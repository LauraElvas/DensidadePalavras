 Some technical elements behind the forecast
 75     FOREWORD
  xi The European and world economy have weakened over the past year. Europe has seen a sharp slowdown 
in external demand and a contraction in manufacturing, which is starting to spill over to other parts of the 
economy. Whil
e the solid performance of the labour market has helped to sustain private consumption 
and domestic demand, GDP growth is unlikely to rebound swiftly. 
 The fact that growth is no longer expected to rebound meaningfully in the next two years is a major shif
t compared to previous forecasts and is based on the assessment that many features of the global slowdown 
will be persistent. Most importantly, the surge in trade tensions and record
-high uncertainty about trade 
policies is likely to have inflicted lasting
 damage to world trade, as corporates have postponed investment 
and may be reconsidering altogether their sourcing arrangements and related global value chains in view 
of weakened multilateral cooperation. As a consequence, demand for investment goods, whi
ch thrives on 
trade integration, has slumped. The current deceleration in the US is largely due to the maturing of the 
cycle. By contrast, held back by population ageing, high debt and the rebalancing away from 
overinvestment, China™s economy is set for a 
structural shift to lower growth. The recent slowdown in 
emerging market economies amid trade tensions, tighter financing conditions and low commodity prices 
also now appears unlikely to be followed by a swift rebound. 
 Adding to domestic economic shocks a
nd policy uncertainty, the slowdown in global demand and weak 
trade has hit the European economy hard, particularly the manufacturing sector in export
-oriented 
Member States. So far, the strength of the labour market and the resilience of the services sect
or have 
prevented the impact from spreading much further, but this resilience cannot endure indefinitely. 
Economic activity now looks set to slow down in a number of Member States, which at first appeared 
immune. As the slowdown spreads, labour markets wil
l lose steam. Wage growth may already have 
stopped increasing, leaving core inflation at persistently low levels. In the meantime, long
-standing 
structural impediments to productivity growth have yet to be resolved. 
 The subdued outlook for growth and infl
ation prompted the European Central Bank to implement another 
round of easing measures in September. At the same time, the ECB and other international organisations 
have called for fiscal and structural policies to be stepped up to create a more supportive
 and efficient 
policy mix. In addition to stabilising an economy faced with the prospect of a sharper and longer 
downturn, improving human and physical capital through increased investment in education and key 
infrastructure could raise productivity growth
. A targeted package of fiscal and structural policies could 
further contribute to the transition to an environmentally and socially sustainable economy. In the absence 
of a euro area budget for stabilisation, a supportive fiscal stance for the euro area a
s a whole requires a 
more coordinated response. Using available fiscal space actively would allow Member States not only to 
provide a fiscal stimulus amid the sharp slowdown in manufacturing that threatens to spill over to the 
labour market, but also to re
fresh and modernise the public capital stock, thereby boosting potential 
growth. Member States with high public debt should enact prudent policies that put their debt credibly on 
a sustainable downward path while prioritising investment and improving the q
uality of taxation and 
expenditure. Very low or negative financing costs provide an opportunity to bring forward projects with a 
high social, environmental and economic return. This window of opportunity should be used now.

 OVERVIEW:
 A CHAL
LENGING ROAD AHEAD
 Weaker trade set to test robustness of labour market
 1 The European economy has entered a protracted period of subdued growth 
and low inflation in the context of high uncertainty, a much less supportive 
external environment, and structural shifts mainly affecti
ng the 
manufacturing sector. Global growth is set to fall this year to a pace usually 
associated with the brink of recession. International trade in goods has been 
stagnant at best, previously
-identified risks of an increase in trade tensions 
and geopoliti
cal conflicts materialised over the summer, and high 
uncertainties related to trade policies and Brexit have not receded. Leading 
indicators suggest that the weakness in global manufacturing will continue in 
the near term. Hence, the EU economy, which slow
ed down in the second 
quarter of 2019, is not likely to rebound in the near term.
 Labour markets in Europe, however,
 have remained strong and the 
unemployment rate has fallen to below its pre
-crisis level, fuelling robust 
wage growth, which has allowed domestic demand to expand at a relatively 
steady pace, in a context of historically low borrowing costs. As on top, som
e Member States have introduced growth
-enhancing fiscal measures and more 
domestically oriented sectors are expected to remain resilient, GDP should 
continue to grow in all Member States. All these factors are however unlikely 
to be strong enough to power 
growth to a higher trajectory than this year.
 The EU economy is 
facing a combination 
of shocks–
          –whose impact is 
cushioned by the 
strength of its labour 
market–

Overview - the autumn 2019 forecast
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  2  Lingering trade policy uncertainty, including on future relations between the 
UK and the rest of the EU, compounded by structural shifts, 
such as changing 
consumer preferences in the car industry and the damage already caused to 
trade integration, are likely to dampen growth and inflation in the euro area 
for a protracted period. Euro area GDP growth is thus forecast to slow from 
1.9% last y
ear to 1.1% this year and to stabilise at 1.2% in the next two years. 
While the growth rate in 2020 will be flattered by a higher number of 
working days, its expected stabilisation in 2021 should be helped by the 
fading negative impact of some shocks. Give
n the expected weakness in the 
second half of this year, which implies a lower starting point into next year, 
the projections for 2019 and 2020 are lower than in the Commission™s spring 
forecast and slightly below the summer interim forecast. 
 Over the summer, the re
-intensification of economic tensions between the US 
and China and elevated policy uncertainty took their toll on global 
investment, manufacturing and trade. 
Consequently, the modest rebound in 
global GDP growth in the first half of 2019 should be short
-lived, and the 
near
-term outlook has turned notably more subdued than expected in the 
spring. However, policy stimuli in a number of major economies, including 
the US and China, as well as resilient labour markets and easy financing 
conditions in advanced economies, should limit the depth of the global 
slowdown. Global GDP growth (excluding the EU) is forecast to decrease 
from 3.8% in 2018 to 3.2% in 2019, marked
ly lower than in previous 
forecasts.
 Over the next two years, elevated uncertainty around US trade policy, worries 
regarding the ability of the WTO to uphold the multilateral trading system 
and geopolitical tensions in 
the Middle East are all set to linger and weigh on 
global growth. As these will be compounded by structural factors such as 
population ageing and low productivity trends, the slowdown in China, 
protectionist tendencies and the impact of climate change, the
 global 
economy (excluding the EU) is set to continue expanding below trend at 
3.3% in 2020 and 3.4% in 2021. The slight increase compared to this year 
mostly reflects the expectation of modestly improving cyclical conditions in 
some distressed emerging ma
rket economies. But the previously expected 
stronger rebound of emerging markets as a whole has been scaled back amid 
trade tensions, tighter financing conditions and low commodity prices, while 
the largely cyclical slowdown in advanced economies (excludin
g the EU) 
should proceed broadly as anticipated. 
 Coinciding with record
-high trade policy uncertainty, global trade growth 
weakened considerably in the first half of 2019 with no signs of a rebound 
yet. Non
-EU world import growt
h is expected to slow down sharply from 
4.1% in 2018 to 0.4% this year before picking up to 2.1% in 2020 and 2.5% 
in 2021. This slight increase is mainly expected to occur as a result of base 
effects linked to the fading impact of the trade uncertainty sho
ck and due to 
the assumption that import elasticities will increase somewhat from their 
extremely low current levels. The weakness of trade has coincided with a 
pronounced, worldwide slowdown in industrial production and investment. 
The increasingly struct
ural nature of the weakness in the manufacturing 
sector and the assumption that trade tensions and uncertainties will remain 
elevated over the forecast horizon, mean that the revival in trade dynamics 
would likely be limited.  
 –but uncertainty and 
structural shifts should 
keep GDP growth 
subdued.
 As global gr
owth is 
hurt by escalating 
economic conflict 
and lingering 
uncertainty...
 –it is expected to 
remain subdued...
 –and less trade
-intensive.
 Overview
  3 In response to concerns about slowing growth and the escalation in trade 
tensions, central banks across the world have recently shifted to more 
accommodative policies. Government bonds have rallied remarkably in 
recent 
months, leading to lower yields around the world. Stock markets have 
been volatile reflecting the ups and downs in the US
-China economic 
confrontation but, overall, equity indices in advanced economies have 
recently hovered near record highs. 
 In Europe, financial markets have shown significant volatility, driven by 
similar factors. Equity markets recovered their substantial summer losses on 
expectations that the ECB would come up 
with a significant policy package, 
and recovered further after the subsequent announcement of the resumption 
of net asset purchases and the strengthening of the ECB™s forward guidance. 
Indices for banks and export
-oriented economies, however, have 
underper
formed. In the bond market, the perception of a deteriorating 
outlook, expectations of a prolonged period of monetary policy 
accommodation and a further decline in the term premium put pressure on 
sovereign yields over the summer. As demand outpaced the su
pply of safe 
assets, a large share of sovereign bonds is trading at negative yields.  
 The euro™s weakness against the US dollar and the Japanese yen over the 
summer has been broadly offset by its app
reciation vis
-à-vis the currencies of 
most other EU countries and some emerging economies. On average, the 
euro™s nominal effective exchange rate is assumed to depreciate by 1% this 
year and to broadly stabilise next year.  
 Net lending to the private sector in the euro area has continued to expand at a 
robust pace in recent months owing to an overall easing of credit standards, 
as well as rising demand for housing loans, which reflects the continued 
buoyancy of housin
g markets. Overall, funding costs for the private and 
public sectors are expected to remain supportive over the forecast horizon. At 
the same time, the real increase in credit volumes to the private sector is set 
to remain modest despite the very low inter
est rates.
 Some of the shocks that have dampened activity in the euro area are expected 
to fade over the forecast horizon, as e.g. world trade is expected to bottom out 
and its drag on the manufacturin
g sector to lessen. However, the slowdown of 
activity is now expected also to affect Central and Eastern European 
economies. For some time, they seemed to be immune, but spillovers via 
cross
-border production chains are bound to take place eventually
.  In the euro area, private consumption growth has held up relatively well so 
far this year. Households™ purchasing power has increased on the back of 
further job creation and real wage growth, as well as supportive
 discretionary 
fiscal measures in some Member States. However, only part of the rise in real 
disposable income has actually been spent. Household decisions to save more 
have probably been driven by higher unemployment expectations and 
uncertainty regarding
 the scope and duration of technological and regulatory 
changes in the car industry, the latter reflected in still subdued car sales. 
Overall, private consumption growth in the euro area is expected to edge 
down this year to 1.1% (from 1.4% in 2018), dampe
ned by a higher increase 
in the saving rate than previously expected. It is forecast to continue growing 
at about the same pace towards 2021, amid a softening of real income growth 
driven by slower employment creation.

tlook have

bonds are traded at

 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  4 The weakness of global trade is set to hit business investment in the euro area 
hard, as a large share of it is linked to trade. Investment growth in the euro 
area (excluding Ireland) is forecast to moderate this year, diminish further 
next year and to rem
ain steady in 2021 as the drag from the external 
environment is fading. This ongoing moderation is not fully reflected in the 
data available for the first half of this year given the large swings related to 
the activities of multinationals in Ireland and t
he support that came from the 
increase in public investment in machinery and equipment in Germany. Still, 
looking beyond this, forward
-looking indicators confirm that non
-construction investment is set to slow down in the near term. Over the next 
two years
, favourable factors such as historically low financing conditions 
and the support from various schemes such as the European Fund for 
Strategic Investments are likely to be offset by the declining rate of capacity 
utilisation, lower profit margins, as well
 as weaker corporate earnings in a 
context of subdued aggregate demand and elevated uncertainty. In the 
construction sector, the pace of further expansion should be limited by still 
elevated skilled labour shortages. 
 Due to its high openness and intense participation in global value chains, but 
also because of the high share of manufacturing in its exports, the euro area 
has been hit particularly hard by the weakness 
in foreign trade and 
heightened uncertainty about trade policies. In the first half of 2019, euro 
area exports of goods failed to grow with both intra
- and extra
-euro area 
exports underperforming. Leading indicators such as export order books 
signal that t
hey are likely to remain sluggish in the near term. Euro area 
export growth is forecast to decrease by about one percentage point this year 
and to edge down further next year, before increasing modestly in 2021. The 
contribution of net exports to euro area
 GDP growth is forecast to be negative 
this year and quasi neutral in 2020 and 2021. The current account surplus of 
the euro area is set to decline from 3.8% of GDP in 2018 to 3.1% in 2021, 
largely mirroring the fall in the merchandise trade surplus.   
 The labour market in the euro area has proved to be surprisingly resilient so 
far to the slowdown in economic growth, showing improvements both in 
terms of the number of persons employed and the number of hours worked 
and allowing a substantial reduction in the unemployment rate. However, as 
changes in the labour market situation usually lag developments in economic 
activity, the potential for further increases in employment has become more 
limited, particularly in the u
nderperforming manufacturing industry where 
labour hoarding has taken place in some countries. Nevertheless, the labour 
market situation is expected to remain relatively favourable, with 
employment set to increase further, though survey indicators point to
 a significantly more moderate pace. Shifts in the sectoral composition of 
employment towards sectors like services with lower productivity increases 
are however likely to make low growth compatible with higher employment 
gains than before. In combination 
with more limited increases in the labour 
force than in previous years, the aggregate euro area unemployment rate is 
expected to fall slightly further from 7.6% this year to 7.3% in 2021. 
 Inflation i
n the euro area has been on a downward trend so far in 2019, 
failing to pick up during the third quarter of this year, largely because of the 
fall in energy prices and the lack of pass
-through from robust wage growth to 
core inflation. In a context of weak
 demand firms have been absorbing these 
increases by accepting lower profit margins rather than by raising prices. In 
line with subdued economic growth and under the assumption of moderately 
declining oil prices as well as subsiding external and industrial
 price 
–while investment is 
more hard hit–
 –and the contribution 
of net exports t
o 
growth  should only 
return to neutral next 
year. 
 Employment gains are 
set to slow down–
 –while inflation is 
expected to remain 
low for longer. 
 Overview
  5 pressures, inflationary pressures should remain muted over the whole forecast 
horizon. HICP inflation in the euro area is projected at 1.2% this year and 
next (0.2 pps. lower than last spring and slightly below the summer interim 
forecast) and to pi
ck up only marginally to 1.3% in 2021. 
 The euro area™s general government deficit is expected to increase gradually, 
rising from the historica
l low of 0.5% of GDP recorded in 2018 to 1.0% in 
2021, based on a no
-policy
-change assumption. The projected fall in the 
revenue ratio is the dominant factor behind this expected increase, as below 
potential economic growth and somewhat loose discretionary
 fiscal policies 
in some Member States affect structural revenues while structural 
expenditures should remain broadly stable as a share of potential GDP. The 
euro area aggregate debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue declining 
steadily over the forecas
t period. Based on a no
-policy
-change assumption, it 
is set to fall to about 84% in 2021. This deleveraging should find support 
from nominal GDP growth remaining higher than the very low implicit 
interest rates paid on outstanding debt. 
 The fiscal stance for the euro area is expected to remain broadly neutral over 
the forecast horizon under a no
-policy
-change assumption. Given the outlook 
for subdued economic growth and inflation as well as recent ECB decisions, 
including renewed monthly 
net asset purchases, upward pressure on nominal 
interest rates should be very limited over the forecast horizon and real short 
and long
-term rates should remain negative. 
 The EU economy is facing a perio
d of very high uncertainty related to trade 
and other economic policies which is expected to last over the forecast years. 
A further increase in uncertainty could lead to a worse outcome than 
envisaged in this forecast. At the same time, substantial downsi
de risks still 
surround the outlook. Outside Europe, any deviation from the assumption 
that the current trade and geopolitical tensions will not escalate further, or 
lower than assumed effectiveness of policy measures to boost global growth 
in general, and
 in China in particular, could deepen the slowdown of the 
global economy and make it more protracted than currently forecast. Within 
Europe, any deviation from the relatively benign technical assumption of 
status quo in terms of trading relations between t
he UK and the EU that 
underlies these forecasts would dampen economic growth, particularly in the 
UK. Another downside risk is that the recession in the manufacturing sector 
could have a bigger spillover effect on the services sector, affecting 
confidence,
 net job creation, domestic demand, growth expectations and 
ultimately resulting in worse growth outcomes.
 On the upside, trade tensions could be resolved faster than assumed, the 
response to easing measures in China could positively surprise and 
geopoliti
cal tensions could diminish. In in the euro area, the fiscal policy 
stance could turn out more expansionary than currently envisaged
.  The euro area's 
headline deficit is set 
to increase slightly but 
public debt ratios 
should continue to 
improve– 
 –amid a broadly 
ne
utral aggregate 
fiscal stance.
 Risks to economic 
growth are tilted to 
the downside
 PART I
 Economic outlook for the euro area
 and the EU
   1. KEY FEATURES
   9 1.1. THE MAIN ISSUES
 OF THE FORECAST
 The European economy has weathered external 
headwinds relatively well so far; economic growth 
has continued and the labour market has 
remained 
robust. However, many recent news and data 
releases have been unfavourable for the EU 
economy. This included not only evidence of a 
weaker momentum in global activity and trade but 
also of a more moderate economic expansion in 
Europe. This is indi
cating that the outlook has 
deteriorated since the Commission™s spring and 
summer forecasts and that it is now quite clear that 
Europe will be facing a challenging road ahead.
 (1) The key issue for the forecast in autumn 2019 is 
whether the slowing of econ
omic growth will 
continue or whether it can be stopped and/or even 
reversed. The EU and the euro area are at a 
crossroads where the main directions are either 
further weakening with the possibility of entering a 
recession, a muddling through with a protrac
ted 
period of low growth and low inflation (ﬁL
-shapeﬂ), or a rebound in economic activity with a 
more or less quick return to higher growth rates 
(ﬁV
-shapeﬂ or ﬁU
-shapeﬂ). The answer to this 
question depends on recent developments and the 
confluence of fac
tors that are driving economic 
developments and the outlook.
 The central scenario of the autumn 2019 forecast is 
that it has become less likely that the euro area will 
manage to return in the near term to higher growth 
rates and to sustain them. The previo
usly identified 
factors of resilience against falling into recession 
continue to hold up, but many factors dampening 
growth are expected to be persistent. Therefore the 
road ahead looks set to be one of fairly stable but 
low growth rates (Graph 
I.1.1
), which is a major 
shift compared to previous forecasts. 
 In line with subdued economic growth and under 
the assumption of moderately declining oil prices, 
inflationary pressur
es should remain constrained. 
Accordingly, HICP inflation in the euro area is 
expected to remain generally muted over the 
forecast horizon (Graph 
I.1.2
). The main reasons 
                                                           (1) European Commission (DG ECFIN) (2019

 behind 
this central scenario are explained in the 
remainder of this chapter. A more detailed look at 
specific elements of the forecast is presented in the 
following chapter. 
        1.2. RECENT DEVELOPM
ENTS
 Economic growth in the euro area lost momentum 
in the first half of the year. By the second quarter, 
growth had fallen well below its average in recent 
years. Against the background of an escalation in 
trade tensions
, a near stagnation in international 
trade, and slowing global growth, the external 
environment has become less supportive than in 
recent years. Moreover, tariff threats, rising 
geopolitical tensions, the unknown features of 
Brexit, the persisting weakness

  10 and several structural factors have conspired to 
ensure a prolonged period of high uncertainty that 
is keeping a lid on economic growth. 
 Diminishing expectations for a near
-term 
rebound
 During the summer months trade tensions 
escalated, global uncertainty increased and 
concerns about geopolitical conflicts rose. The 
contribution to growth from the external 
environment has been declining since last year 
after an exceptionally strong 2017, 
when the euro 
area was buoyed by the strength of the global 
economy and the pace of global trade growth. 
Meanwhile, the weakness of the global 
manufacturing sectors (Graph 
I.1.3
, second panel) 
acted as a drag on global investment and foreign 
trade, which declined in the first half of the year 
(third panel). Weak global growth momentum 
(first panel) and elevated glob
al economic 
uncertainty added to the negative news for the euro 
area economy. 
    In Europe, the weak economic growth in the 
second quarter was in line with th
e expectations of 
the summer forecast, with quarter
-on-quarter 
growth falling back to 0.2% in both the EU and the 
euro area. As expected, the first quarter had 
benefitted from exceptional factors (e.g. 
stockpiling in the UK, relatively mild weather 
support
ing construction, and a rebound in car sales 
after the standstill in the last quarter of 2018), 
which faded in the second quarter. Nevertheless, 
private consumption held up well and continued 
with government consumption to make positive 
contributions to ec
onomic growth (Graph 
I.1.4
).      The s
ustained expansion of private consumption 
was supported by further improvement in the 
labour market (Graph 
I.1.5
). While employment 
continued to grow, the unemployment rate 
declined further and fell close to pre
-crisis levels. 
Meanwhile slack in t
he labour market, as measured 
by the rate of underemployed in the active 
population, diminished further.
    Moreover, on the basis of past wage settlements, 
labour incom
es rose further and labour cost 
pressures strengthened, leading to higher unit 
labour costs. However, the pass
-through to core 
inflation remained incomplete as firms did not 
immediately adjust their prices and core inflation 
remained rather muted (Graph 
I.1.6
). (2) The 
limited increase in core inflation was beneficial for 
household purchasing power and thereby 
                                                           (2) This observation is consistent with the finding that the 
wage
-price link is strong but time
-varying, depending on 
the state of the economy and the type of shocks hitting the 
economy, as for instance shown for the largest euro area 
economies by E. B
obeica, 
M. 
Ciccarelli
 and I. 
Vansteenkiste

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  11 con
tributed to sustained private consumption 
growth.
      A slightly different picture emerged for gross fixed 
capital formation (investment). In the second 
quarter, investment increased sharply in the euro 
area, but this mainly reflected exceptional 
developments in Ireland, where investment jumped 
182% (q
-o-q) on the back of intellectual property 
accounting by multinationals. In the rest of the 
euro area, inv
estment expanded moderately (Graph 
I.1.7
, first panel). As a large share of investment is 
linked
 to trade, the weakness of global trade was a 
blow to the euro area, which added to the negative 
impact of increased economic policy uncertainty.
    Incoming data from the third quarter did not 
brighten the picture. In the euro area this included 
relatively weak sectoral data, with industrial 
production markedly lower and construction 
weakening somewhat, and retail trade softening 
but remaining in expa
nsion territory (Graph 
I.1.8
).      All these 
developments have further diminished 
expectations of future economic activity. This is 
evident from declines in the key survey indicators 
(e.g. the Economic Sentiment Indicator, the 
Purchasing Managers™ Indices, and national 
indicators), but also in anothe
r round of downward 
revisions in macroeconomic forecasts. A similar 
series of downward revisions had already been 
observed in the spring.
 With an eye on these developments, central banks 
saw fit to depart from their planned paths of policy 
normalisation. I
n the US, the Fed cut interest rates 
in July and September, while in the euro area the 
European Central Bank (ECB) in September took 
measures to stimulate the economy with the aim of 
raising inflation towards its target, after recent 
months had pointed to 
further declines in the 
headline inflation rate. Globally, central banks 
have shifted to more accommodative policies 
citing slowing growth and the escalation of US
-China trade tensions, as well as the deterioration in 
the economic outlook and, in the case 
of the ECB, 
the generally muted outlook for inflation.
 (3) The perception of a deteriorating outlook, 
expectations of a prolonged period of very 
accommodative monetary policy, and a further 
decline in the term premium put pressure on 
sovereign yields, as demand for safe assets 
outpaced supply (Graph 
I.1.9
). After the sharp fall 
in yields in recent months a substantial part of 
sovereign bonds in Europe is tr
ading at negative 
yields. In the US, declines at the long end have put 
the yield curve into a shape that is usually 
associated with recessions, although there are 
                                                           (3) The IMF estimates that about 70% of the world™s 
economies, weighted by GDP, have adopted a more 
accommodative monetary stance; see IMF (2019). ‚

  12 strong arguments explaining why this may be one 
of the indicators in the business cycle toolk
it where 
traditional relationships may not hold at the current 
juncture.
    More generally, the traditional triggers of 
recessions, such as in
flationary pressures that 
cause central banks to hike interest rates or the 
bursting of bubbles in financial markets, appear 
irrelevant at the current juncture. But on the other 
hand, new triggers seem to have come to the fore 
that could pull the global an
d/or the EU economy 
into contraction. These include the continuing 
weakness in manufacturing, but also a wider range 
of factors weighing on economic growth.
 1.3. KEY FACTORS BEH
IND THE FORECAST
 Economic growth in the EU is being dampened by 
the high level 
of uncertainty linked to trade 
tensions and by structural factors, some of which 
are temporary while others are more permanent. In 
the US, cyclical factors (supplemented by trade 
policy uncertainty) appear more relevant. In order 
to assess the factors that
 are weighing on economic 
growth, one has to distinguish between factors 
reflecting long
-term developments (e.g. a trend 
decline in productivity, ageing); supply shocks 
(e.g. US
-China trade tensions, Brexit, and 
temporary oil supply constraints); cyclical 
features 
(e.g. the economic cycle in the US, Asian tech 
cycle); structural shifts (e.g. car demand going 
‚greener™, transition in China); policy effects (e.g. 
fading fiscal stimulus in the US); but also elevated 
uncertainty (e.g. related to trade policy, B
rexit, and 
geopolitical issues). 
 Disentangling these elements is challenging 
because they are interrelated (Graph 
I.1.10
), but 
looking at them in detail is vital to understand the 
nature of the slowdown, which has implications for 
the outlook and the effectiveness of monetary, 
fiscal and other policy measures.
     Slowing economic growth in Europe™s external 
environment– 
 An obvious downside factor for Europe is the 
global slowdown that set in last year and which 
lowered economic growth outside Europe to the 
low
est rates since the Great Recession. In the short 
term, this slowdown implies weaker demand for 
euro area exports and dampens economic growth 
(see Section I.2.1). It relates to cyclical factors, 
such as the slowdown in the US economy after a 
very long peri
od of expansion, or diminishing 
demand in the context of the Asian tech cycle. But 
it also relates to factors such a trade barriers, the 
elevated level of uncertainty, country
-specific 
growth impediments in several emerging market 
economies, and more struc
tural changes in the 
global economy, such as those induced by 
technological change in the car sector.
 These factors are behind the downward revisions 
to global output and trade growth that the 
Commission and other international institutions 
have made since
 mid
-2018, lowering forecasts to a 
level that is usually considered to signal the brink 
of a global recession.
 ...partly reflects trade tensions and the 
confrontation between the US and China–
 Trade barriers have become an increasingly 
important downside f
actor to economic growth. 
For decades, trade liberalisation and the build
-up 
of cross
-border production patterns had been a 
source of economic growth. This has changed with

Factors impacting on economic growth

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  13 the introduction of more inward
-oriented trade 
policies, mainly with the sequence o
f policy 
measures introduced by the US and, in retaliation, 
by China in the last two years.
 Since the spring, trade tensions between the US 
and China have further escalated (Graph 
I.1.11
), 
including the mutual introduction and threat of 
new and/or higher tariff rates on imports. In 
August, the US announced plans to apply tariffs on 
all goods importe
d from China, which then 
announced countermeasures. Both sides went 
beyond simply raising and/or implementing tariffs, 
and included actions such as labelling certain 
companies as threats to national security, calls for 
firms to leave the other country, and
 instructions to 
companies to refrain from buying from the other 
country.
    As the economic confrontation between the US 
and China goes beyon
d current trade tensions
 (4) and increasingly takes a systemic and strategic 
nature, the spillovers to other countries are 
becoming more important. Partial delays of tariff 
increases and news about the resumption of trade 
talks and about imminent trade ‚deals™ between the 
US and Chin
a raised hopes, temporarily, that such 
growth impediments would eventually be 
removed. But trade tensions have since spread 
further to other regions (e.g. US vs Turkey, US vs. 
EU, US vs. Vietnam, US vs. Mexico, US vs. India, 
Korea vs Japan).
 All these meas
ures have created obstacles to global 
trade growth and have affected all countries that 
                                                           (4) For a revie

 are highly integrated in global value chains and 
trade, including those in Europe (see Section 
I.3.1). The size of the negative impact depends on 
specific elements of t
he exposure, for instance on 
the share of domestic value added created by gross 
exports, the importance of car exports, as well as 
on the size of trading links with the heavily 
affected Chinese economy. A closer look at these 
features in the EU Member Stat
es points to 
substantial differences (Table 
I.1.1
), which could 
also explain why some countries have already been
 more affected than others. Germany scores highly 
in several of these criteria. Among the five largest 
euro area Member States it has the second highest 
value added created by its gross exports (as a 
percentage of GDP), the highest value added 
created by t
he export of motor vehicles, and the 
strongest engagement in trade with China. In 
several of the Central and Eastern European 
Member States their value added created by car 
exports stands out, creating specific vulnerabilities.
        –which have raised economic and trade 
uncertainty, dampening global growth.
 The trade policy measures taken raise costs and 
increase trade
-related uncertainty about future 
costs (tariffs) and the viability of global supply 
chains (see Section I.3.1). Trade policy uncertainty 
has further increased since the summer (Graph

  14     In the very short term, the predominant channel of 
impact seems to have be
en associated with this 
unprecedented uncertainty shock (about the extent, 
duration and scope of trade and broader economic 
tensions), contributing to weakening investment, 
manufacturing activity and global trade flows. 
Quantifying the impact of trade tens
ions on global 
growth is a challenging task, but recent empirical 
estimates of the impact pointed to losses of world 
output growth of at least about half a percentage 
point this year and next.
 (5)  Beyond the negative short
-term growth impact, 
elevated unc
ertainty also affects the medium term. 
As tariffs and other restrictive economic measures 
take effect, the supply shock is set to trigger 
adjustments in the trade and investment decisions 
of firms, and ultimately imply a less efficient 
global allocation of
 resources. 
(6) The impacts will 
reverberate far beyond the US and China, as other 
economies will be affected by the associated 
rolling
-back of trade integration and the prospect 
of the global economy becoming increasingly 
fragmented (see Section I.3.1). A
s a result,

 medium and long
-term global growth expectations 
are also being revised downwards.
 The weakness of the manufacturing sector is 
widespread across the global economy–
 A key feature behind the global economic 
downturn has been the slump in manufact
uring, 
which has been driven by trade tensions, trade 
policy uncertainties and the associated slump in 
global capital spending. In addition, more cyclical 
factors have been at work since the boom in 2017, 
such as the cyclical downturn in the Asian 
semicond
uctor industry. 
 Globally, the weakness in the manufacturing sector 
has started to spill over to services, as a closer look 
at non
-euro area PMIs indicates (Graph 
I.1.13
). 
But while the index for manufacturing has 
temporarily fallen into contractionary territory, the 
services index continues to signal expansion. What 
both sectors have in common is the weakness of 
new export orde
rs, which highlights the correlation 
between weak trade momentum and the slump in 
manufacturing.
      The declines observed in the services sector raise 
the question as t
o whether other sectors can remain 
resilient to the manufacturing sector™s troubles, a 
question that has already received particular 
attention in the euro area.
 –but has so far had only a limited impact on 
other sectors in the euro area–
 While the euro are
a™s more externally oriented 
manufacturing sector has been contracting for 
some time, its other more domestically oriented 
sectors have continued to expand, as can be seen in

  15 (Graph 
I.1.14
). (7) This ‚divergence™, i.e. the 
resilience of other sectors, has so far mitigated the 
impact on economic growth of the recession in the 
manufacturing sector. More generally, in recent 
months, domestic indicators, such as consumer 
confidence and private consum
ption have 
continued performing far better than indicators 
linked to industrial activity (industrial production, 
manufacturing confidence). This ‚divergence™ is 
one of the reasons for expecting the economy to 
escape from falling into recession.
 (8)         Looking forward, survey data like the confidence 
indicators in the Commission™s Business and 
Consumer Surveys and the PMIs for the 
manufacturing and the services sectors suggest a 
continuation of the divergence in the near future, 
but, at the same time, po
int to a certain co
-movement towards lower levels (Graph 
I.1.15
). 
While the Manufacturing PMI in the euro area had 
entered co
ntraction territory earlier in the year, the 
services sector remained in expansion territory. 
The Commission™s industrial confidence indicator 
has been below its long
-term average since June, 
whereas confidence in the services sector has only 
been below av
erage since August. These 
developments might point to limits to the 
divergence.
                                                            (7) Even the subsector of business services (e.g. 
transportation), which
 had shared the decline in 
manufacturing during the Great Recession but had 
remained almost unaffected during the 2011
-2012 
downturn of manufacturing, continued to expand
; see 
Forsells, M., Kennedy, N. and L. M. Timm (2019). 
‚Developments in the services s
ector and its relationship 
with manufacturing™. 
ECB Economic Bulletin
 7 (forthc.).
 (8) A similar ‚divergence™ has been observed in the US 
economy between the first quarter of 2015 and the second 
quarter of 2016 when manufacturing output fell for six 
consec
utive quarters (q
-o-q, CPB data) by a total of about 
4½%  but other sectors remained strong enough to keep the 
US economy on its expansion path.
      An idea of how long the current divergence 
between the manufacturing sector and other parts 
of th
e economy could last can be derived from 
looking at past manufacturing recessions in 
Germany. Since 1995, Europe™s biggest 
manufacturer has experienced seven 
manufacturing recessions, with five lasting for at 
least four quarters and three of them lowering 
manufacturing output (gross value added) by more 
than 5%. On all these occasions, with the 
exception of the Great Recession, the non
-manufacturing sectors experienced only brief 
periods of contraction. This gives reason to think 
that any eventual spillover
 to the rest of the 
economy from a recession in the manufacturing 
sector may be relatively brief and limited.
 –and some differences among countries.
 The ‚two
-speed™ economy (manufacturing versus 
other sectors) also has implications for the relative 
perform
ance of Member States. Those with a high 
share of manufacturing value added and a high 
exposure to exports of industrial goods have been 
more severely affected than other economies. 
Accordingly, the largest impact on gross value 
added in the manufacturing 
sector was seen in 
Germany, whereas gross value added in the other 
large Member States remained fairly stable (Graph 
I.1.16
). By contrast, the expansion of 
manufacturing continued in several smaller 
Member States in Central and Eastern Europe, as 
expected in previous analyses.

  16       Understanding whether this divergence between 
countries can be expected to hold is vital to the 
forecast. One argument in favour is the growth 
support from the EU™s structural funds in several 
Mem
ber States,
 (10) which should continue 
impacting positively on their manufacturing 
sectors. Another argument concerns spillovers 
from the already heavily affected countries to other 
Member States. In that respect, historical evidence 
for manufacturing reces
sions in Germany provides 
some hope (Graph 
I.1.17
). On the 
one hand, in 
most of the past recession periods in Germany, 
manufacturing output in the rest of the euro area 
was only briefly dipping into negative territory

         While these observations cover the time until mid
-2019, a forward
-looking analysis suggests that the 
manufacturing slump has started to be felt in most 
Member States. With respect to the near term, the 
co-movement of the Commission™s industrial 
confidence 
indicator in Germany and the Central 
and Eastern European Member States suggests 
convergence across both regions (Graph 
I.1.18
).       This year™s downward revisions by professional 
forecasters also point to the expect
ation of a 
relatively close co
-movement of manufacturing 
sectors across many EU Member States. 
According to the survey conducted by Consensus 
Economics, since the beginning of the year, 
expectations for industrial production growth in 
2019 and 2020 have be
en lowered. Apart from a 
few outliers (e.g. Poland and Hungary), forecasters 
have become more pessimistic for most countries

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  17       Among the reasons for co
-movements are common 
factors and spillovers from the most heavily
 affected countries, partly reflecting cross
-border 
production chains. Among the common factors are 
the global manufacturing slump, but also 
developments specific to sub
-sectors such as the 
car industry. However, it is difficult to quantify to 
what extent 
the manufacturing weakness is 
attributable to non
-European (e.g. trade barriers, 
slowing demand from China) and to European 
factors. The role of external factors is visible in the 
relatively sharp decline of the manufacture of 
investment goods compared to 
the more resilient 
production of consumer goods (Graph 
I.1.20
), 
where only the interruption o
f car production in the 
fourth quarter of last year caused a temporary 
decline.
        Apart from trade tensions, the car industry is 
the other main 
factor behind manufacturing 
weakness.
 Trade policies are not the only cause of the car 
industry™s current problems; manufacturers also 
face a number of regulatory and structural issues. 
Car producers in Europe have had to adapt to new 
regulatory standards 
(e.g. the Worldwide 
Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure 
(WLTP)), and are facing changing consumer 
preferences, including a shift in preferences from 
combustion engines to electric vehicles. At the 
same time, ride
-sharing apps may be decreasing 
the app
eal of car ownership and turning 
transportation into an on
-demand service. In 
parallel, some legacy issues (‚Dieselgate™ in 
Germany caused by the falsification of emissions 
data in 2015, has restricted the usability of some 
Diesel cars in inner
-city areas)
 and the 
development of autonomous vehicles need to be 
coped with and uncertainty about future 
technologies might delay car purchases by 
European consumers. These factors have pushed 
car production in Europe onto a downward trend 
(Graph 
I.1.21
). 
        Moreover, the trade tensions between the US and 
China are also affecting European carmakers with 
cross
-border production chains, such as German 
car companies which produce cars in the US for 
sale in China. In addition to the higher tariffs 
applied to some 
of their products, car demand in 
important export markets is also declining. In 
connection with the threat of US tariffs on the 
import of cars and car parts, this could be 
described as a ‚perfect storm™ for European car 
producers. Due to cross
-border produ
ction, the 
impacts would be felt well beyond Germany. 
 The labour market implications of the weakness in 
the manufacturing sector have been rather limited 
so far. While headcounts continued to increase in 
euro area manufacturing, some downward

  18 of hours, mainly in car production and particularly 
in the German car production (Graph 
I.1.22
).       Structural shifts on the domestic side are working 
in the same direction as the external supply shocks. 
For example, an increasing replace
ment of fuel
-driven cars requires substantial changes in car 
production. Such changes, like the shift towards 
electric cars, come with substantial adjustment 
costs in terms of output and growth. 
 Underlying trends help explain the persistence 
of low growth
 and low inflation–
 The negative cyclical and structural factors 
discussed above come on top of a medium to long
-term slowing of trend growth. A weakening of 
productivity growth in advanced economies was 
already evident before the Great Recession in 
2008-2009, and many are now entering the phase 
where demographic ageing will be felt more 
strongly. GDP now exceeds pre
-crisis levels in 
most Member States, but the average annual 
growth rate recorded in the decade since the Great 
Recession has been much lower t
han what was in 
the decade before. Persistently low growth and 
inflation amid very low interest rates have 
implications for potential output and equilibrium 
real interest rates (natural rate).
 In the euro area, there are clear indications that the 
equilibr
ium interest rate, i.e., the rate that prevails 
if output equals potential output and the inflation 
rate equals the inflation target, has declined. 
Indeed, while this rate fluctuates over time, partly 
mirroring fluctuations in productivity growth, 
estimate
s point to a declining trend.
 (11) Both a 
                                                           (11) For estimates 
see e.g. 
Jordà, O. and A. M. Taylor (2019). 
‚Riders on the storm™. Paper presented at the Economic 
lower (real) natural rate and low inflation 
(expectations) decrease the policy interest rate that 
is needed for effective monetary policy and imply 
that monetary policy finds itself more often at an 
effective lower 
bound on policy interest rates and 
is thereby less effective at raising economic 
growth on its own. In this context, other policy 
options have been presented, in particular fiscal 
policy options 
(12) and in particular by those who 
interpret persistently low
 yields and low inflation 
as symptoms of insufficient aggregate demand.
 In the euro area, the subdued pace of growth since 
the Great Recession has largely been seen as a 
legacy of the crisis (hysteresis effects), whereas 
empirical analysis has not been abl
e to provide 
strong evidence in favour of the secular stagnation 
hypothesis.
 (13) However, some observers are 
warning that the current set
-up in the euro area 
may be comparable to the situation in Japan at the 
beginning of its multi
-decade period of low gro
wth 
and low inflation. Among the similarities with 
Japan after the late 1980s are: very low inflation 
despite very low interest rates, low productivity 
and potential growth, a large and persistent current 
account surplus, ample liquidity and hints that low
 financing costs depress productivity by keeping 
‚zombie firms™ in the market. However, there are 
also striking differences: banking sector reform has 
made progress, and current problems do not stem 
so much from bad assets as from banks™ low 
profitability;
 deleveraging in the non
-financial 
private sector has also run its course; there is (so 
far) less demographic drag. 
 –and matter for the assessment of policy 
effects at the current juncture.
 Since the crisis, monetary policy in the euro area 
has been very 
effective in mitigating the negative 
impact of the crisis on demand, and in contributing 
to economic growth and job creation.

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  19 some of the current negative supply shocks from 
trade and structural technological change are 
impacting negatively on
 potential growth and can 
thus not be permanently reversed through 
monetary policy alone. However, the policy mix in 
the euro area continues to rely predominantly on 
monetary policy (see Section I.2.8). This 
dominance has stimulated calls for a more 
suppor
tive role of fiscal policy in countries with 
fiscal space and for a more growth
-friendly 
composition of public finances,
 (15) in particular 
against the background of negative sovereign bond 
yields. 
(16)  1.4. THE MAIN RESULT
S OF THE FORECAST 
 The key questio
n for the euro area outlook is 
whether the slowing of economic growth will 
intensify and possibly trigger a recession.
 Not all slowdowns lead to recessions...
 The longer the period of low growth lasts and the 
more regions and countries are affected, the hi
gher 
the risk of slipping into recession. On the one 
hand, the situation could get worse the longer 
economic activity slows. For example, order books 
could decline to critical levels and employment 
levels could become unsustainable in companies 
that had in
itially switched to shorter working hours 
and ‚labour hoarding™. On the other hand, as time 
goes on, initial shocks could fade and result in a 
bottoming out of economic activity. For example, 
a negative supply shock caused by regulatory 
changes could fade 
away, external developments 
that were a drag on growth could stabilise, and the 
lagged impact of supportive monetary and fiscal 
policy measures could kick in.
 While predicting recessions has always been a 
difficult task,
 (17) some information can be gathere
d in historical episodes. At the current juncture, such 
an approach leads to the question of whether 
                                                                                   Guilhem,

 (17) Analyses of forecast accuracy show that economists are 
particularly good at missing recessions and that they, once 
a recession has started, often ﬁmiss the magnitude of the 
recession by a wide margin until the year is almost over

 protracted periods of slowing economic growth 
have usually led to recession. Some comfort can be 
derived from the observation that the euro area has 
never 
fallen into recession after a period of five 
consecutive quarters of declining GDP growth (4 
quarters
-on-4 quarters), as currently registered 
(Graph 
I.1.23
). Either the shocks hitting the 
economy were so strong that economic activity 
was pushed down strongly or enough time had 
elapsed so that the impact of shocks started 
fading.
 (18)           ...but periods of generally muted growth can 
last for longer. 
 In the euro area, some of the shocks that have 
dampened growth can be expected to fade over 
time. This includes
 for example the negative 
impact of some of the shocks that had hit the car 
industry in Europe (e.g. the introduction of new 
regulatory standards in 2018), and the fading drag 
from the external environment, where subpar 
developments are expected to persist
 but without 
further declines in growth rates. Moreover, the 
longer the trade uncertainty lasts, the more 
companies can be expected to get used to it and to 
adapt to the new trade environment, which should 
come along with abating trade policy uncertainty. 
 On the domestic side, the very low financing costs 
for corporate investment and construction should 
be positive for growth momentum, as should 
expansionary fiscal policy measures in some 
countries.

  20 However, there is a complex mix of factors. Some 
shocks s
hould diminish over time (e.g. demand 
shocks that disappear in the long term), while 
others represent more permanent structural shifts. 
The latter are expected to limit growth momentum 
over the whole forecast horizon and suggest that 
the economy will not r
eturn to a previously 
observed level of trend potential growth. The 
length or the size of the expansion in the euro area 
is therefore of very limited value for describing 
economic patterns over the forecast horizon. 
(19) Domestic factors are still set to 
support 
economic growth in the euro area...
 Although a substantial part of the manufacturing 
weakness is of domestic origin,
 (20) the factors seen 
as supporting the continuation of the economic 
expansion are also mainly found on the domestic 
side. At the cu
rrent juncture, three elements are 
seen as an insurance for the euro area against 
falling into recession.
 First, the labour market situation is expected to 
remain solid with further but more moderate 
increases in employment, in spite of the low pace 
of out
put growth. In combination with the ongoing 
growth of the labour force this should slightly 
lower the aggregate euro area unemployment rate 
in 2020 and 2021. This raises the question of 
whether the expected relationship between 
economic activity and the la
bour market is 
consistent with traditional views, such as the one 
the Okun law stipulates for cyclical unemployment 
                                                           (19) In the recent discussion about the length of the US 
expansion, Friedman™s ﬁpluckingﬂ has featured 
prominently. Dupraz, Nakamura, and Steinsson looked at 
ﬁpluckingﬂ where t
he economy is operating along a ceiling 
of maximum feasible output most of the time over the 
business cycle; sometimes it is ﬁplucked downﬂ by a 
contraction that could be due to supply or demand shocks 
so that the ﬁpluckﬂ predicts the size of the subsequen
t expansion, but the size of the expansion does not 
necessarily predict the subsequent recession. See Dupraz, 
S., Nakamura, E. and J. Steinsson (2019). ‚A plucking 
model of business cycles™. Unpublished manuscript, April;

 (20) An ECB analysis
 found that ﬁ
between July 2018 and June 
2019 the global trade factor and all factors associated with 
developments in China, the United Kingdom and Unit
ed 
States explained 37% of the fall in euro area industrial 
production growth, while domestic factors contributed 
63%, although part of this effect may reflect temporary 
factors linked to the car industry in the second half of 
2018

 and the output gap,
 (21) or whether there is a 
divergence between economic activity and 
employment. If subdued growth were caused 
entirely by
 a demand shock, the Okun law would 
suggest an increase in unemployment, but in the 
current situation, negative supply shocks and 
structural shifts add to the picture and also 
negatively affect potential output. This alters the 
level of unemployment for a 
given rate of growth. 
 Shifts in the sectoral composition of the economy 
towards sectors with more moderate labour 
productivity growth may also make low growth 
compatible with higher employment gains than 
before. Moreover, after several years of tightening
 labour markets, employment patterns have become 
more robust, for example with a less intensive use 
of temporary workers and labour hoarding in some 
countries. To some extent, this is expected to limit 
headcount reductions in underperforming sectors 
such a
s manufacturing, but it does not exclude 
adjustment as indicated by the recruitment plans, 
signalled by survey indicators such as falling 
employment expectations in the euro area. 
    With the pass
-through of higher wage costs to 
prices becoming more difficult for firms due to 
slowing demand growth, muted inflation supports 
the translation of nominal disposable income gains 
into higher household purchasing powe
r and 
sustained private consumption growth (Graph 
I.1.24
).                                                            (21) Empirical estimates of the Okun coefficient in the euro 
arera stand close to 
-0.3% with a lot of differences across
 Member States; see e.g. Ball, L., Leigh, D., and P. 
Loungani, P. (2017).

  21 Second, the resilience of the non
-manufacturing 
part of the economy (mainly services) is expected 
to waver towards the end of the forecast, but to 
retain enough strength to ensure that private 
domestic demand remains strong enough to make a 
significant contribution to economic growth 
(Graph 
I.1.25
). This mainly applies to private 
consumption, but also, to a lesser extent, to 
investment. 
           Third, the construction sector is set to remain 
growth supportive in the euro area. Improvements 
in the labour market and the prolonged period of 
historically low borrowing costs are good news for 
the afford
ability of house purchases for 
households, which also raises the demand for 
construction output. The large number of public 
infrastructure projects and several support schemes 
(e.g. European Fund for Strategic Investments, and 
InvestEU) are also expected t
o exert a positive 
impact on the construction sector in the forecast 
years, which should help limit the expected 
slowing of construction investment.
 –whereas the external environment is set to 
remain a drag, though gradually diminishing 
over time.
 External
 developments in early 2020 are still likely 
to be weak, but by then, after almost a year of 
weakness, some base effects may come into play. 
For example, the decline in car sales is expected to 
come to an end, which should help foreign trade. 
Moreover, the
 monetary easing in several countries 
is expected to support an upturn in demand. 
However, the decoupling of global economic 
activity and trade, i.e. the decline in the trade 
elasticity, 
(22) is expected to limit potential relief 
from the trade side. 
         The global outlook is contingent on the assumption 
that all the trade policy measures implemented so 
far remain in place until the end of the 
forecast 
period and that the measures that have already 
been credibly announced will be implemented. 
This implies that the US will refrain from 
imposing tariffs on the imports of cars and car 
parts from Europe and elsewhere. It also implies 
that trade agre
ements that have been agreed upon 
(United States
-Mexico
-Canada Agreement, EU
-Mercosur Trade Agreement) will be ratified and 
implemented as foreseen. As in previous forecasts, 
the autumn forecast is based on a purely technical 
assumption of status quo in te
rms of trading 
relations between the UK and the EU over the

 In view of these developments in the euro area™s

  22 tensions and near
-stagnant foreign trade growth are 
the main determinants.
 The aggregate euro a
rea growth figure is expected 
to hide two types of two
-speed developments. On 
the one hand, manufacturing is set to remain the 
weak spot, while other sectors, including services 
and construction, should maintain some resilience. 
On the other hand, countrie
s such as Germany are 
set to continue suffering more from weakness in 
global growth. A weak second half of the year can 
also be seen as a challenge to the strength of labour 
markets, but the momentum is expected to be 
sufficient to maintain some employment
 growth 
and to keep unemployment rates at historically low 
levels. Overall, the bleaker outlook for the second 
half of the year implies that growth momentum in 
2019 will be slightly weaker than previously 
expected.
 –but also in 2020 and 2021.
 The lower for
ecast for growth in the second half of 
2019 implies a low carry
-over to 2020. But despite 
the expectation of almost unchanged growth 
dynamics, this does not show up in a lower annual 
growth forecast, because substantial calendar 
effects kick in next year (
Table 
I.1.2
).        The 
higher number of working days in Germany 
and some other countries is set to create 
exceptionally strong positive calendar effects 
amounting to 0.2 pps. in 2020. Accordingly, the 
calendar
-adjusted forecasts for 2020 must be lower 
than the (non
-adjusted) for
ecast published by the 
Commission.
 (23) Disregarding both the carry
-over 
                                                           (23) The ECB and the OECD publish forecasts for calendar
-adjusted real GDP growth.
 and the calendar effects leads to a within the year 
growth rate that is over the entire forecast period 
unchanged compared to 2018.
 In 2021, fading negative shocks should 
compensate for the absence of positive calendar 
effects and keep the pace of growth again almost 
unchanged. As structural shifts take time, the 
effect of relocated trade (re
-shoring or new set
-up 
of cross
-border value
 chains) should mainly kick
-in in 2021 and in subsequent years. Overall, the 
negative impact from external trade is expected to 
remain in place in 2021, which keeps 
responsibility for growth for domestic factors 
(Graph 
I.1.27
).       During the forecast years, the part
ial relocation of 
elements of global value chains could support 
foreign trade, which is expected to return to a more 
solid though lower growth trajectory. This partially 
reflects slowing growth in China and the planned 
change in the composition of Chinese 
growth with 
a stronger focus on domestic components.
 All in all, the autumn forecast sees reasons why a 
further downturn could be avoided, but it also 
emphasises that it now looks less likely that 
growth rates will rebound to a level strong enough 
to lift 
the outlook for potential growth to the kind 
of trajectory that had been expected in the 
Commission™s spring and summer forecasts. With 
expected economic growth in the euro area at 1.1% 
in 2019, and 1.2% in 2020 and 2021 (Graph 
I.1.1
), 
the central scenario of the autumn forecast 
includes fairly stable but low growth rates. 
Accordingly, inflationary pressures are set to be 
more moderate than expected in spring, lowering 
the
 inflation forecast for 2019 and 2020 to 1.2%, 
followed by slight uptick to 1.3% in 2021 (Graph

y-o-y %Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  23 Elevated uncertainty and substantial downside 
risks surround the central s
cenario...
 In autumn 2019, the EU economy is going through 
a period of very high uncertainty, which is related 
to trade policy and other economic policies. A 
further increase in trade policy uncertainty, and 
concerns that new tariffs might be applied on a 
much wider range of items, could adversely affect 
business investment plans and lead to a worse 
outcome.
 Although the EU economy is already affected by 
an increased number of external headwinds, there 
is a meaningful number of substantial risks that 
have n
ot yet materialised but darken the economic 
outlook or could even derail the continuation of the 
economic expansion in the EU. Many of these 
risks are related to developments that could 
materialise outside the EU such as a further 
escalation of US
-China tr
ade tensions; higher or 
additional US tariffs on car imports; a sharper
-than
-currently
-forecast slowdown in China; 
geopolitical tensions (e.g. in the Middle East) 
which could push oil prices significantly higher; or 
events related to climate change that da
mpen 
economic activity.
 But there are also downside risks on the domestic 
side related to the depth and duration of the 
downturn in the manufacturing sector and its 
spillovers to other sectors and economies, which 
could prove worse than anticipated. Strong
er-than
-expected spillovers could raise unemployment 
fears of consumers, lower their confidence, 
weaken private consumption and result in a worse 
growth outcome than currently expected. 
 Moreover, abrupt financial market adjustments 
could trigger turmoil 
that impact negatively on the 
real economy. A trigger could be seen in changes 
in the expectations underlying recent 
developments in bond and equity prices, which 
could then lead to investor risk aversion with 
significant spillovers in terms of capital flo
ws, 
financial market stability and financial conditions. 
Asset prices could also be vulnerable to a re
-assessment of risks, creating vulnerabilities for the 
real economy. A ‚disorderly™ Brexit could dampen 
economic growth, particularly in the UK, but also 
in the EU27, though to a minor extent.
 ...and dominate less prominent upside risks, 
keeping the risk balance on the downside.
 Upside risks surrounding the growth outlook can 
also be found on the external side. If trade tensions 
were resolved faster than 
assumed, it could raise 
confidence and lead to a faster and stronger 
rebound in foreign trade that would improve the 
growth outlook for the EU. Easing measures in 
China could push economic growth more than 
expected. Fiscal policy in Europe could shift to a
 more expansionary stance.
 Several of the risks could materialise in the near 
term but may be more relevant in 2020 than in 
2021. Overall, risks to the growth outlook are 
skewed to the downside over the full forecast 
horizon.
 2. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
   25 2.1. GLOBAL DEVELOPM
ENTS
 After a sluggish end of 2018, global GDP growth 
picked up temporarily in the first half of 2019 on 
the back of upside surprises in some advanced 
economies and resilient activity in the ASEAN 
region. However, this modest rebound is proving 
to be only short
-lived. Over the summer, the re
-intensification of economic tensions between the 
US and China dampened already weak and fragile 
business confidence, hurting the outlook for 
investment, global manufacturing and trade 
activity. In addition, heightened geopoli
tical 
tensions in the Middle East and Asia, elevated 
policy uncertainty in Europe and the US, and the 
financial situation in Argentina added to the 
fragility of the global economy. The short
-term 
outlook for the global economy has turned notably 
more subdu
ed than expected in the spring, with 
global growth dragged down by the continuing 
slowdown in several major advanced economies 
and in China and by weaker than previously 
expected growth prospects in emerging markets. 
Elevated global uncertainty, trade and 
geopolitical 
tensions look set to linger and weigh on global 
growth, along with a number of other structural 
factors. These include demographic and 
productivity trends, the structural slowdown in 
China, protectionist tendencies and the impact of 
climate ch
ange.  
 Policy stimuli deployed in a number of major 
economies have so far prevented a sharper slump 
in global GDP growth and should limit the depth 
of the global slowdown in the near term. 
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of macroeconomic 
stimulus in boost
ing global growth at the current 
juncture is uncertain. The slowdown of the global 
economy could therefore turn out deeper and even 
more protracted than currently envisaged.
 Global growth is projected to remain subdued 
over the forecast horizon–
 Across all
 major advanced economies, the upside 
growth surprises in the first quarter of 2019 were 
followed by a backlash in the second quarter. 
Growth in the US and Japan moderated as business 
investment and manufacturing weakened and US
-China economic tensions re
-surfaced. At the same 
time, private consumption in these countries has 
remained resilient. By contrast, in emerging 
market economies as a whole, GDP growth picked 
up to some extent in the second quarter from an 
exceptionally weak first quarter, with severa
l countries benefitting from monetary policy easing 
and/or fiscal stimulus.  
 Beyond GDP dynamics, the pronounced weakness 
in global trade and industrial production persisted. 
Global merchandise trade volumes fell by 0.8% q
-o-q in the second quarter of 201
9 (according to 
CPB data). Overall, global trade volumes in the 
first half of the year were flat compared to the 
same period in 2018 and turned negative
 if July 
data are included.
    Recent
 high frequency indicators signal that the 
rise in global GDP growth in the first half of the 
year is proving to be short
-lived. The global 
manufacturing PMI (including the EU) was
 in 
contractionary territory during and after the 
summer, suggesting
 weak gl
obal manufacturing 
activity into the second half of 2019. In addition, 
after a long period of resilience, the global services 
PMI also weakened in recent months driven by 
slowing job creation in the sector and declining 
export demand, indicating that spill
overs from the 
slowdown in manufacturing are beginning to 
materialise.
 Global GDP growth (excluding the EU) is 
expected to slow down sharply from 3.8% in 2018 
to 3.2% in 2019 as the large negative shock from 
the escalating US
-China economic confrontation 
takes its toll on global investment and trade. Over 
the next two years, global economic activity is set

  26 to remain subdued and below trend due to the 
lasting US
-China confrontation, geopolitical 
tensions 
and elevated policy uncertainty. In 
addition, underlying structural trends are set to 
weigh on the global growth trajectory beyond the 
short
-term, including demographic and 
productivity trends, rising protectionism, the 
structural slowdown in China, the th
reat of a more 
fragmented global economy and less trade
-intensive global growth as well as the impact of 
climate change. At the same time, macroeconomic 
policies and resilient labour markets continue to 
support consumer spending, cushioning in many 
countri
es the impact from weak external demand. 
Overall, the global economy (excluding the EU) is 
forecast to expand by 3.3% and 3.4% in 2020 and 
2021, respectively, only marginally stronger than 
in 2019. In this baseline scenario, the profile of 
slightly acceler
ating global growth
 mainly reflects 
modestly improving cyclical conditions in Turkey 
and some countries in Latin America and the 
MENA region, driven by country
-specific factors. 
Nevertheless, growth in emerging market 
economies as a whole has been revised 
down 
substantially since the spring, as both cyclical and 
structural factors are set to prevent the stronger 
rebound that had previously been expected in these 
economies.  
 This baseline scenario  is underpinned by a number 
of important forecast assumption
s. The sharp 
intensification of economic tensions between the 
US and China during the summer signalled that the 
confrontation between the two countries is likely 
to persist regardless of the temporary truce agreed 
in mid
-October. While this forecast does n
ot 
assume 
any
 further escalation of trade tensions, it 
factors in the currently implemented and 
announced tariff measures (see 
technical box
). 
Furthermore, the uncertainty around US trade 
policy and the tensions regarding the functioning 
of the World Trade
 Organisation are assumed to be 
a permanent feature over the whole forecast 
horizon. The same holds for the ongoing 
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. On the 
other hand, the recent financial turmoil in 
Argentina is assumed to remain an isolated case
 that should not affect market sentiment towards 
emerging markets more generally.
 –with a gradual cyclical slowdown in 
advanced economies– 
 The economic outlook for advanced economies 
(excluding the EU) has deteriorated slightly since 
the 
spring. Investment and trade activity are set to 
remain weak, while robust labour markets and 
accommodative monetary policies should support 
private consumption in some countries (US, 
Canada, Australia, Korea). Overall, real GDP 
growth in advanced economie
s (excluding the EU) 
is set to slow over the forecast horizon, from 2.5% 
in 2018 to 1.8% in 2019, before edging further 
down over 2020 and 2021.

(Annual percentage change)
Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  27 After the US economy registered above potential 
growth of 2.9% in 2018, buttressed by a sizeable 
procyclical fi
scal expansion, the pace of growth in 
the first half of 2019 moderated to 2.6% 
(annualised) as business investment, the 
manufacturing sector and export growth weakened. 
So far this year, GDP growth has been mainly 
driven by strong private consumption under
pinned 
by a robust labour market. Going forward, activity 
is set to slow further. The economic tensions with 
China, together with the pervasive general 
uncertainty surrounding US trade policy, are 
expected to continue weighing on business 
confidence. At th
e same time, the growth impulse 
from the fiscal stimulus is set to fade out and fiscal 
policy should turn growth neutral in 2020
-2021. In 
particular, private non
-residential investment and 
activity in the manufacturing sector are projected 
to remain weak o
ver the forecast horizon, also 
contributing to a gradual slowdown in the pace of 
job creation. On the other hand, accommodative 
monetary policy is expected to lower borrowing 
costs, cushioning the slowdown in economic 
activity. Private consumption is proje
cted to be the 
main growth driver over the next two years against 
the backdrop of growing real wages, favourable 
financing conditions and stronger household 
balance sheets. Thus, US real GDP growth is 
projected to slow to 2.3% in 2019 before 
moderating fur
ther to below potential rates in 2020 
(1.8%) and 2021 (1.6%). 
 In Japan, robust GDP growth in the first half of 
2019 was underpinned by strong public spending 
and resilient private consumption. However, the 
economy is expected to go through a soft patch in
 the second half of the year due to the consumption 
tax hike in October (from 8% to 10% with some 
goods exempted) and a weak trade outlook, 
reflecting the US
-China economic confrontation 
but also the trade tensions between Japan and 
Korea. For the year as 
a whole, GDP is forecast at 
0.9%. In 2020 and 2021, the pace of growth is 
expected to slow to 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, 
as domestic demand weakens in the wake of fiscal 
consolidation and exports remain sluggish.
 – and a very modest rebound in emerging 
market economies.
 After
 solid growth in 2018 (4.5%), real GDP 
growth in emerging markets is expected to 
decrease to 3.9% in 2019 amid weak global trade 
momentum, heightened global uncertainty and a 
mixed outlook for financing conditions in 
emerging markets 
(see below). Furthermore, the 
deteriorating global outlook has led to lower 
commodity prices, which combined with slowing 
demand growth in China, weakens the prospects 
for a number of commodity exporting emerging 
countries. The slowdown in China and the US
-China trade tensions are also taking a toll on some 
export
-oriented economies in emerging Asia, 
though a few countries (e.g. Vietnam) are set to 
benefit from some trade diversion away from 
China. At the same time, monetary policy easing 
across many emergi
ng market countries and 
expansionary fiscal policies in some major 
economies with fiscal space (China, Korea, 
Russia) are likely to provide some limited support 
to growth. Growth in emerging market economies 
is projected to pick
-up moderately
 to 4.2% and 
4.3% in 2020 and 2021, respectively, against the 
backdrop of persisting trade tensions, slowing 
economic activity in advanced economies and the 
diminished outlook in a number of distressed 
countries.
 The growth outlook is subdued across emerging 
markets. In
 China, downward pressure on the 
economy has intensified amid persistent 
uncertainty related to economic and trade tensions 
with the US. Domestic demand is also showing 
signs of weakness with both consumer spending 
and investment decelerating amid rising f
inancial 
sector tensions. While the policy stimulus 
deployed by the Chinese authorities is expected to 
cushion the negative impact of these downward 
pressures, it will not fully offset them. Growth in 
China is expected to slow from 6.1% in 2019 to 
5.8% in 
2020. A further decrease to 5.6% is 
projected in 2021, partly as a result of structural 
factors such as a shrinking working age 
population, persistently high debt levels (despite 
the recent deleveraging campaign) and the ongoing 
rebalancing process away fr
om investment
-led 
growth. 
 In India, real GDP growth slowed significantly 
from 8% y
-o-y in 2018
-Q2 to 5% y
-o-y in 2019
-Q2 and is projected to bottom out in the second 
half of the year helped by monetary easing and 
other policy support. Nevertheless, the pi
ck-up in 
growth over 2020 and 2021 is likely to remain 
subdued reflecting the trend of weakening private 
investment in recent years amid still tight credit 
conditions. 
 In Russia, weak wage growth, increasing taxes and 
lower oil revenues dampen the outlook
, though 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  28 fiscal and monetary policy easing are set to bring 
some respite. 
 In Latin America, the Middle East and Sub
-Saharan Africa lingering policy uncertainties, 
domestic idiosyncratic factors and heightened 
geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on 
underlying growth dynamics.
 In the more medium run, structural factors such as 
weak FDI inflows and domestic investment, weak 
productivity growth, aging societies and the lack of 
structural reforms are weighing on emerging 
markets™ potential growth. The gr
owth differential 
of more than 4 pps. that emerging market 
economies enjoyed over advanced economies 
during 2000
-2010 has narrowed to about 2 pps. 
(2018 data). Moreover, non
-financial corporates 
have become considerably more indebted, while 
bank and shadow
 bank credit has slowed following 
previous excesses and bank restructurings in many 
emerging market economies, including India and 
China. Without major structural reforms, per capita 
income convergence between emerging markets 
and advanced economies is no 
longer assured. This 
would also imply a re

- to 
long
-term growth prospects for the global 
economy as a whole.
       Global trade growth remains weak with no 
strong 
rebound in sight
 Following the sharp slowdown at the end of 2018, 
global trade considerably weakened in the first two 
quarters of 2019 and turned negative in year
-on-year terms in July. This weakness has been broad
-based, and has coincided with a pronounce
d slowdown in industrial production and investment 
indices worldwide. Geographically, a contraction 
of imports was stronger among emerging market 
economies, with emerging Asia and China 
particularly affected. Imports in advanced 
economies held up better, c
ushioned by the relative 
robustness of domestic demand. Overall, trade 
remained well below trend in all regions.
       On the back of weak demand in several key 
economies, non
-EU world import
 growth is 
expected to slow down sharply to 0.4% this year 
from 4.1% in 2018. The sharp revision compared 
to spring reflects a softer
-than
-expected first half 
of the year and continued weakness in global new 
export orders in the third quarter. Global polic
y uncertainty is expected to continue weighing on 
trade in the quarters to come, driven by the ups and 
downs of the trade conflict between the US and 
China and the global increase in protectionism as 
also other countries have ramped up their rhetoric 
and s
tarted introducing new trade barriers 
themselves. 
 Global import growth (excluding the EU) is 
forecast to pick up to around 2% in 2020, driven 
by base effects, before further edging up to 2.5% 
in 2021 under the assumption that import 
elasticities will incr
ease moderately from their 
extremely low current levels (0.1 for 2019). 
Nevertheless, given the continued impact of the 
current weakness in investment and the fact that 
the broad
-based softening in the global 
manufacturing sector is partly driven by struct
ural 
factors, import elasticities are set to remain 
subdued compared to the levels observed before 
2019. Furthermore, as trade and economic tensions 
are assumed to remain elevated in the medium
-term, rising protectionism, risks of de
-globalisation 
and an e
rosion of the multilateral rules
-based 
trading system, as well as possible retrenchment of 
global value chains, are expected to continue

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  29 weighing on trade dynamics beyond the current 
slump.
      Well
-supplied global oil markets limit the shock 
from supply disruptions in Saudi Arabia
 Over the summer, oil prices slipped below 60 
USD/bbl, spooked by the re
-escalating economic 
tensions between the US and China and the
 deteriorating global outlook. The recent attack on 
Saudi Arabia™s oil production facilities resulted in 
a temporary loss of 5.7 million barrels of output 
per day (40
-50% of the country™s oil output), 
briefly lifting oil prices to around 65 USD/bbl, 
sugges
ting that, despite the significant outage, the 
global oil market is very well supplied. Saudi 
Arabian authorities have also calmed markets by 
ensuring a quick restoration of production. But an 
elevated risk premium could remain in oil prices 
for some time,
 as the attack highlighted the 
vulnerability of oil infrastructures. However, over 
the forecast horizon, upward price pressures are 
expected to be held down by the recovery in 
production in Saudi Arabia, as well as the 
increasing production of shale oil in
 North 
America. Substantial uncertainties around this 
scenario relate to the heightened risk for further 
escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle 
East and the evolution of demand for oil as growth 
in advanced economies and China softens.
 The assum
ptions for Brent prices this year and 
next are revised down compared to the spring 
forecast to an average of 63 USD/bbl in 2019 and 
57 USD/bbl in 2020. Oil prices are then assumed 
to edge further down to 56 USD/bbl in 2021. In 
euro terms, this implies a do
wnward revision of 
around 8% and 14% in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively, as compared to the spring forecast.
       2.2. FINANCIAL MARKE
TS In global financial markets, monetary easing in 
advanced economies has
 led to a further reduction 
in bond yields, but financing conditions for some 
emerging market economies have tightened. 
Equity markets have been volatile reflecting 
concerns about the slowdown of growth and trade. 
 Financing conditions are diverging betwee
n advanced and emerging economies
 Since the dovish pivot of the US Federal Reserve 
in the beginning of 2019, financing conditions in 
advanced economies have eased. Over the 
summer, the intensified US
-China economic 
confrontation, heightened concerns about a global 
recession and escalating 
geopolitical tensions 
triggered a financial market adjustment globally. 
The Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 
bps in July and another 25 bps in September, with 
expectations for further policy easing rising. 
Government bonds continued this summe
r the 
remarkable rally initiated late 2018, leading to a 
further flattening of yield curves globally. In the 
US, the 10y Treasury yield was around 1.80% in 
late October, down from 2.0% at the end of July 
and over 3% at the start of the year. On the other 
hand, stock markets in advanced economies have 
been volatile over the last few months, falling on 
trade and global growth concerns and rebounding 
on monetary policy easing and on hopes for 
progress in US
-China trade negotiations. The spike 
in risk aversion 
over the summer also contributed 
to considerable appreciation in safe heaven 
currencies (namely the JPY and the USD) while 
the US
-China trade tensions resulted in a 
depreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  30 US dollar (above the threshold of 7 USD/RM
B for 
the first time since 2008).
       After tightening rapidly in August, financing 
conditions in emerging market economies 
improved somewhat in September. This mainly 
reflected developments
 in currencies and to some 
extent equity markets and was also driven by the 
flight
-to-safety episode in August related to the 
intensification of global growth concerns and trade 
tensions. During that month, equity indices 
declined globally due to the deter
iorating growth 
outlook and slowing portfolio capital inflows. In 
September though, equities recovered some of 
their losses as capital flowed back in. While 
average emerging market long
-term yields fell 
below 5%, the spread to US long
-term bond yields 
wide
ned by 30 bps. from the end of July to 335 
bps. in the beginning of October. These 
developments were mirrored in the foreign 
exchange markets, as emerging market currencies 
depreciated following the intensification of trade 
tensions (e.g. Chinese renminbi,
 Korean won) and 
idiosyncratic domestic factors (e.g. Brazil, South 
Africa, Argentina).
 Going forward, financing conditions in the US are 
set to remain favourable over the forecast horizon, 
underpinned by market expectations for easier 
monetary policy by t
he US Fed and a domestic 
economy performing close to potential output. 
Financing conditions in emerging market 
economies are expected to remain at best neutral to 
growth, given the risks related to a stronger US 
dollar and more abrupt capital outflows, whi
ch 
reduces the room for further monetary policy 
easing.
         European financial markets have been driven 
by similar factors
 European financial markets have shown significant 
volatility ov
er the last few months, driven by 
concerns about the economic slowdown and global 
trade tensions, as well as long
-term expectations of 
lower interest rates and inflation, coupled with the 
prospect of a more accommodative monetary 
policy stance. Yields on l
onger
-term euro area 
sovereign debt moved down over summer, and 
those with the highest credit ratings went well into 
negative rate territory. European equity markets 
experienced a substantial price correction in 
August, but reversed course sharply in early
 September on expectations that the ECB would 
come up with a significant and impactful policy 
package at its meeting in September. The 
subsequent announcement of net asset purchases 
has further supported financial asset prices.
 As the ECB eased monetary po
licy further–
 The ECB Governing Council decided in 
September that additional monetary stimulus was 
needed in light of further downward revisions to 
the inflation outlook. The latest easing package 
included a 10 bps cut in the deposit facility rate to 
-0.50
% and a restart of open
-ended net asset 
purchases at a pace of EUR 20bn per month from 
November this year. The ECB also announced a 
strengthening of its forward guidance on policy 
rates to reinforce the impact of the cut in the 
deposit facility rate as wel
l as the signalling effect 
of asset purchases. The new forward guidance no 
longer includes the date
-based leg (‚at least 
through the first half of 2020™) and becomes 
entirely state
-based, with a first rate hike now

  31 linked to a sufficient convergence of the
 inflation 
outlook to the ECB™s objective over their 
projection horizon that should also be ﬁconsistently 
reflected in underlying inflation dynamicsﬂ. As 
part of the monetary policy easing package, the 
modalities of the new series of Targeted Longer
-Term R
efinancing Operations (TLTROs) 
announced in June 2019 were also eased, making it 
possible for banks to access longer
-term funding at 
lower rates with a longer maturity. In order to 
safeguard bank
-based policy transmission, the 
ECB also announced a two
-tier
 system for the 
remuneration of euro area banks™ reserves with the 
Eurosystem. According to this new system, part of 
banks™ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt 
from the negative deposit facility rate in order to 
mitigate the impact of negative poli
cy rates on 
euro area banks™ profitability. Meanwhile, the 
other EU central banks have kept unchanged their 
monetary policies, adopting a ‚wait and see™ 
position in an environment of persistent 
uncertainties related to protectionist policies and 
geopolitic
al factors. 
 While the euro has not showed a clear trend in 
nominal effective terms in recent months, it has 
been rather volatile, mainly reflecting an increased 
volatility of some of the euro™s main bilateral 
exchange rates. The euro has shown in particul
ar 
an increased volatility relative to the pound against 
the backdrop of persistent uncertainty about a 
Brexit deal. At the same time, the euro has 
weakened mostly against the Japanese yen and the 
US dollar in a context of increased political risks 
(e.g. B
rexit, renewed US
-Iran tensions, tensions 
between Japan and South Korea, recent social 
unrest in Hong Kong) and escalating trade tensions 
between the US and China. The euro™s weakness 
against safe
-haven currencies such as the Japanese 
yen and the US dollar
 has been broadly offset by 
its appreciation vis
-à-vis the currencies of most 
other EU countries and some emerging economies.
 – bond yields declined – 
 In the sovereign bond markets, 10
-year Bund 
yields turned negative in May and set an historical 
trough o
f -0.7% in mid
-August, before increasing 
to 
-0.40% in late October as investor demand for 
safe assets somewhat abated compared to the 
summer. Italy™s sovereign spread vis
-à-vis the 
German Bund narrowed in the last few months, as 
political uncertainty in It
aly abated. In a sign of 
easing political tensions in the country and 
reflecting the global search for yield, Italy in 
October issued US dollar denominated sovereign 
bonds for the first time in 10 years. The spreads of 
peripheral countries have also tighte
ned 
significantly thanks to the global search for yield. 
In mid
-October, the Greek spread vs German 
Bunds on 10
-year sovereign bonds was around 190 
bps., while the Italian spread was around 135 bps., 
and Portuguese and Spanish spreads were around 
65 bps. 
        The euro area™s corporate bond spreads have 
oscillated over the last few months, tracking 
investors™ risk sentiment. Bond spreads for all 
credit profiles widened in August and narrowed in 
September. Investors generally appear to continue 
pricing credit and interest rate risks at low levels, 
in spite of lower economic growth and global trade 
tensions.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  32     Private sector lending flows set to increase 
further 
 Bank lending continues to expand, with the annual 
growth rate of loans to the euro area private sector 
remaining robust in a range of 3
-4% since the 
beginning of 2018 (3.8% in August 2019, 
following 3.7
% in July). Among the borrowing 
sectors, the annual growth rate of loans to 
households stood at 3.4% in August, unchanged 
compared to July, while the growth rate of loans to 
enterprises increased to 4.3% in August, up from 
4.0% in July. However, credit dev
elopments are 
quite divergent amongst Member States, with 
lending to corporates expanding by more than 5% 
annually in France and Germany, while shrinking 
by about 1% in Italy and Spain, where banks are 
still deleveraging. Banks are continuing to make 
progr
ess in consolidating their balance sheets, with 
the share of non
-performing loans declining, 
supported by asset disposals. However, the overall 
level of non
-performing loans remains high in 
some countries.
 In the ECB Bank Lending Survey of the third 
quarter of 2019, euro area banks reported that 
credit standards (loan approval criteria) eased 
slightly for loans to enterprises and for loans to 
households for house purchases, driven by 
competition and in spite
 of the continued 
tightening contribution of risk perceptions related 
to the economic outlook. Credit standards 
continued to tighten for consumer credit. However, 
banks™ overall terms and conditions (those agreed 
in the loan contract) for new loans to ente
rprises 
and for housing loans continued to tighten, driven 
by higher margins on riskier loans. Terms and 
conditions for consumer credit remained 
unchanged. Loan demand was stable for 
enterprises, and continued to increase for housing 
loans and consumer cre
dit. For the fourth quarter, 
banks expect credit standards and demand for 
loans to enterprises to remain broadly unchanged, 
while demand for housing loans and consumer 
credit is expected to increase. 
 Meanwhile, debt market funding for enterprises 
continue
d to expand in the euro area, although at a 
slower pace than in previous years, around 5% in 
October on an annual basis. The high level of 
corporate debt remains a concern, particularly in 
segments such as leveraged loans, low
-credit 
quality borrowers and 
highly
-leveraged 
enterprises. Euro area banks and other financial 
institutions may be exposed to leveraged debt 
issued by companies located in other jurisdictions, 
particularly the US. Meanwhile, net issuance of 
equity by euro area enterprises is still gro
wing, 
although at a very moderate rate, around 0.3% in 
October on an annual basis, reflecting limited 
investor demand under the current economic 
slowdown.
 Overall, financing conditions are expected to 
remain supportive with very low funding costs for 
both 
the private and public sectors. Credit volumes 
to households and NFCs are set to rise further in

 2.3. GDP COMPONENTS
 GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was similar to 
that in the latter 
half of 2018. In the second 
quarter, weighed down by net exports, GDP 
growth decreased to 0.2% quarter
-on-quarter 
(q-o-q) from 0.4% earlier in the year, where 
figures were distorted by UK
-specific factors 
related to stock building in anticipation of the 
‚original™ Brexit date. Domestic demand proved 
supportive and remained resilient to external 
headwinds. Compared with the same quarter of the 
previous year, GDP growth slowed to 1.2% in the 
euro area (from 1.3% in the first quarter), a sharp 
contrast from it
s post
-crisis peak of 3.0% in the 
fourth quarter of 2017. 
 The euro area economy continues to grow–
 A number of temporary factors propped up activity 
in the first quarter (e.g. mild weather benefitting 
construction activity, Brexit
-related stockpiling), 
and helped push up half year
-on-half year rates, 
which stood at 0.7% (in 2019
-H1), slightly higher 
than the 0.5% growth in the second half of 2018. 
While growth lost steam in a majority of Member 
States in the second quarter, it brought to light 
differences 
in relative performance between 
countries and sectors. In the euro area, only 
Germany and Italy recorded changes in output that 
were below the area
-wide average in both quarters, 
while France and Spain showed more resilience. 
 Sector
-wise, the euro area ha
s been moving at two 
different speeds. First, a still robust service sector, 
supported by domestic demand; and second, a 
significant cooling down in manufacturing, for 
which the downturn has now completed the fourth 
consecutive quarter. In the second quart
er, gross 
value added in the euro area manufacturing 
industry fell at its fastest pace since end
-2012 with 
Germany at the core of the turn in the cycle. The 
disconnect between German manufacturing output 
and that of other euro area countries mainly 
reflect
s developments in the car manufacturing and 
electrical equipment sectors.
 (24)  The continued dampening in the manufacturing 
sector can be partly traced to persistent uncertainty 
about the future state of the global economy and 
the rules governing world tra
de,
 (25)  geopolitical 
concerns, falling demand for capital goods, 
structural changes in the automotive industry, as 
well as the deteriorating performance of the 
electronic components sector (particularly in 
Asia).
 (26) Given the trade and capital
-intensity 
of 
the manufacturing sector, countries with a larger 
industrial base and higher reliance on exports have 
been more affected so far. 
 Former advantages have thus turned into 
vulnerabilities. The export orientation (high weight 
of value
-added exports in econ
omic activity) and 
importance of the manufacturing sector have 
exposed German manufacturers more than others 
to a slowdown of global demand. The production 
of auto vehicles, which has an important economic 
footprint, has been hit by falling demand from 
Chi
na, due to higher taxes and tighter financial 
conditions, as well as market saturation; the rollout 
of new emission tests in Europe; and the shift 
away from diesel towards gasoline and alternative 
fuels.
 (27) The exposure to the fading export 
demand from specific trading partners, such as 
China, has turned into a headwind as well. 
 –but surveys suggest growth is still stuck in low 
gear.
 In contrast to previous expectations, recent hard 
and survey data suggest 
that growth momentum 
eased further in the third quarter of the year. Both 
                                                           (24) These sectors together account for about 16% of euro area 
manufacturing value added, but 27% in Germany, giving 
rise to asymmetric effects across Member States.
 (25) Uncertaint
y acts as an extra hurdle on the required return 
for new projects. Investment is hit more than in normal 
circumstances as waves of uncertainty resurface following 
previous peaks, frustrating expectations around duration 
and resolution, consistently increas
ing the real value of 
waiting. See Broadbent, B. (2019). ‚Investment and 
uncertainty: the value of waiting for news™. Speech at the 
Imperial College Business School, 20 May.
 (26) Asian tech exports account for about 10% of global trade, 
with these economies
 closely linked through integrated 
supply chains. See Lane, P. (2019). ‚Reflections on 
monetary policy™. Speech at Bloomberg, London, 16 
September.

mand, also suggests a softening growth 
momentum ahead. In August, 
industrial 
production
 in the euro area increased somewhat, 
recovering from a similarly
-sized fall in July 
(+0.4%, following 
-0.4%), but failing to rebound 
after the sharp decline in June (
-1.4%), thus paving 
the way for a contraction in the quarter. It is now 
broadly at the same level as it was in December 
                                                           (28) Concordance indices indicate that turning points in real M1

 2018. Adding to the weakening momentum, 
production in construction
 in the euro area 
decreased in August for the third month in a row 
(-0.4
%, after 
-1.1% in July and 
-0.7% in June), 
which suggests that the fall in the average 
production level in the second quarter may not 
have been the last. 
 Despite the increase in August (+0.3%, after 
-0.5% 
in July)
, retail trade volumes
 still hint at a slo
wer 
pace of sales growth compared to the previous 
quarter. On the upside, n
ew passenger car 
registrations
 continued to recover in the third 
quarter, although increasing at a much more 
moderate pace (from +2.7% q
-o-q to +0.7%) 
staying now close to its level
 of one year before. 
Consequently, growth looks set to remain subdued 
in the second half of the year. While the 
manufacturing sector is not likely to bottom out 
soon, it is expected that the more 
domestically
-oriented services and construction 
sectors™ sho
uld continue to remain relatively 
insulated. 
 The fundamentals of the European economy, 
including its robust labour market, should be 
strong enough to withstand
 external headwinds and 
avoid a recession. They are, however, unlikely to 
power growth to a high
er trajectory. The economic 
engine is pushing against structural impediments 
such as the slowdown in China, the shift away 
from diesel
-powered vehicles and fuel engines
, and supply shocks emanating from the disruption 
of global supply chains. These add to 
the trend 
decline in productivity and population ageing 
which weigh down on the medium
-term outlook.
 All in all, the euro area economy is forecast to 
grow at a rate of 1.1% in 2019, and at broadly the 
same rate in 2020 and 2021. Compared to the 
summer inte
rim forecast (published in July), the 
forecast has been downgraded by about 0.1pps. in 
2019 (from 1.2%) and 0.2pps. in 2020 (from 
1.4%). The downward revision to growth in 2020 
is mostly due to a carryover from
 lower growth 
momentum in the previous year. A
t the same time, 
economic activity in 2020 is expected to benefit 
from a higher number of working days in some 
Member States, which should add an estimated 0.2 
pps. to the growth rate of that year.
 In 2020, domestic demand is expected to be 
supported by a 
reduced tax burden and increased 
government transfers in several Member States, as 
well as by the transmission of an accommodative

  35 monetary policy, with historically low financing 
costs for consumers and corporates (see Section 
I.2.2). This adds to relativ
ely favourable labour 
market conditions, with sustained but slower 
employment creation (see Section I.2.5) and the 
improvement of private sector balance
-sheets
 in 
recent years, which have further reduced 
deleveraging needs and created room for higher 
expen
diture levels.
 Over the forecast years, the contribution to growth 
from domestic demand is nevertheless expected to 
moderate (from 1.5
 pps. in
 2018 to 1.3
 pps. in 
2021), driven mainly by moderating investment 
growth. The contribution from net exports is 
forecast to stay broadly neutral in both 2020 and 
2021, after weighing
-down growth in 2019, with 
exports growing at almost a third of the rate seen 
in 2017 (see also Section I.3.2 for a model
-based 
identification of growth drivers).
 All euro area countries
 apart from Lithuania are 
projected to see growth slowdown in 2019. The 
majority is forecast see growth moderate further in 
2021 compared to the current year, with the gap 
between the fastest and slowest growing 
economies diminishing, as the higher levels 
of 
growth come down.
         Also, among euro area countries, only Greece and 
to a lesser extent Italy, 
are forecast to grow at rates 
higher than their estimated potential by the end of 
the forecast horizon, thus resulting in a smaller 
positive output gap than in recent years. According 
to the Commission™s estimates, the growth rate of 
potential
 GDP in the e
uro area is expected to 
remain slightly below 1½%, compared to a real 
GDP growth forecast of about 1.2% between 2019 
and 2021, on average.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  36 of 2018). Household expenditure growth continued 
to go hand
-in-hand with labour market conditions 
and slowed in line with a lower pace of 
employment creation during that quarter. The 
slowdo
wn is further explained by the loss of 
momentum in Germany, where the first quarter 
outturn benefited from an upsurge in durable 
goods consumption and the enactment of 
supportive fiscal measures (e.g. an increase in 
child benefits).
 According to the breakd
own of private 
consumption for the second quarter, euro area 
durable goods consumption remained almost 
unchanged, whereas semi
- and non
-durable goods 
and services grew at half their previous pace. It 
should however be noted that the growth of 
durable goods
 consumption has been slowing for 
some time. This is unlikely to change, despite 
favourable financing conditions, as 
consumers™ 
intentions on making major purchases
 in the year 
ahead have eased, the prospect of increases in 
income out of net employment cre
ation are 
dimmer and because pent
-up demand appears to be 
exhausted.
 (29)  Private consumption growth remains aligned and 
contingent on developments in households™ 
income and wealth. So far this year, nominal 
disposable income has grown at an average rate o
f 3.5% (y
-o-y) from 3.1% in the two previous 
quarters, with the contribution of direct taxes, 
social contributions and net transfers paramount to 
this pick
-up. Whereas in the second half of 2018, 
these detracted (about 0.7 pps.) from the annual 
increase in
 income 
Œ reflecting the cyclicality of 
automatic stabilisers 
Œ in the first half of this year, 
they supported disposable income. This is the first 
time in nine years that they have had such an effect 
and it reflects discretionary measures in some 
Member S
tates.
 Real household disposable income is projected to 
gain further momentum this year, before 
weakening next year and the year after. The 
contribution of labour income is expected to 
decline compared to 2018, with a lower pace of 
headcount employment gro
wth not fully offset by 
faster growth in wages per employee.
 (30) This 
                                                           (29) At least on aggregate, as the share of durables on overall 
consumer expenditure is now close to where it stood prior 
to the euro area crisis (at about 9.0%)
. (30) A lower contribution of compensation per employee to 
disposable income growth in 2019 is partly 
due to the Tax 
Credit for Competitiveness and Employment (CICE) in 
France which permanently reduces employers™ social 
change in the composition of income growth, away 
from employment and towards wages, is expected 
to yield lower increases in spending. After growing 
by 1.6% in 2018, household real dispos
able 
income growth is projected to increase to 2.0% in 
2019, before returning to 1.4% in 2020 and 
decreasing further to about 1.2% in 2021 as 
inflation is expected to slightly pick up that year.
     How much of the increase in income spills over to 
actual consumer spending will ultimately depend 
on households™ savings decisions. Across most 
countries in the euro area, household savings have 
been building up, with the euro area saving rate 
increasing f
rom 11.9% in the first quarter of 2018 
to 13.3% in the second quarter of this year (see 
Graph 
I.2.12
). Since the start of this year, the Commission™
s 
consumer confidence indicator
 has been hovering 
within a steady range in the euro area. At the same 
time, consumers are becoming less optimistic 
about the labour market, with unemployment 
expectations moving higher. A prolonged period of 
uncertainty arou
nd income prospects has pushed 
up precautionary saving and is weighing on 
consumers™ propensity to make big spending 
decisions, such as the purchase of housing and 
durable goods.
 (31) Also, changes in sentiment can 
have a long
-lasting and persistent impact 
on consumer spending, weighing on activity well 
beyond the short
-term.
 (32)                                                                                    security contributions, while having no impact on 
household purchasing power.

fluctuations affect workers unevenly. The income

more vulnerability to downturns, giving rise to 
cyclical swings in precautionary saving

 possible saturation of consumer demand amid a 
maturing economic cycle.
 Overall, private consumption growth in the euro 
area is expected 
to cool for the third consecutive 
year (to 1.1% in 2019 from 1.4% in 2018), 
dampened by a higher saving rate. It is forecast to 
increase slightly next year to 1.2% thanks to a 
smaller increase in the saving rate, and to grow just 
at about the same rate in 
2021 in line with real 
income growth (see Graph 
I.2.13
). Since liquidity
-constrained households show a h
igher propensity 
to consume out of disposable income, poorer 
labour market improvements are set to dampen 
aggregate consumption. It should, however, be 
supported by the solid shape of the aggregate

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  38       – while government consumption growth is set 
to remain strong–
 In the first half of this year, government 
consumption con
tinued to contribute positively to 
growth. It grew by 0.8%, which compares 
favourably with the increase of 0.5% in both 
halves of 2018. This was particularly driven by 
developments in Germany, where government 
consumption increased twice as much as in the 
previous year (+1.2%, 0.6% in both halves of 
2018).
 Building on the outturn available for the first two 
quarters of 2019, aggregate government 
consumption is projected to grow by 1.6% this 
year, slightly more than the 1.1% recorded in 
2018. It is forecast 
to grow at about the same pace 
in 2020 before slowing moderately in 2021 to 
1.3%. (see Section I.2.7.) The slowing projected 
for the outer year is linked to the no
-policy
-change 
assumption, according to which measures are only 
factored into the forecast if
 they have been adopted 
and presented to national parliaments, or if they 
have been sufficiently specified.
 –and investment to lose impetus–
 In the second quarter, investment in the euro area 
grew faster than GDP,
 rising by 5.6%
 after losing 
pace in the 
first quarter (0.5% q
-o-q). Looking at 
its breakdown, construction investment remained 
flat, although this performance should be seen 
against the influence of extraordinarily favourable 
weather conditions, which benefitted construction 
activity early in th
e year, particularly in Germany. 
In contrast, non
-construction investment increased 
by about 10.9% after declining in the previous 
quarter (
-0.6%). Half year
-on-half year investment 
spending expanded by 4.1% in the euro area, 
above the 2.2% rate seen in th
e second half of 
2018 and 1.6% in the first. 
 Data from Ireland, which is subject to large swings 
linked to the activities of multinationals, continued 
to blur investment readings. A more reliable 
understanding of the cyclical standing of euro area 
investm
ent spending is indeed only possible by 
stripping out the figures from Ireland 
Œ where 
investment contracted by 22.7% in the first quarter 
before increasing 182.2% in the second. Without 
accounting for such volatility, investment 
excluding construction has
 been increasing by 
between 1.0% and 1.5% (q
-o-q) for three quarters 
now. Still, the second quarter figure benefited from 
a significant increase in general government 
investment in machinery and equipment in 
Germany (by about 44.8%), which raised the 
aggre
gate figure.
 (36) The investment
-to-GDP ratio, 
adjusted for Irish figures, stood at 21.6% in 
2019-Q2, about the same as in the previous three 
quarters and about 1 pp. below the average of 
between 2000 and 2005. 
 A look at 
forward
-looking demand for credit f
or 
investment purposes,
 however, offers a less benign 
view on the quarter ahead, as reported in the 
October 2019 ECB Bank Lending Survey (see 
Section I.2.2).
 Based on this metric, investment is 
set to moderate, which is also consistent with the 
decline of 
the stringency of 
equipment as a factor 
limiting production
 back to end
-2017 levels. At the 
same time, 
profitability measures
 deteriorated in 
the second quarter of this year 
Œ as higher wages 
have yet to be compensated by increased 
productivity 
- with the 
gross profit share of non
-financial corporations settling at 39.2% of gross 
value added, down from 40.1% one year before 
and below its long
-term average of 40%. 
 Most signals for the near
-term outlook are more 
benign for residential investment. The 
Commiss
ion™s 
Construction Confidence Indicator
 moderated in the third quarter, with sentiment in 
September falling to its lowest since December 
2017. It remains, however, well
-above its 
historical average. Also, 
house prices
, as measured 
by the House Price Index 
remain buoyant, rising 
by 4.2% in the second quarter compared to the 
                                                           (36) By contrast, business investment in machinery and 
equipment in Germany fell significantly in the second 
quarter, for the first time since send
-2016, as a phase of 
high capacity utilisation in industry is ending.

Investment is also expected to benefit from the 
continued support of the European Fund for 
Strateg
ic Investments (EFSI).
 (37)  At the same time, these supportive factors are 
likely to be dampened by declining profit margins 
and weaker corporate earnings 
expectations
, in a 
context of weak aggregate demand. The declining 
rate of 
capacity utilisation
 is reducing the need for 
investments linked to capacity expansion and 
lowered incentives for upgrading. Still
-high supply 
hindrances, particularly in recruiting skilled labour 
in the construction sector, add to the limits for 
further capital deepening, co
mpounded by adverse 
demographic trends. Elevated uncertainty,
 (38) most 
notably regarding the future viability of value 
chain integration,
 (39) further undermines incentives 
to invest, with firms being expected to follow a 
wait

 in 
capital

    Against this background, after growing by 3.3% in 
2018, investment in the euro area (excluding 
Irela
nd) is projected to increase by 3.0% this year 
(4.3% after 2.3% accounting for Irish figures). 
Further ahead, it
 is forecast to grow by about 1.9% 
in 2020 before moderating further to 1.8%, in line 
with the still subdued demand outlook (see Graph 
I.2.14
). Both investment in construction and in 
other assets, such as intellectual property products, 
are expected to moderate in
 the following years.
 –in a context of subdued export growth.
 In the second quarter of the year, export volumes 
were at a standstill, after having grown by nearly 
1% in the two preceding quarters. The aggregate 
picture masks considerable differences betwee
n goods and services, as well as between countries. 
Exports of services growth strengthened and 
registered five quarters of uninterrupted growth. At 
the same time, goods exports contracted for the 
first time since the first quarter of 2018, even if 
only ma
rginally (
-0.3% q
-o-q). 
 International trade data shows that both intra
- and 
extra
-euro area exports of goods continued to 
underperform in the first half of the year. Whereas 
the former grew modestly (at 0.2%, after failing to 
grow in the second half of la
st year), the latter 
remained broadly unchanged and at about the same 
level as in the first half of 2018. This hides a sharp 
contraction in the second quarter of this year, after 
a reprieve in the first quarter (see Graph 
I.2.15
) in 
which exports were bolstered by trade flows with 
the UK (stockpiling in advance of the ‚original™ 
Brexit date in March).

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  40 Exports are unlikely to strengthen significantly in 
the near term given the gloomy outlook for foreign 
demand. This is suggested by the assessment of 
export order books
 in the Commission™s 
manufacturing survey, which deteriorated further 
in the third quart
er of 2019 to levels not seen since 
August 2013. 
Export expectations
 in 
manufacturing, as measured by the Commission™s 
quarterly survey (conducted in July), fell for the 
seventh consecutive quarter to its lowest since the 
end of 2012. 
 The geographical ori
entation of the euro area™s 
external trade, as well as its product specialisation, 
appears to have been a disadvantage. While euro 
area export markets
 (41) contracted by about 2.3% 
in the second quarter of the year, the overall world 
import demand (excludin
g euro area) contracted by 
only 0.8%. Both, however, are currently close to 
their levels at the end of 2017, a clear signal of 
how trade flows have failed to provide a positive 
contribution to growth.
 (42) Looking ahead, after 
expanding by 3.1% in 2018, dem
and for euro area 
exports of goods and services is forecast to grow 
by 2.2% in 2019 and to continue growing at a 
modest pace of 2.6% in 2020 and 2.7% in 2021.
          Euro area export growth should continue to be 
affected by weak global activity, particularly the 
fading impact of the fiscal stimulus in the US,
 (43)                                                                                    area exports were reported to hav
e contracted by 0.3% after 
growing by 0.8% in the first three months of the year.
 (41) Based on data from the CPB World Trade Monitor on the 
volume of goods imports by trading partners weighted by 
their respective share in euro area exports.
 (42) Compared to
 2018, t
he larger contributor
s to softer 
euro 
area 
external demand 
in the first seven months of 2019 
were 
Turkey
 and China, where imports of goods fell by 
8.7% and 1.8%, respectively.
 (43) Real exports of goods to the US grew by about 8.7% in 
2018, from 4.4
% in 2017, which was key to cushion the 
as well as sluggish world trade, in a context of a 
lowered elasticity of trade to growth compared to 
previo
us years. Heightened uncertainty about trade 
policy and geopolitical tensions pose further 
challenges and limit a
 potential revival of demand 
for trade
-intensive capital goods. This is
 also 
consistent with IHS Markit™s flash 
Manufacturing 
PMI new export or
ders
 index which stood at mid
-2012 levels in October and has been in 
contractionary territory (below the no
-expansion 
threshold of 50) for thirteen months now.
 All in all, euro area exports are projected to grow 
by 2.4% in 2019, down from 3.3% in 2018 and 
5.5% in 2017. Growth is set to remain sluggish, 
with exports of goods and services increasing by 
only 2.1% next year, before ticking
-up slightly to 
2.3% in 2021. Exports are forecast to grow less 
than external demand directed at euro area goods 
and service
s, implying market share losses
 over the 
forecast horizon (see Graph 
I.2.16
). 
    Euro area imports of goods and services are 
projected to increase by 3.2% in 2019 before rising 
by 2.6% in 2020 and 2.7% in 2021. This partly 
reflects the expected slowing of investment 
growth, which has the highest import content of all 
demand 
components. With export growth 
weakening to a lower rate than that of imports, net 
trade is projected to act as a drag on growth this 
year (
-0.3 pps.) and to detract further in the next 
two years (
-0.1 pps.), with the growth rate of 
exports failing to catc
h up with that of imports.
 As in previous forecasts, projections are based on a 
purely technical assumption of status quo in terms 
of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK.
                                                                                    sharp slowdown in the growth of exports to China (from 
13.5% in 2017 to 1.8% in 2018).

  41 2.4. CURRENT ACCOUNT
 Euro area current account surplus to narrow as 
export 
growth weakens
 The current account surplus of the euro area 
stabilised at a historically high level of 3.8% of 
GDP in 2017 and 2018, but is expected to narrow 
to 3.3% in 2019 and further to 3.2% in 2020 and 
3.1% in 2021, the lowest since 2014.  Similarly, 
the adjusted current account 
(44) surplus is expected 
to ease from 3.1% of GDP in 2018 and 2017, to 
2.7%, 2.6% and 2.5% of GDP, in 2019, 2020 and 
2021, respectively. 
 This downward trend largely reflects the decline in 
the merchandise trade surplus (from 3.
0% in 2018 
gradually down to 2.7% in 2021), but also a lower 
surplus in services trade and a more negative joint 
balance of primary incomes and transfers. The 
surplus in services trade is expected to narrow in 
2019 (from 1.3% in 2018 to 1.1% 
(45)  in 2019) 
and 
remain roughly stable at 1.1% of GDP in 2020 and 
2021. Finally, the joint balance of primary incomes 
and current transfers is projected to worsen from 
-0.6% of GDP in 2018 to 
-0.7% in 2019 and 2020 
and 
-0.8% in 2021. 
 The declining surplus in trade in 
goods and 
services appears to be primarily a reflection of a 
protracted weakness in global manufacturing and 
trade that started in 2018, continued well into 2019 
and is set to remain a drag on euro area exports 
over the entire forecast horizon. The euro ar
ea has 
been hit particularly hard in 2018 and 2019 due to 
its high openness and intense participation in 
global value chains, but also the product 
specialisation and geographical orientation of its 
exports.  The euro area™s terms of trade are 
expected to i
mprove marginally in 2019 and 2020 
(by 0.1 and 0.3%, respectively) and remain 
unchanged in 2021, following sizable declines in 
2017 and 2018. 
 Viewed from the savings
-investment
-balance 
perspective, the narrowing of the current account 
surplus reflects the
 steady rise in the investment 
ratio combined with a relative stability in the 
                                                           (44) The adjusted current account and merchandise trade 
balance of the euro area and the EU take into account 
discrepancies betwee
n the sum of the trade balances of the 
Member States and the aggregate, which theoretically 
should not exist, but are usually observed due to reporting 
errors.
 (45) Largely reflecting a surge in services imports by Ireland 
(see 
Section I.2.3
) savings ratio. The euro area gross
-saving
-to-GDP 
ratio is set to remain largely unchanged in the 
forecast horizon, as an increase in private savings 
is expected to be offset by 
a steady decline in 
public savings. The trend in private savings is 
driven primarily by the jump in the household 
saving rate in 2019 and, to a smaller extent in 2020 
(see Section I.2.3), followed by some increase in 
corporations savings ratios in 2021. In
vestment
-to-GDP ratio is set to continue on a rising trend in the 
forecast horizon, driven by the steady increases in 
the private sector. 
 Germany and the Netherlands remain top 
contributors despite sizable declines in their 
surpluses
 While as many as
 11 Member States contributed to 
the euro area™s current account surplus in 2018, it 
is Germany and the Netherlands that accounted for 
more than three
-quarters of the euro area™s overall 
current account surplus (see Graph 
I.2.17
). Over 
the forecast horizon, their combined share is 
expected to go up slightly, despite a significant 
reduction in the current account surp
lus in both 
countries. At the same time the number of Member 
States with a surplus is expected to remain 
unchanged at 11 during the entire forecast horizon.
         The 
gradual decline in the euro area current 
account surplus reflects sharp reductions in its 
biggest contributors: Germany and the Netherlands 
(Graph 
I.2.18
). In Germany the current account 
surplus is expected to decline by 1.2 pps. of GDP 
between 2018 and 2021, reflecting the severe 
weakness in its export sectors due to its 
specialisation (machinery and equipment) and 
geographical orien
tation (large exposure to China). 
In the Netherlands, similar problems exacerbated 
by close links with the German market are set to

       2.5. LABOUR MARK
ET The labour market in the EU and the euro area has 
so far proved to be resilient to the slowdown in 
economic growth, with most labour market 
outcomes improving further over the last couple of 
months. However, as changes in the labour market 
situation usu
ally lag developments in economic 
activity, the potential for further increases in 
employment remains to be seen. This is of high 
importance for the outlook given the essential role 
played by employment in household disposable 
income and private consumptio
n. 
 Labour markets have continued to improve in 
2019, so far–
 The current economic recovery has been 
particularly favourable for EU labour markets in 
terms of the number of persons employed (see 
Graph 
I.2.19
). Now in its seventh year, it remains 
exceptionally strong in terms of employment 
creation. But this feature came as the counterpart 
to relatively weak labour productivity growth in a 
context of rather subdued GDP growth.
       The situation of the labour market in the euro area 
has improved further in terms of both the number 
of persons employed and the number of hours 
worked (Graph 
I.2.20
). The latest employment 
data releases for the euro area and the EU show a 
further 0.2% increase in the number of employed 
persons in th
e second quarter of 2019 compared 
with the first quarter of 2019. This is a 1.1% yearly 
increase in the euro area (+1.0% in the EU) with 
levels clearly above their pre
-crisis peak. 
      In terms of the number of hours worked though, 
the current level barely matches the levels 
recorded before the crisis. Between 2008 and 
2013, changes in the sectoral composition of 
employment and the increase in the share of part
-time 
workers in total employment have led to a 
sharper decline of total hours worked compared 
with total employment. During the economic 
recovery phase, the two aggregates rose in parallel 
suggesting a permanent shift in labour market 
structures during the down
turn from 2008 and until 
2013. This is reflected in the rather high and stable 
share of part
-time employment since 2013,

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  43 particularly for men (Graph 
I.2.21
) and may be one 
of the reasons for the sluggish wage growth until 
recently.
     The strong demand for labour during the current 
economic expansion has attracted newcomers in 
the labour market while at the same time lowering 
the unemployment rate. The increase in the labour 
force has been supported by rising participation 
rates for man
y years, leaving little room for labour 
supply to expand much further. The usual 
indicators of labour market slack have also been 
declining in recent years. Meanwhile the 
unemployment rate in the euro area and the EU has 
been declining continuously since 2
013. The latest 
available figures for August this year show an 
unemployment rate of 7.4% in the euro area (6.2% 
in the EU28). This compares with 8.0% in the euro 
area one year before (6.7% in the EU28) and is 
close to the lowest point of 7.3% reached early
 2008 in the euro area (in the EU28 unemployment 
is already below the lowest point of 6.8% reached 
early 2008). 
 The declining slack in labour markets combined 
with high vacancy rates and ongoing declines in 
unemployment rates provide evidence of a tighter
 labour market. This is reflected in the recent rise in 
wages, which are growing faster than inflation 
(+2.0% expected this year for the euro area, +2.8% 
in the EU) despite no productivity gains in the euro 
area (+0.4% in the EU). However, the situation 
varies significantly across countries and sectors. In 
some sectors and some countries (e.g. construction 
in Germany) there are skill shortages, while in 
other countries/sectors there is still a significant 
amount of slack. Wage developments therefore 
differ 
significantly between countries (see annex 
table 25). 
 –but survey indicators have moderated 
further– 
 The Commission™s survey data on employment 
expectations suggest a more significant easing of 
job creation with an increasing apparent 
divergence between 
manufacturing and services 
(Graph 
I.2.22
). Employment expectations in the 
manufacturing sector turned negative in June
 this 
year and have declined further since, with the 
latest September print matching the long
-term 
average (
-4.78). Meanwhile, employment 
expectations in services remain positive but have 
continued to slow down over the last couple of 
months. 
 The Commissi
on™s ‚limits to production™ survey 
indicator shows firms™ perceptions of labour 
constraints (Graph 
I.2.23
). The sectora
l discrepancy appears again with fewer and fewer 
manufacturing companies seeing labour as a 
limiting factor of activity (13% in 2019
-Q3 down 
from a peak of 17% last year). Conversely, 19.5% 
of firms operating in the services sector point to 
labour constrai
nts, close to the 20% peak reached

  44 last year, while firms in the construction sector 
continue to be impacted by labour shortages 
(around 20% of firms still see labour as a limiting 
factor for their activity). 
              –and suggest a further loss of momentum–
 The latest near
-term indicators suggest that the 
economy™s weakness has start
ed affecting labour 
markets. For the moment, the only indications of 
employment growth coming to a halt come from 
the manufacturing sector. Employment in the 
services sector is still on the rise and weighs 
significantly more in aggregate employment. The 
services sector is more labour intensive than the 
manufacturing sector and accounts for 73% of the 
euro area™s economy, compared with only 25% for 
the manufacturing sector. The productivity and 
importance of the manufacturing sector differs 
among countries b
ut overall, the services sector 
remains the main driver for labour markets.
    At the aggregate level, employment growth has 
always been closely linked with GDP growth 
(Graph 
I.2.24
). Employment growth tends to be 
smoother and lag economic growth by a few 
quarters as firms limit adjustment costs related to 
lay
-offs and new 
recruitment by adapting to 
changes in the economic environment in a prudent 
way and with a delay. The current situation is 
expected to be broadly similar but there are also 
reasons to expect some particularities. First of all, 
GDP is currently more labour 
intensive than in the 
past, as productivity growth has declined over 
time. This suggests that employment may only 
contract if the economic slowdown is more 
significant than in the past. Secondly, labour 
hoarding and working hour adjustments play an 
importa
nt role in the current context, as labour 
markets have turned particularly tight in some 
countries and sectors. In order to avoid future 
hiring difficulties, which would lower their 
productivity in the medium term, firms may react 
with forbearance to the c
urrent economic 
slowdown. As a corollary, firms accept 
temporarily lower productivity per employee and 
hence lower corporate margins. The impact of the 
economic slowdown on labour markets may 
therefore turn out to be smoother and slower than 
in previous sl
owdowns,
 as long as firms regard the 
weakness as temporary.
 During the first half of 2019, the pace of job 
creation moved in line with GDP growth. Due to 
the lag between developments in GDP and the 
labour market, the pace of job creation is projected 
to moderate in line with the lacklustre outlook. As 
a result, pro
ductivity is expected to pick
-up 
slightly in 2020 and 2021 after no productivity 
gains this year in the euro area due to strong labour 
market developments relative to a weaker output.

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  45 economic growth, differen
ces in the degree of 
labour markets slack across countries and 
divergent sectoral evolutions may also weigh on 
employment growth on the supply side. 
Bottlenecks and labour shortages are likely to 
persist in some sectors (e.g. construction) and/or 
countries
 and constrain the employment expansion.
 All in all, while employment growth has proved 
surprisingly resilient so far this year (+1.1% 
currently expected compared with +0.9% in 
spring), it is projected to weaken more than 
previously expected in 2020 and 20
21 (+0.5% in 
both years compared to +0.8% expected for 2020 
in the spring).  
 –but allowing still the unemployment rate to 
fall slightly in the euro area.
 Despite the projected slowdown, employment 
growth is expected to outpace the growth of the 
total labo
ur force. 
(46) This should allow 
unemployment rates to decline further, though 
only slightly. From 7.6% this year in the euro area, 
the unemployment rate is expected to edge down 
to 7.4% in 2020 and 7.3% in 2021 (6.3% in 2019 
and 6.2% in 2020 and 2021 in th
e EU). 
 Differences in unemployment levels persist across 
EU Member States (Graph 
I.2.25
), as EU countries 
have been recovering at different speeds since 
2008 and structural differences remain. But 
differences in unemployment rates 
have 
progressively narrowed over the last few years and 
are expected to narrow further over the forecast 
horizon. Unemployment rates are expected to fall 
in most euro area and EU countries. Increases over 
the next two years are projected only in a few 
coun
tries with already very low unemployment 
rates and where labour markets are particularly 
tight (Germany, the Netherlands and Estonia in the 
euro area, and the UK, Sweden, Czechia, and 
Romania in the rest of the EU). 
                                                            (46) While agei
ng contributes negatively to the population of 
working age, further increases in labour market 
participation rates and net immigration of workers should 
prevail and lead the total labour force to grow moderately 
(0.5% in 2019, 0.4% in 2020 and 0.3% in 2021
).     2.6. INFLATION
 Inflation in the euro area failed to pick up during 
the third quarter and has been on a downward 
trend so far in 2019, principally reflecting the fall 
in energy prices compared to last year. The eff
ects 
of robust wage growth, high employment levels 
and strong house price increases has failed to 
materialise in domestic inflationary pressures. 
There were strong movements within the major 
inflation subcomponents throughout the year but, 
in the third qua
rter, they were all below their long
-term averages since 2000s, signalling subdued 
inflationary pressures. As economic growth is not 
expected to rebound and external price pressures 
subside, no notable pick
-up in inflation is expected 
in the time covered b
y this forecast.
 Headline inflation fails to pick up–
 Headline inflation in the euro area, as measured by 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer prices (HICP), 
averaged 1.0% in the third quarter of 2019, slightly 
lower than forecast in summer and down from 
1.4% 
in the second quarter (see Graph
 I.2.26
). This 
sudden decline is mostly explained by energy 
inflation which turned strongly negative during 
that 
quarter. The notable decline in headline 
inflation, to 0.8% in September, was partially 
expected due to strong negative base effects in 
energy inflation, but it also reflected a sharp 
decline in unprocessed food inflation.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  46       –and core inflation remains flat and low–
 On the other hand, core inflation, which captures 
all items except energy and unprocessed food, 
continued to hover around 1.1% in the third 
quarter, basically the same average as
 in the first 
half of 2019, which is slightly lower than the 
average of 1.2% registered in 2018. The gap 
between subdued core inflation and vigorous wage 
growth remains wide. The expected pass
-through 
of higher wage growth to underlying price 
pressures has
 so far not materialised, including in 
those components which are more sensitive to 
domestic demand conditions especially the non
-tradable sector such as services. Annual growth in 
compensation per employee in the euro area 
remained robust and stood at 2.1
% in the second 
quarter, a slight decrease from the previous three 
quarters but the comparability is limited because it 
takes into account the downward adjustment in 
employers™ social security contributions in France 
early this year. Excluding the social s
ecurity 
contributions from total compensation, growth in 
wages and salaries per employee was stronger, at 
2.4% in the second quarter. 
 As for the main component of core inflation, 
services inflation picked up again in September, to 
1.5%, even if the averag
e of the third quarter 
(1.3%) was lower than in the previous one (1.5%). 
However, services inflation has been volatile in 
2019 mainly because of the seasonal pattern of 
package holidays, which represents just under 10% 
of the services basket. Also, the rec
ent 
methodological and reclassification exercise by 
Eurostat within the inflation subcategories, 
especially in the packaged holidays and 
accommodation component, may have accentuated 
the impact of seasonal movements and not just 
around the Easter period.
       –while the strong increase in house prices is 
showing up in rent.
 Within services, rent inflation (with a weight of 
around 15% in the services basket) has clear
ly 
picked up from 2018, especially over summer. In 
the third quarter it averaged 1.5%, up from an 
average of 1.2% in 2017 and 2018. The increase in 
rents followed a strong rise in euro area house 
prices. House prices have risen more than an 
annual rate of 
4% in every quarter since mid
-2016, 
reflecting partly the decline in household 
borrowing costs but also developments in asset 
prices during a period of low interest rates. 
Increases in house prices tend to shift demand 
towards renting due to declining affo
rdability 
while landlords try to pass on part of this increase 
to tenants by raising rental prices in order to 
maintain an attractive rental yield.
 The reported growth in house prices appears to be 
having an impact on this component of inflation, 
although 
with a rather long delay. While the two 
components generally co
-move, accelerating house 
prices may not necessarily lead to higher rent 
inflation due to several reasons including rent 
regulation and controls, some form of contractual 
indexation linked to a
 rate of inflation, low 
turnover in rental contracts, social housing, and 
financing conditions. For example, with declining 
asset returns in a low
-yield environment, landlords 
may accept a low
er rental
-yield as house prices 
increase. 
(47)   When looking across countries, it appears that the 
recent increase in rent inflation is mainly due to 
developments in France while most other euro area 
                                                           (47) European Central Bank (ECB) (2019

y-o-y %Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  47 countries have displayed a stable profile so far in 
2019. When it comes to rental developments, the 
picture within the euro area is very varied.  Rent 
inflation in the third quarter, for example, was 
5.5% in Ireland, over 2.5% in Austria and the 
Netherlands, but only 0.2% in Italy and 0% in 
Greece.
         The weakness in industry is spilling over to 
prices
 Non
-energy industrial goods and processed food 
inflation have been relatively stable and have 
moved within a 
narrow range in the first three 
quarters of 2019. The weakness in the 
manufacturing sector and the moderation in oil 
prices has limited upward pressures in annual non
-energy industrial goods inflation, which averaged 
0.3% in the third quarter. Industrial p
roducer price 
inflation in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.8% 
in August, strongly driven lower by energy prices, 
while the total index excluding energy was only 
0.5% higher compared to the same month last year. 
Only non
-durable consumer goods inflation 
rates 
showed some upward trend during the year, while 
capital goods and durable consumer goods 
- at 
1.5% and 1.4% in August, respectively 
- were 
relatively steady around their August rate during 
the year and above their average in 2018. 
Intermediate goods 
and especially energy producer 
inflation have declined strongly over the year and 
entered negative territory in the third quarter. 
Capacity utilisation and pricing intentions in the 
manufacturing sector across the euro area, as 
reported by corporate survey
 respondents, have 
continued to decline at a notable pace since the 
beginning of the year
 and may further reduce 
pipeline price pressures in the future.
       Prices in
 the tradable goods sector are also being 
depressed by a general slowdown in prices along 
global supply chains, especially in Asia and China 
in particular where producer prices fell by 1.2% in 
September. In the euro area, industrial import 
prices have fall
en even more strongly than 
industrial domestic output prices since the 
summer, standing at 
-2.5% in August. This was 
again driven by strong declines in energy and 
intermediate import prices but there was also a 
general weakening in import prices across all
 categories, despite the weakening of the euro™s 
nominal effective exchange rate in 2019.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  48 The forecast for inflation has been revised 
lower for longer –
 The near
-term inflation outlook is rather flat. In 
line with moderately declining oil price 
assumption
s, some positive base effects are 
expected in energy inflation early in 2020, 
followed by the opposite effect in the second 
quarter, and will impinge on the profile for 
headline inflation. The impact of oil prices on 
headline inflation is expected to taper
 off in the 
second half of next year as base effects fade and 
oil prices are assumed to remain relatively stable 
thereafter. On average, headline inflation in the 
euro area is forecast at 1.2% in both 2019 and 
2020, with a small increase to 1.3% in 2021, w
hen 
headline and core inflation are expected to be 
largely aligned. Compared to the summer, this 
represents a downward revision of 0.1 pps. for 
2019 and 2020. 
 Growth in compensation per employee in the euro 
area is expected to remain robust throughout the
 forecast horizon. It is projected to moderate at 
2.0% in 2019 
- from 2.2% in 2018 
- partially 
reflecting the above
-mentioned downward 
adjustment in employers™ social security 
contributions in France (CICE 
- Tax Credit for 
Competitiveness and Employment) w
hich should 
however not have an impact on the take
-home pay 
of households per se. The growth of compensation 
per employee is projected at 2.1% in 2020 and 
2.2% in 2021. The growth of real compensation 
per employee, after deducting for inflation, should 
rem
ain firmly positive until 2021.
 As a result of 
the robust increase in compensation per employee, 
unit labour cost growth in the euro area is expected 
to increase to 2.0% in 2019 but to moderate to 
1.4% in 2020 and 2021, which is still high relative 
to the 
average registered during the ten years after 
the financial crisis. The strong rise in unit labour 
costs in Germany (compared to its historical 
average) and in the services sector, where the pass
-through tends to be rather high as well as in 
countries with
 vigorous increases like the 
Netherlands and Austria, should contribute to 
eventually re
-assert the link between labour costs 
and inflation in the euro area
(48). Overall, the annual growth rate of the GDP 
deflator in the euro area is projected to rise from 
1.3% in 2018 to 1.5% in 2019 and to stay at this 
level in 2020 and 2021. This is in some contrast to 
                                                           (48) See E. Bobeica, M. Ciccarelli and I. Vansteenkiste (2019).

Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  49 they remained positive and above their average. 
Consumers™ perceptions of price trends over the 
past 12 mo
nths have remained positive but slightly 
less so than earlier this year. Euro area PMI indices 
for September showed price pressures falling 
further in the manufacturing sector while the 
assessment of average selling prices in services 
sectors suggested inf
lation at a slightly positive 
rate.
 The monthly mean of market forecasts calculated 
by Consensus Economics stood in October at 1.2% 
for both 2019 and 2020. The results of the ECB 
Survey of Professional Forecasters for the fourth 
quarter of 2019 showed aver
age inflation 
expectations at 1.2% in 2019 and 2020 (0.1 pps. 
lower than in the third quarter), and 1.4% in 2021 
(-0.1 pps.).  Longer
-term inflation expectations 
(for 2024) remained at 1.7%.
 Inflation differentials to narrow
 Aggregate HICP inflation rates 
continue to mask 
substantial differences across euro area Member 
States but these are expected to narrow in 2020 
and 2021 (Graph
 I.2.31
). 
    By the fourth quarter of 2021, only four euro area 
Member States are expected to experience inflation 
at or above 2%; mostly those small euro area 
countries 
which are growing strongly and still 
converging towards average price levels. With 
most countries projected to record inflation rates 
within a narrower range, the dispersion of inflation 
rates, as measured in terms of the unweighted 
standard deviation, is 
expected to decline further. 
Outside the euro area, inflation differentials are 
more pronounced; by the fourth quarter of 2021, 
headline inflation rates are projected to range from 
1.5% in Denmark to 3.3% in Romania.
 2.7. PUBLIC FINANCES
 In 2018, the aggre
gate public deficits of the EU 
and the euro area fell to their lowest levels since 
2000 and stood much lower than in the US and 
Japan (Graph
 I.2.32
). 
 In 2019, however, the aggregate deficits of the EU 
and the euro area are expected to increase slightly 
for the first time since 2010. Projections for 2020, 
which for euro area Member States take account of 
measures 
announced in their Draft Budgetary 
Plans, show a further marginal increase in the 
aggregate deficit. Based on unchanged policies, the 
deficit looks set to increase again in both areas in 
2021. Nevertheless, the aggregate debt
-to-GDP 
ratios of both areas ar
e projected to continue 
declining steadily over the forecast period.
          Lower revenues drive the projected increase in 
the euro area deficit
 Changes in the revenue an
d expenditure ratios are 
both expected to provide a negative contribution to 
the euro area budget balance in 2019 
(Graph
 I.2.33
), and the deficit is anticipated to rise 
to 0.8% of GDP. In 2020, below potential growth 
and somewhat loose discretionary fiscal policies in 
some Member States contribute to a marginal 
increase in the
 euro area deficit (by 0.1
 pps. of 
GDP) as the revenue ratio is set to continue 
decreasing, whereas the expenditure ratio remains 
stable. The no
-policy change forecast for 2021 
shows a more marked decline in the revenue ratio 
partially compensated by a low
er expenditure 
ratio, which implies a further increase (by 0.1
 pps.) 
in the euro area aggregate deficit. Overall, the 
projected fall in the revenue ratio is the dominant 
factor behind the expected increase in the

EUAutumn 2019 forecast
Euro area
Spring 2019 
forecast
Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  51 mainly thanks to the very accommodative 
monetary policy environment. 
         In terms of the quality of public spending, the 
aggregate public investment
-to-GDP ratio in the 
euro area is projected to increase from 2.7% in 
2018 to 2.9% in 2020
-2021, thanks also to the 
implementation of the 2014
-2020 programm
ing 
period of the EU™s structural and cohesion funds 
and to the Investment Plan for Europe. In 2020, 
however, the public investment
-to-GDP ratio is set 
to remain below its pre
-crisis (2000
-2005) average 
level in almost half the EU Member States (Graph 
I.2.37
). Sizeable gaps remain in six countries: the 
gap is about 2 pps. of GDP in Portugal and Spain; 
and 1.5 pps. in Cr
oatia, Greece, Cyprus, and 
Ireland.
          At the country level, budgetary developments in 
2020 are expected to be mixed (Graph 
I.2.38
). 
Among countries with a high deficit, the fiscal 
position is projected to worsen significantly further 
in Roma
nia, where the deficit is forecast to rise to 
4.4% of GDP (from 3.6% in 2019), mainly due to 
a deterioration in the structural primary balance 
(SPB) compared to 2019. Deficits
 are also set to 
increase in Italy and more significantly in 
Belgium, where reduc
tions in interest expenditure 
are expected to be more than offset by declines in 
the structural primary balance. The deficit is 
projected to narrow in France, as the sizeable 
negative impact of a specific one
-off measure 
affecting 2019 fades,
(51) and Spain.
 Hungary is 
expected to see a significant reduction in its deficit
 in 2020 due to a large increase in the structural 
primary balance, which outpaces the negative 
impact of the change in the cyclical component of 
the budget. 
          Among surplus countries, in 2020, significant 
declines in the budget balance are projected mostly 
due to expansionary fiscal policies
 in 
Denmark, 
Cyprus, the Netherlands, Luxemb
ourg and, to a 
lesser extent, Germany. 
 The debt ratio is set to decline further 
 The aggregate general government debt
-to-GDP 
ratio of the euro area has been on a declining path 
since 2014, when it reached a peak of 95.1% 
(88.7% in the EU).
(52) In 2018, th
e debt ratio fell to 
87.9% (81.9% in the EU) and is projected to fall 
further over the forecast period to reach 84.1% in 
2021 (78.4% in the EU), under a no
-policy
-change 
assumption. In the euro area, the deleveraging of 
the government sector is supported b
y the 
historically low interest rates paid on debt, which 
                                                           (51) The fall in social contributions in 2019 and in subsidies in 
2020
 is mainly related to the replacement of the CICE 
(credit d™impôt pour la compétitivité et l™emploi) with a cut 
in employers™ social contribution in France.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  52 combined with nominal GDP growth imply a debt
-decreasing snowball effect.
 (53)         In 2015
-2018, almost all Member
 States reduced 
their debt
-to-GDP ratio, with some countries 
recording substantial reductions (Ireland, Malta, 
the Netherlands and Germany). As GDP growth 
has eased recently, the expected pace of debt 
declines moderates somewhat. Nevertheless, 
further debt
 reductions are forecast in most 
countries by 2021. Ireland, Germany and Slovenia 
are projected to reduce their debt ratio below 60% 
of GDP (Graph 
I.2.39
). By contrast, among highly 
indebted countries, the debt
-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to increase in Italy also due to a debt
-increasing snowball effect and in France due to 
primary deficits. The debt
-to-GDP ratio is 
expect
ed to remain at or above 100% in four 
Member States in 2021 (Belgium, Greece, Italy, 
and Portugal) and above 90% in two others (Spain 
and France). 
 2.8. MACROECONOMIC P
OLICIES IN THE 
EURO AREA
 The policy mix in the euro area reflects the 
interplay between 
financing conditions and fiscal 
policy. Monetary conditions in the euro area 
remain very accommodative overall. Based on the 
customary technical assumptions,
 (54) short
-term 
                                                           (53) The snowball effect is the impact on the debt
-to-GDP ratio 
provided by the difference between nominal growth and 
the implicit interest rates paid on debt. Specifically, in the 
euro area, nominal GDP growth is projected to average 
2.7% over 2019
-2021 and thus surpass the average interest 
rate paid on 
debt, which is forecast at 1.8%. As a result, the 
snowball effect is expected to help reduce the debt ratio in 
the euro area aggregate by around 0.8 pps. of GDP per year 
on average over the forecast period.
 (54) The interest rate assumptions underlying the 
forecast are 
market
-based; nominal exchange rates are assumed to 
money market rates are set to decrease somewhat 
over the forecast horizon and shoul
d remain very 
supportive overall in both nominal and in real 
terms. As nominal long
-term yields are expected to 
increase only very gradually and inflation 
expectations for the longer term are above current 
inflation, real long
-term financing costs should 
remain clearly in negative territory. Moreover, the 
steady depreciation of the euro since mid
-2018 has 
had an additional easing effect. As regards the 
fiscal policy stance, as measured by the change in 
the structural budget balance, it is expected to stay 
broadly neutral over the forecast horizon under a 
no-policy
-change assumption. 
 Monetary conditions are expected to remain 
accommodative
 In the light of a slowdown in the euro area, a 
subdued inflation outlook and recent ECB 
decisions including renewed mont
hly asset 
purchases, upward pressure on nominal rates 
should be very limited over the forecast horizon. 
Thus, given the record low interest rates at present, 
financing conditions in the euro area are expected 
to remain very loose by historical standards. 
Nominal long
-term money market rates, which in 
tandem with weakening economic data and rising 
expectations of further ECB monetary stimulus 
have decreased significantly since the beginning of 
the year, are expected to pick up only modestly 
over the forecast
 horizon and remain even below 
their levels reached in July of this year. The restart 
of net asset purchases under the ECB™s Asset 
Purchase Programme, in combination with the 
continued reinvestment of maturing securities for 
an extended period of time afte
r net purchases 
cease, should help keep nominal long
-term rates 
very low, overall.
 (55) On the short end of the yield 
curve, the three
-month Euribor rate fell to a new 
historical low following the latest deposit facility 
rate cut in September. The high and 
growing 
volume of excess reserves, in combination with the 
ECB™s forward guidance, should keep short
-term 
                                                                                   remain constant with respect to a 
given 
base p
eriod. For 
details, see 
Box I.4.1.
 (55) Empirical evidence suggests that the portfolio rebalancing 
effect of asset purchases on 
bond market yields
 works 
predominantly via the size of the stock of purchased assets 
rather than the size of the monthly flows.

Santis, R. and F. Holm

 (56) and 
support favourable lending conditions further on. 
 Since the spring, short
-term rates have continued 
to 
increase in real terms. Amid fluctuations linked 
to weakening headline inflation (see Graph
 I.2.40
), 
they reached their highest level since the
 end of 
2016 in September.
 (57) Nonetheless, they remain in 
negative territory. By contrast, real long
-term 
interest rates, which have been slightly negative 
since mid
-2014, have decreased further since the 
beginning of the year. The decline was somewhat 
weaker than for their nominal counterpart, as lower 
long
-term inflation expectations partly offset the 
significant decrease in nominal long
-term rates. 
       Looking ahead, overnight rates are assumed 
to 
decrease slightly further over the course of the 
current and the coming year before starting to 
gradually increase thereafter, as suggested by 
EONIA forward rates. At the cut off date, market 
pricing suggested short
-term rates would be 20 
bps. lower by 
the end of 2020 compared to current 
spot rates and that the next rate increase would not 
happen until the end of 2022 and would likely be 
just 10
 bps. In light of the ECB Governing 
Council's modified forward guidance,
 (58) this 
                                                           (56) Indeed, in the unsecured money market, 
short
-term rates
 ha
ve
 continued to trade 
close to
 the ECB™s deposit facility 
rate
. The reference point is always the last forecast, so 
since spring they have continued to trade closely to the 
DFR. Overall, they trade closely to the DFR since the 
beginning of 2015, 
when
 the APP led to a significa
nt 
increase in excess reserves.
 (57) Real ra
tes are derived from the respective short
- or long
-term rate minus annual HICP inflation and expected 
average inflation according to 10
-year inflation swaps, 
respectively. Forecasts are derived from futures and 
forward rates, deflated by the 
Commission's 
inflation 
forecast
 and market
-based measures of inflation
 expectations
. (58) According to its modified rate forward guidance, the ECB 
Governing Council 
expect
s the key ECB interest rates to 
suggests that market participants do not expect a 
robust convergence of inflation to the ECB™s 
medium
-term objective over the forecast horizon. 
As inflation is forecast to increase very mildly, this 
should lead to steadily decreasing real short
-term 
intere
st rates over the forecast horizon. At the 
same time, forward rates suggest a slight but 
gradual rise in nominal long
-term rates. With 
markets anticipating long
-term inflation to increase 
at a somewhat slower pace, this should also 
translate into marginall
y higher, but still clearly 
negative, real long
-term rates. 
 The decrease in nominal long
-term rates since the 
beginning of the year has also translated into lower 
borrowing costs for non
-financial corporations and 
households, which both fell to new histor
ical lows 
in August after a period of fluctuations but no clear 
direction since the end of 2016. The observed 
decline in corporate financing costs mainly 
reflected lower rates on long
-term loans and 
decreasing corporate bond yields, whereas lower 
interest 
on housing loans was the main driver for 
households (see Graph
 I.2.41
). (59)        The euro area fiscal stance is set to remain 
broadly neutral in 2019 and 2020 
 The euro area fiscal stance is set to remain broadly

it ha
s seen the 
inflat
ion outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently 
close to, but below, 2% within 
the ECB™s

reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.

%European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  54 incorporating the fiscal policies announced by euro 
area Member States in their Draft Budgetary Plans, 
the euro area fiscal stance is forecast to stay 
broadly neutral, as the structural balance is set to 
decline by around 0.
2 % of GDP (Graph 
I.2.42
). 
The change in the structural primary balance, 
which is not affected by ongoing savings in 
interest expenditure, points to a slightly 
expansionary fiscal stance in both 2019 and 2020.
       Looking at structural balance developments in 
large 
euro area countries in 2019 and 2020 (Graph 
I.2.43
), fiscal policies are projected to lead to a 
broadly neutral fiscal stance in Spain and France in 
both years. In Italy, the fiscal stance is expected to 
become slightly expansionary in 2020, after being 
broadly neutral in 2019. As for countries with 
fiscal space, Germany is projected to implement 
mild
ly expansionary fiscal policies in 2019 and 
2020, while the Netherlands is expected to use a 
larger part of its fiscal space in 2020.
            Looking at the policy mix (see Graph
 I.2.44), the 
policy measures taken by the ECB since the end of 
2014 have exerted significant downward pressure 
on nominal long
-term interest rates. However, 
monetary easing has only been partially 
transmitted to real ra
tes. This is because long
-term 
inflation expectations also declined over the same 
period and only started to pick up towards the end 
of 2016 before declining again substantially after 
mid
-2018. Average real long
-term rates for 2019 
(derived from the 10
-yea
r swap rate deflated by 
inflation expectations) are expected to be markedly 
lower than in the previous year. Given their 
considerable decrease over the course of 2019, 
long
-term rates for 2020 are expected to be on 
average even lower despite the expected g
radual 
increase over the year. Thus, financing conditions 
should remain very supportive overall. At the same 
time, as illustrated by the change in the structural 
balance, the fiscal policy stance is set to remain 
broadly neutral in 2020.
        2.9. RISKS
 The EU economy is facing an elevated level of 
uncertainty, including with respect to trade policy
 and other economic policies
. The downside risks 
surrounding the central scenario remain 
characterised by a high degree of 
interconnectedness, which could magnify their 
impact on the economy. Several of these risks 
might materialise in the near term. Looking further 
ahead, risks might be more relevant in
 the next 
than in the outer forecast year. Overall, risks to the 
growth outlook are skewed to the downside over 
the full forecast horizon.

  55 Elevated uncertainty could weigh more 
heavily on economic growth
 Uncertainties have been a major topic in recent 
year
s, but by contrast to earlier expectations in 
previous forecasts, uncertainty has not diminished. 
Up to the autumn, trade policy
-related uncertainty 
has even increased against the background of 
newly discussed, announced or partly introduced 
measures. A fu
rther increase in trade policy 
uncertainty, and concerns that new tariffs might be 
applied on a much wider range of items, could 
adversely affect business investment plans 
in 
Europe
 and lead to a worse outcome than included 
in the central scenario.
 Many of
 the downside risks are found on the 
external side...
 Although the EU economy is already affected by 
an increased number of external headwinds, there 
is a meaningful number of substantial risks that 
have not yet materialised but could darken the 
economic o
utlook or even derail the continuation 
of the economic expansion
 in the EU
. A further escalation of US
-China trade tensions.
 As regards rising protectionism and the retreat 
from multilateralism, the central scenario of the 
forecast assumes that a further e
scalation will be 
avoided. But tariffs in place so far may only be the 
tip of the iceberg relative to those under review or 
threatened (including non
-tariff trade barriers). 
Further escalation of trade tensions could have 
much worse effects and could inten
sify a process 
of ﬁde
-globalisationﬂ more than currently 
envisaged. A further increase in impediments to 
global trade could have a stagflationary impact on 
the global economy. The inflationary impact on 
consumer goods would hurt the purchasing power 
of hou
seholds, dent consumer confidence and 
weaken private consumption dynamics, which 
would dampen economic activity. Higher prices of, 
and other barriers to, imported inputs and final 
goods, could slow the diffusion of technologies, 
and reduce economic activit
y via their impact on 
global value chains. Moreover, an escalation of 
trade tensions could also be expected to impact 
strongly on financial markets (increased volatility, 
falling asset prices), which could then trigger 
wider distortions. 
 Higher or additio
nal US tariffs on car imports
 constitute a downside risk to the forecast. 
(60) By 
investigating the impact of the import of cars and 
car parts from Europe and Japan on national 
security grounds, the US has prepared the basis for 
possibly introducing tariffs
 on this sector. A 
number of studies have provided estimates of the 
impact on exporting countries and emphasised that 
the indirect exposure to US tariffs through global 
value chains could be greater than the impact from 
directly affected car exports for ma
ny Member

the transition towards a more services and

 Climate change
 is expected to matter most beyond 
the forecast horizon, but this does not ex
clude the 
occurrence of devastating effects already in the 
forecast years both in the EU but also globally. 
Unusually bad weather conditions could directly 
impact on agricultural output and commodity 
prices, but also distort production chains and 
impact th
ereby negatively on economic growth. 
This could trigger cascading effects in the financial 
system by affecting financial assets and the 
liabilities of financial institutions. In the absence of 
appropriate policies, risks related to climate 
change would inc
rease.
(64)  ...but there are also downside risks on the 
domestic side...
 On the domestic side, risks relate 
for example 
to 
political uncertainty, a stronger spillover from the 
manufacturing weakness to other sectors, financial 
market adjustments and possibl
e negative side 
effects of monetary policy.
 Spillovers from the manufacturing weakness.
 The 
central scenario might include a too benign view 
on the negative spillovers from the manufacturing 
recession in several economies to other sectors 
such as services.
 Stronger

spillovers could raise unemployment fears of 
consumers, lower their confidence, weaken private 
consumption and result in a worse growth outcome 
than currently expected. Were expectations about 
the future economic growth pat

disappoint for longer, these would eventually have 
a material impact on macroeconomic outcomes.

 (66)  Abrupt financial market adjustments
 could result 
in turmoil that impact negatively on the real 
economy. There are several potential triggers for 
such developments. For example, 
changes in the 
expectations underlying recent developments in 
bond and equity prices could lead to investor risk 
aversion with significant spillovers in terms of 
capital flows, financial market stability and 
financial conditions. Such change in risk attitu
des 
could also be caused by political developments 
that lead to the re
-emergence of sovereign risk 
concerns by investors with spillovers to vulnerable 
economies. This could widen cross
-country growth 
differences and lead to unsustainable imbalances.
 A ‚dis

 would lead to a more 
disruptive impact on the UK
-EU trade relationship 
and on economic activity in the EU and the UK 
than currently envisaged under the purely technical 
assumption of status quo in terms of trading 
relations between the EU27
 and the UK. 
 ...which meet a number of less prominent 
upside risks...
 Some of the downside risks are mirrored by upside 
risks. On the external side, trade tensions could be 
resolved faster than assumed, which would push 
confidence higher and could result 
in a faster and 
stronger rebound of foreign trade
, which would 
improve
 the growth outlook for the EU
 as an open 
and strongly integrated economy. Chinese 
economic growth could surprise on the upside, for 
instance in response to easing measures that are 
not 
included in the central scenario of this forecast. 
Similarly, the fiscal policy stance
 in the euro area
 might turn out more expansionary than currently 
expected. Moreover, geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East could diminish, which would remove 
upward p
ressures on the oil price, strengthening 
the purchasing power of consumers, lowering 
input costs of non
-oil companies, and supporting 
economic activity.

 Economic outlook for the euro area and the EU
  57 –which implies that risks to economic growth 
are tilted to the downside.
 Gauging the central scenario o
f the autumn 
forecast against the background of the 
aforementioned upside and downside risks, two 
results from previous forecasts are confirmed: the 
dominance of downside risks to growth and the 
relatively wide band of possible outcomes 
surrounding the cen
tral scenario. This is visualised 
in the fan chart (Graph 
I.2.45
), which shows the 
uncertainty around the central scenario for euro 
area 
GDP growth with different confidence 
intervals.
       The very high degree of uncertainty of the central 
projection is reflected by the large width of the f
an 
chart, most notably in 2021. The depicted skew of 
the distributions of the forecasts illustrates the 
balance of risks of the forecasts, which is seen on 
the downside.
 Risks to the inflation outlook are broadly 
neutral
 With a key role in the autumn forec
ast played by 
technical assumptions on exchange rates, oil 
prices, and tariffs on exports and imports, any 
deviation from their assumed paths have the 
potential to cause substantial deviations from the 
inflation forecast for the EU and the euro area. 
Such 
risks are two
-sided. Other risks are aligned 
with the risks surrounding the growth outlook (e.g. 
Brexit), which have been assessed as being tilted 
to the downside and constitute therefore mainly 
downside risks to the inflation forecast. Further 
supply shoc
ks from disruptions of international 
trade would however tend to push prices higher. 
Finally, there is the risk of a further substantial 
decline of longer
-term inflation expectations 
(ﬁde
-anchoringﬂ) in response to a protracted period 
of very low inflation
 with the possibility of 
self
-perpetuating dynamics.

3. SPECIAL ISSUES
   59 3.1. GLOBAL VALUE CH
AINS AND 
PROTECTIONISM
 A surge in protectionism has contributed to the 
slowdown in world trade growth since 2017 but it 
is arguably the high level and persistence of
 uncertainty surrounding trade policies that has had 
the biggest effect. 
(67) Uncertainty also has had a 
great impact on global value chains (GVCs) and 
thrown their continued viability into question. 
 World trade expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 
2000s befo
re slowing after the financial crisis. The 
expansion of GVCs has been a key driver of global 
trade flows since the 1990s, while the recent 
retrenchment in GVCs is often identified as one of 
the key factors behind the recent trade slowdown. 
This section she
ds light on the factors driving the 
medium
-term trends in GVCs, including in the 
period just after the financial crisis. It then looks at 
the current escalation in trade tensions and 
increases in tariffs to investigate the channels of 
impact and takes stoc
k of existing literature on the 
topic.  
 Global value chains in a medium
-term 
perspective
 Global value chains developed rapidly in the two 
decades up to the financial crisis of 2008
-2009, 
thriving on unprecedented waves of trade 
liberalisation as well as f
alling transport, 
transaction and telecommunication costs. 
Corporations took advantage of these positive 
supply shocks to fragment the production process 
in order to exploit cross
-country differences in 
factor costs, such as labour, capital and raw 
materia
ls and benefit from economies of scale. 
Complex value chains were thus formed that 
involved all stages of the production process 
needed to bring a final good to the consumer, 
including the conception of a product, its design, 
production, marketing and logi
stics. An 
international value chain can involve several firms 
                                                           (67) See fo

 or a single firm that is spread over different 
geographical locations. 
(68) Firms can either 
outsource or offshore specific tasks or decide to 
specialise in a specific task and join an existing 
global value chain. The gradual expansion of 
GVCs over the last three decades has led to a 
profound reshaping of the international division of 
production, labour and trade.
 GVCs expanded rapidly in the two decades 
up to the financial crisis 
 The most compre
hensive indicators that capture 
the degree to which countries are integrated in 
GVCs are indicators of backward (or downstream) 
and forward (or upstream) participation in GVCs 
based on international input
-output tables. 
Backward participation is defined as
 a share of 
foreign value added in a country™s gross exports, 
while forward participation is a measure of 
domestic value added embedded in other 
countries™ exports, as a share of the gross exports 
of the reporting country.

  60 in 2017 and 2018. While indices of participation of 
various regions tend to move rather closely 
together, reflecting the cross
-country 
fragmentation of production, their levels differ 
significantly across countries and regions, and 
these differenc
es persist over time.
 The relative position of the EU/EA has been 
consistently very strong in terms of backward 
participation but visibly weaker in terms of 
forward participation. The position of the United 
States, for example is significantly more upstrea
m, 
mainly thanks to high shares of activity in sectors 
such as natural resources, research and 
development (R&D) and financial services, which 
provide intermediate inputs to the production 
chain. 
(71) Trends in GVC participation in China 
and Japan appear to
 be reverse images of each 
other. China has shifted gradually towards 
providing intermediate inputs to other countries™ 
exports (forward participation) amid a gradual 
decline in Japan™s respective participation rates. 
This suggests that China has been repl
acing Japan 
as the key trade hub in Asia.

 provides more insights into cross
-country differences in terms of participation in 
GVCs. The chart points to very high backward 
participation in GVCs of several smaller
 euro area 
Member States, such as Luxembourg, Malta, 
Ireland and Belgium; Central and Eastern Europe 
(Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary) as well as Korea and 
South
-East Asia (Vietnam, Malaysia and 
Thailand). This clearly reflects the high degree of 
integration of
 these countries in downstream 
regional (European) and global value chains. On 
the other hand, commodity exporters (Saudi 
Arabia, Australia, Norway and Russia) and 
countries with high levels of R&D (Japan, United 
States) rank high in terms of forward parti
cipation, 
reflecting their upstream position in the supply 
chain. 
(72)                                                            (72) It is important to note that traditional GVC participation 
indices capture only the flows of goods that cross borders 
at least twice. They therefore do
 not capture, for example, 
traded intermediates that are used in domestic production 
for final consumption. Consequently, they tend to 
underestimate the GVC participation of those economies 
whose exports of intermediate goods are largely for the 
final use 
in a destination country. Another limitation is that 
they only take into account the flows related to intellectual 
property rights between a firm and its foreign affiliates, 
which are recorded as trade; and exclude those flows which 
are recorded as primary
 income flows. As a result, the 
index can underestimate the participation of countries 
where the parent companies are located

  61        However, traditional GVC indicators based on 
shares of current
-price trade flows in current
-pric
e gross exports have serious shortcomings. They are 
only available with a long lag 
(73) and are sensitive 
to business cycles and commodity price 
fluctuations. To remedy this, Haugh et al. 
(2016)
(74), Borin and Mancini (2017) 
(75) and 
Gaulier et al. (2019) 
(76) developed indicators that 
offer an analogous insight into the process of 
fragmentation of production (based on 
intermediate goods trade) but have been corrected 
for the impact of these two distorting effects. The 
indicator developed by Haugh et al (2016) 
proxies 
GVC participation with the ratio of intermediate 
goods imports to final domestic demand. At the 
global level, this indicator does not suggest any 
retrenchment in GVC during the 2008/2009 crisis 
(Graph 
I.3.4
), but points to a decline from 2013 to 
2016, followed by a gradual rebound in 2017 and 
2018. Overall, this indicator suggests that the GVC 
intensity of the global economy in 2018 was only 
slightly bel
ow its 2011
-2012 peak. Moreover, in 
OECD countries, GVC trade does not show, on 
average, any signs of retrenchment, even between 
2013-2016. In fact, GVC trade continues to rise in 
2017 and 2018, indicating that GVCs recorded a 
new historical peak in 2018.

.     Likewise, the analysis by Gaulier et al (2019) 
suggests that it may be premature to talk about the 
unwinding of global value chains, at least until 
2016 (last data point in the analysis). Gaul
ier et al 
(2019) show that the volume of intermediate goods 
trade, 
(77) and in particular that of parts and 
components (typically associated with the 
expansion in GVCs), have actually been on the rise 
since the crisis, reaching an all
-time high in 2016 
(las
t available data). 
 What drives GVCs in the medium term?
 While the evidence on recent developments in 
GVCs
 appears mixed, there are increasing signs 
that some of the key impulses behind the earlier 
expansion of global value chains may now be 
largely exhaus
ted, and that some new medium
-term trends would be at play. These largely 
structural factors appear to have been driving the 
dynamics of GVCs in recent years and are set to 
remain important in the near future. 
  Automation could favour nearshoring
. In the 
past, advances in Information and 
Communication (ICT) technology have 
strongly supported the unbundling of tasks and 
the rapid development of GVCs, by reducing 
the costs of fragmenting production processes 
across tasks and locations 
(78). Looking 
forward, ne
w ICT technologies such as block 
chain, the internet of things and e
-commerce 
are bound to contribute to the further decline in 
transaction and coordination costs. However, at

  62 the same time, the technological revolution also 
creates scope for the automatio
n of production 
tasks and hence reduces incentives for 
outsourcing and offshoring them to locations 
with lower labour costs. Therefore, with new 
technologies, the advantage of proximity to 
consumers may start to dominate labour cost 
considerations and thus
 favour nearshoring and 
further regionalisation (rather than 
globalisation) of trade. 
(79)  Maturing domestic supply chains reduce GVC 
trade
. The expansion of global value chains 
facilitated the access of emerging economies to  
global production processes by
 allowing them 
to participate in specific parts, without the need 
to build comprehensive supply chains on their 
own. 
(80) Maturing industrial structures and 
strengthening domestic demand have gradually 
created room for the development of more 
comprehensive 
domestic
 supply chains, 
especially in larger emerging market 
economies. Reflecting these processes, GVC 
participation indices for India, China and as 
well as most other big emerging markets, have 
been declining since the financial crisis, 
following a rapid
 expansion in the two 
preceding decades (see Graph 
I.3.5
). This 
process weighs on regional and global value 
chains trade and is set to dampen the expansion 
in GVCs 
in the medium term.
            The slower pace of trade liberalisation
 has 
often been cited as one of the key factors

 behind the post
-crisis unwinding in GVCs. 
Their robust expansion in t
he two decades prior 
to the financial crisis was clearly underpinned 
by the rapid pace of liberalisation, which 
included milestones such as the creation of the 
WTO, China™s accession to the organisation 
and several waves of EU enlargement. The 
result was a
 sharp reduction in average applied 
tariffs from 9% in the early 1990s to 3% in 
2006 (see Graph 
I.3.6
), or from around 40% to 
10% in the case of tarif
fs applied by emerging 
markets. However, since then, very little 
progress has been made and average tariffs 
have edged down only marginally in the last 
decade. This may reflect higher political and 
social costs attached to further tariff reduction 
and the 
ensuing shifts towards protectionism. 
Moreover, new non
-tariff measures have been 
put in place in recent years. The WTO 
secretariat reports that the stock of trade
-restrictive measures increased nearly fivefold 
between 2010 and 2017 despite a commitment 
by G-20 members to resist protectionism. From 
a European perspective, the 2018 Trade and 
Investment Barrier Report confirms that 
additional barriers to trade which negatively 
affect European firms have been on the rise. It 
is therefore clear that the trade p
olicy 
environment had become significantly less 
conducive to GVCs even before the most 
recent protectionist shifts by the US. Moreover, 
local content requirements and other regulatory 
measures have increasingly become headwinds 
to GVC expansion. These new 
barriers are 
often more subtle than previous tariff and non
-tariff measures and are aimed at reducing 
imports by, for example, tailoring licence 
requirements in such a way as to promote 
domestic purchases, or provide tax incentives 
for local procurement.

  63      Other factors have played a role as well
. Following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in 
Japan and disastrous floods in Thailand, which 
both led to supply
-side disruptions in 
many 
sectors, a number of companies decided to 
contain their supply risks by reducing the 
length of their supply chains, 
(82) in turn 
dampening GVC participation. 
 Implications of the recent rise in protectionism 
on global value chains
 While some evidence s
uggests that global value 
chains bottomed out already before the current 
bout of protectionism, there is no doubt that the 
ongoing escalation of trade tensions between the 
US and China will weigh further on their near
-term 
prospects. Several empirical stud
ies look at the 
impact of new tariffs and trade policy uncertainty 
on trade flows and the expansion of GVCs. While 
some of the conventional studies indicate already 
high costs of protectionism at the global level and 
in specific countries, adding the compl
ex GVC 
linkages amplifies this cost considerably. 
 Global value chains amplify the cost of tariff 
hikes–. 
 Traditional trade analysis looks at countries trading 
final goods
 in which they have a comparative 
advantage. The development of global value 
chains complicates this picture, shifting the focus 
towards a production process organised around 
specific 
tasks
 in which firms/countries have a 
comparative advantage. 
(83) Fragmen
tation of the 
production process has been most profound in 
manufacturing and sectors that have higher R&D 
                                                           (82) De Backer

.  intensities. 
(84) In global value chains, components 
cross borders several times before they are 
assembled into a final good and sold to a 
consumer. As
 a result, every time a good or service 
crosses a border it may be subject to trade
-restrictive measures. 
 As such, industries/countries, which rely to a 
higher extent on imported inputs further 
downstream, may face a higher cumulative tariff. 
A study of M
ao and Görg (2019) 
(85) shows that 
tariff hikes in the context of the US
-China trade 
confrontation, levies an additional burden via these 
indirect effects of between $500 million and $1 
trillion on the US™ closest trade partners, namely 
the EU, Canada and M
exico. Likewise simulations 
by the IMF 
(86) show that closer integration has 
increased the sensitivity of upstream and 
downstream tariff changes. Therefore, a 1pp. tariff 
increase by all countries would have a larger 
negative effect today than it would have
 two 
decades ago. Naturally, losses in countries that are 
highly integrated in GVCs would likely be much 
higher. 
 The effect is amplified because when imposing 
higher tariffs on imports from a targeted country, a 
country imposes them also partially on thei
r own 
exports (via domestic value added contained in 
imports) and exports of all other countries further 
downstream or upstream in the supply chain. 
Therefore, theoretically, the incentive to impose 
tariffs should decrease when the domestic value 
added of 
imported goods increases and the foreign 
value added increases in domestic final goods. 
(87) Fontagné and Bellora (2019) 
(88) provide evidence 
from the general equilibrium model that tariff 
hikes not only hurt the targeted country but also 
countries linked via global value chains, including 
the country imposing tariffs itself. Specifically, in 
the case of the US
-China trade conf
rontation, this 
means that the negative impact on the US and 
China is reinforced by the linkages via 
                                                           (84) OECD, WTO, World Bank Group, IDE

  64 intermediate trade. Thus, even for the country 
imposing tariffs, the trade war comes at a cost. 
One can therefore interpret the decision of China 
to exempt
 certain sectors (aircrafts, semi
-conductors and pharmaceuticals) from additional 
levies, as a way of minimising the additional cost 
of the trade war. 
(89) More specficially, a study by the IMF 
(90) finds that 
in the case of a hypothetical 25% tariff on impo
rts 
of cars and car parts, about a half of the impact 
would be transmitted directly towards the affected 
countries, but another half would be propagated 
via supply chains. A study by the ECB 
(91) on the 
impact of car tariffs by the US, indicates that 
taking
 into account the complex GVC linkages 
would add around 50% to the negative welfare 
effect for Germany and Italy, and around a third of 
the negative impact on the euro area, on average. 
 ...and affect business decisions.
 Global value chains not only alter 
the distribution 
costs related to protectionism, they also influence 
the sourcing and investment decisions of firms 
(92). Production networks as we know them today are 
the result of firms optimising their business plans 
taking into account all the relevant 
factors 
including trade barriers but also geopolitical 
tensions. Trade barriers enter these business 
decisions as an extra cost variable. In the short run, 
it will increase the cost of imports for producers 
and consumers and induce firms to diversify trade
 and to postpone new investments.

.    structural ones. As such, firms could be forced to 
shorten, reshape or diversify global supply chains 
to mitigate risks. Ultimately, this could imply a 
less efficient global allocation of resource
s, less 
technology diffusion and lower productivity 
growth. The degree to which global value chains 
will be reshaped or shortened will depend on 
several factors such as the type of the trade
-restrictive barrier, the complexity and governance 
of the global 
value chain, and the costs associated 
with disruption (as value chains tend to be 
inflexible due to the associated costs of building 
them 
(95)). Trade diversification becomes more 
complex if the degree of specialisation is higher, as 
in the semi
-conductor i
ndustry, for example. 
However, if the cost of a disruption in a supply 
chain is high (e.g. an outright ban on importing 
essential components), it could become efficient 
for even highly complex value chains and/or 
vertically integrated firms to reshape or s
horten 
their existing value chains. Additionally, trade 
policy uncertainty and protectionism will also 
affect the future development of value chains and 
investment decisions, as they add another complex 
layer of risks to future decisions. Higher trade and 
transportation costs favour nearshoring and more 
regional supply
-chains. 
(96) Given the depth of regional trade integration in 
Asia, the recent tariff hikes between the US and 
China expose the broader Asia region to negative 
economic impacts via its trade c
hannels. However, 
opportunities for trade diversion in the form of 
reshaping value chains could arise for certain 
countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Exports 
from Vietnam to the US have surged in 2019. 
However, this could be due to the relabelling of 
goods that originated in China to avoid tariffs, or 
could represent trade diversion that is only 
temporary. Moreover, it is not possible to assess 
whether FDI has been diverted to these countries 
on the basis of the FDI data currently available. As 
such, i
t is too soon to indicate if global value 
chains are reshaping or shortening permanently but 
anecdotal evidence suggests that the trade 
confrontation has affected the foreign investment 
decisions of companies.

 Economic outlook for the euro area and 
the EU
  65 Conclusion
 Global value chains have become a
 symbol of 
globalisation. They thrived for more than two 
decades in the run
-up to the financial crisis 
supported by rising trade openness, lower tariffs 
and declining transportation and 
telecommunication costs. There is more evidence 
that this process has 
stagnated after the crisis and 
is likely to go into reverse in the near term. 
 The presence of global value chains amplifies the 
immediate negative impact of recent tariff hikes on 
the global economy by propagating their negative 
supply shocks down the sup
ply chain. Moroever, 
the recent shift to protectionism and trade policy 
uncertainty has clearly pushed the global economy 
in the direction of less interdependence and 
integration. Additionally, given some medium
-term trends (such as automation and maturing
 domestic supply chains), a further slowing or 
possible reversal of GVC trade appears likely in 
the near future.
 3.2. WHAT IS BEHIND 
THE SLOWDOWN? A 
MODEL
-BASED ANALYSIS
 OF GROWTH 
DRIVERS
 Real GDP of the euro area is forecast to grow at 
1.1% in 2019 and 1.
2% in 2020, which is 0.2 pps. 
below the potential growth estimate in both years, 
and constitutes a pronounced slowdown compared 
to the annual average growth of 2.1% in 2016
-18. The forecasts for the individual Member States 
reveal marked differences and si
gnal an 
asymmetric reaction to external developments. 
Looking at the two largest euro area Member 
States, real GDP growth in Germany is forecast to 
slow down to 0.4% in 2019 and to be at 1.0% in 
2020, below its long
-run trend and after an average 
annual gr
owth rate of 2.1% in 2016
-18. The 
French economy, by contrast, is forecast to grow at 
1.3% annually in 2019 and 2020, which is close to 
its long
-run trend growth. 
 This special topic discusses the main growth 
drivers of the euro area in both 2019 and 2020 
through the lens of a structural model. The 
structural model decomposes macroeconomic 
dynamics based on a rich information set. In 
particular, the model identifies the driving forces 
of the forecast on the basis of restrictions imposed 
by structural equati
ons, i.e. by economic theory, 
across variables and over time. The sign and size 
of the different demand and supply shocks
 (97) depends on their ability to fit not only GDP, but 
also other observables, such as economy
-wide 
consumption, investment, trade, and
 employment. 
The special topic also includes a
 discussion of the 
forecasts for Germany and France to illustrate the 
heterogeneity across countries implied by 
particular drivers of growth. 
 The analysis builds on the Global Multi
-Country 
model, which is a m
acroeconomic model in the 
New
-Keynesian tradition.
 (98) The analysis uses a 
configuration with two regions, the euro area and 
the rest of the world (RoW) for the euro area 
forecast; and a three
-region set
-up (individual 
Member State, rest of the euro area, 
RoW) for the 
identification of growth drivers in Germany and 
France, thus providing further granularity. Once 
the model has been estimated using historical data 
from 1999
-Q1 to 2019
-Q2, the time series are 
extended by the European Commission™s Autumn 
2019 forecast for the set of available variables. The 
estimated model then recovers the shocks that are 
necessary to fit the forecast given the estimated 
model parameters and the historical data.

  66 contributions matches the data (solid blue line) for 
any point in time and the
 forecast (dashed line) for 
2019-20.      From the perspective of the estimated model, the 
deceleration of euro area GDP growth in 2019 is 
explained predominantly by declining export 
demand (Graph 
I.3.7
). This group of shocks 
(100) alone (dark blue bar) would signal a 2.1 pps. 
decline in GDP growth in 2019 compared to 2018. 
The decline in exports is led by a slowdown in 
world import demand (excluding e
uro area), which 
is forecast to continue weighing negatively on euro 
area exports over 2019
-2020, although more so in 
the current year. The slowdown in world import 
demand is stronger than suggested by the 
slowdown in global activity alone. It affects not 
only euro area exports, but also feeds through to 
employment and consumption growth (see below). 
 The negative impact of external demand on growth 
in 2019 is estimated to be partly attenuated by 
lower oil prices (light blue bar). Domestic demand 
and financ
ial market shocks 
(101) (grey bar) also 
play a positive role in 2019, which is associated 
notably with still robust investment growth (in the 
euro area as a whole) in 2019 and a depreciation of 
the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro in 
line with the
 forecast's external assumptions. 
Domestic labour and goods market ("supply
-side") 
factors (red bar) contribute on the upside in 2019 
and 2020. These are shaped by positive labour 
supply shocks consistent with a decline in the 
NAWRU and a sluggish response
 of labour 
                                                           (100) The
 group "external demand" summarises shocks to 
foreign demand and shocks to the trade equations, where 
the latter affect trade volumes and prices for given levels o
f foreign demand. Together, these shocks affect euro area 
(net) exports.

rate shocks. 
 demand (i.e. stabilisation of labour income) to the 
slowdown in growth ("labour hoarding"), lifting 
GDP growth in 2019
-20. With euro area growth failing to rebound swiftly, 
the labour market outlook is less bright compared 
to the recent past. Em
ployment growth is projected 
to decelerate, from 1.5% on average in 2016
-2018 
to 1.1% in 2019 and 0.5% in 2020. Lower external 
demand translates into declining GDP growth, 
which requires less labour input (Graph 
I.3.8
). 
    The slowdown of employme
nt growth in the 
forecast is less pronounced than the slowdown in 
euro area real GDP 
growth
, however. The model 
attributes the stronger resilience of employment 
growth mostly to stabilising factors in the labour 
market itself. In particular, employment con
tinues 
to grow faster than the labour force, leading to a 
(further) decline in the rate of unemployment in 
2019-2020. Despite this decline in unemployment, 
real wage and labour cost growth are projected to 
remain below trend, which is consistent with 
posit
ive labour supply adjustments (wage 
moderation). Labour demand, furthermore, adjusts 
sluggishly to the slowdown in economic activity, 
which the model attributes to "labour hoarding". 
The two labour
-market factors account for most of 
the positive "supply
-side" component (red bar) in 
Graph 
I.3.8
. In addition to the labour market 
factors, oil prices, domestic 
demand and financial 
market factors support employment in line with 
their positive contribution to GDP growth in 2019.

  67 States, as shown in the decomposition of GDP 
growth in Germany and France (Graph 
I.3.9
).    In effect, the downside contribution of external 
demand shocks to real GDP growth in 2019 
(Graph 
I.3.9
) is moderate in France, compared to a 
large drag on GDP growth in Germany, which is in 
line with stronger (net) export growth in France 
compared to Germany in the forecast for 2019. 
The d
ifferent growth contribution of external 
demand (difference of 0.8 pps.) can almost fully 
account for the growth differential (0.9 pps.) 
between France and Germany in 2019. The 
stronger negative contribution to growth in 
Germany is partly driven by market 
share losses of 
German exporters, which further highlights the 
asymmetric nature of the shock. 
 Concerning other factors, the projected decline in 
oil prices contributes positively to growth in 2019 
and 2020, in line with the results for the euro area 
aggr
egate. Domestic demand factors play a less 
positive role in France, due to a reduction in 
government spending relative to GDP as 
incorporated in the forecast. Fiscal policy plays a 
more stabilising role in Germany, where 
government consumption and investme
nt spending 
is projected to rise relative to GDP. 
 Domestic supply shocks dampen real GDP growth 
in Germany. The GDP deflator growth picks
-up in 
2019 and remains broadly stable in 2020, despite 
the slowdown in economic activity this year. The 
model attribu
tes the sluggish response of prices to 
economic activity to an increase in the price mark
-up that has negative implications for domestic 
activity and weakens the recovery in 2020. The 
model also suggests sluggish adjustment of prices 
in France in 2019 and 
2020. The negative impact 
of the temporary price mark
-up increase on 
economic activity in France is, however, largely 
offset by wage moderation (notably a decline in 
nominal unit labour costs in 2019 linked to 
changes in social security contributions of th
e CICE), which in the model is a negative wage 
mark
-up shock that strengthens employment and 
GDP growth.
    The drivers of employment dynamics in Germany 
and France (Graph 
I.3.10
) are similar to those 
highlighted for GDP growth. The slowdown in 
export demand, which is the main factor behind 
the slowdown between 2018 and 2019, al
so 
dampens employment growth in both countries and 
more substantially so in the case of Germany. 
Domestic demand and financial factors, together 
with the lower oil price incorporated in the 
forecast, strengthen employment growth in France 
in 2019 and 2020 
compared to 2018. For Germany 
the model suggests a
 decline in the contribution of 
domestic demand factors in 2020. 
 Contrary to the decomposition of GDP growth, 
domestic supply factors play a more positive role 
for employment in both countries. As for GDP 
growth the identified price mark
-up increase 
dampens employment growth, whereas declining 
wage costs in France (wage mark
-up decline) 
strengthen labour demand and employment in 
2019. In addition, labour hoarding stabilises 
employment in both countries, alt
hough it is more 
pronounced in the case of Germany, in light of the 
magnitude of the growth slowdown.

  68 3.3. THE PROCYCLICAL
ITY OF POTENTIAL 
OUTPUT 
 Introduction
 Any meaningful analysis of cyclical developments, 
of medium term growth prospects, or of the sta
nce 
of fiscal and monetary policies, inevitably rests on 
either an implicit or explicit assumption about the 
rate of potential output growth. The measurement 
of potential growth is therefore an important 
ingredient in the EU™s surveillance processes and 
in evaluating the effectiveness of the EU™s 
structural reform agenda. Unfortunately, however, 
potential growth is not directly observable and so, 
must be estimated. 
 Given its importance in the EU™s fiscal 
surveillance framework, the question of how best 
to calculate potential growth is a subject of much 
debate. One criticism sometimes levelled at the 
EU™s commonly agreed methodology (CAM) is 
the procyclicality of its 
estimates. Critics argue 
that the CAM™s estimates track actual GDP too 
closely and therefore fail to accurately distinguish 
between temporary, cyclical, fluctuations in GDP 
and permanent, structural, changes in the growth 
potential of the EU™s economy. Thi
s concern is 
particularly relevant now that economic growth is 
slowing after six years of expansion, as it could 
lead to an overestimation of potential growth.   
 The CAM has undergone numerous evaluations 
since its inception in 2002. It was also updated 
significantly, in 2010 with respect to total factor 
productivity (TFP), and in 2014 with respect to the 
non
-accelerating wage rate of unemployment 
(NAWRU), in response to the concerns about 
procyclicality. The evaluations showed that the 
CAM has a relativel
y good overall track record 
compared with alternative methodologies with 
respect to its real time revision properties. 
However, the general question of procyclicality 
has been less extensively evaluated, including the 
specific performance of the CAM at par
ticular 
stages of the cycle, such as at turning points, or in 
the downward or upward phases of the cycle where 
the real time potential output estimates play a 
significant role in driving fiscal policy changes. 
 Against this background, the purpose of this 
special topic is to empirically assess the link 
between the CAM™s potential output estimates and 
the dynamic pattern of the actual GDP series. A 
too close link between actual and potential output 
growth risks giving policy makers an 
unrealistically pessimi
stic view of the structural 
budget balance in bad times and an unrealistically 
optimistic view in good times. This specific 
criticism goes to the heart of the complaints made 
against the CAM, which is that it risks misleading 
policy makers and encouraging 
procyclical fiscal 
policies, whereas fiscal policy needs to be 
countercyclical in order to achieve its stabilisation 
goals. The allegation that the CAM™s potential 
output estimates suffer from excessive 
procyclicality has been raised widely in the 
literatu
re. 
(102) What is meant by procyclicality and how has 
the CAM performed with respect to it in the 
pre
-crisis, crisis and post
-crisis periods?   
 One of the advantages of the economics based 
CAM, compared with purely statistical methods 
such as the Hodrick
ŒPrescott
 (HP) Filter, which 
suffer from end point bias concerns, is that the 
issue of procyclicality can be assessed from an 
economic perspective. As such, it is clear that there 
are both ‚realistic™ and ‚excessive™ (i.e. unrealistic) 
types of procyclicality
:    ‚Realistic™ procyclicality means that the CAM 
correctly detects when the EU™s underlying 
growth rate has either shifted downwards or 
upwards permanently. The biggest test of the 
CAM therefore occurred during the financial 
crisis and in the years that f
ollowed. Did the 
CAM ‚get the crisis right™ and were its 
estimates before, during and after the crisis 
realistic, or excessively negative?
  ‚Excessive™ procyclicality occurs when the 
CAM produces potential output estimates 
which rise too much when the econo
my is in 
the upward phase of the cycle or go down too 
much when it is in the downward phase. These 
episodes can best be identified by the degree of 
revision after turning points in the cycle.

. Fatas argues that procyclical fiscal 
policies in the Euro Area in the post crisis years from 2010 
to 2014, were driven by an overly pessimistic view of 
potential output among EU policy makers, creating a self
-fulfilling 'doom loop', which resulted in hyst
eresis and 
permanently lower levels of GDP.  
  Economic outlook for the euro area and 
the EU
  69 Should one expect some level of procyclicality to 
occur in pote
ntial output calculations?
 Some 
degree of procyclicality is inherent in the 
calculation of potential output. For example, 
recessions are often associated with increases in 
structural unemployment because of hysteresis 
effects and firms typically cut invest
ment (which 
lowers the capital stock) or postpone their adoption 
of new technologies (which lowers trend TFP 
growth). In the case of financial and banking 
crises, the evidence for persistent or even 
permanent output losses is relatively strong. 
(103) The gre
at recession of 2008/2009 in the US and 
the EU, as well as the sovereign debt crisis in the 
EU, confirm this evidence by showing persistent 
negative level effects (Graph 
I.3.11
). In the EU, 
potential growth rates decreased considerably after 
                                                           (103) See B

capital mi
sallocation before the boom, i.
e. increasing the 
size of low productivity sectors/firms, which are kept aliv

 the boom has collapsed (see for example

). 
contributions of all three drivers of growth, 
especially capital and labour and to a lesser extent 
TFP (total factor productivity). Consequently, 
when it comes to the EU™s CAM methodology for 
calculating potentia
l output, the aim is to limit 
procyclicality whilst prioritising the detection of 
permanent shifts in potential. Since some degree of 
procyclicality appears justified, the question 
therefore is whether the CAM gives a ‚realistic™ or 
an ‚excessive™, real ti
me signal to policy makers 
regarding the level and direction of change in the 
underlying strength or weakness of the economy.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  70  2009 Crisis
: Looking at the potential output 
series from the spring 2019 forecasts (the ‚full™ 
red line), one sees a clear break in the series 
around 2009, with potential output falling 
below historical rates. 
(106) The CAM handled 
this shock to previous patterns of po
tential 
growth very well, producing realistic and stable 
potential growth rate estimates compared with 
the HP filter, in real time, which signalled to 
policy makers the permanent, rather than 
cyclical, nature of the output loss. The crisis 
period is theref
ore an example of ‚realistic™ 
procyclicality. 
  In the spring 2009 forecast, the CAM 
essentially halved its estimated potential 
growth rates for the euro area and the EU for 
2009 and 2010 to 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. 
Since 10 years have now elapsed, the s
pring 
2019 estimates for 2009 and 2010 can be 
considered largely final and factual, with those 
estimates being almost identical to those of the 
CAM™s spring 2009 assessment for 2009 and 
2010, with a maximum difference of 0.1 of a 
percentage point for both 
the euro area and for 
the EU as a whole. 
  Consequently, the CAM produced 
economically accurate and stable estimates in 
spring 2009 of the short run effects of the 
crisis, which have not been revised over the last 
10 years. In addition, the CAM™s realistic 
assessment of the short term impact on 
potential of the financial crisis, and the knock
-on implications for output gaps, contrasts 
sharply with the assessment of its predecessor, 
the HP filter. In spring 2009, the CAM™s output 
gap estimates for the euro ar
ea for the years 
                                                                                   Spring 2010 has estimates until 2010). The lower end 
of 
the spread is then given by the lowest estimate ever made 
for the year 2010 in all vintages. Graph

Economic outlook for the euro area and 
the EU
  71     Period after 2009:
 In the first vintages after 
the crisis, growth in potential output was 
forecast to be low, but in fact those predictions 
were not low enough and were subsequently 
revised downwards. In o
ther words, the CAM, 
in most of the vintages since spring 2009, 
underestimated the permanent loss of GDP 
growth induced by the crisis. On the basis of 
the spring 2019 forecasts, estimates for the 
potential GDP growth rates for 2010
-2012 (the 
‚full™ red lin
e) are at the lower end of the band 
of predictions over this period. Consequently, 
the EU's methodology did not display 
‚excessive™ procyclicality in this period since, 
in general, the CAM has had to revise its 
potential growth estimates down, not up, afte
r observing the new facts on actual growth 
developments. 
  A similar conclusion is evident for the early 
years of the recovery period from 2013 
onwards. One can see from graphs 
I.3.14
 and 
I.3.15
 that whilst the potential growth rate 
estimates moved in line with actual GDP, the 
degree of procyclical tracking was limited. 
Over time, the
 real time potential growth rates 
(‚full™ red line) were revised upwards, with the 
spring 2019 estimates for potential GDP during 
the 2013
-2017 period being at the higher end of 
the prediction range. In other words, the CAM 
estimates displayed prudence/cau
tious 
optimism in the early recovery stage of the 
upswing phase, with few signs of ‚excessive™ 
procyclicality.
  However, as the recovery became more 
persistent after 2017, tentative indications of 
‚excessive™ procyclicality, in the form of 
unrealistic real 
time optimism, become visible, 
with the CAM™s real time potential growth 
projections tending to rise too much in the 
advanced upward phase of the cycle, only to be 
followed by downward revisions in subsequent 
vintages. 
 Why do most of the procyclicality pr
oblems 
appear to occur in the advanced upswing 
phase of cycles?
 Whilst the analysis above showed only small 
revisions of the CAM in the crisis years as well as 
in the downswing and early upswing stages of the 
current cycle, it also showed that the CAM appe
ars 
to be vulnerable to larger errors in the more 
advanced upswing stage of business cycles. 
Indeed, the CAM™s potential output estimates 
based on the most recent forecast vintages, do 
show some tentative signs of ‚excessive™ 
procyclicality. Although it is
 clear from graphs 
I.3.14
 and 
I.3.15
 that the degree of unrealistic 
procyclicality currently evident is significantly 
lower than in the pre
-crisis period, ‚excessive™ 
procyclicality does appear to be an entrenched 
feature of estimates in the advanc
ed upswing stage 
of cycles. This section will examine the 
methodological and non
-methodological factors 
behind CAM™s difficulty in removing the cyclical 
component of actual GDP developments in the 
upswing stage of cycles. 
 Regarding methodological factors,
 as the mood of 
economic agents shifts in the expansion phase of 
the cycle, it becomes difficult for all trend 
extraction methods, including the CAM, to make 
an accurate distinction between the realistic future 
expectations of consumers and investors and t
he 
emergence of irrational exuberance. In addition, 
the CAM, for sound theoretical and practical 
measurement reasons, does not cyclically adjust 
the investment inputs into the potential output 
calculations (essentially the CAM produces a 
measure of potenti
al, not equilibrium, output), with 
the result that it depends heavily on the quality of 
its cyclically adjusted TFP series. On the labour 
side, the population of working age variable is also 
not cyclically adjusted. Whilst the CAM correctly 
shows a boost t
o potential growth in countries 
enjoying strong inward migration due to buoyant 
economic conditions, it seems to struggle to 
decipher whether those migration flows are 
sustainable, long term shifts,  or if they are largely 
cyclical, as was the case for man
y countries in the 
pre
-crisis period.

  72 Regarding the non
-methodological factors 
explaining the optimistic bias in the advanced 
upswing stage of cycles, one factor which has not 
been given sufficient attention in the literature, is 
the role played by the opt
imistic bias of forecasts 
in this stage of the cycle. A major reason for this 
bias is the general difficulty forecasters have to 
correctly flag the possibility of business cycle 
downturns.  Although recessions are relatively 
common, Commission, OECD and IM
F forecasters have almost never forecast a negative 
growth rate in the second year of their short term 
forecasts. In this context, graphs 
I.3.16
, I.3.17
, I.3.18
 and 
I.3.19
 (107) show the absolute revisions 
to the Commission™s spring actual and potential 
GDP growth rate projections over time. As one can 
see from the graphs, there are minimal changes in 
each Spring forecast round to the T
-1 actual GDP 
estimates (wh
ich one would expect). In addition, 
revisions to the year T forecast are relatively small. 
However, one year ahead forecasts tend to see 
significantly more revisions.  
                                                                        (107) First vintage available: EU

                            These revisions in actual GDP forecasts, of course, 
influence the revisions in potential output growth 
(Graphs

the scales for both graphs needing to be

Area and the EU as a whole, for every one

output changes by roughly 1/3 of a percentage 
point. Moreover, several individual member states

Economic outlook for the euro area and 
the EU
  73 may see a larger change in es
timates of their 
potential rates due to revisions in actual GDP (i.e. 
a change in excess of 1/3) because of two factors: 
  Firstly, the 
pattern of the actual GDP growth 
revisions
, and particularly the degree of 
persistence displayed, plays a very important 
role in deciding the cyclical versus structural 
decomposition of any actual GDP change. This 
explains why the signal given in the second 
year of the actual GDP forecast is very 
important for the accuracy of the CAM. 
  Secondly, the 
composition of the actual
 GDP 
growth forecasts
 and the input variables 
driving those revisions are also fundamental. 
More specifically, since the investment and 
population of working age variables are not 
smoothed in the CAM (i.e. they lead directly to 
changes in potential output)
, a strong revision 
for investment growth (especially housing 
investment) or for population of working age 
growth (driven, for example, by volatile 
migration flows) has important knock
-on implications for the potential growth rate 
revision. 
 Consequently, 
it is both the pattern of the actual 
GDP growth rate forecasts (i.e. whether the 
upward or downward actual GDP revisions are 
one
-off or persistent in nature) and the 
composition of these forecasts (particularly the 
extent to which  revisions are driven by 
investment 
or demographic developments) that influences the 
proportion of the revision that is considered 
structural or cyclical. 
 Concluding Remarks 
 This special topic has looked at the cyclical 
properties of the CAM™s potential output estimates 
for EU a
ggregates. It argues that a certain degree 
of procyclicality is justified and that it is 
appropriate that the capital stock and the 
population of working age variables are not 
cyclically
-adjusted (since the CAM is measuring 
potential, not equilibrium, outp
ut). The main focus 
of the analysis has been on distinguishing between 
‚realistic™ and ‚excessive™ (i.e. unrealistic) pro
-cyclicality. Whilst pre
-crisis potential output 
estimates showed clear signs of ‚excessive™ 
procyclicality, this was not a feature of 
the 
estimates during the crisis itself or in the post
-crisis period. The improvements made to the 
CAM™s NAWRU and TFP trend estimates in the 
post
-crisis period, in particular the introduction of 
the new TFP methodology in 2010, all helped to 
reduce the CAM
™s overall degree of procyclicality, 
with the result that the CAM avoided the ‚undue 
pessimism™ of the HP filter
-based methodology in 
the post
-crisis years.
 In assessing periods of both ‚excessive™ and 
‚realistic™ procyclicality, the analysis focused on 
answering two key questions. First, did the EU™s 
CAM produce excessively negative potential 
growth rate forecasts in the aftermath of the 2008 
financial crisis? Secondly, did the CAM display a 
pessimistic bias over the post crisis period by 
tracking too clos
ely the low actual GDP growth 
rates, thereby signalling unrealistically negative 
future growth expectations for the EU? 
  In relation to question 1, the evidence shows 
that the CAM™s assessment of the short
-term 
impact of the crisis was remarkably realistic
. It 
is now clear, 10 years on, that there was a 
genuine trend break in the EU™s growth 
prospects in 2009 and that the halving of the 
CAM™s potential growth estimates following 
the crash in Spring 2009 was not a reflection of 
a procyclicality bias. Since t
rend growth has 
been on a lower path in the post crisis period 
than it was in the post
-2000 years, the CAM 
clearly helped provide policy makers with a 
more credible/realistic path for future growth 
rate expectations. In addition, the CAM was 
not procyclica
l enough in the post crisis years 
as the real time CAM predictions had to be 
progressively revised downwards in subsequent 
forecast vintages. This absence of ‚excessive™ 
procyclicality in the post
-crisis period 
contradicts the ‚self
-fulfilling pessimism™ 
hypothesis referred to by Fatas (2018). 
  Regarding question 2, although there are no 
clear signs of a procyclicality problem for the 
CAM during the crisis or in most of the post 
crisis period, some tentative signs of excessive 
procyclicality appear to be em
erging in recent 
forecast vintages. Given the CAM™s optimistic 
bias, the biggest risk regarding the emergence 
of instances of ‚excessive™ procyclicality is in 
the advanced upswing stage of any cycle, with 
this risk due to both forecast issues (i.e. the in
-built optimistic bias in the second year of 
economic forecasts) and methodological issues 
(i.e. the fact that the capital or population of 
working age variables are not smoothed in the 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  74 CAM, rather than to any serious problems in 
relation to trend TFP or th
e NAWRU). 
 Finally, whilst the CAM performed relatively well 
in the post crisis downswing period, only time will 
tell if it has also managed to avoid any ‚false™ 
optimism in the current stage of the cycle. The 
evidence so far seems to suggest that the 
inve
stment bubble which preceded the 2008 crisis 
seems currently not to be emerging (with 
investment growing broadly in line with its 
endogenous determinants, namely labour and TFP 
growth) and that recent population of working age 
 trends appear less cyclical
ly driven than in the pre
-crisis period.  However, given the uncertainties 
involved, it is clear that great vigilance will be 
needed to ensure that the CAM™s potential output 
estimates remain prudent. Ongoing vigilance is 
essential given that the credibili
ty of the CAM 
ultimately rests on its ability to provide a realistic 
growth outlook with which to guide the 
expectations of both economic agents and policy 
makers in the EU.

 Box I.4.1: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
Given the ongoing ratification process of the 
revised 
Withdrawal Agreement in the UK, 
projections 
for 2019
, 2020
 and 202
1 are based on a 
purely technical assumption of status quo in terms 
of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. 
This is for forecasting purposes only
. The cut
-off date for taking new information into 
account in this European Eco
nomic Forecast was 
24 October
 201
9. The forecast incorporates 
validated public finance data as published in 
Eurostat
™s news release 
161/201
9 of 
21 October
 2019. External assumptions
 This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions, reflecting market
 expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 
day, averages from a 10
-day reference period 
(between 
8 and 
21 October
) were used for 
exchange and interest rates, and for oil
 prices. 
 Exchange and interest rates
 The technical assumption regarding exchange rates 
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption 
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 
1.12 
in 2019 and
 1.11 both 
in 
2020 
and in 
2021. The 
avera
ge JPY/EUR is 
121.81 in 2019
 and 
119
.52 in 
both 
2020
 and 2021
. Interest
-rate assumptions are market
-based. 
Short
-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts. Long
-term interest 
rates for the euro area, as 
well as short
- and 
long
-term interest rates for other Member States are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread between the 
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, the fixed spre
ad 
vis
-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both 
short
- and long
-term rates. As a result, short
-term 
interest rates are assumed to be 
-0.4% in 
201
9 and 
-0.5% in 20
20 and 2021
 in the euro area. Long
-term euro area interest rates are assumed to be
         
-0.3% in 201
9, -0.4% in 2020
 and 
-0.3% in 20
21. Commodity prices
 Commod
ity price assumptions are also 
based on 
market conditions. According to futures markets, 
prices for Brent oil
 are projected to be on average
 63.3 USD/bbl in 201
9, 57.4 USD/bbl in 
2020
 and 
56.1 USD/bbl in 2021
. This would correspond to an 
oil price of 
56.5 EUR/bbl in 201
9, 51.

. Trade policies
 As far as
 trade policy is concerned, t
his 
forecast 
pencils in only the measures that have been 
implemented until the cut
-off date
. Compared to 
the 
summer 
interim forecast, there were a number 
of limited changes to the baseline scenario.
  On 
01/08/2019
, the trade conflict between 
Japan and Korea
 escalated
. Japan introduced 
export controls for tech material shipments to 
Korea and removed Korea from the white list 
of countries that benefit from minimum trade
-related restrictions and procedures.
 Later, 
Korea also removed Japan from a list of 
preferred trading 
partners.
  On 
01/08/2019, despite ongoing trade talks, the 
US announce
d a 10% tariff on the remaining 
300 b
illion USD 
of imports from China, which 
were not yet subject to new tariffs. The US 
administration de
cided that part of the tariff 
will take effect on
 1 September
 except for some 
tariffs on consumer goods which will be 
implemented from 15
 December
 onwards.
  0n 23/08/2019, 
China retaliated by announcing 
5% and 10% tariffs on 75 billion USD
 of 
imports from the US
 to be phased in in two 
stages (on 1 Septemb
er and 15 December) 
along with resuming the 25% duty on US 
automobiles and auto parts from 15 December
 onwards
. The US administration reacted by 
increasing the tariff on 300 billion USD of 
imports 
from China 
to 15% and 
announced 
raising the 25% tariff alre
ady in place on 250 
billion USD of Ch
inese imports to 30% 
from
 15 October onwards
.  On 25/09/2019, t
he US and Japan announce
d a partial trade agreement in which Japan would 
lift its tariffs on some agricultural products in 
exchange for the US lifting tariff
s on some 
industrial goods.

  On 11/10/2019,
 the US announced
 that a

reached. As a result, the US suspended the 
tariff increase from 25% to 30% on 250 billion 
USD imports from China, which were planned 
to go into ef

 15 October. In exchange, 
the Chinese

 The 
public finance
 forecast is made under the 
‚no-policy

, which extrapolates past 
revenue and expenditure trends and relationships in 
a way that is consistent with past policy 
orientations. This may also include the adoption of 
a limited number of working assumptions, 
especially to deal with possible structural 
breaks.
 The forecast 
includes
 all fiscal policy measures that 
imply a change to these past policy orientations on 
the condition that they are sufficiently detailed as

cluding 
those made through the European Financial 
Stability Facility). To ensure consistency in the 
time series, historical data are also published on the 
same basis. For 201

 PART II
 Prospects by individual economy
    Euro Area Member States
   1. BELGIUM
 Growth to slow down, rising public deficit
 82 Economic growth set to weaken and remain 
driven by d
omestic demand
 Economic growth slowed to 1.1% in the first half 
of the year and is expected to stabilise in the rest of 
2019. Weaker household consumption growth and 
negative change in inventories are forecast to 
weigh on GDP growth, which should decline 
compared to 2018. However, rising disposable 
income should support household consumption 
growth from 2020 onwards, paving the way for 
domestic demand to become the sole growth 
engine over the forecast horizon. 
 Soft and hard indicators have deteriorated ste
adily 
in 2019, suggesting that Belgium™s economic 
growth will continue to soften. Overall, real GDP 
growth is expected to fall from 1.5% in 2018 to 
1.1% in 2019 and 1.0% in both 2020 and 2021.
    Private consumption to pick
-up, underpinned 
by low unemployment and rising income
 The job market should continue developing 
favourably thanks to recent measures to lower 
labou
r costs. Employment growth is forecast to 
remain strong at 1.3% in 2019 and decelerate 
gently to 0.9% in 2020 and 0.8% in 2021. The 
unemployment rate is expected decrease to 5.5% in 
2019 and to 5.3% in 2021. Rising disposable 
income, thanks to personal inc
ome tax cuts and 
wage indexation, is expected to underpin stronger 
private consumption growth in 2020 and 2021. 
Still, deteriorating household confidence suggests 
that part of the rise in disposable income will 
likely go towards savings, particularly in 20
19 and 
2020. 
 Investment to slow down, while net trade turns 
negative
 The contribution of investment to growth is 
forecast to moderate over the next two years, 
following sustained growth in 2018 and 2019. 
Business investment is set to lose momentum in 
2020 amid markedly weaker confidence and lower 
pressure to increase capacity. Housing investment 
growth is also expected to decelerate, amid 
tightening lending standards. Public investment is 
projected to slow down in 2019, in line with the 
electoral cycle, an
d accelerate slightly from 2020. 
Total investment growth is forecast to fall from 
3.4% in 2019 to 1.7% and 1.6% in 2020 and 2021, 
respectively.
 The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is 
projected to be neutral in 2019 and turn negative in 
2020. Whil
e subdued world trade growth will 
weigh on exports, imports are expected to be 
bolstered by stronger domestic demand. 
 Downside risks to the outlook include potential 
impacts from a higher
-than
-expected slowdown in 
trading partners to which Belgium could b
e particularly exposed. On the upside, private 
consumption could rise more than expected if 
consumers spend more of their increase in 
disposable income.
 Inflation to decline towards euro area average
 Headline HICP inflation is forecast to decrease 
from 2.3
% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019, driven by 
lower energy and food prices. Headline inflation is 
expected to rise gently to 1.4% in 2020 and 2021, 
reflecting increasing food and services prices. This

Economic growth in Belgium is set to slow 
down and broadly stabilise over the forecast horizon. 
Domestic demand is projected to continue driving growth, as the weakening of investment growth is 
partially offset by the momentum of private consumption. The contribution to growth of net trade is 
expe
cted to be neutral in 2019 and turn negative in 2020. Inflation is forecast to decrease in 2019 and 
rise slightly thereafter. The headline general government deficit is projected to deteriorate markedly.
 Euro Area Member States, Belgium
  83 should support core inflation, which is projected to 
edge up. 
 Deficit expected to edge up again
 In 2018, the headline deficit reached 0.7% of GDP, 
broadly unchanged from its 2017 level. In 2019, 
the headline deficit is expected to significantly 
widen to 1.7% of GDP driven both by a decrease 
in revenue of
 0.9% of GDP and an increase in 
expenditure of around 0.2% of GDP. A number of 
tax reforms adopted in recent years are expected to 
weigh heavily on revenues. Corporate income tax 
(CIT) revenue is expected to decrease in 2019 as it 
reverts to trend, after a
 temporary peak in 2017 and 
2018 due to a reform incentivising advanced 
payments. In addition, a cut in personal income tax 
(PIT) takes effect as part of measures to shift 
taxation away from labour. Finally, deteriorating 
macroeconomic conditions weigh on 
the collection 
of direct taxes. On the expenditure side, rising 
social benefits and transfers in kind, notably due to 
higher pensions and health expenditure, further 
worsened the headline deficit. Once netted off 
from temporary and cyclical factors, the st
ructural 
balance is projected to deteriorate from around       
-1¾% of potential GDP in 2018 to 
-2% in 2019.
 In 2020, under a no
-policy
-change assumption, the 
headline deficit is expected to further widen to 
2.3% of GDP, with the structural deficit forecas
t to 
deteriorate by 0.3% of potential output. The 
decrease in revenue of 0.2% of GDP in 2020 is 
expected to result, among others, from a cut in 
corporate tax rates, amid a broader reform of 
corporate taxation launched in 2018. Other 
elements 
Œ e.g. a reduc
tion in employers™ social 
contributions as a part of the last phase of the tax 
shift
Œ will also play a role. The expenditure
-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by 0.3% of 
GDP, driven by rising social benefits and social 
transfers in kind, in continuatio
n of the trend 
observed in previous years. 
 In 2021, under a no
-policy
-change assumption, the 
headline deficit is expected to further widen to 
2.6% of GDP, due to several factors including the 
slowing economic activity, the end of temporary 
revenue measure
s and increasing social spending. 
 Starting from 100.0% in 2018, Belgium™s debt
-to 
GDP ratio is projected to decrease to 99.5% in 
2019 mainly due to a fall in interest spending. I
t is 
forecast to rise again to 99.6% in 2020 and back to 
100% in 2021 due to increasing deficit projections 
and relatively high stock
-flow adjustments.

2. GERMANY
 Subdued growth following a sharp slowdown in 2019
 84 The manufacturing sector remains weak
 Germany™s economy contracted by 0.1
 % in the 
second quarter of 2019 as the souring external 
environment took its toll on exports. 
Manufacturing continued to decline for the fourth 
consecutive
 quarter. The car manufacturing sector, 
which has a high share of output and a complex 
value chain, is undergoing a structural 
transformation. The production of combustion 
engine vehicles is being scaled down and relocated 
abroad. At the same time, equipme
nt 
manufacturers are suffering from the impact of 
trade conflicts on investment demand. The second 
quarter also showed declines in construction and 
key services. Whereas in construction this reflects 
a particularly strong first quarter, in services this 
may be signalling weaker demand from industries 
and consumers. Moreover, business confidence has 
been deteriorating over the last seven quarters and 
may have affected consumer sentiment. All this 
suggests that Germany could see another slight 
GDP contraction
 in the third quarter of this year, 
resulting in a technical recession.
 Muted domestic demand to result in modest 
growth
 Due to the continued weakness of global trade, 
export growth might recover only partially from its 
decline in the second and presumably
 the third 
quarter of 2019. At the same time, domestic 
demand could prove strong enough to generate 
growth. Consumption should continue benefitting 
from stable employment and ongoing wage 
increases. Even if constrained by capacity, 
construction activity is
 expected to continue 
expanding, while equipment investment should 
strengthen as export activity normalises as 
expected in a few quarters. These prospects are 
subject to downside risks, particularly as recent 
strong wage growth has boosted savings rather 
than consumption growth. Downside risks on 
investment relate to global trade uncertainty, 
sectoral structural issues (e.g. in the auto sector), 
but not least also to the planning and 
implementation capacity of the public sector. All 
in all, after a nine yea
r expansion, GDP is expected 
to increase by only ½
 % this year, and by just 1
 % in 2020 and 2021. This still suggests subdued 
underlying dynamics, as in both 2020 and 2021 
there are positive calendar effects at play (0.4
 % and 0.1
 %).
     A supportive labour market
 The labour market has so far remained robust with 
record high employment and increasing wages. 
Still, the number of overall hours worked stagnated 
in the 
first half of the year and the hiring appetite 
of firms has been subsiding. Private consumption 
growth was restrained in the second quarter, 
despite ongoing increases in disposable income 
and might disappoint further as consumer 
confidence continues declin
ing. Nevertheless, job 
creation is expected to remain slightly positive on 
aggregate. Persistent labour shortages in some 
sectors are expected to sustain labour hoarding and 
wage growth. Job losses in the manufacturing 
sector are expected to be modest.

forecast
pps. 
After slipping into a technical 
recession in mid
-2019, Germany™s economy is expected to see muted 
growth over the forecast horizon. Foreign demand now looks likely to be weaker than previously 
expected and domestic demand is set to be dampened by weak investment. The labour market, by 
contrast, should remain supportive of private consumption, though likely less than in previous years. 
The current account surplus and domestic savings remain high while the fiscal stance is expected to be 
moderately expansionary over the forecast period, as 
budget surpluses diminish.
 Euro Area Member States, Germany
  85 The
 external surplus remains high but declining
 Export growth has slowed significantly since 2018 
and is likely to recover only gradually in 2020. 
Meanwhile, resilient domestic demand is expected 
to lead to a further increase in the import
-to-GDP 
ratio. Thus,
 the current account surplus, which 
declined to 7.6
 % of GDP in 2018, is expected to 
come down further to around 6
 ½ % in 2021.
 Inflation to remain moderate
 Consumer price inflation has been running below 
wage growth, which is supportive of purchasing 
powe
r. Having been around 2
 % for most of 2018, 
HICP inflation declined to just 1
 % in the third 
quarter of 2019. Not taking into account volatile 
energy and unprocessed food prices, it hovered 
around 1.5
 % between January and September 
2019. Moderate domestic
 demand is not expected 
to exert strong inflationary pressure and core 
inflation is not expected to exceed 1.5
 % before 
2021. Budget surpluses diminishing
 The budget balance peaked at 1.9
 % of GDP in 
2018 and is expected to decline to around 1.2
 % in 2019
, 0.6
 % in 2020 and 0.2
 % of GDP in 2021. 
This reduction of budget surpluses reflects the 
expected slowdown in growth as well as the 
planned implementation of fiscal measures.
 On the revenue side, measures lowering the 
personal income tax burden and the ab
olition of 
the solidarity levy in 2021 for more than 90
 % of 
taxpayers will dampen tax revenue. On the 
expenditure side, increased social transfers will 
provide additional support to household disposable 
income. Public investment is forecast to continue 
growing faster than GDP. The measures in the 
recent climate package should lead to additional 
spending of around 0.1
 % of GDP per year. 
Government spending is set to increase noticeably 
over the forecast period, reducing the budget 
surplus. All measures toge
ther imply a modest 
fiscal expansion of around 1 pp. of potential GDP 
over the years 2019 to 2021.
 The structural surplus peaked in 2018 at about 
1½ % of GDP and is projected to decline by about 
1 pp. over the forecast period. Government debt is 
projected 
at 59
 % of GDP in 2019, falling below 
the 60
 % Maastricht threshold, and to decline 
further to around 55
 % of GDP in 2021.

3. ESTONIA
 Sectoral restructuring and weak foreign demand slow down growth
 86 Recovering investment is driving growth 
 Following strong growth in 2018 of 4.8% and a 
solid performance in the first half of 2019, 
economic growth in Estonia is fore
cast to 
moderate to 3.2% in 2019. Economic activity in 
the first half of 2019 was mainly driven by private 
investment, which rose by over 20% partly 
reflecting a base effect from low investment a year 
ago. Investment growth was broad based and 
particularly
 strong in machinery and equipment 
and in residential construction. Investment appears 
to have been driven by capacity constraints and 
increased need for automation motivated by labour 
and skills shortages, as well as by the favourable 
borrowing conditions
 and healthy profit margins. 
 Despite strong investment, industrial output 
growth is set to decline by the end of the year due 
to weak external demand. A decline in industrial 
sector confidence over 2019 signals worsened 
expectations for the coming quarter
s. Estonia™s oil 
shale and energy production sectors have been 
affected by rising CO2 emissions certificate prices. 
Electricity production is set to decline substantially 
in 2019 and will contribute negatively to GDP 
growth. 
 Private consumption has so far
 been supported by 
strong employment growth, as well as by 
increasing real incomes. At the same time, 
borrowing by households has remained stable and 
relatively moderate, with saving rates close to the 
EU average. Estonia™s household debt has 
marginally de
clined since 2016 and is projected to 
stabilise going forward.  
 In 2020 and 2021, economic growth is expected to 
slow further in line with cyclical developments. 
Industrial exports are expected to flatten. Domestic 
demand is set to remain the key growth d
river 
primarily due to the increase in real disposable 
incomes supported by moderating inflation. The 
employment rate and wage increases are forecast 
to weaken somewhat, but labour market 
participation is set to remain high. Given the base 
effect, investme
nt is set to contribute less to 
growth than in 2019. Corporate profit margins are 
likely to decrease as foreign demand remains 
subdued and labour costs elevated. Overall, GDP 
growth is forecast to slow to 2.1% in 2020 before 
perking up slightly to 2.4% in 
2021, rates that are 
below the economy™s estimated potential growth 
rate. 
     Price dynamics reflect external factors
 HICP inflation is forecast to fall from 3.4% i
n 2018 to 2.4% in 2019, largely due to lower global 
energy prices. In addition, consumption tax 
changes (which were raised sharply prior to 2019) 
are expected to have a smaller inflationary impact 
over the forecast horizon. At the same time, prices 
for ser
vices are expected to continue growing 
rapidly, reflecting the pass
-through of high wage 
growth. Overall, inflation is expected to stay 
slightly above 2% over 2020 and 2021. 
 Labour market performs strongly 
 The cyclical peak in economic activity has led t
o labour shortages and rapidly rising nominal wages. 
Short
-term capacity constraints of companies have 
been alleviated through greater labour market 
flexibility. Since 2017, labour supply has been 
sustained through inward migration and an 
increased use of 
contracted foreign labour, which 
has helped to address labour needs in the 
construction and manufacturing sectors.

Strong private investment and flexible labour supply have supported growth in the first half of 2019. 
However, growth is set to slow due to cyclical factors and the ongoing restructuring of the energy 
production sector. The government budget is expected to continue to be in a slight deficit.
 Euro Area Member States, Estonia
  87 After a decade of growth, the employment rate is 
projected to peak at over 79% in 2019 and to 
stabilise thereafter, in line with slowing economic 
growth. The rise in the unemployment rate is 
forecast to be relatively small, given that labour 
supply is also
 set to moderate in a setting of 
population ageing. At the same time, structural 
skills mismatches are likely to persist, reducing the 
cost
-competitiveness of the Estonian companies. 
 Public spending growth is set to slow 
 The general government is project
ed to run a 0.2% 
of GDP deficit in 2019. Cyclically strong tax 
revenues are matched by rapid expenditure growth.  
Social expenditures (pensions, parental benefits) 
are growing relatively rapidly due to an indirect 
link to overall wage growth. At the same t
ime,
  public sector wage growth has been rapid, also 
due to hikes in educational and healthcare sector 
wages. The 2020 state draft budget foresees some 
expenditure restraint. However, as this coincides 
with slower economic and revenue growth, the 
budget i
s projected to remain in a small nominal 
deficit of 0.2% in 2020. Under a no
-policy
-change 
assumption, the deficit is projected to amount to 
0.2% of GDP in 2021. 
 Given that the economy is forecast to operate well 
below its potential in 2020 and 2021, the 
structural 
fiscal position is projected to improve from a 
deficit of around 1½% of GDP in 2019 to about 
1% of GDP in 2020 and ½% of GDP in 2021. 
Public debt is forecast to remain low at about 8% 
of GDP by 2021.

4. IRELAND
 Solid growth subject to substantial uncertainty
 88 Domestic activity is moderating but 
remains 
robust
 Real GDP in Ireland grew by 6.6% year
-on-year 
(y-o-y) in the first half of 2019, well above the 
euro area average. GDP growth is expected to 
reach 5.6% in 2019 and to moderate to 3.5% in 
2020 and 3.2% in 2021, on the back of increasing 
capac
ity constraints and an expected slowdown in 
government expenditure.
     Consumption and investment in construction 
support domestic activity
 GDP figures remain distorted by the activities of 
multinational companies operating in Ireland. 
Modified domestic demand
, a measure of domestic 
activity that strips out some of the effects of 
multinationals, grew by 2.3% y
-o-y in the first half 
of 2019, su
pported by robust, albeit moderating, 
private consumption and construction investment. 
Modified domestic demand is projected to grow 
over 3% on average over the forecast horizon.
 In the first half of 2019, employment grew by 
2.8% y
-o-y and the unemployment
 rate declined to 
5.2%, a level last seen in 2007, suggesting a labour 
market close to full employment. Although skills 
and labour shortages are building up, high net 
inward migration should continue to alleviate 
Ireland™s labour supply constraints. Employ
ment is 
expected to continue expanding over the forecast 
horizon, albeit at a moderating pace, in line with 
the projected slowdown in activity. Average 
hourly earnings grew by 3.4% y
-o-y in the first 
half of 2019. Wage growth is expected to 
strengthen furt
her, supporting household 
disposable income.
 Ireland™s trade and investment figures were heavily 
influenced by the activity of multinationals in the 
first half of 2019. Investment sharply increased, 
bolstered by investment in intellectual property. As 
this
 investment component is entirely imported, 
the surge in investment was matched by a rise in 
service imports. These two effects largely offset 
each other and have an overall neutral first
-round 
impact on GDP. Domestic investment, by contrast, 
decreased by 
0.6 % y
-o-y in the first half of 2019. 
While external uncertainty weighed on investment 
in machinery and equipment, investment in 
construction increased by 8.2% y
-o-y. It is 
expected to moderate but remain robust, as 
housing supply is still catching up wit
h demand. 
 Low inflation supports disposable income
 Average HICP inflation hit 0.9% in the first three 
quarters of 2019 and is forecast to remain 
moderate. Rents and restaurant service prices are 
expected to sustain services price inflation, while 
the down
ward trend in industrial goods prices is 
expected to lower price pressures along the supply 
chain. In 2020 and 2021, inflation is projected to 
rise slightly, as wage pressures build up in a tight 
labour market.
 Trade developments are less favourable
 In the
 first half of 2019, exports increased by 
12.5% y
-o-y, supported by pharmaceuticals and 
computer services, while imports surged by 38.7%, 
bolstered by imports of R&D services. As the high 
share of pharmaceuticals and ICT services makes 
Ireland™s exports pa
rticularly competitive and less 
sensitive to changes in overall global demand, 
export growth is projected to remain robust, 
though lower than in 2019.

GDP growth is set to moderate amid a weakening external environment, while underlying economic 
activity is expected 
to remain robust, driven by household consumption and investment in construction. 
Inflation is expected to remain moderate. The government balance is projected to further improve, but 
risks to the fiscal outlook remain.
 Euro Area Member States, Ireland
  89 The economic outlook remains clouded by 
uncertainty 
 Uncertainty mainly relates to the terms of the UK™s 
withdrawal from the EU and to changes in the 
international taxation environment. More 
generally, the difficult
-to-predict activities of 
multinationals could drive headline growth in 
either direction. On the domestic side, the tight 
labour market and dimini
shing spare capacity point 
to an economy possibly operating above its 
potential. Against this background, signs of 
overheating could become more apparent if 
adverse external shocks do not materialise.
 Buoyant tax revenue continues to support
 public finances
 The headline government balance is projected to 
increase to 0.2% of GDP in 2019. In the first three 
quarters of 2019, growth in total expenditure was 
broadly matched by a strong increase in revenue. 
This translated into a mild surplus of t
he cash 
balance, compared with a deficit in the same 
period of last year. Tax revenue increased by 
8.7%
 y-o-y in the year to date, driven largely by 
buoyant corporate tax receipts.
 Ireland™s 2020 Draft Budgetary Plan includes new 
spending measures of around 0.3% of GDP.
(108) They are partially financed by revenue raising 
measures of around 0.1% of GDP. Including the 
pre
-committed expenditure increases, the balance 
is expected to imp
rove in 2020 to 0.3% of GDP 
and, based on a no
-policy
-change assumption, 
register a surplus of 0.6% of GDP in 2021. Risks 
to the fiscal outlook remain skewed to the 
downside, mainly reflecting the uncertainty 
surrounding the economic outlook, the ongoing 
international discussions about reforms to
 the 
global tax system and the sustainability of 
corporate tax revenue.
 The structural deficit is expected to deteriorate in 
2019 to about ¾% of GDP before improving in 
2020 and turning into a surplus in 2021. The 
general government debt ratio is projected to 
decline to 59.0% of GDP in 2019 and to fall 
further to 53.9% and 52.6% of GDP in 2020 and 
2021, respectively. This is contingent on continued 
stable medium
-term economic growth and positive 
primary balances.
                                                            (108) This amount excludes the contingency provisions 
(amounting to 0.35% of GDP) 
for measures that will be 
defined only 
if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

 Fiscal rebalancing to strengthen ongoing recovery
 90 Economic growth continues, but at a slightly 
lower pace
 Real GDP growth decreased in the first hal
f of 
2019 to 1.5% (y
-o-y). The lacklustre performance 
of growth in the first quarter (1.1% y
-o-y) was due 
to a decrease in net exports as well as a decline in 
government consumption. These were partly 
reversed in the second quarter (1.9%) but headline 
grow
th remained below the 2018 average. 
 Despite higher disposable incomes through 
improving labour market conditions, private 
consumption declined by 
-0.1% (y
-o-y) in the first 
half of 2019. In light of strong improvements in 
business and consumer confidence 
during the 
summer, consumption is expected to accelerate in 
the second half of 2019.
 Reform efforts are expected to have a positive 
effect on growth, amid external headwinds –
 The subdued outlook for the euro area economy is 
set to dampen export growth, th
ough this effect is 
likely to be cushioned somewhat by the solid 
market share gains being made by Greek exports. 
 In addition, the shift in the composition of tax 
revenues towards less distortionary taxes 
accompanied by social policy measures, is 
expected 
to support investment and employment 
growth. Against this background, GDP growth is 
projected to strengthen to 2.3% in 2020 before 
easing to 2.0% in 2021.
 Employment growth is expected to remain above 
2% in 2019 and 2020 and to slowly moderate 
thereafter, 
bringing the unemployment rate to 14% 
in 2021. Inflation has been revised down to 0.5% 
in 2019 due to the impact of the VAT reduction in 
the second quarter as well as the 
lower
-than
-expected rise in oil prices. In 2020 and 
2021, inflation is expected to in
crease to 0.6% and 
0.9%, respectively, in line with the ongoing 
recovery and inflationary pressure from the tax 
reforms. 
    Downside risks to the outlook stem from a
 slowdown in foreign demand, as well as a 
persistent under
-execution of the budget targeted 
for public investment. Upside risks are related to 
the marked improvement in business and consumer 
sentiment, which has yet to be translated into 
significant increa
ses in spending. Improved access 
to finance and bank lending would also provide 
further upside lift to growth.
 –which facilitates the achievement of fiscal 
targets
 Greece™s headline budget balance is forecast to 
record a surplus of 1.3% of GDP in 2019, whi
ch 
would mark its fourth year in a row in surplus. 
This forecast is supported by favourable revenue 
collection, on the back of strong growth in 
disposable incomes as well as a reduction in the 
spending ceilings, which have helped to 
accommodate permanent m
easures worth 0.7% of 
GDP adopted in spring 2019. The primary surplus 
monitored under enhanced surveillance is now 
projected to reach 3.8% of GDP in 2019. The

forecast
Economic growth slowed in the first half of the year but is expected to remain resilient, against the 
headwinds of a weaker external environment. The ongoing recovery is likely to be
 supported by gains in 
export market shares and fiscal policy measures aiming to stimulate investment and reduce labour 
costs. The general government balance is projected to record a surplus in 2019 for the fourth year in a 
row, which should facilitate a r
apid reduction in public debt. Greece is projected to achieve its agreed 
fiscal targets, while at the same time improving the quality of its public finances.
 Euro Area Member States, Greece
  91 will be covered from the contingency reserve and 
no additional package of social spending will be 
paid on top of the current plans because it was not 
announced with a sufficient level of detail.
 The forecast for 2020 incorporates planned cuts in 
distortion
ary taxes and a limited increase in 
family
-oriented social benefits. The package 
(worth 0.6% of GDP) includes a 4 percentage 
points reduction in the corporate income tax, a 
reform of personal income taxation that introduces 
a new rate of nine percent for t
he lowest incomes, 
and a reduction in social security contributions for 
full
-time employees. The package is accompanied 
by measures ensuring fiscal neutrality, supporting 
a higher collection of indirect taxes and revisions 
in spending ceilings. Overall, Gr
eece is expected 
to achieve its primary surplus targets in 2020 and 
2021. 
 The fiscal outlook also reflects the recent Court 
ruling on the 2016 pension reform and the 
authorities™ commitment to accommodate the 
 possible fiscal impact of the follow
-up legi
slation 
within the agreed spending ceilings of the Ministry 
of Labour. However, the forecast remains subject 
to uncertainty in view of another Court case on 
pensions that is still ongoing, while additional 
pressure could arise from past policy initiatives 
affecting the public wage bill and the increasing 
number of temporary personnel. The upside risks 
from overstated budget ceilings have somewhat 
diminished but remain substantial.
 The headline balance is forecast to deteriorate by 
0.3 percentage points
 of GDP in 2020 and slightly 
improve in 2021. The projected decrease in 2020 is 
driven by the payment of the first tranch
e of the 
contingent debt
-relief measures in 2019 and the 
expected decrease in the primary surplus in 2020. 
In view of the projected narrowing of the output 
gap, the structural balance is projected to gradually 
decline over the forecast horizon, reaching ab
out 
1.2% of GDP in 2021. Greece™s public 
debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall significantly 
from 181.2% in 2018 to 163.1% in 2021.

 Growth set on a moderating path after a long expansion
 92 A downgraded outlook due to data revisions 
and we
aker growth momentum
 Revised national accounts up to 2019
-Q2 show 
that growth in recent quarters has been lower than 
previously estimated, mainly as a result of lower 
private consumption. This implies a lower growth 
momentum, and points to weaker domestic 
demand going forward due to a lower propensity to 
consume than previously expected. Soft and hard 
indicators also point to a lower growth trajectory 
going forward amid increased uncertainty. 
 As a consequence, the growth forecast for this year 
has been rev
ised down to 1.9%, 0.4 pps. lower 
than in the summer. Half of this difference is due 
to  historical data revisions, while the other half is 
due to a weaker outlook for 2019H2. For 2020, 
growth is now forecast at 1.5% (also 0.4 pps. lower 
than in the summer
) and at 1.4% in 2021. Risks to 
the outlook are on the downside in a context of 
elevated uncertainty, and relate to both external 
and domestic risks, such as global trade tensions 
and households™ precautionary savings behaviour.
 Domestic demand to grow mod
estly, but net 
exports to make a positive contribution
 In recent quarters, private consumption has been 
growing at its slowest pace since 2014. 
Consumption of durable goods has been 
particularly weak. This has been taking place in a 
context of increasing r
eal wage growth, resulting 
in a sharp increase in the saving rate. This may 
indicate that households are increasing their level 
of precautionary savings amid growing 
uncertainty.
 Private consumption growth is expected to recover 
slightly as households™ fin
ancial position improves 
and some of the temporary factors limiting car 
sales gradually fade away. Still, consumption is 
expected to grow below real disposable income 
over the forecast horizon, resulting in a continued 
recovery in the household saving rate
.        Investment is expected to decelerate over the 
forecast horizon. Weakness in the manufacturing 
sector since mid
-2018 has had an adverse impact 
on equipment 
investment growth, which is 
expected to bottom out this year. It should then 
recover slightly over the forecast horizon, in line 
with final demand. Construction investment is 
expected to decelerate, both for residential and 
non
-residential construction, as
 the economic cycle 
matures. 
 The unusually low import growth reported in 
recent quarters, partly reflecting weak demand for 
durable and investment goods, is set to result in a 
large positive contribution of net exports to growth 
this year. The import inte
nsity of final demand is 
expected to gradually increase as demand for 
durable and capital goods recovers, resulting in 
higher import growth going forward. Exports are 
forecast to continue growing moderately, amid 
trade tensions and weak global growth. As a
 result, 
the contribution of net exports to growth is 
expected to diminish but remain positive.
 Unemployment to continue falling, inflation set 
to increase gradually
 The labour market started to lose traction in 2019

forecast
Growth forecasts have been revised downward 
due to both data revisions and a weaker growth 
momentum amid increased uncertainty. Private consumption is expected to recover slightly over the 
forecast horizon but provide only a moderate impulse to growth. Net exports are set to decelerate while 
remaini
ng supportive to growth. Employment creation is also expected to slow down, but unemployment 
should continue to fall. In the absence of a budget for 2020, the deficit reduction is projected to slow 
further.
 Euro Area Member States, Spain
  93 creation is expected to continue but weaken, 
especially in 2020 and 2021. Still, the 
unemployment rate is set to continue falling, to 
below 13% in 2021, the lowest since 2008. Wage 
growth is expected to peak in 2019, and remain 
dynamic and higher than
 inflation in 2020 and 
2021. As productivity growth is set to turn positive 
next year, unit labour costs should rise more 
slowly after peaking in 2019. Due to oil price 
developments, HICP inflation is forecast to decline 
to 0.9% this year, before increasin
g gradually to 
1.4% in 2021, due to base effects from energy 
prices and a gradual increase in core inflation.
 Budget deficit reduction to slow further
 After decreasing by 0.5 pps. to 2.5% of GDP in 
2018, the general government deficit is expected to 
continue declining, albeit at a slower pace. Despite 
the moderation in economic growth, revenues are 
expected to grow at a relatively rapid pace in 2019, 
hel
ped by buoyant social contributions and 
personal income taxes. This rise in revenues 
should more than offset significant increases in 
expenditure, related to compensation of employees 
and social transfers, in particular pensions. This 
should lead the gener
al government deficit to 
narrow to 2.3% of GDP for the full year. 
 In the absence of a 2020 budget bill, the deficit is 
projected to decline further to 2.2% of GDP in 
2020. This projection includes the wage increase 
for public employees stipulated for 2018
-20 in 
agreement with the trade unions and an annual 
pension revalu
ation in line with inflation. At the 
same time, it incorporates only some of the 
potential savings identified in the spending reviews 
published by AIReF which, if fully implemented, 
could help lowering the deficit from 2020 
onwards. Assuming no change in p
olicy, the 
headline deficit is set to decline to 2.1% of GDP in 
2021. Downside risks are related to the 
materialisation of contingent liabilities, such as the 
guarantee call under the banking asset protection 
scheme. 
 Spain™s structural deficit is projected to increase 
slightly and reach 3¼ in in 2020, before improving 
marginally in 2021. The debt
-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to decrease gradually to 96.0% by 2021. 
This decline will be d
riven by nominal GDP 
growth and falling interest expenditure, while the 
primary balance is likely to remain broadly 
unchanged around zero.

7. FRANCE
 GDP growth moderating slightly amid rising uncertainties
 94 GDP growth to be supported by domestic 
demand 
 Economic activity in France grew by 0.3% in the 
first two quarters of 2019. Investment remained 
buoyant, while private consum
ption slightly 
decelerated. The contribution of net exports to 
GDP growth was subdued in the first half of 2019.  
 Supported by domestic demand, GDP is forecast to 
grow by 1.3% in 2019 and 2020
 (109) and then by 
1.2% in 2021, levels which are close to the 
economy™s estimated potential growth rate. 
Following a deterioration at the end of 2018, 
economic sentiment and consumer confidence 
indicators have been improving and have stabilised 
above their historical means. However, rising 
external uncertainties are se
t to weigh on net trade 
and the external sector is not expected to provide 
any support to growth over the forecast horizon.
         Private consumption is forecast to pick up 
somewhat in 2020, boosted by gains in purchasing 
power, which increased strongly in 2018
-Q4 and 
2019-Q1 on the back of rising wages, falling 
unemployment and inflation and supportive fiscal 
measures. Household pur
chasing power is set to 
continue expanding in 2020 and 2021, albeit at a 
slower pace. This slowdown is explained by the 
planned adjustment in social benefits after 
                                                           (109) The GDP annual growth figures are non
-calendar adjusted. 
In 2020, calendar adjusted GDP growth would 
reach 1.2%.
 significant increases in 2019 and by the slowdown 
in job creation. Households are set to smo
oth their 
private consumption profile over the forecast 
horizon. Therefore, changes in purchasing power 
are expected to lead to higher precautionary 
savings in 2019 that should gradually fade away 
afterwards.  
 Stronger private consumption is expected to 
partially compensate for the slowdown in 
investment over the next few years. Corporate 
investment is still set to soften, but should continue 
to grow faster than economic activity in general, 
supported by favourable financing conditions. 
Household investmen
t is projected to remain 
subdued. Finally, public investment is forecast to 
accelerate in 2019 and weaken thereafter in line 
with the local electoral cycle. 
 After a strong contribution to economic activity in 
2018, net exports™ contribution to GDP growth 
is 
set to be broadly neutral over the next years. 
Imports are projected to accelerate in line with 
domestic demand, while export growth, which has 
slowed this year, is expected to remain rather flat 
as external demand loses momentum.
 Unemployment rate to c
ontinue falling and 
inflation to remain broadly stable
 Unemployment in France is forecast to dwindle in 
2019 and to continue falling afterwards, albeit at a 
slower pace. Inflation is forecast to drop to 1.3% in 
2019, from 2.1% in 2018, due to lower oil pri
ces 
and lower tax increases. Core inflation is also set 
to remain broadly stable and close to HICP.
 (110)  Risks are balanced
 Private consumption growth could prove stronger 
than expected due to the strong gains in purchasing 
power. However, the deterioratio
n of the external 
environment could weigh more than expected on 
corporate investment and exports.

forecast
Real GDP growth is set to decre
ase in 2019 before levelling out a rate close to the economy™s potential. 
Private consumption is forecast to pick up somewhat, partly compensating the slowdown in investment, 
while net exports should cease to support GDP growth. The public deficit is forec
ast to temporarily 
exceed 3% of GDP in 2019, but to fall to 2.2% in 2020 and 2021. 
 Euro Area Member States, France
  95 Stable structural deficit over the forecast 
horizon
 The headline deficit declined to 2.5% of GDP in 
2018. In 2019, it is expected to rise
 to 3.1% of 
GDP, unchanged from the spring forecast. The 
increase in 2019 is mainly due to the one
-off 
impact of 0.9% of GDP stemming from the 
transformation of the tax credit for competitiveness 
and employment (
crédit d'impôt pour la 
compétitivité et l'em
ploi, CICE
) into a permanent 
cut in employers™ social contributions. In turn, the 
measures, mainly on the revenue side, which are 
aimed to enhance the purchasing power of 
households, entail a net deficit
-increasing impact 
of around 0.3% of GDP in 2019. 
 In 2020, the deficit is projected to fall to 2.2% of 
GDP, unchanged from the spring estimate. This 
reduction mainly reflects the fading away of a one
-off impact, stemming from the tr
ansformation of 
the CICE in 2019. Additional measures aimed at 
further enhancing household purchasing power 
were adopted after the broad national debate 
ﬁGrand Débat Nationalﬂ in April. These measures 
include a EUR 5 billion reduction in the personal 
 inc
ome tax (0.2% of GDP), the indexation of 
pensions below EUR 2000 per month, and the 
increase in minimum pensions (both amounting to 
EUR 1.5 billion, or 0.1% of GDP). The deficit 
increasing impact of these measures is however, 
offset by a sizeable decline i
n the debt service due 
to low interest rates. Public expenditure in nominal 
terms, net of tax credits, is set to rise by 1.8%, 
which implies an increase in real terms of 0.6%. 
The projected reduction in the expenditure
-to-GDP 
ratio of 1.1
 pps. is mainly du
e to the 
transformation of the CICE (0.9 pps.), followed by 
the projected reduction in interest payments (0.2 
pps.). The structural balance, however, is set to 
improve only marginally.
 Under a no policy change assumption, the headline 
deficit is expected t
o remain stable, at 2.2% of 
GDP in 2021. The revenue and the expenditure
-to-GDP ratios are projected to decline by 0.3
 pps. and 
0.4
 pps., respectively. The fiscal stance is expected 
to be broadly neutral. In turn, public debt is set to 
rise from 98.4% in 2
018 to 98.9% of GDP in 2019 
and 2020, then to further increase to 99.2% of 
GDP by the end of the forecast horizon.

8. ITALY
 Struggling to escape the low
-growth doldrums
 96 Growth is only slowly gaining traction
 Italy™s economy has largel
y been stagnating since 
early 2018. In line with global trends, 
manufacturing weakened further this year, while 
exceptionally sharply falling inventories continued 
to curtail growth. Leading indicators do not 
suggest an imminent output recovery in the seco
nd 
half of 2019. In addition, there are growing signs 
that the weakness in the manufacturing sector has 
started to spread to services. However, favourable 
financing conditions and waning political 
uncertainty may support growth beyond the very 
near term. A
nnual average growth is projected at 
0.1%, taking also into account the revision of 
quarterly national accounts. In 2020, real GDP is 
set to rise by 0.4%, thanks in part to the presence 
of two more working days. In 2021, real output is 
expected to grow at 
0.7%, slightly above potential.
 Exports and modest domestic demand 
supporting subdued recovery
 Higher social transfers and falling energy prices 
are set to support private consumption, while the 
projected weakening of the labour market and 
subdued wage gro
wth are likely to dampen real 
disposable incomes and thus household spending. 
Alongside some positive signs from public 
investment, business surveys suggests that firms™ 
assessment of investment conditions are more 
favourable in the near
-term. Profit margi
ns have 
been falling, but fiscal incentives and favourable 
financing costs should be supporting factors. 
However, subdued demand prospects and recurrent 
global policy uncertainty are likely to prevent a 
meaningful rebound in business investment. Italian 
exports surprised on the upside in 2019 despite the 
sharp slowdown in global trade. However, in the 
wake of persisting trade tensions exporters are 
unlikely to reap the full benefit of the projected 
rise in export market growth, implying some 
moderate losses
 in market shares. The growth 
contribution of net exports is likely to remain 
broadly neutral over 2020
-2021, given that imports 
are also linked to the turning inventory cycle.
 Risks to the growth outlook remain skewed to the 
downside. Italy is exposed to 
a further weakening 
of the global economy and the potential worsening 
of financing conditions, given its high public debt.
    Employment unlikely to remain unscathed 
by 
weak economic activity
 The job market has remained resilient in the face 
of the recent economic slowdown. However, latest 
labour market data point to a deterioration. Falling 
labour productivity is likely to prompt employers 
to cut jobs or resort to sho
rt-time working 
schemes, as indicated by the rising number of 
workers covered by the wage guarantee fund 
(Cassa Integrazione Guadagni
). The jobless rate is 
unlikley to drop, also due to the new minimum 
income scheme that is set to induce progressively 
more
 people to officially register as unemployed.
 Falling oil prices are dampening HICP inflation
 Consumer price inflation is set to decrease to 0.6% 
this year on the back of lower energy prices, before 
gradually picking up to 1.1% by 2021. The 
existing slack 
in the labour market will prevent the 
build
-up of wage pressure. Pay rises are so far 
limited, as the wages of close to 50% of employees 
in the private sector are tied to labour agreements 
that expired or were extended at unchanged wages.

Italy™s economy stalled at the beginning of 2018 and still shows
 no signs of a meaningful recovery. In 
2020, growth is set to pick up modestly on the back of rising external demand and moderate household 
spending, though the latter will be partly dampened by a weakening labour market. Government deficit 
and debt are se
t to increase over the next years, amid weak economic growth and the rising costs of past 
measures. Consumer price inflation is set to decrease this year and pick up moderately in 2020
-2021.
 Euro Area Member States, Italy
  97 Government debt s
et to increase amid weak 
growth prospects
 The government headline deficit is expected to 
remain stable at 2.2% of GDP in 2019. 
Government revenues are set to benefit from a still 
resilient labour market and from several changes in 
the tax regime introduced
 with the 2019 budget. At 
the same time, the negative financial market 
developments observed in 2018 curbed revenues 
from taxes related to capital gains. Government 
spending is expected to increase following the 
introduction of a minimum income scheme and 
of 
several provisions broadening the possibilities for 
early retirement.
 In 2020, the government deficit is projected to rise 
to 2.3% of GDP. Introduced in spring 2019, the 
minimum income and early retirement schemes 
will start showing their full yearly cost from 2020, 
further increasing government spending. These 
projections a
lso assume that the renewal of public 
wage contracts for the period 2019
-2021 will be 
agreed by the end of next year, increasing the wage 
bill in 2020. Conversely, a new spending review 
together with a cut in government spending of 
EUR 1 billion planned as
 a safeguard clause will 
help to contain expenditure growth. Weaker labour 
market dynamics and the reduction of the tax 
wedge on labour planned in the 2020 draft budget 
are set to curb government revenues. At the same 
time, these are expected to benefit fr
om a review 
of environmental taxes planned for 2020 and from 
past measures against tax fraud, including 
compulsory electronic invoicing and the electronic 
transmission of receipts. The additional measures 
against tax fraud planned in the 2020 draft budget 
are also expected to support revenues, although the 
related yields are subject to some uncertainty.
 In 2021, the government headline deficit is 
expected to increase to 2.7% of GDP due to 
several measures included in the 2020 draft 
budget, including a furth
er reduction of the tax 
wedge on labour and stronger support to public 
and private investment. Given past repeals, this 
forecast does not consider the increase in VAT 
rates still legislated as a safeguard clause for 2021.
 The structural balance is expected to slightly 
improve from around 
-2½% of GDP in 2018 to 
around 
-2¼% of GDP in 2019, before deteriorating 
to around 
-3% of GDP by 2021. Italy™s debt
-to-GDP ratio is forecast to incre
ase from 134.8% in 
2018 to 137.4% in 2021, due to the weak nominal 
GDP growth and a deteriorating primary balance.

9. CYPRUS
 Growth momentum moderates
 98 Growth slows amid external headwinds 
 After reaching 4.1% in 2018, real GDP growth 
slowed down in the first half of this year. The 
weakness came mainly from the external 
environment, while domestic demand held up well. 
External headwinds are expected to continue, 
leading to more moderate growt
h over the forecast 
horizon, which is projected at 2.9% this year, 2.6% 
in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021. 
     Private consumption should continue to provide 
strong support for growth as real disposable 
income continues to rise. The unemployment rate 
fell in 2019, standing at 6.8% in August. 
Meanwhile, wages in the private sector have risen 
only moderately. This wa
s attributable to 
continued presence of slack in the labour market 
despite high employment rates in certain sectors, 
such as construction and tourism. Public sector 
wages, however, have increased much more 
prominently, notably reflecting increases in the 
wage bill for health care providers (with the launch 
of the national health system) and the gradual 
phasing out of wage cuts implemented during the 
crisis. These developments are likely to provide 
solid support for both private and public 
consumption. 
 Inve
stment in 2019 has been strong, particularly in 
construction. This sector has benefitted largely 
from the Citizenship by Investment scheme, which 
has brought in substantial foreign direct investment 
(FDI), concentrated in the real estate sector. The 
tighte
r requirements of the Scheme caused a 
frontloading of applications, thus also FDI in the 
first half of the year before their entry into force; 
hence, a deceleration in the second half of the year 
is expected. 
 Net exports were negative in the first half of
 2019 and are expected to continue to weigh on growth. 
Tourism, a flagship industry and major exporter of 
services, saw a fall in revenues, driven by several 
factors.  First, tourists from the UK 
- the most 
important tourism market for Cyprus 
Œ suffered 
from the depreciation of the pound sterling versus 
the euro. Second, competition from cheaper 
neighbouring destinations led to a decline in 
Russian tourist arrivals (the second largest 
market). Finally, the persisting air access problems 
led to a contraction
 of German arrivals by nearly 
one fifth. Imports, meanwhile, are set to increase 
alongside strong domestic demand.
 Looking forward, some of the above factors are set 
to continue, while slowing global demand coupled 
with the bankruptcy of the travel company
 Thomas 
Cook may further compound the situation in the 
tourism sector. Furthermore, the economy™s 
reliance on foreign funding leaves it heavily 
exposed to adverse external developments. 
 Inflation remains subdued and is expected to 
average 0.6% in 2019 and
 0.7% in 2020 and rise to 
1.3% in 2021. Inflationary pressures stem mainly 
from services and unprocessed food categories. 
Energy inflation is on a declining path following a 
period of significant increases. Core inflation 
remains subdued, albeit increasing
 reflecting 
overall moderate wage growth. Over the forecast 
horizon, inflation is expected to remain low due to 
the continued presence of slack in the labour 
market and the currently low oil price, which

-Real GDP growth and 
contributions, output gap
Cyprus™ economic expansion remains strong but is set to gradually moderate, mainly due to extern
al 
headwinds. Domestic demand is projected to stay the main driver of growth, supported by private 
consumption and an improving labour market. Meanwhile inflation should remain subdued. The general 
government budget is expected to remain in surplus and pub
lic debt to steadily decline from 2019 
onwards. Risks to the fiscal outlook are also mainly on the downside. 
 Euro Area Member States, Cyprus
  99 Public finances
 are back to budgetary 
surpluses
 The general government headline balance is 
expected to record a hefty surplus of around 3.7% 
of GDP in 2019, after a temporary deficit of 4.4% 
of GDP in 2018 that was due to the one
-off support 
measures related to the Cyp
rus Cooperative Bank 
sale. Cyprus™ fiscal performance is projected to 
remain strong, on the back of a still relatively 
strong GDP growth and improving labour market. 
After an expected surplus of 3.7% of GDP in 2019, 
the general government surplus is expect
ed to 
decrease to 2.6% in 2020 and 2.4% in 2021. 
 Government revenue is forecast to increase 
strongly in 2019 and in the next two years driven 
by strong tax collection and by a sizable rise in 
social security contributions due to higher 
contribution rates 
and to the introduction of the 
National Health Insurance System (NHIS). 
However, rising revenues will be more than offset 
by higher expenditure growth in 2020 and 2021. 
This is mostly due to the gradual reversal of wage 
cuts implemented during the crisis, 
the 
introduction of the Estia scheme to support non
-performing loan repayments, and changes in the 
 statistical treatment of a signature bonus for the 
exploration of hydrocarbons. The structural budget 
surplus is set to decline over the forecast period 
from 1½% of GDP in 2019 to
 ½% in 2020, mainly 
reflecting the large positive output gap.
 Risks to the fiscal outlook however are on the 
downside. Key risks include the court cases that 
could lead to the reversal of civil service pay cuts 
implemented during th
e crisis as well as the 
potential deficit of public healthcare providers 
during the first years of the NHIS. The potential 
realisation of contingent liabilities remains a major 
risk to public finances. Positive cash balances from 
the resulting Cyprus Coope
rative Bank (CCB) 
entities constitute an upside risk.
 Following a significant increase in government 
debt in 2018, due to the one
-off government 
support to the 
banking sector, the debt
-to-GDP 
ratio is projected to fall to 93.8% in 2019, to 
87.8% in 2020 and to 81.8% in 2021. The decrease 
is mainly due to projected primary budget 
surpluses, strong GDP growth and active debt 
management. Cyprus repaid in advance the
 Russian loan in September 2019 and plans to repay 
early the IMF loan in 2020.

 Growth slows amid weakening investment and exports
 100 Investment cycle cools off
 Latvia™s real GDP grew by 2.4% (y
-o-y) in the first 
half of the year, supported mainly by private 
consumption and slowing, but still strong 
investment. Growth is set to improve slightly in 
the second half tha
nks to a good harvest and 
favourable calendar effects. Yet, compared to 
2018, growth has slowed significantly, as the 
investment cycle is losing steam and exports face 
growing headwinds from main trading partners. 
While a strong labour market remains suppo
rtive 
of private consumption, public consumption is 
restrained because of tax cutting measures. On 
balance, GDP growth in Latvia is expected to 
reach 2.5% in 2019. 
    Private consumption set to maintain a healthy 
growth rate
 In 2020, real GDP growth is set to increase slightly 
to 2.6%. Private consumption growth is expected 
to increase slightly due to slowing inflation and a 
tax cut boosting real disposable incomes, but 
slowing employment growth and somewhat lower 
wage growth 
are set to work in the opposite 
direction. Investment growth is set to fade in 2020 
as EU fund inflows peak and private investment is 
likely to slow from the high output level attained 
in 2019. Despite bright prospects for agricultural 
products and service
s, export growth is expected to 
struggle in the face of weak demand in Latvia's 
main foreign markets. In 2021, real consumption 
should benefit from slowing inflation while 
investments are supported by the beginning of the 
construction of the Rail Baltica l
ine, a major 
project integrating the Baltic States with the rest of 
the European rail network. Export growth is 
expected to recover slightly, but the scope for 
positive surprises remains limited. The current 
account is set to remain balanced throughout the
 forecast horizon. 
 Labour market set to remain tight
 The slowdown of investment growth is set to 
relieve employment demand somewhat and 
therefore ease the pressure on the tight labour 
market in 2020 and 2021. However, as the labour 
force should continue t
o shrink, the unemployment 
rate is expected to decline further, albeit at a 
slower pace, falling to 6.4% by 2021. 
Consequently, wage growth is set to remain 
relatively high, but should slow somewhat in 2020 
in the absence of a minimum wage increase and 
fol
lowing a wage restraint in the public sector.  
 HICP inflation is set to reach around 3% in 2019, 
driven by rising food prices and growing cost of 
the utilities following energy price growth of the 
previous years. In 2020, inflation is set to slow to 
2.5% 
and then to 2.3% in 2021 as energy and food 
price growth flattens. 
 The risks to the forecast are tilted to the downside 
as the slowdown in investment and exports may 
spill over to the labour market and therefore 
negatively affect private consumption. More
over, 
the uncertainty related to the external environment 
could also impact export growth more sharply than 
currently forecast.

Latvia™s economic growth is set to slow down to 2.5% in 2019. Private consumption is expected to 
remain the main 
growth driver over the forecast horizon as investments are expected to slow further in 
2020 before picking up slightly in 2021. Export growth is set to remain modest due to weak external 
demand. Driven by increases in utility and food prices, inflation is 
forecast this year at 3.1% before 
cooling off in 2020 and 2021. The slowing investment is set to relieve labour demand somewhat, but the 
declining labour force is set to maintain a tight labour market. The government deficit is expected to 
remain at 0.6% o
f GDP through 2021. 
 Euro Area Member States, Latvia
  101 Budget deficit set to remain stable
 The general government deficit is forecast at 0.6% 
of GDP in 2019, improving slightly from 0
.7% in 
2018. Overall, tax collection has slightly exceeded 
projections with the exception of corporate income 
tax, the collection of which has considerably 
underperformed. Fiscal costs of the transition to 
the new corporate taxation regime appear larger 
than initially assumed. On the positive side, labour 
tax collection has been better than expected. 
Government spending, by contrast, is expected to 
be in line with the Commission™s earlier 
projections.
 For 2020, the government deficit is projected to 
remain 
at 0.6% of GDP. The budget plan includes 
0.6% of GDP worth of new policy measures, 
including wage increases for teachers and medical 
personnel, and an increase in non
-taxable 
allowance for personal income tax. These 
measures are mostly financed by realloca
ting 
resources from the existing budgetary envelopes.
 The budget also includes minor revenue
-increasing 
measures. Social payments and public sector 
wages are expected to drive expenditure growth, 
while public investment expenditure is set to fall 
somewhat
 after having surged over the last three 
years.
 Under a no
-policy change assumption, the 
government deficit is projected to remain at 0.6% 
of GDP in 2021. This is linked to an expected tax 
revenue growth in line with economic 
developments. Few policy chang
es are stipulated 
for 2021. Public expenditure growth is expected to 
remain strong, particularly for social spending and 
public sector wages. Latvia™s structural deficit is 
forecast to decrease from nearly 2% of GDP in 
2018 to 1% by 2021.
 The ratio of gove
rnment debt to GDP, estimated at 
36.4% in 2018, is forecast to decline to 32.9% by 
2021, as nominal GDP growth outpaces the 
government™s net borrowing.

11. LITHUANIA
 Continued GDP growth despite global slowdown
 102 The 
momentum of broad
-based growth 
 In the first half of 2019, Lithuania™s real GDP 
grew by 4.2% (y
-o-y) thanks to a combination of 
favourable factors. Growth in gross fixed capital 
formation was supported by investment in 
equipment and non
-residential constru
ction, which 
is partly linked to an acceleration in the use of EU 
funds. This, combined with an increase in public 
sector wages, contributed to government 
consumption growth. Furthermore, increasing 
employment and solid wage growth together with 
lower labo
ur taxation and positive household 
expectations, have kept the real growth of private 
consumption above 3% y
-o-y. At the same time, despite a deceleration in the 
exports of goods in the second quarter of 2019, 
double
-digit growth of trade in services kept 
net 
exports positive. This together with a positive 
balance of secondary income, helped the current 
account to remain in surplus.
     Domestic demand as the main 
driver of growth
 After a solid performance in the first half of 2019, 
annual real GDP growth is forecast to reach 3.8%, 
which is somewhat higher than in 2018. This is 
also partly due to projected better outcomes of the 
agricultural sector compared with las
t year™s 
results. 
 However, given the weak external environment 
expected in 2020 and 2021, growth is forecast to 
rely on domestic demand developments and is 
therefore projected to moderate to 2.4%. Private 
consumption growth is expected to remain strong, 
on the back of an increase in the untaxed 
allowance for personal income, pension 
indexation, as well as rising minimum wages and a 
strong labour market. Consumption growth is 
expected to remain above three percent over the 
forecast horizon. 
 EU
-funded inves
tments seem to have reached 
cruising speed this year and are projected to 
continue at a similar pace in 2020 and 2021. 
Private investment in equipment and intellectual 
property is set to remain an important growth 
factor as businesses continue to face labo
ur 
shortages and a high level of capacity utilisation. 
Due to less favourable financing conditions, 
residential construction is forecast to contribute 
less to investment growth in the coming years.
 A bleaker economic outlook in some of Lithuania's 
trading 
partners suggests a likely slowdown in 
export growth. Due to the high import content of 
exports and the dependence of investment on 
capital goods imports, the overall contribution of 
net exports to GDP growth is expected to be 
slightly negative in 2020 and
 2021. Positive net migration
 After a substantial increase in 2018, employment 
growth is expected to continue in 2019 and 2020. 
The main source of improvement is the historically 
high level of immigration, which is set to exceed 
the also high level of emig
ration. Though the 
number of vacancies remains high, to some extent, 
workers from non
-EU countries are helping to ease 
labour shortages, especially in the transportation 
and construction sectors. Overall, the 
unemployment rate, after declining significantl
y in 
2018, is projected to stand at 6.2% over the 
forecast horizon. At the same time, increases in the 
minimum wage and the tight labour market

Real GDP growth is projected to pick up slightly in 2019, as strong domestic demand and resilient 
exports continue to support the Lithuanian economy. Due to the weak outlook in major t
rading partners, 
however, growth will depend increasingly on domestic demand in 2020 and 2021. Inflation is forecast to 
moderate marginally in the coming years. Increasing government expenditure is set to reduce the 
general government surplus to zero.
 Euro Area Member States, Lithuania
  103 situation are expected to drive wages up, albeit 
more slowly than in 2018.
 Slightly lower inflation ahead
 Compar
ed to 2018, HICP inflation is forecast to 
decline marginally to 2.4% in 2019. Higher prices 
of some food products, coupled with increases in 
service prices, should prevent any sudden drop in 
inflation. In the coming years, wages should 
continue growing str
ongly enough to maintain a 
rise in service prices. However, this effect, 
together with scheduled increases in excise duties 
on alcohol and tobacco products, is expected to be 
somewhat counterbalanced by a projected fall in 
oil prices. Overall, in 2020 and 
2021, HICP 
inflation is forecast to decrease slightly to 2.2% 
and 2.1%, respectively.
 Modest fiscal outlook
 After three years in surplus, the general 
government budget is forecast to move into 
balance from 2019 onwards. The decline in the 
nominal balance 
in 2019 is linked to higher
-than
-planned government expenditures, particularly on 
wages and social benefits, as well as some other 
unplanned additional expenses. At the same time, 
the government revenue side is being negatively 
affected by the labour taxat
ion reform.
 Compared to 2018, the structural balance is 
projected to deteriorate substantially to 
-1½% in 
2019, followed by a gradual improvement to 
-½%  
in 2021 as the positive output gap diminishes.
 In preparation for an upcoming bond redemption 
in early 2020, Lithuania has been accumulating 
pre
-financing in 2019. Consequently, this is 
projected to drive the debt
-to-GDP ratio to 36.3%, 
compared with 34.1% in 2018. The positive effect 
of the scheduled bond redemption is set to be 
somewhat counterbalanced by a continuous 
accumulation of necessary funds for the same 
exercise in 2021 and 2022. Therefore, the debt
-to-GDP ratio is forecast to 
remain rather stable in the 
coming years.

 Steady growth ahead
 104 A moderate slowdown in 2019
 Real GDP growth in Luxembourg is expected to 
reach 2.6% in 2019, a moderate slowdown 
compared with the 3.1% estimate for 2018. 
Growth was mainly supported by private 
consumption, while investment rebounded
 following the sharp drop recorded last year. The 
contribution from non
-financial services exports 
improved after weakening somewhat in recent 
years, which, according to the national statistical 
institute, was most likely due to exceptional 
transactions by
 foreign
-owned, non
-financial 
corporations operating in Luxembourg.
 (111)      Overall, export growth remained subdued, 
reflecting weaker activity in the 
international 
financial sector, with net investment inflows to the 
fund industry stagnant amid increased uncertainty. 
In value terms, funds have continued to expand 
despite some volatility in global financial markets. 
Domestic banks have maintained their 
profitability, mostly by increasing lending. In sum, 
                                                           (111) This forecast does not integrate any assumption on the 
impact of those "exceptional 
transactions
". The
 latest 
revision (+0.8 pps
., on average, per year in real GDP 
between 2015 and 2018) might suggest a lower impact than 
previously envisaged, although this hypothesis cannot be 
confirmed due to insufficient information and given the 
frequent and substantial
 revisions to Luxembourg's national 
accounts.
 growth is set to continue at a steady pace at around 
2½% over the forecast horizon, driven by domestic 
demand, with a positive, though weak contribution 
from the external sector.
 Steady growth ahead
 Priva
te consumption, the main driver of domestic 
demand growth, is expected to slow down but 
remain strong after 2019, benefitting from 
favourable labour market conditions. In addition to 
budgetary measures, wages (and pensions) are 
expected to be raised by the
 year
-end 2019, once 
the indexation mechanism is triggered, and then 
again by the second quarter of 2021.
 As a small open economy with strong trade and 
financial links with international markets, 
Luxembourg remains highly exposed to external 
risks. Uncerta
inty, and any financial turmoil that 
may ensue, could result in a less benign outcome 
for Luxembourg™s economy.
 Strong labour market
 In 2019, employment growth is expected to remain 
around 3.7%, its highest rate since the crisis but 
job creation is likely 
to slow in 2020 and 2021. 
Employment among residents is projected to 
follow a broadly similar trajectory but at a lower 
level, with unemployment projected to remain 
around 5½% over the forecast period.
 A shift in inflation drivers 
 HICP inflation is foreca
st to fall to 1.7% in 2019 
and 1.6% in 2020 from 2.0% in 2018. Base effects 
related to lower energy inflation are expected to 
ease headline inflation in 2019 and 2020. 
Meanwhile, domestic price pressures, including 
from wage increases, are set to reassert 
their 
influence, although those will be partly offset by 
new measures, including free public transport on 
the national network by 2020. Headline inflation 
should reach 1.9% by 2021.

Real GDP is set to grow at a steady pace over the forecast period. With prospects for external trade 
weakening, growth is expected to be mainly driven by domes
tic demand, supported by stronger labour 
market conditions. Inflation is set to fall well below 2.0% in 2019 and 2020, reflecting base effects 
related to energy, before returning again to almost 2.0% in 2021. The headline budget surplus is 
forecast to decl

  105 The general government surplus is set to 
decline from a high level
 The gen
eral government surplus is expected to 
decline to 2.3% of GDP in 2019, from 2.7% of 
GDP in 2018. 
 In 2019, total revenues are projected to increase 
sharply underpinned by direct taxes and to a lesser 
extent by indirect taxes. Revenues from current 
taxes on
 income and wealth are expected to post a 
strong increase, in particular as revenues from 
corporate taxes have increased substantially, partly 
thanks to the introduction of the automatic tax 
declaration, which accelerates revenues collection. 
Payroll taxes
 also benefit from the dynamic labour 
market. VAT revenues are expected to increase in 
proportion to private consumption growth and will 
only partially be dampened by the loss of residual 
revenues from e
-commence transactions.
 In 2019 expenditure growth sh
ould also display a 
dynamic trend. In particular, a significant increase 
is projected for public investment. Recent 
measures announced, such as the compensation of 
employees and current transfers, are expected to 
boost expenditure by 0.4 pps. of GDP.
 The general government surplus is projected to 
decline further in 2020 when revenues are set to be 
impacted by recent government measures such as 
the introduction of free public transport and the 
impact of a further reduction in corporate tax
ation. 
The purchase of a military plane will substantially 
increase public investment. The surplus is 
projected then to fall to 1.4% of GDP in 2020. 
 On a no
-policy
-change scenario, the general 
government surplus is estimated to remain stable at 
1.4% of GD
P in 2021.
 The structural surplus is expected to decline in 
2019 and 2020 and remain broadly stable in 2021, 
while remaining comfortably positive.
 Luxembourg™s debt
-to-GDP rat
io is projected to 
decline to 19.6% in 2019, from 21.0% in 2018. It 
is expected to decline further over the forecast 
horizon as a favourable snowball effect will 
counterbalance the impact of the new debt 
issuance to finance the projected deficits of the 
central government.

13. MALTA
 Strong growth ahead, albeit at a slower pace
 106 Economic activity remains vibrant–
 After recording
 annual real GDP growth of close 
to 7% in 2017 and 2018, Malta™s economy started 
to show signs of cooling down in the first half of 
this year. In particular, private consumption 
growth significantly slowed down from the very 
high rate recorded in 2018. Dom
estic demand was 
underpinned by strong investment growth, which 
fuelled a strong rise in goods imports. Export 
growth remained subdued, also reflecting a 
slowdown in the tourism sector. After dropping in 
the second quarter of the year as a result of a 
sign
ificant decline in the industry confidence 
indicator, general economic sentiment has 
recovered but remains substantially lower than in 
recent years.
        –but 
growth is set to moderate
 Growth is expected to continue over the forecast 
horizon, but the pace of expansion is expected to 
gradually ease from 5% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2020 
and 3.9% in 2021. Private consumption growth is 
set to weaken but should remain abov
e its 
historical average, due to favourable labour market 
conditions. Large
-scale projects planned in the 
aviation, health and tourism sectors are set to boost 
private investment. Residential construction 
investment, by contrast, is expected to moderate 
after several years of strong growth. Investment 
growth is forecast to remain high until 2020 and to 
slow down thereafter, as a number of infrastructure 
projects reach completion. 
 Looking at the external side, export growth is 
expected to remain relatively 
low over the forecast 
horizon, reflecting a weaker external environment 
and elevated global uncertainty. As domestic 
demand remains high, imports are set to grow 
somewhat faster than exports in 2020, before 
decelerating in 2021. The current account surplus
, which peaked in 2017, is projected to gradually 
narrow but remain high. 
 Job creation slowing down
 The fast pace of economic growth in Malta has 
been coupled with strong employment growth and 
record
-low unemployment rate, which is projected 
to reach 3.5%
 in 2019, and to remain broadly 
stable over the forecast horizon. The recent steady 
increase in Malta™s labour supply, due to both 
higher domestic labour market participation and a 
net inflow of foreign workers, has kept wage 
pressures contained despite pe
rsistent labour and 
skill shortages. 
 As economic growth slows down, the fast pace of 
job creation is expected to moderate. At the same 
time, the labour market tightness is set to translate 
into increasing wage pressures and higher unit 
labour cost. 
 Gradu
al price increases and elevated external 
risks
 Headline inflation is projected to decline slightly 
from 1.7% in 2018 to 1.6% in 2019, as the rise in 
unprocessed food prices is expected to be offset by 
low prices for non
-energy industrial goods due to 
weak 
inflationary pressures in Malta™s trading 
partners. Inflation is set to pick up moderately and 
reach 1.7% in 2021, reflecting a recovery in 
imported goods™ prices. 
 As a small open economy, Malta™s economic 
outlook is subject to significant uncertainties

Malta™s economic performance continues to be strong, driven by robust domestic demand. Growth is 
expected to slow down from the high rates recorded in recent years, as private consump
tion and export 
growth moderate. Employment growth is set to continue, albeit at a slower pace, while the 
unemployment rate remains at a record low. The government is expected to maintain a budget surplus.

partners. Risks to the projections appear tilted to 
the downside as the weak global trade outlook and 
possible foreign exchange rate movements could 
further weigh on Malta™s exports. 
 Government to maintain
 surpluses
 In 2019, the government surplus is projected to 
decrease to 1.2% of GDP from 1.9% a year earlier. 
Strong demand
-driven economic growth 
underpinned by favourable labour market 
developments is projected to translate into robust 
tax revenues. Proce
eds from Malta™s citizenship 
scheme for foreigners, however, are expected to be 
lower than in recent years. Current expenditure is 
projected to grow swiftly in most categories with 
the exception of interest outlays, which are set to 
decrease. A hike in the
 government™s investment 
activity will be largely driven by the 
implementation of EU
-funded projects. The public 
investment
-to-GDP ratio is expected to exceed 4%. 
 In 2020, the government™s budget surplus is set to 
decline further to 1% of GDP. Despite som
e moderation, the economic environment remains 
favourable, which should support strong revenue 
 growth also when accounting for introduced fiscal 
measures (e.g. retaining advantages for first
-time 
home buyers and taxing overtime work at a lower 
rate). Pro
ceeds from the citizenship scheme are 
expected to increase. On the expenditure side, the 
government announced a series of social measures 
focussing on pensioners (e.g. supplementary aid to 
those over 65 and at risk of poverty), families (e.g. 
extension of 
free transport to all students, a grant 
for every new
-born) and benefits for disabled (e.g. 
a minimum wage for those who cannot work). The 
growth of public investment is projected to decline 
reflecting also a slowdown in implementation of 
EU
-financed proje
cts. Nevertheless, it is expected 
to remain above long
-term averages. Assuming no 
changes in policies, the surplus is projected to 
remain unchanged in 2021.
 The 
structural balance has reached a surplus of 
¾% of GDP in 2018. In 2019 it is estimated to 
decrease somewhat, reflecting a declining nominal 
surplus. In 2020 and 2021 it will improve again 
driven mainly by the output gap developments. 
The government debt
-to-GDP ratio is forecast to 
remain on a downward path, declining to some 
43% in 2019 and below 40% by the end of 2021.

14. THE 
NETHERLANDS
 Domestic demand remains resilient as growth moderates
 108 External demand 
weakens while domestic 
demand remains buoyant
 After several years of above
-potential growth, 
economic momentum in the Netherlands remained 
relatively solid in the first half of the year, with 
GDP increasing 0.4% (q
-o-q) in both the first and 
second quarter
. This was primarily driven by 
domestic demand as well as strong exports in the 
second quarter. GDP is forecast to grow at an 
annual rate of 1.7% in 2019 but growth is expected 
to be slower in the second half of the year, partly 
due to subdued prospects in
 major trading partners. 
 Net exports are expected to contribute negatively 
to growth over the forecast horizon. As a result, 
real GDP growth is set to slow to 1.3% in both 
2020 and 2021. Despite low financing costs, 
business investment is projected to wea
ken 
because of heightened (trade related) uncertainty. 
Residential investment growth is also expected to 
moderate, in part due to capacity constraints.
    At the same time, both private and public 
consumption are expected to remain resilient. 
Private consumption should enjoy the support of 
robust disposable income growth over the forecast 
horizon and the government™s fiscal stance is set to 
become more expans
ionary in 2020. 
 The current account surplus peaked at 11.2% of 
GDP last year, but is expected to decline gradually 
in 2019 and beyond as import growth outpaces 
export growth. This is a reflection of weak external 
demand and solid domestic demand, as well 
as 
declining gas exports.
 Labour market remains tight, wage growth 
picks up
 The labour participation rate is at a post
-crisis high 
in the Netherlands but employment growth, which 
is expected at 1.8% in 2019, is forecast to slow to 
0.3% in 2021. In conjunct
ion with dynamic rates 
of labour supply growth, this should lead to a 
modest uptick in the unemployment rate from 
3.5% in 2019 to 3.7% in 2020 and 4.1% in 2021. 
 With wage developments lagging the cycle, labour 
market tightness is now translating into high
er 
wage increases, contributing to rises in household 
disposable income and thereby fuelling private 
consumption. This is also supported by fiscal 
measures that lower the tax burden on labour 
income from 2020 onwards.
 Inflation set to moderate in 2020 and 
2021  Increases in indirect taxes in 2019 have pushed 
inflation up to 2.6% this year. For 2020 and 2021 
respectively, inflation is forecast to moderate to 
1.4% and 1.5%, as these indirect tax increases will 
no longer be reflected in the inflation figures a
nd 
the underlying trend is expected to remain flat. For 
2020, real wage growth is expected to entail a 
pick
-up in prices for services, although a lowering 
of energy related taxes for households should put 
downward pressure on energy inflation. 
 Fiscal expansion in 2020 
 The headline budget balance is forecast at 1.5% of 
GDP in 2019, and 0.5% and 0.4% of GDP in 2020 
and 2021 respectively. In 2019, higher government 
spending is offset by higher tax revenues, partly on

After solid growth of 2.6% in 2018, activity rema

-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
decrease by 0.4 pps. of GDP due to lower direct 
income taxes
. The combination of these revenue 
and expenditure measures is forecast to drive the 
headline surplus down by one percentage point in 
2020. In 2021, the headline surplus is set to decline 
to 0.4%, following further tax relief. 
 The structural budget balanc
e is projected to 
decline by about ½ percentage points of GDP, 
leading to a roughly balanced budget in structural 
terms in 2020 and 2021. 
 Government debt is forecast to fall below 50% of 
GDP in 2019 and to decline further to 47.1% in 
2020 and 45.6% in 20
21. Further reprivatisation of 
financial institutions may further lower the debt 
level in the years ahead.

15. AUSTRIA
 Growth to moderate but private consumption remains strong
 110 Domestic demand supports growth in 2019
 Data from the first half of 2019
 suggests that the 
strong economic growth momentum that Austria 
has been experiencing since 2016 is starting to 
diminish. After a still strong outturn in the first 
quarter of 2019, GDP growth came to a halt in the 
second quarter. This can be linked to a fa
ll in 
equipment investment as well as in goods and 
service exports. As imports fell to a lesser extent, 
the overall contribution of trade to GDP growth 
was negative. The decrease in exports is visible 
across sectors including chemicals but also 
machinery a
nd manufactured goods, which have 
been affected amongst others by the weaknesses in 
the German automotive sector. By contrast, 
investment in the construction sector remained 
firm, as population growth and favourable 
financing conditions support demand for 
housing. 
Private consumption increased markedly in the 
first half of 2019, supported by real wage 
increases, employment growth and the tax relief 
provided by the new ‚family bonus plus™.
 Growth to slow down but to remain robust
 In the second half of the ye
ar, economic growth in 
Austria is expected to experience a drag from the 
weaknesses in Germany and the global economy. 
Business sentiment indicators have been gradually 
deteriorating. These developments are expected to 
mainly affect industrial production, 
export and 
investment growth. However, export growth is set 
to recover somewhat in 2020 and 2021 as Austria 
is well
-placed to benefit from global growth, also 
thanks to its close links with the Central and 
Eastern European countries where growth is 
forecas
t to remain robust. As import growth is 
expected to decline, the contribution of trade to 
economic growth is set to turn positive again. GDP 
growth is set to stabilise at 1.4%. Supported by 
fiscal measures, private consumption is expected 
to remain strong 
and become the main driver of 
growth over the forecast horizon. Investment is set 
to slow down amid lower economic growth and as 
excess demand for housing is expected to wane.
    Still positive but slowing labour market 
dynamics
 Despite lower economic growth, employment 
growth remained firm in the first half of 2019 and 
the unemployment rate continued to fall. However, 
a decrease in the number of job vacancies sugges
ts 
that the jobs market may already have peaked. As 
the economy is set to cool, employment growth is 
expected to decrease while the unemployment rate 
is set to roughly stabilise at 4.6%. Wages are 
projected to increase more moderately, in line with 
the low
er GDP and inflation growth prospects.
 Inflation expected to moderate
 In 2019, a drop in oil prices is expected to lower 
headline HICP to 1.5%. As strong domestic 
demand should sustain domestic price pressures, 
the core inflation rate is set to exceed the 
headline 
rate over the forecast horizon. Overall, headline 
HICP is expected to remain around 1.6% in 2020 
and 2021.
 Public finances develop favourably
 Having improved to 0.2% of GDP in 2018, the 
government budget surplus is expected to expand 
further to 
0.4% of GDP in 2019. This positive 
development is largely due to higher

Economic growth in Austria is expected
 to moderate but remain robust in 2019 and to stabilise in 2020 
and 2021. Domestic demand is set to remain the main driver of growth, with strong private consumption 
supported by fiscal measures. Net exports are set to turn slightly positive in 2020 and 20
21. The 
government headline balance is set to improve further this year before diminishing in 2020 due to 
recently adopted fiscal measures and a less favourable macroeconomic outlook.
 Euro Area Member States, Austria
  111 expected revenues especially from the wage tax 
and assessed income tax, which is, in turn, the 
result of the strong employment growth in 2017 
and 2018.
 In 2020, the headline surpl
us is expected to narrow 
to 0.2% of GDP, which is largely due to a series of 
fiscal measures implemented in 2019. On the 
revenue side, increased tax credits and lower 
health contributions will relieve especially low
-income earners, while a staggered pensio
n increase 
will weigh on the expenditure side. This will 
support private consumption over the forecast 
horizon. Counter
-financing measures include taxes 
on the digital economy and measures against tax 
fraud. Overall, the budgetary impact of all 
measures am
ounts to 0.2% of GDP. 
 In 2021, the general government surplus is 
expected to improve again to 0.4% of GDP, on the 
back of stable economic growth. This is largely 
due to still robust tax revenues, and the fact that 
the budgetary impact of discretionary mea
sures 
falls mainly on to 2020. 
 Public debt is expected to continue its downward 
path and to decrease from 74.0% of GDP in 2018 
to 69.9% and 67.2% of GDP in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. This mainly reflects the favourable 
development of interest expenditu
res and the 
successful divestment of impaired assets.

16. PORTUGAL
 Buoyant investment supports growth
 112 Growth surpris
es on the upside
 Economic growth exceeded expectations in the 
first half of 2019 despite the weak external 
environment. GDP rose by 0.6% (q
-o-q) in each of 
the first two quarters of the year, setting up a more 
favourable outlook for the whole year. The 
exp
ected pace of moderation forecast in the 
summer, however, still looks likely, although it 
would now begin from a higher base. Taking into 
account the recent weakness in high frequency 
indicators and a further deterioration in external 
demand, GDP growth in
 Portugal is now forecast 
to moderate further from 2.4% in 2018 to 2.0% in 
2019 and 1.7% in both 2020 and 2021.
     Domestic demand is expected to remain a strong 
contributor to growth in 2019 due to a substantial 
rebound in investment in the first quarter of the 
year. Both private consumption and investment are 
projected to remain the major growth drivers in 
2020-2021, albeit at a diminishing pace. The 
expected mod
eration in private consumption is 
linked to the recent slowdown in job creation. 
Investment is facing a decline in business 
sentiment, particularly in the industrial sector, but 
looks set to benefit from the absorption of EU 
funding over the forecast horiz
on. On the supply 
side, the strong performance in services and 
construction should continue to offset the weak 
industrial performance.
 Imports outpace exports
 In 2019, imports are projected to increase much 
faster than exports for the second year in a row.
 This is mainly due to strong investment demand 
and is set to continue over the forecast horizon, 
triggering a significant deterioration in the 
country™s external balance. The current account 
balance has been revised upwards for the last 
several years, but
 is set to worsen from a surplus of 
0.1% of GDP in 2018 to a deficit of around 1% by 
2021. This reflects a significant widening in the 
deficit for trade in goods, which is set to be only 
partly offset by primary and secondary income 
where the net flows are
 expected to benefit from 
lower interest payments to foreign creditors and 
higher receipts from EU structural funds. Trade in 
services is set to retain a stable surplus of around 
8% of GDP throughout the whole forecast period, 
thanks to the strong performa
nce in tourism.
 Employment growth slows
 Employment growth has slowed down and wage 
growth picked
-up since the beginning of 2019, as 
the slack in the labour market has declined 
substantially. This is expected to have a positive 
impact on labour productivity
 and to slightly 
weaken the growth in unit labour costs over the 
forecast horizon. The unemployment rate is 
forecast to decrease at a moderate pace to 5.6% by 
2021 with services and construction being the 
major contributors to job creation.
 Inflation drops
 substantially
 Annual HICP inflation dropped from 1.2% in 2018 
to 
-0.3% in the third quarter of 2019. The 
downturn reflects a significant decline in energy 
prices, including different regulatory components 
of electricity tariffs, as well as lower prices of
 other administrative services such as public 
transport and telecommunications. In addition,

Economic growth is expected to moderate from 2.4% in 2018 to 2.0% in 2019 and 1.7% in both 2020 
and 2021, driven by buoyant investment but weighed down by foreign trade. The general govern
ment 
headline balance and debt
-to-GDP ratio are expected to continue benefiting from economic growth and 
favourable financing conditions. The structural balance is forecast to slightly improve in 2019 and 
remain broadly unchanged thereafter.
 Euro Area Member States, Portugal
  113 core inflation has been contained by a continuous 
decline in the prices of industrial goods and a 
temporary drop in accommodation prices. Inflation 
is forecast to 
reach an annual average of 0.3% in 
2019 and to increase somewhat in the coming 
years with core inflation staying slightly above the 
headline rate.
 Public finances benefit from resilient domestic 
demand and favourable financing conditions
 The general govern
ment headline deficit is 
projected to decrease to 0.1% of GDP in 2019, 
helped by still buoyant cyclical revenue, 
decreasing interest expenditure and lower
-than
- budgeted public investment. It is, however, 
negatively impacted by a further activation of the 
Novo Banco contingent capital mechanism (0.6% 
of GDP). Excluding this and other one
-offs, the 
government balance is set to reach a surplus of 
0.5% of GDP. As a result, the structural balance is 
projected to improve by about ¼% of GDP in 
2019, while the str
uctural primary balance is 
expected to remain broadly unchanged.
 Under a no
-policy
-change assumption, and in the 
absence of a fully
-fledged Draft Budgetary Plan
 for 2020 (due to the recent general elections), the 
headline balance is projected to improve t
o 0.0% 
of GDP in 2020. At the same time, the headline 
balance net of one
-offs (mainly a further deficit
-increasing impact of 0.3% of GDP from the Novo 
Banco contingent capital mechanism) is set to 
remain broadly unchanged at a surplus of 0.4% of 
GDP. As th
e deficit
-increasing carry
-over impact 
of past discretionary fiscal policy measures is 
projected to be roughly offset by further savings in 
interest expenditure, the structural balance is 
projected to remain broadly stable in 2020. The 
headline balance is 
set to improve to 0.6% of GDP 
in 2021 while the structural balance is set to 
remain broadly unchanged. The structural primary 
balance is forecast to worsen by about ½% of GDP 
over the forecast horizon. Risks are tilted to the 
downside, linked to uncertaint
ies surrounding the 
macroeconomic outlook and the potential further 
impact of bank support measures.
 The public debt
-to-GDP ratio is set to continue 
declining 
from 122.2% in 2018 to 119.5% in 2019, 
117.1% in 2020 and 113.7% in 2021, mainly due 
to continuous primary surpluses and favourable 
growth

 Growth cooling down but remaining robust
 114 Slowdown in the first half of 2019
 In the first half of 2019, Slovenia™s economy grew 
by 3.0% compare
d to the first half of 2018 (or 
0.9% compared to the previous six months). This 
compares with a (revised) growth of 4.1% in 2018. 
Domestic demand growth was driven by 
investment spending, while private consumption 
grew somewhat slower. Residential construc
tion 
grew at a strong pace (13.8%) while investment in 
machinery and equipment grew more modestly 
(3.6% on half year
-on-half year). Exports grew by 
8.6%, slightly below import growth, which stood 
at 9.9%.
 Economic sentiment worsened over the first nine 
mon
ths of 2019. Taking into account the 
slowdown in Slovenia™s main export markets, 
economic growth in the second half of the year is 
projected to lose further momentum. Real GDP 
growth is now forecast to fall to 2.6% in 2019, 
compared to 3.1% in the spring f
orecast.
 Growth expectations lower for 2020 and 2021
 GDP growth is forecast to average 2.7% in both 
2020 and 2021. Growth is expected to continue to 
be driven by domestic demand, with a negative 
contribution from net exports over the forecast 
horizon. Dome
stic demand is expected to be 
supported by continued increases in employment 
and wages, as well as favourable bank lending 
conditions. Investment growth is projected to 
continue at around the same pace as this year, 
mainly driven by construction investment
. Housing 
prices have risen rapidly and supply has been 
constrained so far, further supporting the expected 
pick
-up in housing construction. In the public 
sector, the uptake of EU funds is forecast to 
increase further as the programming period draws 
to a c
lose.
 While export growth was boosted by one
-off 
factors in 2019, it is expected to be significantly 
lower in 2020 and 2021, at 4.9% and 4.6%, 
respectively. This lower growth path is explained 
by lower demand from export markets, while 
Slovenia™s price com
petitiveness is expected to 
remain strong with labour cost growth relatively 
moderate compared to its trading partners. Imports 
are expected to continue growing more quickly 
than exports. Slovenia™s current account surplus is 
projected to decline to 5.1% o
f GDP in 2021 after 
reaching 5.8% in 2019.
    Negative risks to the growth mainly stem from the 
external outlook. A sharper
-than
-expected 
slowdown in export demand
 growth would not 
only affect exports but also business investment. 
On the upside, household consumption could 
increase faster than currently projected as the 
saving rate remains high.
 Labour market still strong
 In 2019, employment is expected to grow by 2
.3% 
and to slow down somewhat over the forecast 
period. An inflow of foreign workers and a rising 
participation rate should help alleviate labour 
supply constraints to some extent. The 
unemployment rate is projected to fall to 4.4% in 
2019 and to stabilise
 at 4.2% in the following 
years. Growth of compensation per employee is 
expected to average 3.6% over the forecast 
horizon.

Economic growt
h in Slovenia slowed down in the first half of 2019 on the back of weakening foreign 
demand, and it is expected to remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon. Domestic demand is 
expected to remain strong. Inflation is projected to increase slightly in
 2020 and 2021. The government 
budget balance is forecast to remain in surplus, with a slightly improving structural balance position in 
the coming years.
 Euro 
Area Member States, Slovenia
  115 At 1.8%, HICP inflation is projected to be lower in 
2019 than it was in 2018, mainly due to the 
slowdown in energy and food price in
flation. 
Inflation is expected to modestly increase 
Œ to 
1.9% in 2020 and 2.0% in 2021. 
 General government budget remains in surplus
 In 2018, Slovenia™s general government surplus 
increased to 0.8% of GDP from a balanced budget 
in 2017, driven by particularly strong revenue 
growth. A widening positive output gap led to a 
small deterioration in the structural deficit to about 
2/3% of GDP
. Over the forecast horizon, the 
headline surplus is expected to be at around 0.5% 
of GDP, while the structural deficit is projected to 
deteriorate in 2019 and to gradually improve 
thereafter. 
 In 2019, tax revenues are expected to grow more 
slowly than in
 the year before due to weaker 
domestic demand growth and a tax exemption on 
the annual holiday allowance. Expenditure is 
expected to grow faster than revenues. Next to the 
significant public sector pay rise negotiated with 
labour unions at the end of 2018
, social transfers 
are forecast to be among the main drivers of 
expenditure growth. Public investment is also 
projected to increase, although at a lower pace than 
in 2018. 
 In 2020, tax revenue growth is forecast to remain 
moderate, due to changes adopted 
to reduce the tax 
burden on labour. Higher social transfers, further 
public sector pay rises and higher absorption of EU 
funds will drive expenditure growth. In 2021, 
somewhat strengthening private consumption and 
higher wages should continue to support th
e surplus. 
 The downside risks to public finances stem from 
expenditure pressures, particularly on wages and 
social benefits, and the possibility of unexpected 
one
-offs due to unfavourable court rulings. Lower
-than
-projected economic growth could put 
downw
ard pressure on revenues.
 Slovenia™s debt
-to-GDP ratio has been on a 
declining path since its peak at 82.6% in 2015. 
Supported by the low interest rate environment, 
active publi
c debt management, the general 
government surplus and privatisation proceeds, the 
ratio is expected to decrease significantly from 
70.4% in 2018 to 63.1% in 2020 and to fall below 
the 60% threshold in 2021.

18. SLOVAKIA
 Strong growth set to decelerate to more sustainable levels
 116 Growth slows markedly
 After Slovakia™s economy expanded by 4.0% in 
2018, real GDP growth is forecast to slow 
markedly to 2.7% in 2019 and then to remain at 
similar rates of 2.6% in 2020 and 2.7% in 2021. 
On the back of strong wage increases and record
-low unemployment, private consumption will 
continue to be a significant sour
ce of GDP growth 
over the forecast horizon. Weaker demand in key 
EU trading partners is projected to take its toll on 
exports, particularly in 2019. Investment growth is 
expected to normalise after sluggish growth in the 
first half of 2019.
    Exports hit by weak trade outlook
 As a very open economy, Slovakia™s exports are 
registering the impact of slowing foreign demand 
throughout 2019. Temporary factors, such as 
changes and delays in production in Slovakia™s 
large, export
-focused automotive sector, have 
exacerbated the slowdown. Exports are thus likely 
to gradually pick up thereafter and expand by 
around 4.5% in 2021. In a similar pattern, the trade 
balance is pro
jected to dip into negative territory in 
2019, but to slowly recover in 2020
-2021, when 
Slovakia is likely to gain export market shares. 
However, this recovery remains uncertain and will 
depend on prospects in Slovakia™s key trading 
partners, and any devel
opments affecting the car 
industry, such as the possible imposition of U.S. 
tariffs.
 Wage growth to support spending
 After years of strong employment growth, the rate 
of job creation has been slowing in 2019 and may 
continue doing so in 2020
-2021, in line 
with the 
more subdued economic outlook. The 
unemployment rate is forecast to decrease slightly 
to a new record low of 5.9% in 2019 and to hover 
around this rate throughout 2020
-2021. While the 
positive effect from job creation on household 
disposable incom
e is expected to fade, strong wage 
growth should prop up earnings and incomes. 
After strengthening in 2019 on the back of a tight 
labour market and supported by strong salary 
increases in the public sector, wage growth is set to 
ease slightly in 2020
-2021. In view of the low 
unemployment risk and supportive financial 
conditions, this should continue to bolster 
consumer spending.
 Demand pressures will drive inflation
 HICP inflation is forecast to remain slightly 
elevated over the forecast horizon, first risi
ng to 
2.7% in 2019, and then moderating to 2.5% in 
2020 and 2.2% in 2021. Services, food prices and 
energy are all expected to contribute substantially 
to overall inflation. Services price inflation is 
expected to remain elevated as a result of rapid 
wage 
growth. Moreover, increases in regulated 
energy prices will contribute to HICP inflation in 
2019. Food prices are likely to grow at a high rate 
in 2019 but to moderate somewhat thereafter.
 Government deficit expected to increase
 Slovakia™s general governme
nt deficit in 2018 rose

Slovakia™s brisk economic expansion is expected to give way to slower growth from 2019 onwards. 
Though decelerating, domestic demand is set to drive growth, with private consumption backed by 
buoyant real wage increa
ses. Investment is forecast to normalise after sluggish growth in the first half 
of 2019. Net trade is forecast to weigh on growth in 2019 but to contribute positively in subsequent 
years. Consumer price inflation is expected to be fuelled by wage increase
s and robust private demand, 
but to moderate over the forecast period. The general government deficit is forecast to grow, mostly due 
to increases in public wages and social benefits.
 Euro Area Member States, Slovakia
  117 deterioration took place against the background of 
fast revenue growth and swift economic 
expansion. High transfers from the EU also 
boosted revenues. On the expenditure side, these 
transfers c
orresponded to higher current transfers, 
subsidies, and compensation of public employees. 
Gross fixed capital formation increased 
significantly for the central and local government. 
On the other hand, intermediate consumption grew 
moderately and interest s
pending fell. Overall, the 
consolidation effort slowed in 2018, with the 
structural balance deteriorating to around 
-134% of 
GDP.
 In 2019, the headline deficit is expected to 
decrease to 0.9% of GDP, with total revenues and 
expenditure changing slightly. 
Buoyant private 
consumption and the strong labour market are 
expected to support VAT receipts, income taxes 
and social contributions. On the expenditure side, 
the largest spending increases are expected for 
employee compensation and social benefits. These 
will be partially counterbalanced by developments 
in investment and interest spending. In structural 
terms, the general government balance will 
improve by around 0.1
 pps.
 In 2020, the general government deficit is expected 
to increase to 1.2% of GDP due t
o the introduction 
of government fiscal measures decreasing the tax 
burden and introducing minimum pensions. 
The
 fiscal expansion is dampened by restrained 
investment and measures to enhance tax collection. 
A discussion is ongoing regarding some further 
potential measures. The structural balance is 
projected to deteriorate by 0.2% of GDP to nearly 
-1.8% of GDP.
 In 2021, the headline deficit is forecast to rise by 
0.1%
 of GDP. The use of EU funding for 
investment is expected to increase as the end of the 
pro
gramming period approaches. Risks to the 
fiscal outlook are tilted to the downside, linked to 
uncertainties in macroeconomic developments and 
insufficiently specified austerity measures to 
achieve the set fiscal targets.
 The general government debt
-to-GDP 
ratio is 
forecast to remain on a declining path, thanks to 
the pace of nominal economic growth. It is 
projected to decline to 48.1% this year, 47.3% in 
2020, and 46.9% in 2021.

19. FINLAND
 Outlook subdued as cycle matures
 118 Economic growth to ease
 Finland™s real GDP gro
wth is expected to reach 
1.4% this year, after having already decelerated in 
2018. Amid weakening external demand and rising 
uncertainties, most high
-frequency indicators point 
to a gradual slowdown in 2019 and 2020. Growth 
is expected to be broad
-based th
is year, with 
positive and balanced contributions from all 
components. In 2020 and 2021, GDP growth is 
forecast to stay close to 1%, as the contribution 
from net exports turns negative.  
 Domestically driven growth in 2020 and 2021
 Private consumption is e
xpected to remain the 
main driver of growth, fuelled by the expected rise 
in wage income and modest increases in 
employment. Public consumption is set to 
contribute to growth more than in recent years, as 
the new government plans to increase spending. 
 Inv
estment is expected to slow down in 2020, in 
particular its construction component. As indicated 
by the decline in the number of new housing 
permits requested and project starts, it is likely that 
residential construction growth will turn negative 
next yea
r. This might be partially compensated by 
public infrastructure projects and investment in 
machinery and equipment but investment is likely 
to remain subdued overall.
 Exports are forecast to improve in line with the 
expected slow recovery in demand in Finl
and™s 
main trading partners, but only gradually. Imports 
should follow a similar path but its growth rate is 
expected to outpace exports, leading to a slight 
deterioration in the trade balance. 
 Mild employment growth and low inflation
 Wage increases are l
ikely to outpace productivity 
growth as the unemployment rate nears its 
structural level. While the outlook for the labour 
market is still positive, further sizeable 
employment increases are unlikely. The expected 
rise in real income should boost household
 disposable income and help the household saving 
rate to recover.
 Inflation remained low and below the euro area 
average in 2019. The pass
-through from higher 
wages into services was smaller than in the past. 
This, coupled with expected low energy prices 
implies that the period of low inflation is likely to 
continue over the forecast horizon.
    Risks are tilted to the downside
 Being a small open economy, Finland is 
vulnerable 
to disruptions in trade, which would further lower 
demand in Finland™s main trading partners. 
Domestically, the slowdown in residential 
construction could turn out to be even stronger 
than anticipated.
 Expansionary fiscal stance
 The general government headline balance is 
forecast to deteriorate from 
-0.8 % of GDP in 2018 
to 
-1.1% of GDP in 2019, revised down from 
 -0.4% of GDP at the time of the spring forecast. 
While economic and employment developments 
should continue to support
 tax revenues and keep a 
lid on expenditures linked to social benefits, the 
outlook for government revenue has clearly 
deteriorated in line with the cyclical developments.

Economic growth, after solid 2019, is expected to moderate in 2020 as residential investment declines. 
Unemployment is set to fall gradually to its structura
l level while inflation is expected to remain low. 
The outlook for the general government balance has deteriorated substantially due to the decelerating 
economy and the government™s expansionary fiscal plans. 
 Euro Area Member States, Finland
  119 local authorities in the first half of
 2019 has further 
deteriorated the projected balance. Finally, recent 
statistical revisions have also resulted in a 
deterioration of the balance for 2018 by 0.1 
percentage points.
 The general government balance is forecast to 
further deteriorate to 
-1.4% o
f GDP in 2020 and 
Œ under a no
-policy
-change assumption 
Œ to 
-1.6% of 
GDP in 2021. In early October, the Rinne 
government adopted new medium
-term fiscal 
plans underpinning the government™s programme 
and the draft budget for 2020. Starting from 2020, 
the go
vernment plans to increase spending in 
several areas, including education, social security, 
health and long term care as well as its investment 
in infrastructure (in particular road and rail 
transport networks). These plans, if fully 
implemented, are proje
cted to lead to a substantial 
increase in government expenditure that would 
only partially be funded by revenue increasing 
measures. Excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and 
fuel will be raised as of 2020, but many other 
revenue
-increasing  measures that were 
announced 
will be specified and adopted only later during the
 government term. In addition, some revenue
-increasing measures from the 2017 
Competitiveness Pact are to kick in in 2020, but 
the impact of those is offset by new plans to cut 
income taxes paid
 by low and middle
-income 
earners. Overall, the discretionary fiscal measures 
leave a substantial gap between expenditure and 
revenues, resulting in a growing deficit. 
 The structural budget balance is forecast to 
deteriorate from about 
-1% of GDP in 2018 
to 
around 
-1½% in 2019. As the output gap will be 
gradually closing, the structural balance is 
projected to remain around the same level in 2020 
and 2021. 
 The general government debt
-to-GDP ratio is set 
to increase through 2021 but it will remain below

 Moderate growth 
ahead
 122 Moderate GDP growth ahead
 Following real GDP gro
wth of just over 3% in 
2018, growth dynamics remained strong in the first 
half of 2019, registering 1.1% in the first quarter 
and 0.9% in the second (q
-o-q). Private 
consumption contributed strongly to the overall 
expansion on the back of rapid wage growth
 and 
high employment. Investment in machinery and 
equipment performed strongly, supported by 
favourable financing conditions and buoyant 
public investment activity. Aggregate investment, 
however, grew more moderately due to 
underperformance of other invest
ment 
components.
 Exports maintained positive annual growth in the 
first quarter, continuing the favourable trend from 
the second half of 2018. However, as external 
demand has continued to falter, exports declined in 
the second quarter and became more volat
ile. 
Imports contracted sharply in the second quarter 
due to an abrupt drop in imports of crude oil, as 
inventories were run down.
 Real GDP growth is forecast to reach 3.6% in 
2019, and then slow down to 3% in 2020 and 2.9% 
in 2021. Exports are set to regi
ster small negative 
growth in 2019 and regain modest growth rates 
ahead, in line with foreign demand developments. 
Domestic demand is expected to continue to lose 
some growth momentum, but remain the main 
growth driver. A limited room for further 
improveme
nt in employment is set to weigh on 
household consumption dynamics while real wage 
increases support private spending. In 2019 
aggregate investment should posit only modest 
expansion due to the relatively subdued 
performance in the first half of the year. 
In the next 
two years investment is expected to regain some 
momentum but grow at a moderate pace, against 
the backdrop of elevated economic uncertainty 
abroad and somewhat worsened growth prospects.
 Risks to the forecast are mainly on the downside, 
associa
ted with a potential sharp and protracted 
deterioration of external demand from the major 
trading partners and second
-round effects through 
higher unemployment and lower domestic demand.
 Temporary factors influence inflation
 Annual headline inflation is fo
recast at 2.4% in 
2019. Price dynamics have been volatile since the 
beginning of the year, accelerating to 3.1% in 
April and declining to 1.6% in September. Food 
prices have contributed strongly to inflation, 
influenced by the poor harvest in 2018 and the 
spread of African swine fever beginning in May 
2019. Energy inflation was influenced upwards by 
electricity price hikes in the middle of the year and 
downwards by lower petrol prices in the second 
half of the year. Services inflation outpaced that of 
total
 goods on the back of strong wage growth and 
factors specific to catering services, such as more 
pronounced seasonality and higher prices of food. 
Owing to the gradual fading of temporary factors 
and the further decline in oil prices, inflation is set 
to d
ecrease to 1.6% in 2020 and increase again to 
2.1% in 2021.
       Unemployment falls to historic lows
 The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.4% 
in 2019, dow
n from 5.2% in 2018. Over the 
following two years it is set to drop further to 4.1% 
and 4.0%, respectively. The employment gains

  123 forecast for 2019 are likely to stall in 2020 and to 
turn negative in 2021 due to Bulgaria™s shrinking 
labour force. Real wages
 are forecast to increase 
strongly in 2019, owing to the historically low 
unemployment turnout and planned minimum and 
public sector wage increases. Wage growth is 
expected to remain strong in 2020 and 2021, 
although likely to moderate compared to this yea
r. Sustained budget surpluses
 The general government surplus, is forecast at 
1.1% of GDP in 2019, lower than in 2018. Budget 
revenue is set to strengthen further this year mainly 
thanks to strong social contributions and revenues 
from electricity fees. Gov
ernment expenditure, 
however, seems to be rising faster than revenues. 
This is mainly due to increases in some current 
expenditure categories such as wages and social 
expenditure, as well as an expected pickup in 
public investment.
 
pected to remain positive 
during the forecast period. Revenue collection is 
projected to remain strong, in line with 
macroeconomic and labour market developments.
 Wage increases in the public sector, which have
 been announced for 2020 and high public 
inve
stment as a result of both national and EU
-financed projects will fuel an increase in total 
spending.The budget surplus is thus expected to 
reduce to 0.9% of GDP in 2020 and remain at the 
same level in 2021.
 The budgetary forecast is subject to upside risk
s. 
The public investment plans remain ambitious. At 
the same time, revenue collection seems to have 
gained some momentum and may continue to 
exceed expectations in the coming years. 
 In structural terms, the budget surplus is set to drop 
from 1
2/3% of GDP 
in 2018 to around 1% of GDP 
in 2019 and further reduce during 2020 and 2021, 
reflecting the changes in the headline balance and 
the positive and increasing output gap. Interest 
spending is decreasing. On the other hand, the 
government plans some pre
-financ
ing of its 
medium term debt, so the pace at which Bulgaria™s 
public debt is set to fall is likely to slow despite the 
primary surplus. The public debt
-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to fall from 22.3% in 2018, to 21.1% in 
2019, 19.9% in 2020 and 18.6% in 2021.

21. CZECHIA
 Growth remains robust but external risks are starting to materialise
 124 Growth is driven by private consumption 
 Czechia™s economy is forecast to grow by 2.5% 
this year
, down from 3% in 2018. Growth is 
expected to continue slowing in 2020 and 2021 to 
2.2% and 2.1%, respectively, which is broadly in 
line with the economy™s estimated potential growth 
rate. On the back of a tight labour market, strong 
wage growth and robust
 consumer confidence will 
continue to support household consumption 
throughout the forecast horizon. Government 
consumption is also expected to remain strong, 
influenced by the ending of the current 
programming period for EU funds. Private 
investment growt
h and trade are expected to 
moderate significantly, influenced by weaker 
global demand and geopolitical uncertainties. A 
larger dampening effect on imports, due to a 
slowdown in production and investment, is 
expected to mean that the external balance will 
contribute positively to GDP growth over the 
forecast horizon. 
    Private investment decelerates, external risks 
start to materialise
 After strong growth in 2018, 
investment is likely 
to abate in 2019 and 2020, before slightly 
rebounding in 2021 thanks to an expected ease in 
the external environment. Investment in equipment 
will be particularly affected in the near term, as the 
growth of industrial production was mu
ted in the 
first three quarters of 2019. While the automotive 
industry remains resilient, other manufacturing 
sectors have witnessed a significant drop in 
economic activity. As manufacturing sentiment is 
rather weak, new orders have been declining 
througho
ut 2019. On the other hand, whereas 
labour market pressures may be slightly easing, the 
job market remains very tight and companies are 
still struggling to fill job vacancies (currently 1.6 
job vacancies per unemployed worker). 
Unemployment is at very low 
levels and is forecast 
to remain at 2.1% in 2019, 2.2% in 2020 and 2.3% 
in 2021. 
 The recent drop in investment and industrial 
production has been mostly due to external 
uncertainties, as the Czech industrial sector is very 
dependent on the external sector
. Slowing demand 
from euro area trading partners, global trade 
disruptions and revised standards in the automotive 
industry are weighing on investment decisions. In 
addition, the competitiveness of Czech exports 
may have already been negatively affected by
 the 
fast pace of real wage growth since 2016. As 
imports are expected to grow more slowly than 
exports due to weaker investment and production, 
the trade balance will likely remain positive 
throughout the forecast horizon.
 Inflation is expected to fall to
wards target after 
the rise in 2019
 HICP inflation is forecast to increase to 2.6% in 
2019, above the Czech National Bank's target of 
2%, influenced by steeper energy, services and 
processed food prices. For 2020 and 2021, 
inflation is expected to moderate
 slightly and reach 
2.3% and 2.0%, respectively.

Czechia™s long economic expansion is expected to continue but its rate of growth is set
 to slow. 
Domestic demand remains the key growth driver, boosted by high wage increases in a tight labour 
market. The near
-term outlook for private investment remains subdued and coincides with weakening 
trade activity. Inflation is forecast to remain with
in the tolerance band and to fall towards the central 
bank™s 2% target rate. Public finances are expected to remain in balance throughout the forecast 
horizon.

  125 Public finances are likely to remain in balance
 In 2019, the general government balance is 
expected to remain in surplus for the fourth year in 
a row. However, moderating economic growth and 
a significant increase in public expenditure are 
expected to reduce the surplus to around 0.2% of 
GDP. While loca
l governments and the social 
security funds continue to run a surplus, the central 
government is expected to post a slight deficit. 
Similar to 2018, income tax receipts and social 
contributions are projected to be the main drivers 
of revenue developments. 
On the expenditure side, 
public wages, pensions and subsidies will continue 
to increase firmly. Public investment, on the other 
hand, is expected to moderate compared to the 
very high level seen in 2018. 
 This picture broadly holds true over the entire 
for
ecast horizon, despite the general balance being 
expected to turn slightly negative, at around 
-0.1% 
of GDP and 
-0.3% of GDP, in 2020 and 2021 
respectively. In 2020, tax revenues are likely to
 benefit from the rollout of the final phases of the 
electronic
 registration of sales. In addition, there 
are new discretionary measures planned on the 
revenue side, such as an increase in excise duties 
for alcohol and tobacco products and the 
introduction of a new digital services tax for large 
corporations. Nonethel
ess, revenue growth is 
expected to continue to lag behind expenditure 
growth. The increase in public wages and social 
transfers is expected to continue, albeit at a more 
moderate pace compared to previous years. 
Growth in public investment is also likely t
o remain robust, as the current programming period 
for EU funds enters its final years. Interest 
expenditure is expected to remain low, reflecting 
the wider interest rate environment.
 The structural balance is expected to remain 
slightly negative throughou
t the forecast horizon, 
in line with the shrinking general balance. 
Meanwhile, the general government debt is 
forecast to further decrease to around 30% of GDP 
by 2021, similar to levels last seen in 2008.

22. DENMARK
 Defying global trends for now
 126 Dynamic growth so f
ar this year
 Economic growth in Denmark has outpaced the 
euro area so far this year. A marked increase in 
industrial production and exports provided impetus 
for real GDP growth. These developments are 
mainly due to the favourable industrial 
specialisation 
of Danish industry, which has so far 
proven to be less sensitive to the slowdown in the 
world economy. As a result, real GDP growth is 
set to accelerate to 2% in 2019. Nevertheless, 
Denmark is expected to fall in line with the global 
trend over the forecas
t horizon with real GDP 
growth forecast to moderate to 1.5% in 2020 and 
to 1.6% in 2021.
      Gradually slowing labour market 
 Despite high levels of growth, labour
 demand has 
been gradually weakening this year. As a result, 
employment growth is projected to moderate from 
1.8% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019 and slow down to 
0.8% in 2021. Although the labour force is set to 
continue expanding partly due to the gradual 
increa
ses in the statutory retirement age, 
employment growth remains robust enough to 
keep unemployment steady. The unemployment 
rate is thus forecast to remain stable with a small 
decline from 4.9% in 2019 to 4.7% by 2021.
 Consumption remains a steady driver
 Private consumption has been expanding steadily 
by around 2% in recent years supported by strong 
labour market developments and steady disposable 
income growth. A slight dip is expected in 2019 
mainly due to the weak carry
-over from 2018, but 
the underlying 
trends remain unchanged. While 
employment growth is projected to slow down, 
private consumption will be further supported by a 
one
-off repayment of excessively collected 
property taxes to households (reaching around 
0.5% of GDP) at the end of 2020. As a re
sult, 
growth in private consumption is forecast to hover 
around 2% over the forecast horizon. The new 
budget presented in October 2019 includes 
additional spending in the areas of welfare and 
education in 2020. As a result, public consumption 
is projected 
to increase more dynamically by 1.3% 
in 2020 and 1% in 2021.  
 Volatile investment 
 Investment expanded by 6.5% in 2018. However, 
the surge in equipment investment last year was 
partly due to a large acquisition in the shipping 
sector, which raised both in
vestment and imports. 
This temporary lift implies a negative base effect 
for this year, and is further compounded by 
slowing investment in construction. As a result, 
gross fixed capital formation is projected to 
decline by 0.8% in 2019. Moderately rising h
ouse 
prices and a decline in new residential construction 
permits suggest a further gradual reduction in 
housing construction dynamics. Equipment 
investment growth is forecast to remain subdued 
due to the uncertain global economic outlook. As a 
result, gro
ss fixed capital formation is set to 
expand at a more moderate pace of 2.5% in 2020 
and 1.9% in 2021. 
 Robust goods exports growth this year 
 Despite a general slowdown in its main export 
markets, Danish exports grew dynamically in the 
first half of 2019. 
The growth has come almost 
entirely from just two sectors: pharmaceuticals and

been subdued, reflecting both the negative base

the introduction of 
new emission standards last year. As a result, the 
current account surplus is expected to widen from 
5.7% of GDP in 2018 to 7.1% of GDP in 2019. 
Both exports and imports are expected to resume 
around their trend growth over the forecast
 horizon 
and the current account surplus is expected to 
moderate to 6.7% of GDP in 2021. 
 Moderately increasing inflation
 Danish consumer price inflation has been modest 
so far this year and is forecast to average a mere 
0.8% in 2019. All components of HIC
P inflation 
are expected to remain subdued this year. Despite 
the forthcoming hike of duties on tobacco, 
inflation is only set to increase moderately to 1.3% 
in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021.
 Stable public finances 
 The headline budget balance is projected to reac
h  2.2% of GDP in 2019, a significant upward 
revision compared to the spring forecast. The 
increase is mainly because of an expected surge in 
revenues from the pension yield tax. The headline 
surplus is expected to decline to 0.5% of GDP in 
2020. This is 
partly due to a one
-off repayment of 
DKK 18.5 bn (0.9% of GDP) of excessively 
collected property taxes to households and 
companies as well as additional public spending on 
welfare and education. Weakening economic 
growth and expected decline in pension yie
ld tax 
revenues will weigh on the budget balance in 
2021, which is projected to turn to 0.0% of GDP in 
2021. The structural balance is estimated to remain 
close to positive over the forecast horizon. 
 Public gross debt is set to continue falling 
gradually 
from 34.2% of GDP in 2018 to 31.7% of 
GDP in 2021. Nevertheless, general government 
gross debt will decrease less dynamically than 
positive primary balances, low interest rates and 
stable growth would suggest, because a new 
financing program for social hou
sing is projected 
to increase the debt stock.

23. CROATIA
 Moderate growth under external pressures
 128 Growth recovery in the first half of 2019
 Economic activity in Croatia regained momentum 
in the first half of 2019, after a weaker
-than
-expected performance towards the end of 2018. 
Real GDP rose sharply in the first quarter, by 1
.5% 
quarter
-on-quarter, followed by more moderate 
growth in the second quarter, at 0.2%. Based on 
high frequency indicators, growth is expected to 
remain moderate in the second half of the year, 
bringing the forecast for 2019 to 2.9%. Domestic 
demand is dr
iven by strong household 
consumption and is supported by public 
consumption and investment, which benefits from 
increasing use of EU funding. Despite a recovery 
in exports, net exports are set to negatively 
contribute to growth due to the strong performanc
e of imports. 
    Growth driven by domestic demand
 Throughout the 2019
-2021 period, domestic 
demand is forecast to remain the main driver of 
GDP growth. Ongoing 
improvements in the labour 
market, rising wages and low inflation will 
continue to drive household consumption. A 
stronger contribution from public consumption is 
expected, driven by rising intermediate 
consumption and an increasing public sector wage 
bill
. Together with pension increases, public sector 
wage hikes are expected to support disposable 
incomes and boost household consumption. Driven 
by the rising uptake of EU funds by both the public 
and private sectors, investment growth is expected 
to record 
growth rates above those observed since 
2015 throughout the forecast period. Furthermore, 
favourable financing conditions should remain 
supportive of private investment.
 After growing at an average rate of almost 8% 
since 2013, Croatia™s goods exports grew
 significantly less in 2018, thus ending a period of 
rapid market share gains. In addition, uncertainties 
surrounding global trade and the weakening 
economic performance expected in some of 
Croatia™s main trading partners are expected to 
slow down growth i
n goods exports throughout the 
2019-2021 period. Exports of services, dominated 
by the tourism sector, are also expected to grow 
more moderately. With rising competition in the 
tourism sector and high capacity utilisation in the 
busiest months of the seaso
n, it would take an 
increase in both the number of visits outside the 
peak season and in per
-capita spending to boost 
export growth in the service sector. Import growth, 
by contrast, is expected to remain strong in 2020 
and 2021, in line with domestic dema
nd. Overall, 
the trade balance is expected to deteriorate 
throughout the forecast period. The current 
account balance is expected to gradually decrease 
to 0.3% of GDP by 2021.
 With real GDP growth at 2.9% in 2019, GDP is set 
to finally surpass its pre
-cris
is level. Going 
forward, GDP growth is expected to moderate to 
2.6% and 2.4% in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
 Labour market conditions improve amid low 
inflation
 Labour market conditions continue improving, 
although labour shortages are becoming more 
apparent in some sectors. Moderate employment

As growth in Croatia™s main trading partners moder

of economic activity. Household consumption remains strong, driven by growing employment and wages 
as well as low inflation. Investment is set to continue growing strongly, backed by EU funds, and 
governmen
t consumption is also expected to support growth. The economy should continue adding jobs, 
but at a slower pace as labour shortages appear in some sectors. The debt ratio is set to continue

  129 forecast period. The number of unemployed and 
the unemployment rate are bot
h already at their 
lowest recorded levels and are projected to 
continue decreasing. At the same time, the activity 
rate is projected to pick up marginally, largely due 
to negative demographic dynamics, particularly 
Croatia™s high level of emigration. Stron
g labour 
demand and the planned increase in public sector 
wages should support real wage growth. Still, unit 
labour costs are set to increase only moderately.
 In the first half of 2019, headline inflation declined 
compared to 2018, mainly due to a signific
ant 
reduction in the VAT rate on selected unprocessed 
foods. The HICP inflation rate should thus drop to 
just below 1% in 2019. Inflation is projected to 
pick up in 2020 and 2021, to 1.3% and 1.5% 
respectively.
 Public finances to remain in check
 In 2019, t
he general government balance is 
expected to remain in surplus for the third year in a 
row. Revenues are performing strongly in spite of 
 tax cuts, which particularly affected revenue from 
VAT and social contributions. Expenditure grows 
primarily due to w
age hikes in the public sector, 
investment and intermediate consumption.
 In 2020
-2021, tax revenue is expected to grow at a 
slower pace than nominal GDP, due to further tax 
cuts. EU funds are projected to continue 
supporting revenues as the programming per
iod 
enters its most mature stage. Expenditure growth 
should continue in 2020 and moderate somewhat 
in 2021, largely due to the strong base effect of the 
rising wage bill, investment and capital transfers in 
2018-2019. Additional savings are expected in 
int
erest payments, most notably in 2020, as a 
sizable portion of maturing debt is refinanced at 
lower rates. Overall, the budget is expected to 
remain balanced.
 In 
structural terms, the general government deficit 
is expected to increase from 0.3% of GDP in 2018 
to 1% of GDP in 2020 and decrease slightly in 
2021. The debt ratio is set to continue declining 
strongly on the back of surpluses and nominal 
GDP growth, dipp
ing below 65% of GDP in 2021.

24. HUNGARY
 Strong growth set to moderate
 130 Domestic tailwinds support growth in 2019
 Real GDP growth remained stable at 5.1% in the 
first half of 2019, similar to the growth rate in 
2018. So far, Hungary has managed to withstand 
the global slowdown thanks to a domestic 
construction
 boom and a revival of the automotive 
industry. Investment activity was supported by 
rising public expenditure in the run
-up to local 
elections, the recovery of the real estate sector, and 
high capacity utilisation in manufacturing. 
Household consumption c
ontinued to benefit from 
rising employment and real wages. The automotive 
industry and exports received a boost from the 
launch of new models in major factories. Still, the 
trade balance decreased due to buoyant import 
demand.
      A slowdown is expected in the coming years
 The support to growth from construction and the 
automotive industry are set to fade towards the end 
of 2019, and GDP growth is projected to drop 
from 
4.6% in 2019 to 2.8% in both 2020 and 2021. 
Short
-term indicators already anticipate this 
slowdown. The growth of construction output had 
moderated from double digits to 5.9% by August, 
while order books have been contracting 
throughout the year. Manu
facturing has also lost 
momentum in recent months. 
 Household consumption is projected to slow 
gradually. The labour market may become less 
tight as lower GDP growth limits labour demand 
and constrains further real income gains. Rising 
government support t
o families and for home 
buying contribute to higher household investment. 
At the same time, the attractive yields of retail 
government bonds will keep the saving rate high.
 The investment rate is set to decrease from a 
record high level. Public investment 
is projected to 
moderate in 2020 after Hungary™s absorption of 
EU funds peaked in 2019. In contrast, private 
investment is forecast to rise further as real estate 
projects already in the pipeline are completed. 
Several big
-ticket projects in manufacturing 
are 
expected to be finalised in the forecast years.
 Exports are set to grow more slowly in 2020, in 
line with subdued growth in trading partners. 
However, new manufacturing capacities may raise 
the market share of Hungarian exporters, 
especially in 2021. T
he depreciation of the 
currency has so far limited the impact of strong 
wage growth on cost competitiveness. Import 
growth is forecast to slow because of weaker 
domestic demand. As a result, the current account 
deficit is set to decrease in the coming year
s. The 
continuing inflow of EU funds should keep the 
external financing position positive.
 External risks to the forecast remain on the 
downside. Upside domestic risks stem from the 
continuing tightness of the labour market, which 
could sustain faster wage
 and consumption growth.
 Cost pressure eases gradually
 Inflation passed its peak in summer 2019, thanks 
to moderating fuel prices and favourable base 
effects. Decreasing commodity prices should help 
HICP inflation revert from 3.4% in 2019 to 3.1% 
in 2020 a
nd 3.0% in 2021. Core inflation is 
expected to remain higher than HICP with still 
strong, albeit easing consumption and wage 
growth.

Hungary™s economy has proved resilient to the global slowdown so far thanks to temporary domestic 
drivers. Growth, however, is set to slow as domestic support f
ades and the weakness in key export 
markets is expected to persist. The moderation in growth should ease the pressure on costs and prices 
and bring the deterioration in the external balance to halt. The headline and structural budget balances 
are both fore
cast to improve.

  131 General government deficit set to shrink
 The deficit is forecast to decrease to 1.8% of GDP 
in 2019. Tax revenues remain bu
oyant, on the back 
of favourable macroeconomic developments. The 
increase is, however, below nominal GDP growth, 
partly due to a 2 pps. cut in employers™ social 
security contributions. The absorption of EU funds 
is also expected to increase compared to 201
8, 
reaching its peak over the current Multiannual 
Financial Framework. The only factor contributing 
to the deficit™s reduction is the moderate increase 
of total current expenditure compared to GDP, 
taking also into account the full use of free 
reserves in 
the budget. Interest expenditure is 
expected to remain stable as a share of GDP, due 
to the high premium offered by new retail bonds 
launched in June 2019. The deficit
-reducing 
contribution of current spending is only partly 
offset by an increase in capita
l expenditure 
resulting from the implementation of the 
programme to develop villages, the take
-up of the 
pre
-natal loan under the ‚demography programme™ 
and higher
-than
-foreseen national co
-payments to 
EU funded projects. 
 In 2020, the deficit is forecast 
to decrease further 
to 1% of GDP. Revenues from EU funds are 
assumed to decline by 0.5% of GDP. Tax revenues 
are expected to continue increasing but at a lower 
rate compared to 2019, following the measures 
included in the Economy Protection Action Plan, 
in particular the further cut of employers™ social 
security contributions by 2 pps. Except for interest 
spending, current expenditure growth is expected 
to remain moderate, thus contributing to the deficit 
reduction. The drop in public investment (by 1% 
of G
DP), following also a lower absorption of EU 
funds, is only partly compensated by higher capital 
transfers due to the increasing take
-up of the 
‚demography programme™. These projections 
assume almost the full use of the substantially high 
level of free res
erves (1% of GDP) foreseen in the 
budget. In 2021, the deficit is estimated to decrease 
marginally, to 0.8% of GDP, under a no
-policy
-change scenario. Budgetary risks stem from higher 
expenditure related to public investments and the 
measures in the ‚demog
raphy programme™, whose 
take
-up was higher than expected in 2019.
 The structural deficit peaked in 2018 at 3.8% of 
GDP and is estimated to improve by almost 2 ½ 
pps., reaching 1
 ½% of GDP, over the forecast 
horizon, as the positive output gap closes. The 
debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain on a 
downward path, falling
 from 70.2% in 2018 to 
64.4% in 2021.

25. POLAND
 Growth to slow but remain strong, supported by domestic demand
 132 GDP growth was strong in early 2019–
 Strong domestic demand helped maintain 
economic growth close to 4.5% (year
-on-year) in 
the first half of 2019. Favourable labour market 
developments and strong consumer confidence 
were key factors supporting private consumption. 
A rebound of private investment from low levels 
was also visible. Export dynamics weakened 
slightly.
 – but looks set to slow down in 2020
 GDP growth is forecast to remain strong in 2019 at 
4.1%, but to slow down to 3.3% in 2020 and in 
2021. Private consumption growth, which is 
projected to remain the key driver, is expected to 
come down from the exceptionall
y high levels it 
experienced in 2018. A continued rise in wages is 
set to underpin these trends. In addition, recent tax 
and benefit measures are expected to boost 
household disposable income in late 2019 and 
early 2020.
 Public investment growth is project
ed to slow in 
2019, in part due to problems in completing certain 
large infrastructure projects. Given strong 
incentives to fully utilise EU funding, public 
investment is expected to continue rising in both 
2020 and 2021, though at a moderate pace. Private
 investment growth is projected to slow, mainly due 
to weakened confidence about future demand.
 Strong international competitiveness is expected to 
help Poland continue gaining shares in its key 
export markets. However, export growth is 
projected to slow f
rom previous years due to the 
weakening in world trade. As a result, the 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth is set to 
remain slightly negative over the forecast horizon.
 Stabilisation of wage growth
 The demand for labour is projected to remain 
solid
, easing slightly from recent highs. This, 
combined with planned increases in public sector 
wages and a substantial rise in the minimum wage 
in 2020, is expected to keep average wage growth 
close to 8% until 2021. Employment is set to 
broadly stabilise giv
en existing barriers to labour 
force participation and falling working age 
population. Following several years of rapid 
reduction, the unemployment rate is set to stabilise 
slightly above 3.5% until 2021.
      Inflation to peak in early 2020
 Food price inflation increased quickly in the third 
quarter of 2019. In parallel, services price inflation 
continued to rise, while energy prices fell. Inflation 
is projected to gradually increase in late 2019 and 
early 2020, peaking at above 3% in the first 
quarter, before falling to around 2.5% and staying 
around that level until end of 2021. High services 
prices driven by wage increases are expected to be 
the ma
in factor keeping inflation higher than in the 
previous five years. Electricity prices are expected 
to increase in 2020. In turn, strong competition in 
the markets for consumer goods and services, the 
rising importance of e
-commerce and the assumed 
path of
 global oil prices should constrain inflation 
growth.

GDP growth is forecast to remain solid in 2019, at 4.1%. A gradual slowdown is expected in 2020, 
followed by a stabilisation in 
2021. Private consumption is set to remain the key growth driver 
supported by favourable labour market trends and fiscal stimulus. Investment growth is projected to 
moderate, due to weaker demand expectations in the private sector, while public investment 
is expected 
to continue rising largely driven by EU funds, but at a slower pace. The headline fiscal deficit is 
forecast to increase in 2019.

  133 Balance of risks slightly tilted to downside
 The uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook 
relates primarily to the external environment and 
the extent to which possible disruptions in global 
value c
hains could affect Polish producers. The 
balance of risks for GDP growth appears to be 
tilted slightly to the downside.
 Fiscal deficit set to increase in 2019
 The large decreases in fiscal deficits of recent 
years
 are expected to reverse. 
The headline deficit 
is forecast to increase to 1.0% of GDP in 2019, 
driven by a high rise in transfers to pensioners and 
middle
- and upper
-income households with 
children. Revenue growth from indirect taxes is to 
slow down as a result of measures to 
admin
istratively control electricity prices. Both 
social contributions and direct taxes revenue are 
set to remain high thanks to robust economic 
growth and the favourable labour market situation. 
This forecast includes changes to personal income 
taxation decide
d in 2019 with a negative 
incremental impact on revenue in 2019 and, in 
particular, in 2020.
 In 2020, the headline deficit is set to temporarily 
improve to 0.2% of GDP, largely due to a one
-off 
revenue from a conversion fee of the second 
pension pillar ass
ets, assuming that 50% of those 
would be tranferred to the general pension system. 
The strong dynamics of revenue from social 
contributions and indirect taxes is set to continue, 
while changes to personal income tax introduced 
in 2019 will result in slower
 dynamics in direct tax 
revenues. This forecast includes only elements that 
were incorporated in the draft budget law, in 
particular the removal of the payment cap on social 
contributions and an increase in excise duties. In 
2021, under a no
-policy
-change 
scenario, the 
headline balance is set to worsen to 0.9% of GDP, 
primarily as there is no one
-off revenue expected. 
Risks to the fiscal outlook include measures 
proposed during the recent election campaign and 
not included in the draft budget law, e.g. addi
tional 
pension payments in the coming years.
 The structural deficit is set to worsen from some 
1½% of potential GDP in 2018 to around 2¼% of 
potential GDP in 2019 before gradually
 improving 
to 1½%. In turn, the general government debt
-to-GDP ratio is set to continue falling from around 
49% in 2018 to below 45% in 2021, driven by 
strong nominal GDP growth and relatively low 
nominal fiscal deficits.

 Fiscal loosening driven by pension increases
 134 Strong growth during the first quarters signals a 
solid 2019
 Real GDP rose by 4.6% year
-on-year in the first 
half of 2019. Private consumption remained the 
main growth driver, spurred by increases in 
minimum and p
ublic sector wages. Following a 
drop in 2018, investment recovered in the first half 
of 2019 and is set to make a positive contribution 
to growth. This was largely due to strong growth in 
construction, induced by fiscally supportive 
measures adopted at the
 end of 2018. Net exports 
are forecast to have a negative impact on growth in 
2019, with both imports and exports set to decline, 
the latter being affected by a slowdown in external 
demand. The current account deficit is set to 
continue to widen to 
Œ5.1% i
n 2019 from an 
already high level of 
Œ4.4% of GDP in 2018.
     Growth expected to moderate 
 Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.1% in 2019, 
3.6% in 2020 and 3.3% in 2
021. Private 
consumption is expected to ease but remain the 
main growth driver throughout the forecast 
horizon, as disposable income continues to be 
supported by an expansionary fiscal policy and 
strong growth in real wages. Investment is 
projected to rema
in relatively robust, supported by 
construction and an acceleration of EU
-funded 
projects towards the end of the current 
programming period. The output gap is projected 
to narrow over the forecast horizon.
 Exports are expected to continue growing, 
although
 at a slower pace, supported by services 
while imports are expected to decelerate in line 
with a slowdown in private consumption. Net 
exports™ negative contribution to real GDP growth 
is set to progressively decline. Nevertheless, the 
trade balance is fore
cast to continue widening as a 
percentage of GDP, causing the current account 
deficit to increase further in 2019 and beyond. 
 Turning to the labour market, unemployment 
continues to decline, reaching a new historical low 
of 3.8% in August 2019. The labour
 market is 
expected to remain relatively tight as structural 
weaknesses are set to persist, exerting upward 
pressure on wages. However, overall wage growth 
is projected to moderate slightly over the forecast 
horizon as the economy is slowing down and the 
effects of past public sector wage hikes and 
minimum wage increases fade away. 
 Inflationary pressure set to ease 
 From an annual peak of 4.1% in 2018, headline 
inflation decelerated to 3.5% in September 2019 
mainly on account of declining food and energy 
prices. It is expected to remain at around 3.9% in 
2019 and to re
-enter  the  National  Bank  of  
Romania™s  target  band  (2.5%  ±  1 pp.) as of 
2020. Core inflation is projected to increase from 
2.7% in 2018 to 3.8% in 2019, on the back of 
strong wage gro
wth, but should decline somewhat 
after 2020. The National Bank of Romania 
recently decided to maintain its key monetary 
policy rate at 2.50%. 
 Downside risks to the growth forecast
 Risks to economic growth stem from both external 
and internal conditions. Externally, a potential 
slowdown in some of Romania™s main trading 
partners could negatively affect exports. Internally,

Real GDP growth is set to remain robust in 2019 driven by private consumption and a recovery in 
investment. Net exports are projected to continue to weigh on growth while the current account is set t

to widen. The labour market is expected to remain tight but inflation is forecast to decline from its 2018

 a significant rise in the budget deficit.
 Non
-EA Member States, Romania
  135 a heavy election calendar throughout 2020 and 
recent politica
l uncertainty could delay the restart 
of structural reforms and dampen efforts to reduce 
macroeconomic imbalances. Continued 
unpredictability of public policies could delay a 
sustained recovery of investment.
 High public deficit set to widen considerably 
 The general government deficit is set to increase to 
3.6% of GDP in 2019, from 3.0% in 2018, driven 
by continued high increases to public sector wages. 
Public investment is set to rebound somewhat from 
the record low levels of the recent years.
 The general
 government deficit is forecast to reach 
4.4% of GDP in 2020 and 6.1% of GDP in 2021, 
driven by significant increases to old
-age pensions 
enacted in summer 2019. In particular, the 
pensions have been indexed by 15% in September 
2019 and will be indexed by 
an additional 40% in 
September 2020. Public investment is set to 
continue increasing thanks to an acceleration of 
 spending on projects co
-funded by the EU towards 
the end of the current programming period.
 The structural deficit is projected to gradually
 increase over the forecast horizon as a result of the

 Weak domestic demand puts the brakes on growth
 136 The economy is slowing– 
 Economic activity in Sweden slowed down 
markedly in the first half of 201
9 after several 
years of relatively brisk growth. Real GDP growth 
is forecast to fall to 1.1% in 2019 as domestic 
demand growth turns slightly negative. Economic 
growth is expected to stabilise in 2020 and pick up 
modestly to 1.4% in 2021, as exports are s
et to 
weaken and domestic demand to recover slowly.
     – driven by domestic demand
 A pronounced fall in housing investment accounts 
for a large part of the 
deceleration in domestic 
demand in 2019. Equipment investment is also 
expected to decline, mirroring drops in business 
confidence in both manufacturing and services. 
Overall, gross fixed capital formation is set to fall  
nearly 2% in 2019 and only turn pos
itive in 2021.
 Private consumption growth is forecast to decrease 
in 2019, reflecting a deterioration in the labour 
market, falling consumer confidence and the 
associated rise in precautionary savings. It is set to 
recover somewhat, to 1.5%, over the remai
nder of 
the forecast period, with tax cuts and moderate 
inflation supporting disposable income, despite 
subdued wage increases.
 In spite of sizeable spending needs for schools, 
health care and welfare services linked to 
demographic developments, general go
vernment 
consumption is set to moderate in 2019 and 2020. 
Costs linked to migration should decrease, whereas 
new defence and health care expenses, priorities of 
the 2019 budget, are partially compensated by cut 
backs on, among other items, labour market an
d environmental measures.
 Rebalancing of net trade
 Exports grew briskly in 2018 and continued their 
strong performance into 2019, testifying to the 
strong competitive position of Swedish exporters. 
But exports are expected to slow due to lower 
growth in Sw
eden™s major trading partners. Import 
growth, however, is expected to decrease more 
sharply, mirroring domestic demand. Net trade is 
thus forecast to be the sole driver of growth in 
2019 with a partial rebalancing only in 2021. This 
is a change from previo
us years, when domestic 
demand was the main source of GDP growth.
 Marked worsening in the labour market
 Employment growth slowed markedly in the first 
half of 2019, in line with the slowdown in 
domestic demand. According to Statistics Sweden, 
the recent 
sharp rise in the registered 
unemployment rate, however, had been somewhat 
overstated in the statistics due to methodological 
changes in the Labour Force Survey, and the 
figures will be reviewed in the period ahead. 
Against this background, the labour mark
et 
outlook is forecast to mirror economic activity in 
line with prevailing trends. Employment is thus 
expected to broadly stagnate in 2020 and pick up 
only slightly in 2021, while the unemployment rate 
should further increase to 7.2% in 2021. Social 
partne
rs have started negotiations on a new multi
-annual wage agreement. Given the weak labour 
market, wage growth is expected to remain broadly 
stable despite continued shortages of skilled 
labour.

Sweden™s economy is clearly slowing down. Domestic demand 
and investment in particular are weak, 
but exports are still holding up quite well, so net exports are set to become the economy™s engine of 
growth. The unemployment rate is expected to rise above 7% and inflation is forecast to remain below 
2%. A slightly
 expansionary 2020 budget bill and slower growth imply a decline in the general 
government  surplus but the public debt
-to-GDP ratio should continue to fall.

  137 Inflation to remain subdued
 Headline HICP inflation is set to
 decrease from 
2.0% in 2018 to 1.7% in 2019, and reach 1.6% in 
2021, close to the rate of underlying inflation. The 
decrease in inflation from its peak in the middle of 
2018 mainly resulted from falling energy prices 
and the fading away of special factors,
 in particular 
the sharp rise in unprocessed food prices due to the 
warm summer of last year. Domestic factors are 
not set to generate pressure on consumer prices in 
view of weak economic activity, stable wage 
increases, and a relatively muted pass
-through
 of 
the past depreciation of the Swedish krona.
 Downside risks prevail
 As the Swedish business cycle is closely aligned to 
that of its main trading partners, a deterioration of 
the external environment would weigh on the 
export sector. Downside risks also 
remain on the 
domestic side. A sharper
-than
-expected worsening 
in the labour market could have a negative impact 
on private consumption and delay the projected 
gradual improvement in corporate investment.
  Falling surplus but still 
solid public finances
 The slightly expansionary budget bill for 2020 
reflects rising demand for welfare services and the 
constrained situation of local governments and 
regions, wh
ich will receive higher grants. 
Moreover, it includes new spending on law and 
order and a commitment to support a green 
transition. On the revenue side, sizeable tax cuts 
translate into slower revenue growth. Fiscal policy 
Œ expansive also in 2019 
Œ in com
bination with the 
macroeconomic developments, is expected to lead 
to a smaller surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2019, and 
0.1% in 2020
-2021. The structural balance is set to 
increase to around ½% of GDP over the forecast 
horizon. Sweden™s debt
-to-GDP ratio is exp
ected 
to continue to fall: from 38.8% in 2018 to 32.0% in 
2021. While the overall debt is set to decrease, its 
composition is changing, as local governments and 
regions take on more debt to finance investments 
linked to welfare provision. The marked debt 
reduction in 2019 is largely attributable to a 
reduction in loan
-financed foreign currency 
reserves by the Riksbank.

 Outlook remains subdued as uncertainty continues
 138 GDP growth volatile but modest in 2019
 The pace of economic growth has been volatile in 
2019. Stockpiling and other actions by UK 
businesses, in view of a possible disorderly 
withdrawal on 29 March, temporarily boosted 
growth in the first quarter 
of this year. Real GDP 
rose 0.6% (quarter
-on-quarter) in 2019
-Q1. 
However, real GDP fell by 0.2% in Q2, largely due 
to an opposite, dampening effect from the 
unwinding of the earlier mitigation activity. In Q3, 
the latest monthly GDP data suggest that econ
omic 
growth recovered to around its recent trend rate.
    The resilience of GDP growth this year has been 
driven by domestic demand. Private consumption 
growth has been supported by a strong increase in 
real wages, reflecting a tight labour market, and an 
expansionary fiscal policy. Nonetheless, business 
investment growth has remained weak as 
uncertainty persists over the nature and timing of 
the UK™s exit
 from the EU. At the same time, total 
investment is being supported by strong public 
investment. Net exports have continued to act as a 
drag on growth due to market shares losses 
alongside weak external demand. Reflecting these 
developments, under the tech
nical assumption, 
GDP growth over 2019 as a whole is expected to 
be 1.3%, down marginally from 1.4% in 2018.
 Given the ongoing ratification process of the 
revised Withdrawal Agreement and the uncertainty 
on future economic relations between the EU and 
the 
UK, projections are based on a purely technical 
assumption of status quo in terms of trading 
relations between the EU and the UK. This is for 
forecasting purposes only and has no bearing on 
future negotiations between the EU and the UK.
 Domestic demand to 
continue to drive GDP 
growth in 2020 and 2021
 In 2020, continued real wage growth and an 
expansionary fiscal stance are expected to boost 
private consumption growth. Business investment 
growth is projected to remain subdued as 
uncertainty continues over th
e nature of the UK™s 
future relationship with the EU. Net exports are 
projected to remain a drag on growth, as continued 
weak external demand inhibits export growth 
while resilient domestic demand supports import 
growth. Reflecting these factors and the te
chnical 
assumption about UK trade relations with the 
EU27, GDP growth is forecast to be 1.4% in 2020.
 In 2021, GDP growth is projected to be stable at 
1.4%. Private consumption growth is expected to 
continue to be supported by rising real wages 
driven by a
 relatively tight labour market and an 
anticipated expansionary fiscal policy, while 
investment growth should remain subdued. Net 
exports are projected to remain a drag on growth. 
The risks to the UK GDP forecast are tilted to the 
downside, particularly un
der a disorderly Brexit 
scenario and include a steeper softening in 
employment growth than anticipated.
 Employment growth to slow slightly but inflation 
still expected to increase very gradually
 Over the forecast horizon, employment growth is 
projected to slow slightly in a context of resilient 
but relatively modest GDP growth. This is 
expected to keep the unemployment rate near its 
current low level over the forecast period. The

Although volatile, underlying UK GDP growth remains resilie

growth but continuing uncertainty about the UK™s future trading relationship with the EU means that 
business in
vestment is likely to remain subdued. Net trade is expected to remain a drag on growth as 
external demand remains weak. Employment growth is expected to slow somewhat but unemployment 
should remain low. Inflation is projected to ease this year then rise gr

price inflation is forecast to ease to 1.8% in 2019

 General government deficit to rise in 2019
-2020 and 2020
-2021 Due to methodological changes and revisions in 
the official data, the general government deficit 
was recently revised up for all years from 2000
-2001 onwards. This has led to a revision of
 the 
deficit in 2017
-2018 from 2.1% of GDP to 2.7%, 
and from 1.2% to 1.9% in 2018
-2019. For recent 
years, the increases were driven largely by changes 
to the treatment of student loans, but also by other 
revisions including to public sector pensions and 
corporate tax data. 
 After several years of fiscal tightening and an 
improving budget balance, a looser fiscal stance is 
projected for 2019
-2020. The general government
 deficit is expected to increase to 2.2% of GDP in 
2019-2020 and to 2.4% in 2020
-2021, be
fore 
falling slightly to 2.3% in 2021
-2022. The 
increases are due to higher spending, in particular 
on the National Health Service from 2019
-2020 
onwards. Increases in departmental spending in 
2020-2021 announced in the spending round in 
September 2019 wer
e also included and assumed 
not to be reversed in 2021
-2022. The structural 
deficit is expected to be broadly stable at around   
2½% of GDP over the forecast horizon. 
 The methodological and data changes led to a 
small fall in the general government debt
-to-GDP 
ratio. For 2018
-2019 the ratio was revised down 
from 85.2% to 84.3%. It is projected to continue to 
fall over the forecast horizon, from 84.1% in 2019
-2020 to 83.0% in 2021
-2022.

 Sustained growth path
 142 A temporary deceleration
 In the first half of 2019, the economy decelerated 
to 2.4% y
-o-y, down from a 3.8% y
-o-y expansion 
in the same period a year before. This slowdown 
largely reflects a strong bas
e effect from high 
hydroelectricity production one year earlier, and 
weak gross fixed capital formation due to the 
conclusion of works related to the Trans
-Adriatic 
Pipeline. Private consumption and services exports 
were the main growth drivers in this per
iod. A fall 
in the volume of exported goods, coupled with 
solid import growth, resulted in a negative growth 
contribution of net exports.
    Overall, economic growth is 
expected to moderate 
to around 3% in 2019. It is forecast to bounce back 
afterwards, to 3.7% in 2020 and 3.6% in 2021, as 
unfavourable base effects dissipate and domestic 
growth drivers, in particular private consumption, 
remain solid in the context of ris
ing wages and 
employment, and a broad
-based pick
-up in lending 
activity.
 Risks to this forecast are mainly on the downside 
due to the deteriorating external environment and 
the tense domestic political climate.
 Easing external imbalances
 The current accoun
t deficit increased to 7.4% of 
GDP in the first half of 2019, up from 6.8% of 
GDP in 2018, driven by a larger trade deficit in 
goods, and despite some increase in remittances 
inflows. However, the conclusion of large energy 
projects is expected to result i
n a moderation of 
construction
-related imports and an expansion of 
domestic energy production capacities. As a result, 
the current account deficit is expected to gradually 
contract during the forecast period, to some 5% of 
GDP by the end of 2021, covered p
redominantly 
by FDI inflows. However, downside risks to this 
scenario arise from slow growth in Albania™s key 
trading partners in the EU.
 Continuing improvement in the labour market
 In the first half of 2019, the labour market has 
been registering some fur
ther gains in 
employment, leading to a drop in the 
unemployment rate to 12%, a historical low. 
Positive labour market trends were also reflected 
in the continued increase in the participation rate, 
to 69.9%. Employment growth is expected to 
continue at a s
teady pace, and the unemployment 
rate is forecast to decline further but still remain in 
double
-digits in 2020 and 2021.
 Accommodative monetary policy
 The annual inflation rate averaged just 1.5% in the 
first nine months of 2019, well below the Bank of 
Alb
ania™s target of 3%, as domestic inflationary 
pressures from wage increases and food prices 
were offset by muted import price dynamics. With 
its policy rate at the record low of 1%, the central 
bank does not expect to start normalising its 
current accommod
ative stance before mid
-2020 at 
the earliest. However, the long
-standing 
undershooting of the inflation target might 
continue for longer, further postponing the start of 
the tightening cycle.

forecast
Economic growth is projected to decelerate to just above 3% in 2019, down from 4.1% one year earlier, 
due mainly to a weather
-driven drop in electricity production. Econo
mic activity is expected to rebound 
in the next two years on the back of a continuing solid increase in household spending. The combination 
of sustained GDP growth and moderate budget deficits is expected to continue reducing the public debt
-to-GDP ratio, 
which is however forecast to remain above 60% in 2021.
 Candidate Countries, Albania
  143 lending perked up i
n 2019, rising by more than 6% 
y-o-y, with credit to small businesses driving the 
expansion. Favourable financing conditions and 
the recent consolidation in the banking sector are 
expected to continue supporting credit activity in 
2020 and 2021.
 Public deb
t on a declining path
 Budget execution improved in the second half of 
2019, with both revenue and expenditure broadly 
in line with the plan. Overall, a budget deficit 
below 2% of GDP is expected by the end of 2019. 
In the absence of additional measures, th
e deficit is 
forecast to hover around 1.5% of GDP in the 
medium
-term. Although the debt ratio is set to 
continue to be on a declining path, it is projected to 
remain relatively high, at some 62% of GDP in 
2021. The main fiscal risks stem from the possible
 further accumulation of payment arrears, which are 
not captured in cash
-based budget data, and from 
the materialisation of contingent liabilities from 
public
-private partnerships.

 More balanced growth ahead
 144 Rebalancing growth drivers
 Economic growth slowed to 3.1% y
-o-y in the first 
half of 2019, down from 4.8% y
-o-y a year before. 
The deceleration reflects a dec
line in gross fixed 
capital formation, a major engine of growth until 
recently. This was due to a very large base effect, 
as investment (including both public and private 
ones) surged in the same period a year before. In 
spite of stagnating wages, private 
consumption 
remains strong thanks to improving labour market 
conditions and sustained credit growth to 
households. Notwithstanding the announcement of 
fiscal consolidation efforts, government 
consumption recorded some further expansion 
over the year. On th
e external side, exports kept 
growing at double the pace than imports. As a 
result, the negative contribution from net exports 
narrowed to 0.4 pps of GDP in the first half of 
2019, down from a 1.6% pps drag a year before.
     More sustainable growth dynamics
 Going forward, annual output growth in 2019 and 
2020 is set to decelerate to around 3%, mainly due 
to weaker construction activity as the investment 
cycle related to the 
Bar
-Boljare highway is 
gradually phasing out.  At the same time, corporate 
investment, in particular in the tourism and energy 
sectors, is expected to remain strong, providing 
some offset to decreasing spending on public 
works. Moreover, preliminary result
s of the 
rationalisation of public administration suggest a 
lower
-than
-expected negative impact on 
employment as well as on private consumption. 
Private consumption growth is set to benefit from 
positive wage and employment trends, in particular 
in the tou
rism and construction sectors.
 The global economic slowdown represents a 
downside risk for Montenegro™s growth forecast in 
case of a larger than expected impact on tourist 
arrivals and/or FDI inflows.
 Low inflation environment
 Price dynamics are forecast t
o soften considerably 
in 2019, partly due to the high base effect from last 
year™s VAT and excise hikes. The increase of the 
minimum wage in July 2019, and the continued 
rise of household consumption, are set to lead to 
moderately increasing price pressure
s in 2020 and 
2021. Easing of external imbalances
 The slowdown of the European car industry is 
already being reflected in a reduction of 
Montenegro™s export of basic metals and 
machinery. However, this trend is being offset by 
the strong performance of Mon
tenegrin exports of 
services, and of tourism in particular. The 
completion of the highway works announced for 
September 2020 is expected to reduce substantially 
the volume of construction
-related imports. 
However, while the current account deficit is set t
o improve, it is projected to remain in the double
-digits.
 Supportive financial conditions
 The resolution of two troubled domestic banks was 
implemented in an orderly way without disruption 
to the rest of the financial system. In light of ample 
liquidity, 
strong capital buffers, and declining NPL 
ratios, the banking sector is expected to remain

activity during the forecast period.
 Budget set to turn to surplus
 Substantial capital budget underspending and 
improved 
revenue collection resulted in a sharp 
reduction of the budget deficit in the first half of 
2019, to 0.8% of full
-year GDP compared to a 4% 
gap in the same period a year before.
    It is 
expected that capital spending will catch up 
with the original budget plan by the end of the year 
and, consequently, the consolidated budget deficit 
will increase to some 2.5% of GDP in 2019. The 
sharp reduction of public investment as of 2020 
would have a
 negative impact on economic 
growth, but it is also expected to bring about a 
modest budget surplus by the end of the year, and 
a substantially larger one in 2021.
 Public debt remains high and is still growing in 
2019, boosted also by the issuance of sovereign 
debt under the prevailing favourable terms to 
build
-up government reserves and to refinance 
public debt maturing in the next two years. The 
improving budget balance and the drawdown of 
deposits are expected to substantially reduce public 
debt in 2020
-2021, although not below 60% of 
GDP.

31. NORTH MACEDONIA
 Recovery is set to speed up with improved investment 
outlook
 146 Domestic demand is set to strengthen further 
 The economic recovery strengthened in the first
 half of 2019 as investment caught up after several 
quarters of weakness, in spite of heavy under
-execution of government capital expenditure and 
muted foreign investment. Household spending 
also supported growth, while the external balance 
contributed neg
atively, for the third quarter in a 
row, as investment
-related imports rose. 
 Over the forecast horizon, domestic demand is 
projected to be the sole growth driver, underpinned 
by robust private consumption and a continued 
recovery in investment following a
 protracted 
period of weakness. Households™ disposable 
income is expected to be strengthened by further 
employment gains, solid, though diminishing 
increases in net wages, and raises in minimum and 
public sector wages, pensions and social transfers. 
Strong
 annual growth in household credit will also 
support private consumption. Investment benefits 
from a wide range of fiscal incentives, introduced 
under the 2018 Plan for Economic Growth and 
stepped up in the recent 2019 budget rebalancing, 
as well as from s
olid growth in long
-term 
corporate lending. The ongoing clearance of public 
sector arrears is supporting companies™ liquidity.
     External balance is expected to contr
ibute 
negatively to growth
 Net exports, on the other hand, are set to become 
an increasing drag on the expansion, as import 
growth is likely to accelerate with firming 
investment, while export growth is projected to 
slow down amidst a weak external 
environment 
and capacity constraints of foreign companies in 
the country. The latter account for over half of the 
country™s exports. The current account is set to 
deteriorate until 2021, mainly on account of the 
widening merchandise trade deficit.
 Inflatio
n expected to remain muted
 Consumer price inflation in the year to date, 
including core inflation, remained below its level 
of one year earlier. Food, alcohol and health were 
driving prices, with energy and transport prices 
declining. The CPI is projected 
to increase slightly 
over the forecast horizon, mainly as domestic 
demand is firming, backed by higher wages.
 Government measures expected to support 
employment
 The labour market improved further in 2018. 
These dynamics are expected to continue, 
supported 
by the government™s employment
-related subsidies, and by an extension of active 
labour market measures. Government policies to 
incentivise a move from informal to formal 
employment are beginning to bear fruit, and will 
likely be reflected in smaller reduct
ions in the 
unemployment rate in the coming years.
 Risks to forecast are on the downside
 Downside risks to the growth outlook come mainly 
from a stronger than expected deterioration of the 
external environment, exacerbating the drag on 
growth from net expo
rts. Risks on the domestic 
side stem from further delays in key public 
infrastructure works; from potential for renewed 
political instability; and from rising divergence 
between labour productivity and wage dynamics

Economic growth is set to gain speed, supported by solid household spending and the ongoing recovery 
of investment. With a more difficult external environment ahead, net exports are not expected to 
contribute to economic growt
h over the forecast horizon. Fiscal consolidation measures are having a 
beneficial impact on the primary balance, but are not sufficient to stabilise debt levels.
 Candidate Countries, North Macedonia
  147 undermining external competitiveness 
- since 
September 2017, the government has raised 
minimum wages on several occasions, with a hike 
of 16% planned in December, and another one 
announced for 2020.
 Policy reforms underpin fiscal consolidation 
 The 2019 general government fiscal deficit is 
likel
y to remain below target (3% of GDP), as 
capital expenditure is set to continue being heavily 
underexecuted. Reforms on the revenue side, 
which became operational in early 2019, such as a 
progressive income tax system and a rise in social 
contribution rate
s, have bolstered revenue. The 
fiscal balance is projected to improve gradually, as 
the positive net effect from recent policy measures 
(i.e. the pensions deficit, social assistance reform 
in force since June 2019) is set to increase. 
However, subsidies fo
r investment and 
employment are expected to be stepped up in 
2020-2021. 
 Risks to fiscal projections arise from possible ad 
hoc increases in pensions (the government has just 
announced an increase beyond the recently agreed 
CPI
-only indexation for 2020), and public sector 
wages. Potential calls on guarantees for public 
enterpri
ses also present a downward risk. The 
government expects the primary balance to decline 
to 0.5% of GDP in 2022, which would not be 
sufficient to stabilise debt levels. General 
government debt is set to rise further in each of the 
forecast years, as a resul
t of primary fiscal deficits 
and financing requirements for significant 
repayment obligations in 2020 and 2021. Figures 
do not include the debt of the Public Enterprise for 
State Roads, which amounted to over 5% of 2018 
GDP.

 Growth remains firm
 148 The slowdown is left behind
 The soft patch in the first quarter extended into the 
second one, although growth accelerated 
slightly 
from 2.7% to 2.9% y
-o-y. Robust domestic 
demand continued to set the pace in the economy, 
with strong imports resulting in negative 
contribution to growth from net external trade, 
despite decelerating but still high exports growth. 
Household consu
mption increased steadily. On the 
supply side, a powerful investment drive was 
visible in the double
-digit increase of construction 
activity in the first two quarters. Benefiting from 
strong domestic demand, the trade and service
-oriented sectors of the ec
onomy maintained robust 
growth. On the other hand, following a very good 
2018, the agricultural sector stagnated in the first 
half of 2019. Industry underperformed as well, as 
one
-off interruptions in production, such as 
overhauls of major production facil
ities affected 
some important sectors like oil and 
petrochemicals.
 Short
-term indicators suggest that growth may 
have accelerated in the third quarter. Industrial 
production increased in July and August. However, 
manufacturing performance remained uneven. 
The 
production of motor vehicles in particular 
declined, affected by the global slump in the 
sector. Boosted by higher earnings and increased 
consumer confidence and employment, retail trade 
turnover picked up further in the summer months.
 Record
-high FDI 
to sustain export growth
 The strong FDI inflow in tradable sectors over 
recent years has sustained a faster than previously 
expected export expansion in the current year. Net 
exports will subtract less from 2019 growth than 
projected in the spring forecast
. As the Serbian 
economy continued to attract record
-high and 
well
-diversified FDI in 2019, it is well positioned 
to maintain its strong export momentum, despite 
pressures from the external environment.
    Domestic demand growth to remain 
broad
-based
 Robust domestic demand has been a key feature of 
the economy in the last few years and is forecast to 
remain a major growth driver in the next two 
years. It is also expected to remain
 broad
-based, 
with important contributions to growth from both 
consumption and investment. The labour market is 
expected to become increasingly tight as new jobs 
continue to be added, while population and labour 
force are set to decline further. The strong
 real 
wage growth is, therefore, likely to persist and 
will, together with increased government transfers, 
provide a boost to household consumption, 
especially in 2020. Government spending is also 
expected to continue supporting economic activity 
directly 
through higher public consumption and 
capital expenditure. Gross fixed capital formation 
has expanded significantly recently, but its share in 
GDP is still low at around 20% of GDP. 
Investment growth is projected to moderate but is 
likely to remain robust,
 in view of the good 
macroeconomic prospects, lower risk premiums, 
improved financing conditions, and the high FDI 
inflow. Price stability remains well anchored and 
demand
-driven pressures are expected to be largely 
contained over the forecast period.

Despite the global economic slowdown, Serbia™s economy is on track to continue its robust growth. Its 
strength is broad
-based, coming f
rom strong investment and a steady private consumption, sustained by 
rising employment and income levels. In addition, Serbia remains an attractive destination for foreign 
direct investment, which is expected to continue driving export growth. Risks appear
 balanced, as 
possible spill
-overs from the external environment are countered by significant policy space to further 
support growth.
 Candidate Countries, Serbia
  149 Risk
s appear balanced
 As in the previous forecast, there are persistent 
downside risks from the external environment due 
to a possible further deterioration in geopolitical 
and trade tensions. However, they appear balanced 
out by upside risks from investment i
n case FDI 
inflow continues apace, and on the export side if 
past FDI boosts export potential more than 
currently projected. In addition, there is still 
significant policy space to support growth if 
needed.
 Good times for the budget
 Stable economic growth 
and rising employment 
and income levels helped sustain a good fiscal 
performance. The government revised the 2019 
budget, keeping the deficit target of 0.5 % of GDP 
unchanged while providing additional funding for 
capital spending, social transfers, wages,
 and the 
interest costs of buying back short
-dated bonds.
 The fiscal outlook remains upbeat. The projected 
deficit hovers around the medium
-term objective 
of a deficit of 0.5% of GDP, and government debt 
is projected to fall below 50% of GDP. However, 
 the tendency to use the available fiscal space 
largely for increasing current spending continued 
with the 2020 budget. In particular, significant 
wage increases are likely to raise the public wage 
bill as a share of GDP, despite previous 
government commitm
ents. Thus, the structure of 
the fiscal expansion in 2020 benefits more short
-term consumption rather than investment growth 
and, in view of delayed reforms to the public 
administration and the wage system, may prove 
costly for the budget in the future.

 Resilience is wearing thin
 150 Tradables behind the recent rebound
 The twin effects of a steep decline in domestic 
demand, in particular investment, and strong 
depreciation of the lira led to a significant drop in 
imports. Combined with robust export 
performance, this re
sulted in a large contribution 
of net exports to growth in the first half of the year, 
justifying, 
inter alia
, a marked upward revision of 
the 2019 growth forecast compared to the spring, 
which is now in positive territory.
 Agriculture and services have in
 general held their 
ground in the first half of the year. However, 
construction and to a lesser extent industry 
continued to be a drag on growth. High frequency 
indicators point to a still feeble bottoming out in 
the third quarter. Manufacturing industry c
apacity 
utilisation and the PMI increased, signalling a 
revival in industrial activity. General economic 
confidence improved as well across a number of 
sectors. However, reflecting the weak labour 
market situation, consumer confidence remained 
gloomy, exte
nding its decline to a historic low in 
the third quarter. 
 Base effects to drive the momentum in the 
short term but medium
-term growth prospects 
appear subdued
 By the end of 2019 and early next year, strong 
base effects would determine a more vibrant 
econo
mic performance. Rising domestic demand is 
forecast to sustain the growth momentum. 
However, over the forecast period, economic 
growth is unlikely to return to its pre
-crisis 
averages, remaining below the government™s 
ambitious 5% growth target.
 Pent
-up de
mand and expanding consumer lending 
should support private consumption but the weak 
labour market might turn out to be a major 
constraint to higher households spending. In 
addition, further real wage increases, which helped 
soften the impact of the crisis,
 are less probable in 
view of already elevated wage levels and recent 
changes in the wage setting mechanism, adjusting 
wages with targeted instead of past inflation.
     Investment™s share of GDP remained elevated even 
after the steep fall during the crisis. The magnitude 
and speed of investment recovery will likely be 
constrained by the limited fiscal space, financial 
market bottlenecks, in particular the rising NPLs in 
some investment
-driven sectors like construction 
and energy, and the need to repair companies™ 
balance sheets. Although financial conditions have 
improved from the heights of the crisis, they 
remain inherently volatile and may represent an 
additional challe
nge to investment performance. 
Heightened uncertainty, stemming from 
geopolitical tensions is also expected to sap the 
strength of investment recovery.
 Net exports™ contribution to growth is expected to 
remain largely neutral in the next two years. 
Export 
growth is likely to slow down because of 
spill
-overs from global trade tensions, sanctions, 
and the waning effects of the lira™s depreciation. 
The slow recovery of domestic demand is forecast 
to still pull imports up but, external imbalances are 
set to rem
ain low as compared to the excesses seen 
in the pre
-crisis years.

The economy recovered faster than expected from last year™s currency 
crisis, supported by a large fiscal 
stimulus and strong growth contribution of net exports. The recovery, however, is likely to be shallower 
than after previous recessions. A weak labour market, the need to repair corporate balance sheets, and 
persistent u
ncertainty are expected to weigh on consumption and investment. Policy buffers appear 
constrained by low reserves and a shrinking fiscal space following recent stimulus measures, and 
resilience is likely to be tested further in view of geopolitical and reg
ional tensions.
 Candidate Countries, Turkey
  151 Risks are looming large
 The forecast assumes a gradual return to exchange 
rate stability and, in view of a slow recovery in 
domestic demand, subdued inflationary pressures. 
However, this sce
nario could easily be challenged 
in case of domestic policy decisions aiming to 
materially boost growth and employment, swings 
in investors™ preferences, or aggravation of 
geopolitical and regional tensions leading to the 
imposition of more powerful sancti
ons. External 
financing needs remain large, which in view of the 
need to rebuild foreign reserves and the high 
country risk premium could pose an additional 
risk.
 Fiscal anchor increasingly unhinged
 In the aftermath of the failed coup 
attempt in 2016, 
the fiscal anchor weakened significantly and fiscal 
buffers have worn increasingly thin. Expansionary 
fiscal policy was also a key element of the 
authorities™ response to the crisis last year. As a 
result, the 2019 budget deficit, net of o
ne-off 
receipts of close to 1% of GDP from a 
super
-dividend from the central bank, is set to
  widen further to levels not seen in a decade. Fiscal 
space is thus severely limited 
to further support 
growth and, absent new measures, the headline 
government deficit is likely to remain elevated in 
the next two years. Government debt is now firmly 
in the zone above 30% of GDP and growing, with 
rising interest payments. Contingent liabil
ity risks 
from public
-private partnerships and concerns 
about asset quality in majority state
-owned banks 
persist.

 Trade tensions 
and policy uncertainty weigh on growth
 154 Weaker investment dynamics are slowing 
growth
 The US economy has gradually slowed
 after a 
period of above potential activity in 2018. In 2019
-Q2, the pace of real GDP growth moderated to 
0.5% q
-o-q (from 0.8% q
-o-q in 2019
-Q1) as 
business investment weakened against the 
backdrop of intensifying US
-China economic 
tensions and broader tr
ade policy uncertainty. 
Furthermore, the slump in the manufacturing 
sector also extended to the US, where recently 
PMIs have been close to contractionary territory. 
Still, robust consumer spending underpinned by 
progressively tightening labour market condi
tions 
has been a stabilising force for the US economy in 
the first half of the year. 
 Going forward, economic activity is set to 
moderate further. The intensification of economic 
tensions with China in the context of a mature 
economic cycle and a weakening
 manufacturing 
sector have darkened the US economic outlook 
just as the growth impulse from the fiscal stimulus 
has been fading. Recent policy easing by the US 
Federal Reserve aimed to cushion some of the 
negative impact on the economy, but lower 
borrowing
 costs are not expected to be sufficient to 
offset the negative shock on business investment. 
Resilient private consumption is expected to 
remain the main driver of economic activity over 
the forecast horizon supported by easier financing 
conditions, real 
disposable income growth and 
strong household balance sheets. Thus, the US 
economy is expected to grow by 2.3% in 2019 
before slowing further below potential growth to 
1.8% and 1.6% in 2020 and 2021, respectively, on 
the back of weakening investment activi
ty.
 Employment growth passed its peak
 Job creation has been moderating after buoyant 
activity in 2018. Growth of total nonfarm payroll 
employment averaged 167,000 per month in 2019 
compared with an average monthly gain of 
223,000 in 2018. At the same time,
 growth in 
average hourly earnings slipped below 3% in 
2019-Q3, suggesting that demand
-side factors 
rather than supply
-side constraints are causing jobs 
growth to slow. Nevertheless, the unemployment 
rate has continued to edge down so far in 2019, 
recently
 reaching 3.5%. Job creation is expected to 
slow further over the forecast horizon because of 
elevated policy uncertainty and a protracted 
weakness in the manufacturing sector. Against 
this, the unemployment rate is expected to stabilise 
at around 3.7% ove
r the forecast horizon, also 
reflecting the expected slowing growth of the 
labour force due to the retirement of the baby 
boom generation. As wage pressures soften and 
domestic demand slows, consumer price inflation 
is forecast to pick up only modestly ove
r the next 
two years, reflecting mainly the direct impact of 
recently implemented and announced tariff hikes.
    A rotation in the macroeconomic policy mix
 US macroeconomic policies are set to remain 
supportive to the economy over the next two years 
underpinned by a rotation in the policy mix to 
more accommodative monetary policy and from an 
expansionary to a broadly neutral fiscal stance. 
 The US Federal Reserve™s monetary policy stance 
has shifted markedly since the spring against the 
backdrop of intensifying economic tensions with 
China, subdued underlying inflation and a number 
of external risks to the US economic outlook. The

The US economy is forecast to slow down as persistent economic tensions with China and elevated 
policy uncertainty hurt the outlook for private investm
ent. At the same time, recent monetary policy 
easing is set to cushion the economic downturn while tailwinds from the sizeable fiscal stimulus 
implemented last year fade out.
 Other non
-EU Countries, The United States of America
  155 Fed cut its
 benchmark interest rate by a total of 
50bps over the summer while financial market 
expectations for further policy easing remain high. 
The accommodative policy stance is expected to 
cushion the slowdown in economic activity, 
supporting particularly the in
terest rate sensitive 
housing sector as well as consumer spending.
 In addition, the Trump administration and 
congressional leaders recently eliminated the risk 
of a ﬁfiscal cliffﬂ in 2020 by reaching a budget deal 
to raise discretionary government spending
 and 
suspend the US debt ceiling over the next two 
years. The US fiscal stance is set to turn broadly 
neutral over the forecast horizon, in line with the 
policy assumptions in the spring. The general 
government budget deficit is forecast to remain 
above 6½
% of GDP.
 Weak trade activity ahead
 Despite increasing exports of petroleum products, 
total US exports are forecast to nearly stagnate in 
2019, and recover only modestly thereafter, 
weighed down by protectionist trade policies, a 
struggling manufacturing s
ector and subdued 
global demand. Import growth is also expected to 
be weaker than forecast earlier as domestic 
demand slows on the back of weaker investment 
dynamics. The current account deficit is forecast to 
remain contained at around 2½% of GDP over the
 forecast horizon.
 Risks to the outlook remain elevated
 Given weak business confidence and subdued 
manufacturing activity, any further intensification 
of the US
-China economic confrontation could 
also dampen activity in the services sector, 
increasing the risk of a sharper slowdown of the 
economy and the labour market. Bilateral trade 
tensions could spread to other US trade partners, 
notably the EU. Furthe
rmore, tensions between 
market expectations of a more aggressive 
monetary policy easing and the possible more 
cautious reaction of the Fed to incoming economic 
data,  should the strength of the labour market be 
confirmed and inflation rebound, could trigge
r financial market volatility at times when some US 
asset valuations appear stretched. On the upside, 
any material de
-escalation of trade tensions could 
lower policy uncertainty, which combined with 
favourable borrowing costs, could provide the 
basis for a
 pick
-up in business confidence, 
investment and trade.

 Trade tensions add to domestic woes
 156 Public spending supports growth 
 After a weak second half of 2018, economic 
activity accelerated in the beginning of 2019 on 
rising public consumption and investment 
spending. Private consumption accelerated in 
2019-Q2 boosted by the extraordinary long Reiwa 
holidays and frontloading of m
ajor purchases 
ahead of the October consumption tax hike. At the 
same time, the intensification of global trade 
tensions took a toll on exports and manufacturing.  
 Leading indicators point to a moderate output 
deceleration in 2019
-Q3 driven by weak global
 demand. Industrial production and exports 
deteriorated in August, after a temporary rebound 
in July. At the same time, private consumption 
activity signals strong consumption growth 
underpinned by continued frontloading of 
purchases of big
-ticket items. E
conomic activity is 
likely to weaken further towards the end of the 
year following the rise in the consumption tax rate 
bringing the annual growth rate to 0.9% in 2019.   
 Consumption volatility and trade tensions 
weaken the outlook
 Real GDP growth is fore
cast to decelerate to 0.4% 
in 2020 on an expected decline of domestic 
demand in the immediate aftermath of the planned 
tax hike and continued trade weakness. Private 
consumption spending is likely to contract in 2020. 
However, the impact of the tax hike is
 set to be 
much milder compared to a similar experience in 
2014 due to significant  government measures to 
smoothen demand, before and after the tax hike, 
including the introduction of a points redemption 
program for cashless payments and tax breaks on 
car purchases and homes. Consumer spending is 
likely to recover in 2021 driven by a continued 
robust labour market. Labour market conditions 
should remain very tight amid severe labour 
shortages and strong demand for labour, with the 
unemployment rate at slig
htly above 2% over the 
forecast horizon. At the same time, wage pressure 
is set to remain contained amid subdued inflation 
expectations and a rising share of non
-regular 
employment. 
 High business profits, continued monetary 
accommodation and rising spendi
ng on automation 
in view of persistent labour shortages are set to 
support private investment spending in the near 
term. Public investment spending is forecast to 
remain strong on Olympics
-related investment and 
increasing public works. Government consumpt
ion 
spending is set to accelerate as part of the 
additional revenue from the consumption tax hike 
has been earmarked to provide free preschool 
education. 
    The external trade outlook is clouded by the 
intensification of global and regional trade 
tensions. Exports are set to decline in the near term 
reflecting sluggish demand from China, continued 
weakness in the tech cycle and ongoing trade 
tensions between J
apan and Korea. They are 
expected to rebound somewhat in 2020 in line with 
the tepid recovery in global demand, but continued 
trade tensions might lead to a recalibration of 
regional value chains in the medium term. Imports 
are forecast to decline in the n
ear term reflecting 
weak domestic demand before increasing 
gradually toward the end of the forecast horizon. 
Overall, net exports are expected to remain broadly 
neutral until 2021.

Robust economic activity in the first half of 2019 is set to weaken in the remainder of t
he year in the 
wake of the consumption tax increase and sluggish external demand. Accommodative fiscal and 
monetary policies offer some respite, but a sluggish recovery is likely to take hold only towards the end 
of the forecast horizon as Japan remains hi
ghly vulnerable to global and regional trade tensions.

  157 Fiscal consolidation is somewhat delayed
 The recent increase in the consum
ption tax from 
8% to 10% lies at the core of the fiscal 
consolidation strategy, aimed at achieving a 
primary balance by fiscal year 2025. However, the 
stimulus measures enacted in 2019 are likely to 
offset partly the positive fiscal impact of the tax 
hike,
 at least in the near term. Still, the general 
government deficit is expected to gradually narrow 
to around 2% of GDP in 2021 as the stimulus 
wanes. 
 Continued monetary accommodation 
 Inflation has decelerated since the beginning of the 
year with core infl
ation at 0.5% y
-o-y in August 
2019 despite continued unprecedented scale of 
monetary accommodation. Annual headline 
inflation is set to stay well below 1% this year and 
temporary edge up just above 1% in 2020 
reflecting the effects of the tax hike. It is, 
however, 
likely to decelerate again towards the end of the
 forecast horizon as the entrenched low inflation  
expectations, reflecting the deeply enshrined 
deflationary mind
-set of the population, may 
continue limiting inflationary pressures. Monetary 
poli
cy is expected to remain highly 
accommodative throughout the forecast horizon on 
weak demand and contained inflation. 
 Trade
-related risks weigh on the external side

 Downward pressure intensifying
 158 Broad
-based slowdown continues 
 The Chinese economy remains on a gradual 
decelerating trend. GDP growth stabilised at 6.4% 
(y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2019 but decelerated 
to 6.2% in the second quarter and further down to 
6% in the third, the lowest growth in several 
decades, amid softer domestic demand and 
escalation of economic tensions with the US. 
Consumption remains the mai
n growth driver but 
its contribution to growth dropped sharply during 
this year, from around 5 pps in 2018 to only 3.6 
pps in 2019
-Q3. The contribution of investment to 
growth was also significantly lower than in 2018 
and the positive contribution from net
 exports 
reflected weak imports rather than strong export 
performance. 
 Recent high frequency indicators point to 
intensifying downward pressure on the Chinese 
economy. In particular, the downturn in trade since 
late 2018 has been very sharp. While the exp
ort 
weakness is linked mainly to the ongoing tensions 
with the US, the persistent and stronger
-than
-expected decline in imports signals a continuing 
weakness in domestic demand. This is confirmed 
by consumer spending indicators which have been 
softening. P
ersistent uncertainty, a slowing 
economy and worsening job prospects led to more 
cautious consumer behaviour and higher 
propensity to save.  Industrial activity remains 
weak, with trade tensions, mounting tariffs as well 
as slowing demand for consumer dura
bles, in 
particular cars, weighing on the manufacturing 
sector. Lingering uncertainty as well as weak 
industrial profit outlook are also having a negative 
impact on private investment. 
 Growth set to drop below 6% –
 Looking ahead, the Chinese economy is ex
pected 
to continue slowing down over the forecast 
horizon with growth projected to decelerate from 
6.1% in 2019 to 5.8% in 2020 and further to 5.6% 
in 2021. Economic tensions with the US, global 
uncertainty as well as subdued global growth is 
expected to c
ontinue to weigh on trade, business 
sentiment and investment decisions. Moreover, 
underlying structural factors such as a shrinking 
working
-age population, high debt levels, 
declining efficiency of investment as well as 
ongoing rebalancing of the economy t
owards more 
consumption
-led growth will act as additional 
drags. With rising trade tensions over the summer 
and prospects for a comprehensive trade deal with 
the US still uncertain, the trade outlook has 
worsened significantly compared to previous 
forecast
s. Under the assumption of no further 
escalation of trade tensions, trade growth is 
expected to rebound only modestly over the next 
two years but will overall remain sluggish and 
significantly lower than GDP growth.
    – with policy stimulus unlikely to fully offset the 
slowdown 
 The fiscal and monetary policy stance is expected 
to remain supportive of growth and will thus help 
to partly cushion the negative impact of the above
-mentioned factors on economic activity. At the 
same time, the effectiveness of the policy stimulus 
deployed by the Chinese authorities so far has been 
rather limited. Fiscal measures included tax cuts 
for households and businesses as well as incentives 
for l
ocal governments to increase infrastructure 
spending but they have not resulted in a material

forecast
The Chinese economy grew by 6.2% in the first nine months of 2019 amid intensifying downward 
pre
ssure from both the external environment and softening domestic demand. Growth is projected to 
edge down over the forecast horizon as persistent economic tensions with the US, elevated uncertainty 
as well as domestic structural headwinds continue to weigh 
on economic activity. Macroeconomic 
policy easing is expected to contain the extent of the slowdown but not offset it fully.  
 Other non
-EU Countries, China
  159 boost of consumption and investment. Selective 
loosening of monetary policy together with credit 
easing measures have increased bank lending 
modestly but the ongo
ing crackdown on the 
shadow banking sector together with rising 
funding costs and risks in smaller banks are 
causing a funding squeeze in some segments of the 
private sector with defaults on the rise in recent 
months. 
 Overall, the policy space has narrowed, with the 
Chinese authorities facing a complex policy trade
-off between stimulating growth and containing 
financial risks and leverage. The baseline scenario 
assumes that the policy stimulus will remain 
targeted and s
elective and that the authorities will 
refrain from more aggressive policy easing that 
would include stimulus of the property sector.  
 Important downside risks remain 
 Both the growth and the trade outlook are subject 
to downside risks. In particular, the
 risk of further 
escalation of trade and economic tensions with the 
US remains a concern. The US
-China conflict is 
increasingly spreading to other areas than trade, 
notably the currency, technology and investment
 which can further the decoupling of the tw
o economies. Full materialisation of these risks 
would imply further deterioration of business and 
consumer sentiment, exports and investment with 
negative implications for trade, productivity and 
GDP growth. More aggressive policy stimulus in 
case of a pe
rsistent slowdown may lift GDP 
growth moderately in the short run but would 
further exacerbate financial imbalances and 
increase the risk of a sharp economic adjustment in 
the future. Finally, an additional downside risk 
concerns the property sector, which
 plays a very 
important role in the Chinese economy and which 
has so far remained relatively resilient. With rising 
financial pressure on developers, reduced fiscal 
space in local governments and house prices and 
household debt levels at historical highs, 
the 
housing market is in the late stage of the cycle. 
Given its key role in investment, consumer 
sentiment and financial market behaviour, a 
downturn would amplify the slowdown in the 
whole economy and increase the risk of a hard 
landing. On the upside, a 
material and lasting 
improvement in trade and economic relations with 
the US would reduce uncertainty, increase trade 
flows and business confidence with positive 
impact on activity.

 Resilient growth 
amidst a deteriorating external environment
 160 Switzerland
 Output growth during the first half of 2019 
decelerated to 0.6% compared to 3.6% the year 
before. However, the lower year
-on-year growth 
rate in the first half of 2019 was strongly affected 
by a base
-year effect, related to international sports 
events in 2018, which are accounted for as Swiss 
service exports. A less favourable international 
environment and a recent strengthening of the 
exchange rate contributed to a weak performance 
of goods exports, in particular in the machinery 
and metal indus
try. Domestic demand remained 
subdued, reflecting moderate wage growth during 
the year, weak investment growth in view of the 
overall uncertain international environment and the 
end of a construction boom. Inflation remained 
low, benefitting from low impor
t prices, in 
particular for energy. Despite weaker output 
growth in the first half of 2019, employment 
continued to increase by 0.9% in this period.  
     Going forward, annual real GDP growth is forecast 
to decelerate to about 1% in 2019, among others 
reflecting a less benign international environment, 
the negative effects of a stronger exchange rate on 
the country™s price competitiveness and the base 
effec
t from last year™s favourable impact of 
international sports events. In 2020, solid private 
consumption and the positive impact of the 2020 
Olympic games on Swiss service exports should 
help to bring output growth to around 1½%, 
despite negative external h
eadwinds. In 2021, 
domestic demand is expected to remain solid, 
although the negative base effect from the 2020 
service export boom is likely to bring the year
-on-year output growth rate down to around 1¼%, 
which is slightly below the country™s trend growt
h. 
 Exports are expected to remain an important 
source of growth, among others benefitting from 
expanding export markets for pharmaceutical 
products and chemicals. Private consumption 
growth is set to remain stable on the back of 
continued employment growt
h and low 
inflationary pressures, which has a positive effect 
on real disposable income. The growth
-supportive 
monetary stance is expected to remain in place. As 
underlying domestic price pressures are projected 
to remain weak, inflation is forecast to acc
elerate 
only slightly to around 1¼%, largely reflecting 
increasing import prices. The underlying solid 
growth momentum will help to keep public sector 
accounts close to balance. 
 Risks to the outlook are primarily on the downside 
and are mainly related to 
the external environment. 
Geopolitical turbulences and renewed volatility in 
financial markets could lead to safe
-haven capital 
inflows, which could create an upward pressure on 
the exchange rate. A further downside risk relates 
to the uncertain global tra
de outlook.
 Norway
 The Norwegian economy is in a moderate cyclical 
upturn. In the second quarter of 2019, real GDP 
growth slightly accelerated to 0.3% q
-o-q compared to flat growth in the first quarter, mainly 
on the back of a pickup in domestic demand. Th
is 
was largely driven by a surge of investment in the 
extraction and transportation sectors. Despite a 
tightening labour market and firming wage growth, 
there was a marginal slowdown in private 
consumption growth. Net exports continued to

Iceland and Switzerland are experiencing a cyclical downturn amid a deteriorating external  
environment, while Norway benefits from a supply

Switzerland and Norway, while unemployment has slightly increased in Iceland. External risks remain

and refined petroleum products. 
 Robust petroleum
-related investment will continue 
underpinning industrial production this year, while 
the strong wage growth as well as elevated 
consumer confidence should support household 
consumption. Because of robust domestic demand, 
net exports are set to remain a drag on growth in 
2019. Residential investment growth was moderate 
in the first half of 2019, compared to a contraction 
the year bef
ore. In the same period, house prices 
have also risen moderately, although a recovery in 
housing investment will likely be slow due to 
concurrent headwinds including modest population 
growth and the ongoing rise in the interest rates.
 In 2020, a return to 
a lower rate of investment 
growth is expected to be more than offset by 
higher growth of oil and gas exports as well as 
continued strong household spending. 
 Overall, real GDP growth is forecast to accelerate 
slightly to 1.6% in 2019, up from 1.3% in 2018,
 and to 1.9% in both 2020 and 2021.
    Solid economic growth, a weak krone and an 
underlying inflation persistently above the 2%

-o-y in August), 
trig
gered Norges Bank™s Executive Board decision 
on 18 September to raise its key policy rate for the 
fourth time in a year, by 25 basis points to 1.5%.  
 The economy will receive less support from 
government spending in 2020 as the budget 
expects the structur
al non
-oil deficit to narrow. 
The budget anticipates a fiscal impulse of 
-0.2% of 
GDP, resulting in a structural non
-oil deficit of 
7.6% of mainland GDP and spending of oil 
revenues equivalent to 2.6% of the sovereign 
wealth fund™s assets (Government Pensi
on Fund 
Global). 
 Domestic risks to the outlook mainly stem from 
the uncertainties in the property market and the 
historically high household debt levels leaving 
households vulnerable in the event of interest rates 
rises or a steep fall in house prices. A 
sustained 
increase in the debt burden indicates that financial 
imbalances have been building up. This is one of 
the most important vulnerabilities in the 
Norwegian financial system, which is however 
mitigated by the significant capital and liquidity 
buffer
s held by Norwegian banks. Regarding the 
external environment, the volatility of energy 
prices presents upside and downside risks, while a 
marked deterioration in growth prospects of some 
of Norway™s main trading partners, continue to 
point to downside ris
ks.
 Iceland
 After several years of robust growth, Iceland has 
entered a cyclical downturn. A sharp deceleration 
of GDP growth in the first quarter (to 1.7% y
-o-y) 
was followed by a contraction of 1.0% in the 
second. Deteriorating developments in tourism 
(bankruptcy of domestic airlines, declining number 
of tourist arrivals) and shrinking business 
investment are the key factors behind an expected 
economic contraction of 0.2% in 2019. Further 
headwinds come from a poor start into the year of 
fisheries product
ion, which is going to weigh on 
exports of goods. On the positive side, private 
consumption resilience and declining imports, 
partially due to lower investment spending, but 
also a shift towards domestic production, are 
growth supportive. Residential inves
tment is 
projected to remain robust but to decelerate from 
the expansion recorded in 2017
-2018. 
 The contraction is set to be short
-lived with GDP 
growth turning positive in 2020 and 2021 on the 
back of recovering business investment and 
strengthening priv
ate consumption. Exports are 
projected to bottom out in 2020 and accelerate in 
2021. Exports are expected to benefit from the 
increasingly longer tourist stays, which partly 
compensate a declining number of arrivals in 
Iceland. Exports of fishery products 
are set to 
recover due to high prices and large stocks of cod 
and assumed currency depreciation. Fiscal policy 
is shifting to a more growth
-supporting stance. In 
June, the primary surplus target was revised 
downwards to 1.6% of GDP. The 2020 draft

  The registered unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in 
the
 second quarter while for foreign workers it 
reached around 7%. The unemployment rate is
  likely to remain roughly stable in line with the 
expected short
-lived nature of the downturn. The 
Central Bank cut the key policy rate four times in 
2019, bringing i
t to 3.25% in September. Inflation 
stood at 3.1% in the third quarter, above the target 
rate of 2.5%. The latest wage agreement brought 
substantial rises for low
-wage earners, while 
keeping the overall wage bill growth moderate, 
which led to a fall in infl
ation expectations. Going 
forward, inflation is set to ease in line with a 
moderately growing economy and decelerating 
house price inflation, but remain above the target 
due to depreciating currency and potential pass

 The balance
 of risks is tilted to the downside. Key 
external risks stem from trade tensions that would 
challenge the projected recovery of exports. The 
main domestic risk relates to wage increases, 
which could outpace productivity gains and weigh 
on price competitive

ON Growth picks up on a higher public spending
 163 Economy slows amid a weak external demand 
and a rise in VAT  
 After the strong real GDP growth upturn to 2.3% 
in 2018 spurred by transient f
actors related to the 
completion of major infrastructure projects, 
economic activity slowed to 0.7% year
-on-year in 
the first half of 2019, amid sluggish private 
demand growth and contracting exports. Private 
consumption was weakened by an increased VAT 
burden, relatively tight monetary policy and weak 
wage growth. Investment growth was hampered by 
delays in the implementation of public investment 
projects. Exports suffered from weakening global 
demand for hydrocarbons and metals, last year™s 
below
-average 
grain harvest, and temporary 
disruption of oil flows through the Druzhba 
pipeline.  
   Economic activity is set to rebound moderately in 
the second half of 2019 as the significant public 
investment programme is gradually being 
implemented. However, prospe
cts of a stronger 
rebound are dampened by a confluence of 
domestic and external headwinds. Low global oil 
prices and weak demand for oil and gas hamper 
the outlook for exports. At the same time, sluggish 
growth of disposable incomes, slowing consumer 
credi
t growth and uncertainty related to possible 
additional US sanctions limit the scale of domestic 
demand growth. 
 Overall, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate 
to 1% in 2019 and to edge up to 1.4% in 2020 and 
1.5% in 2021, reflecting higher public inv
estment 
spending and a marginal pension
-reform
-induced 
improvement in labour force participation. 
 Public spending accelerates     
 Private consumption growth is likely to remain 
sluggish in the medium term, reflecting limited 
real wage gains and faltering
 consumer credit 
growth. Elevated uncertainty related to the 
deteriorating global trade outlook and geopolitical 
situation, relatively high real interest rates and 
deteriorating environment for foreign investors are 
likely to undermine the private investme
nt outlook. 
However, the acceleration of public infrastructure 
investments in the second half of 2019 and 
thereafter is expected to support overall investment 
growth rates.
 On the external side, import growth is likely to 
pick up only marginally from 2019 
lows amid 
accelerating public investments. Export growth is 
set to remain moderate hampered by soft global 
demand overall and particularly for commodities. 
Overall, the contribution of external trade to real 
GDP growth is forecast to remain marginally 
posi
tive over the forecast horizon. 
 Macroeconomic policy mix becomes 
supportive 
 Headline consumer price inflation peaked at 5.2% 
in February
-April 2019, reflecting rising 
consumption tax rates and effects of past exchange 
rate depreciation. In line with thes
e trends, annual 
average inflation is expected to accelerate from 
2.9% in 2018 to around 4½% in 2019. It is set to 
subside slightly below the central bank target of 
4% in 2020 thanks to the base effects and remain 
around this level towards the end of the f
orecast 
horizon. The central bank started to tighten

Economic activity is set to decelerate in 2019, hampered by the
 increase in VAT rates, rising uncertainty 
and softening global demand. The macroeconomic policy mix is gradually turning more 
accommodative, as fiscal buffers have been rebuilt and the policy framework has been strengthened. 
Going forward, real GDP is exp
ected to rebound moderately in line with gradually improving potential 
growth and accelerating public investments. 
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2019
  164 monetary policy in 2018, raising the main interest 
rate to 7¾%, amid increasing exchange rate 
pressures and accelerating inflation. However, the 
dovish turn among global central banks and 
subsiding infla
tionary pressures gave the monetary 
authorities some space to ease policy and the 
headline interest rate was cut to 6.5% over the 
summer. 
 On the fiscal side, a high fiscal surplus of 2.9% of 
GDP in 2018, driven by rising oil revenues and 
improving non
-oil
 tax collection, is forecast to 
decline to 2.1% of GDP in 2019, as spending on 
infrastructure, human capital and social support 
picks up more strongly than VAT
-related extra 
revenues. Going forward, fiscal surpluses are 
expected to gradually decline, amid 
accelerating 
public expenditures to above 1% of GDP in 2021. 
At the same time off
-budget fiscal buffers in the 
National Welfare Fund (accumulating windfall oil 
 revenues) are likely to reach the legal minimum of 
7% of GDP soon, with a rising probability t
hat any 
additional inflows could be used to boost 
investments in the domestic economy
 Risks to the forecast are broadly balanced  
 On the external side, the major risk on the upside, 
particularly pertinent for Russia, relates to higher 
oil prices due to intensification of geopolitical 
tensions in the Middle East. On the downside, the 
intensification of US economic sanctions that 
would
 negatively affect investments and foreign 
trade remains a risk. On the domestic side, 
previous strong retail credit growth could lead to a 
build
-up of impaired assets and impinge upon 
consumption growth, while slower implementation 
of the infrastructure p
rogramme might limit the 
pace of the investment rebound.

The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG ECFIN) 
produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged economic 
forecasts in Spring and Autumn.These forecasts cover the principal 
macroeconomic aggregates for the Member States, the candidate 
countries,the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the 
international environment.
Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-time-
equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, Italy, and 
the Netherlands report FTE data. In the absence of FTE data, employment 
is based on numbers of persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area 
aggregates, priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more 
representative of diverse patterns of working time.
Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively, 
present data including inventories.
Data for 2019, 2020 and 2021 are forecasts. The source for all tables is the 
European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for the 
Member States are based on the European System of Accounting (ESA 
2010). Due to differences in revision schedules of annual and quarterly 
national accounts, in particular in the context of the Benchmark revisions 
undertaken this autumn, annual and quarterly figures may not be fully 
consistent for some Member States. The macroeconomic forecast for 
Croatia is based on the latest comprehensive national accounts data 
release available at the cut-off date of the forecast. Most Member States 
have now introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure 
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms. For the USA 
and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA. 
   Latin America :All countries in that region.
   Euro area : EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI, 
SK and FI).

   MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebano Iraq, 
Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab 
Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar.
  Emerging and Developing asia :In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA 
and Japan.
Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010), except for US current-account in 
tables 50, 52, and 62 (Balance of Payments). Discrepancies with balance 
of payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences and 
revision schedules.
   Candidate countries : Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. 
   Potential candidates :Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
   Sub-Saharan Africa : EU and euro area aggregates for general government debt are 
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not corrected for 
intergovernmental loans, including those made through the European 
Financial Stability Facility.
EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. World 
GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In the tables 
on world trade and international payments, the aggregation is carried 
out on the basis of current exchange rates. Tables 49 - 52, 61 and 62 show 
also EU and euro-area "adjusted" balances. Theoretically, balances of EU 
and euro area vis-à-vis third countries should be identical to the sum of 
the balances of the individual countries in the EU or  the euro area. 
However, intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of 
reporting errors. 
Note on concepts and sources   Advanced economies :The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential output 
as estimated via a production function, where the increase in the capital 
stock and the difference between actual unemployment and the 
NAWRU play a key role. 
The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls and 
formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU trade 
coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to 
intra-EU exports, leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past 
the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates 
for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the 
extrapolation of the discrepancies observed in 2017.
