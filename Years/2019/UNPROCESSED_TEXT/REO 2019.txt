Global
 trade and manufacturing have weakened 
and so have these sectors in Europe. ˜e evolution of 
European growth depends on two forces. On the one 
hand, European exports are softening and prospects 
for a recovery in global trade are not as strong as 
they were six months ago. On the other hand, easier 
˚nancial conditions, expansionary ˚scal policy in 
many countries, and still-strong labor markets are 
supporting domestic demand. ˜is support is stronger 
in the newer European Union (EU) Member States 
(NMS). On balance, near-term growth in Europe is 
projected to moderate from 2.3˛percent in 2018 to 
1.4˛percent in 2019Šthe lowest growth rate since 
2013Šand rebound to 1.8˛percent in 2020. ˜is 
forecast, broadly unchanged from the April 2019 
World Economic Outlook, re˝ects di˙erences between 
advanced Europe, where growth has been revised 
down by 0.1˛percentage point to 1.3˛percent and 
1.5˛percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 
emerging Europe, where growth has been revised 
up by 0.5 and 0.2˛percentage point to 1.8˛percent 
and 2.5˛percent in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
Amid high uncertainty, risks to the outlook remain 
to the downside, with a no-deal Brexit the key risk 
in the near term. Monetary policy should remain 
accommodative where in˝ationary pressures are 
still subdued, which is the case in most European 
economies. ˜e potential side e˙ects from such policy 
on ˚nancial stability should be carefully monitored. 
Fiscal policy should continue to be guided by 
medium-term objectives. But plans for stimulus in 
case of a sharper downturn should be at the ready, not 
least because the scope for e˙ective monetary action 
has diminished. Countries with ample ˚scal space should implement ˚scal measures that boost potential 
growth. Reinvigorating structural reforms remains 
vital to raise subdued potential output growth and 
address long-term challenges, such as demographics.

data and developments as of October 25, 2019. 
A Trade- and Industry-Driven 
 Slowdown˜e slowdown in global trade and industrial 
activity that began in early 2018 has continued (Figure˛1.1). It came on the back of
 slower capital 
expenditure in Asia and sluggish production in 
the vehicle and technology sectors. Trade tensions 
have intensi˝ed, and Brexit-related uncertainty 
has continued, also weighing on trade.
 Growth 
in global export volumes has slowed signi˝cantly 
from about 4½˛percent in 2017 to close to zero 
in the ˝rst half of 2019 (Figure˛1.1, panel 1).

Industrial production is now expanding at a 
rate that is less than half of its early 2018 peak (Figure˛1.1, panel 2). 
European trade and industry have closely 
followed these global trends. Given Europe™s deep 
integration into global trade,1 European exports, 
both within and outside the region, stalled in the 
˝rst half of 2019 after decelerating in 2018. ˜e slowdown in European exports within the region 
is pronounced in intermediate goods, suggesting 
that the weakness in global trade has seeped into 
European supply chains. Overall, the slowdown 
in Europe™s exports has mainly stemmed from 
softening exports of machinery and transport 
equipment, and other manufactured goods 
(Figure˛1.2).
˜e sluggish demand for and production of cars 
have had an important e˙ect on European activity, 
re˚ecting both structural factors (for example, 
tighter emissions standards) and sluggish world 
demand. Car production remains particularly 
weak in 
Germany
, while it has held up among car producers in 
Central Europe,
 such as the 1See Huidrom and others (2019) for an in depth discussion of 
Europe™s integration into global trade and expected spillovers.
Czech Republic
, Hungary
, and the Slovak Republic
 (see Box˛1.1).
˜e weakness in European exports has meant 
that external surpluses in some advanced 
European economies have declined slightly but 
remain high, for example in 
Germany
 and the Netherlands
. In the NMS and several Southeastern 
European non-EU countries, still-strong domestic 
demand generally led to a small deterioration in current account balances, though market shares 
generally held up well, suggesting no signi˝cant 
loss in competitiveness. 
Turkey
 saw a sharp current account improvement mainly on import 
compression. 
Russia™s
 current account weakened on 
lower oil prices.
Amid weakening global demand, growth in 
advanced Europe
 slowed in the ˝rst half of 2019, 
despite an uptick in the ˝rst quarter due to 
Brexit-related stockpiling and one-o˙ factors 
such as good weather in 
Germany
. Net exports 
continued to be a drag on growth (Figure˛1.3, 
panel 1). Slowing ˝xed investment has also started 
to weigh on growth in some of the 
advanced 
European
 countries.Growth in 
emerging Europe,
 excluding 
Russia
 and Turkey,
 continued to hold up in the ˝rst half of 2019 thanks to robust private consumption, 
which is being driven by strong labor markets 
(Figure˛1.3, panel 2). Further, a higher absorption 
of EU funds and resilient services exports 
(Hungary
, Poland
) also helped cushion the adverse 
e˙ects of weakening manufacturing trade and 
elevated uncertainty. In 
Russia
, growth continued 
to remain modest re˚ecting weaker domestic 
demand, in particular sluggish investment. In 
Turkey
, growth resumed, buoyed by expansionary 
˝scal policy and rapid credit expansion by 
state-owned banks.
Consistent with weak activity, in˚ation has 
fallen in advanced Europe
. In 
emerging Europe
, in˚ation pressures remain relatively contained in 
most countries. With the e˙ects of earlier shocks 
dissipating, in˚ation in Russia
 has moderated to close to the target. In˚ation has also slowed in 
Turkey
, in part due to negative base e˙ects, but

it is still well above the target. However, in some 
NMS (Hungary
, Romania
) core in˚ation has risen, 
partly due to domestic demand pressures.
Will the Weakness in Trade 
and Manufacturing Spread?˜e same forces that have slowed activity over 
the past year are likely to continue to do so 
going forward. Asia™s capital expenditure and 
consumer durables slowdown will likely continue 
to weigh on Europe™s exports and growth as the 
region is a large exporter of capital goods and 
transport equipment. Solid demand growth in 
the United States
Ša large trading partner for 
many European countriesŠhas been a mitigating 
factor, but US growth is expected to ease from 
its strong pace. ˜e vehicle sector may continue 
to be a drag on growth, given signs of saturation 
in ChinaŠthe world™s largest auto marketŠ
continued tightening of emission standards, and 
shifting preferences toward electric vehicles. ˜e 
impact could be particularly sizable for countries 
where the vehicle sector accounts for a signi˝cant 
share of trade (for example, 
Germany
, the Slovak 
Republic
). While trade diversion e˙ects from 
USŒChina trade tensions could help mitigate the slowdown in European exports, these e˙ects 
have been estimated to be relatively small so far 
(World Bank 2019).
At the same time, the industry and trade 
slowdown, combined with trade- and 
Brexit-related uncertainty, has started to take 
a toll on ˝xed investment in several countries. 
Conversely, solid private consumption and a 
resilient services sector helped by strong labor 
markets may mitigate the weakness stemming 
from the deteriorating external environment. With 
labor markets still strong, consumer con˝dence 
has held up better than business con˝dence. ˜e services Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) still 
suggests expansionŠalbeit at a slower paceŠ
contrary to the manufacturing PMI, which has 
plunged deeper into contractionary territory 
(Figure˛1.4). ˜e divergence, however, may be 
temporary. Services™ value added in European 
manufacturing value added is estimated at about 
30˛percent, which is not trivial (Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development Trade 
in Value Added database). Furthermore, there 
are already signs that ˝rms are becoming more 
careful about hiring decisions (Figure˛1.5), which 
could weaken consumer con˝dence and dampen 
consumption. Macroeconomic policies could bu˙er activity. 
˜e stances of the European Central Bank and 
the US Federal Reserve have become more 
accommodative. In addition, some emerging 
European countries have loosened monetary policy 
(Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine
). On the back

of the accommodative monetary stance, overall 
˝nancial conditions have loosened. However, 
the impact might be limited as credit growth 
has been modest and most ˝rms do not report 
availability of credit as a key constraint to their 
expansion. Many countries in the region are also 
conducting expansionary ˝scal policy in 2019, 
albeit less so in 2020.Overall, Europe™s manufacturing and trade have 
weakened considerably, as in the rest of the world. 
Some signs of softness in domestic demand, 
particularly in investment, have appeared.
  Services 
and consumption have been resilient so far, but 
the extent of their continued resilience will depend 
on developments in labor markets.
Outlook: A Modest Recovery
Europe™s real GDP growth is projected to 
moderate to 1.4˛percent in 2019Šthe lowest 
rate since 2013Šfrom 2.3˛percent in 2018, 
before rebounding to 1.8˛percent in 2020 (Annex 
Table˛1.1). 
Advanced Europe
 is expected to recover 
only modestly from 1.3˛percent in 2019 to 
1.5˛percent in 2020 on the back of an expected 
pickup in external demand, though prospects 
for a recovery in global trade are not as good as 
six months ago. 
Turkey
™s growth is anticipated to 
recover from 0.2˛percent in 2019 to 3.0˛percent 
in 2020 as the economy continues to rebound 
from previous economic stresses. In 
Russia
, growth 
is projected to pick up from 1.1˛percent in 2019 
to 1.9˛percent in 2020, assuming the planned 
national projects are implemented e˙ectively. 
Growth in other 
emerging European economies 
is forecast to moderate to 3.7˛and 3.1˛percent in 
2019 and 2020, respectively, re˚ecting lagged 
spillovers from the ongoing slowdown in advanced 
Europe and growth converging to a more 
sustainable pace after some years of operating 
above capacity.
˜e growth projections for the entire region are 
broadly unchanged from the April 2019 
World 
Economic Outlook
. However, they mask di˙erences 
across country groups and some large revisions. In 
advanced Europe
, projections were downgraded by 
0.1˛percentage point both in 2019 and 2020, with 
generally larger revisions for those economies with 
greater exposure to manufacturing. In 
emerging Europe
, growth projections were revised up by 
0.5˛and 0.2˛percentage point in 2019 and 2020, 
respectively. In 
Turkey
, the large upward growth

revisions re˚ect the better-than-expected outturn 
in the ˝rst half of the year. Growth in 
Central 
European countries
 and Southeastern European EU 
member states has also been upgraded for 2019Œ20, re˚ecting robust domestic demand. 
Russia
 saw one of the largest downward revisions for 2019 on 
the back of a weak outcome in the ˝rst half of the 
year and signs of softening domestic demand and 
export growth.
Relatively low energy prices, slowing output 
growth, and weaker passthrough from wage 
growth (Chapter˛2) are expected to keep headline 
in˚ation contained. In 
advanced Europe
, in˚ation is expected to fall from 1.8˛percent in 2018 to 
1.4˛percent in 2019 and 1.5˛percent in 2020 
(0.1˛percentage point lower in both 2019 and 
2020, Annex Table˛1.2). In 
emerging Europe
, in˚ation is projected to temporarily pick up to 
6.9˛percent in 2019 from 6.3˛percent in 2018 
and to moderate to 5.7˛percent in 2020. ˜e 
downward revisions of 0.3 and 0.5˛percentage 
point for 2019 and 2020 are largely driven by 
Turkey
 in 2019 and Russia 
in 2020. In 
Turkey
, the 2019 in˚ation forecast has been revised down by 
1.8˛percentage points due to the more favorable 
market sentiment, which supported lira stability. 
However, the in˚ation outlook is highly uncertain 
over the medium term, as the central bank needs 
to strengthen monetary policy credibility and 
lower in˚ation expectations. In 
Russia
, in˚ation, which picked up earlier in 2019, is expected to be below the target at the end of 2019 and in 
2020, as e˙ects of the January 2019 value-added 
tax rate hike and other one-o˙ factors dissipate. In 
emerging European
 countries excluding 
Russia
 and Turkey
, despite some upward revisions on the 
back of stronger-than-expected activity, in˚ation is 
generally expected to remain restrained as growth 
is expected to ease.Amid High Uncertainty, Risks 
Tilted to the Downside
Amid high uncertainty, risks to the forecasts are 
to the downside. In the near term, the modalities 
of Brexit are key for the European outlook. A 
no-deal Brexit could have a sizable impact on 
activity in the United Kingdom
 and the European 
Union
Šwith output lower by about 3½ and 
½ percent in two years, respectively, relative to 
the April 2019 forecast (see Box˛1.1 of the April 
2019 World Economic Outlook
). Value added trade 
exposure of European countries to the 
United 
Kingdom, though smaller than to Germany
Šthe main European hubŠis sizable (Figure˛1.6). 
Further escalation of trade tensions and related 
uncertainty when combined with tighter ˝nancing 
conditions can weigh signi˝cantly on European 
investment and growth (Ebeke and Siminitz 
2018; IMF 2018). More broadly, the weakness in 
manufacturing and trade could spread to other 
sectorsŠnotably servicesŠand could occur faster 
and to a greater extent than expected. Other risks 
include abrupt declines in risk appetite, a build-up 
of ˝nancial vulnerabilities, and the re-emergence 
of de˚ationary pressures in advanced economies. 
Country-speci˝c factors (such as domestic 
weakness in some large euro area countries) and 
geopolitical tensions could exacerbate the e˙ects from weak global trade and manufacturing. Delays 
in the implementation of structural reforms, 
demographic challenges, climate change, rising inequality, and declining trust in mainstream 
policies could also dampen growth in the medium 
to long term. Policy PrioritiesMonetary policy in many European countries 
should remain accommodative given muted 
in˚ationary pressures. As discussed in Chapter˛2, 
strong wage growth is less likely to boost in˚ation 
than in the past due to rising competitive pressures 
faced by ˝rms, still robust corporate pro˝tability, 
and the generally low in˚ation environment. In 
advanced Europe
, where in˚ation remains largely 
below target, monetary policy should continue 
to focus on supporting the gradual upward 
adjustment of in˚ation toward policy objectives. 
In 
Russia
, monetary policy loosening could be 
considered given contained in˚ation and as 
in˚ationary pressures ease. However, in 
Romania
 and Turkey
, monetary policy should be kept tight 
6REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EURO

to contain in˚ationary pressures and strengthen 
policy credibility. Most other e
merging European 
countries can a˙ord to keep monetary policy 
accommodative for now.
Nevertheless, loose monetary policy for longer 
calls for heightened monitoring of ˝nancial sector vulnerabilities and other possible adverse 
developments. Pockets of vulnerabilities in some 
countries should be closely watched and addressed 
with targeted macroprudential measures as 
needed. In the 
euro area 
and other countries with negative interest rates, the impact on the ˝nancial 
sector, in particular, on traditional business 
operations and pro˝tability and on asset prices 
should be closely monitored. For example, house 
prices have strengthened in several countries and 
the vulnerability of other ˝nancial institutions has increased.

assessment of bank balance sheets, and stress tests

Regarding ˝scal policy, given output above or 
close to full employment in most countries, and 
generally high debt levels in many European 
countries, the ˝scal stance should remain 
anchored by countries™ medium-term objectives, 
while allowing automatic stabilizers to work

human capital or infrastructure needs (
Germany, 
Netherlands
), a measured ˝scal expansion should 
be considered to boost potential outputŠsome 
measures have already been announcedŠand 
would also help reduce their external surpluses. 
Considering the precarious outlook, positive 
spillovers to less cyclically strong economies would 
be welcome. ˜ose countries with still-elevated 
levels of public debt and de˝cit should proceed 
with ˝scal consolidation to reduce economic 
vulnerabilities, except where private demand is 
already so weak that consolidation would push 
output growth far below potential. All countries

take advantage of currently low interest rates. If 
signi˝cant negative risks materialize, given limited 
monetary policy space, the ˝scal stance will need 
to be more expansionary, while keeping in mind 
medium-term debt sustainability objectives. In 
this case, countries with a high de˝cit and public debt could consider a temporarily slower pace of 
˝scal consolidation or a temporary expansion, as 
long as debt sustainability is secured and market 
con˝dence is not undermined. Policymakers 
should prepare contingency plans for such an 
eventuality, focusing on growth-friendly and 
inclusive policies that deliver support in a timely 
manner. A synchronized ˝scal response, albeit 
appropriately di˙erentiated across countries, could 
become suitable.Structural reforms remain essential to raise 
potential output, boost resilience, and strengthen 
inclusive growth. Product market reforms in 
many countries could improve competitiveness 
and increase productivity. Policies to increase 
labor force participation rates and enhance 
human capital (including shifting taxes away from 
labor, enhancing apprenticeship programs, and 
improving tailoring education to labor market 
needs) should be urgently implemented, given 
rising demographic challenges and technological developments in the region. Completing the 
euro 
area™s
 architecture is critical to increase its resilience 
to shocks. ˜e 
European Union
 would bene˝t from 
deepening the single market for services to increase 
eˆciency. In many 
emerging European
 countries, structural reforms have achieved a dramatic 
transformation in the 30˛years of transition. Still, 
strengthening governance and improving public 
sector eˆciency remain imperative to sustain 
continued and equitable convergence of living 
standards to 
advanced European
 levels.

˜e vehicle sector is important in many European countries. In line with global trends, vehicle production has slowed 
in the region, but there is considerable heterogeneity across economies. ˜e near-term outlook remains conservative, 
and potential supply chain reorganizations pose uncertainty in the medium term.
˜e vehicle sector is important in many European countries, for both the domestic economy and exports. 
For instance, in 
Germany
Šthe largest vehicle producer in EuropeŠvehicles constitute about 20˛percent of 
manufacturing and about 17˛percent of exports. ˜e sector is also signi˝cant for 
Central and Eastern Europe
 (CEE): for example, in the Slovak Republic,
 it comprises about one-third of manufacturing and more than a 
quarter of exports. Also, the auto industry constitutes one of the main supply chains in the region.
In line with global trends (Box˛1.1 of the October 2019 
World Economic Outlook
), Europe™s vehicle production 
has fallen and has been one of the main contributors to the industrial production slump in the European 
Union (EU) (Figure˛1.1.1). Several structural and cyclical factors are behind the slowdown, such as the 
tighter EU emission standards, a shift in preferences from diesel toward gasoline and other alternative fuel 
vehicles, and weakening global demand, especially from 
China. After the emissions-related dip in 2018, car 
registrationsŠa demand indicatorŠhave normalized. 
Nevertheless, there is a signi˝cant heterogeneity across European countries. ˜e 2018 vehicle production 
contraction was led by 
Germany
 and to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom
 and Spain
 (Figure˛1.1.2). 
Germany™s production remained weak in the ˝rst half of 2019, dropping by about 12˛percent versus the ˝rst 
half of 2018. Conversely, vehicle production held up in

Anecdotal evidence suggests that CEE™s 
relatively robust car production could be attributed to the types of 
cars produced in the region, such as SUVs and utilitarian cars, whose demand remained more buoyant. 
Furthermore, industry reports suggest the vehicle slowdown in Germany has had a muted impact on 
CEE supply chains, in part because 
CEE suppliers have been able to adapt and re-orient to other models and plants 
outside of Germany
.Overall, the near-term outlook for Europe remains conservative on the back of falling demand for diesel cars, 
trade tensions, Brexit-related uncertainty, and additional tighter emission standards. Potential reorganizations 
of supply chainsŠrelated to the shift to alternative fuel vehiclesŠpose considerable uncertainty to the 
medium-term outlook. A sustained weakness in the vehicle sector could spill over to the broader economy and 
across borders via supply chains.

Wages
 have been rising faster than productivity in 
many European countries, yet signs of underlying 
consumer price pressures remain limited. To shed light 
on this puzzle, this chapter examines the link between 
wage growth and in˝ation in Europe and the 
factors that in˝uence the strength of the passthrough 
from labor costs to consumer prices. ˜e chapter 
˚nds that, historically, wage growth leads to higher 
in˝ation, but the impact has weakened since 2009. 
˜e passthrough is signi˚cantly lower in periods of 
subdued in˝ation expectations, greater competitive 
pressures, and robust corporate pro˚tability. ˜ese 
˚ndings suggest that the recent pickup in wage growth 
is likely to have a more muted impact on in˝ation 
than in the past.Labor market conditions have been improving in 
Europe since 2013, with strong job growth and 
unemployment falling to lower-than-precrisis 
levels in most economies. Yet, as discussed in 
Chapter˛2 of the May 2018 
Regional Economic 
OutlookŠEurope,
 nominal wage growth remained 
subdued for many years (Figure˛2.1, panels 1 
and 2). ˜is trend has recently started to reverse, 
especially in the European Union™s

states (NMS).1 Spurred by strong labor markets

1˜is chapter makes a distinction between long-standing and 
newer EU member states, rather than between ﬁadvancedﬂ and 
ﬁemergingﬂ European economies, to better capture the disparate 
wage developments in these two sets of countries. Newer EU mem

Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, 
and Slovenia. ˜e long-standing EU members are the countries that 
joined the European Union before May 1, 2004: Austria, Bel
-gium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the 
United Kingdom (EU15). Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Malta 
are not included in the analysis because their GDP data distort labor 
productivity numbers. Israel, Norway, and Switzerland are added to 
this group, hence the acronym EU15+3.

growth averaged nearly 8˛percent in NMS since 
the ˝rst quarter of 2017, and 2˛percent in other 
European countries (EU15+3). As discussed in 
Chapter˛1 of this Regional Economic Outlook,
 the strengthening of wage growth has supported 
domestic demand, namely consumption, and has cushioned the drag from slowing global trade on 
aggregate activity in the region.
2 In contrast, core 
in˚ation remained, on average, below 2˛percent 
in both groups of countries. In addition to 
rising faster than prices of goods and services, 
compensation costs have outpaced improvements 
in labor productivity, especially in NMS 
(Figure˛2.1, panel 3). Productivity-adjusted wage 
growth in NMS has exceeded in˚ation by about 
3˛percentage points on average since early 2017, 
with even stronger growth in the 
Czech Republic
 and Hungary
. In EU15+3, the gap between 
productivity-adjusted wage growth and in˚ation 
is smaller, at about 0.4˛percentage point, but still 
sizeable compared to 2000Œ16. In several of these 
countries (for example, Germany
, Israel
, Portugal
), annual real wage growth exceeded productivity 
gains by more than 1˛percentage point since the 
beginning of 2017. ˜e apparent disconnect between wage and price 
developments in Europe in the last few years is 
puzzling. Economic theory suggests that if real 
wage growth exceeds productivity gains, the higher 
labor costs faced by businesses should eventually 
raise the prices of the products and services they 
provide. Labor costs constitute a large share of 
business expenses in Europe: almost 50˛percent in 
NMS and 53˛percent in EU15+3 countries. And 
yet, in˚ation has remained stubbornly below target 
in many countries, despite closing output gaps and rapid gains in productivity-adjusted wages in the 
past three years. A variety of factors may explain 
this puzzle. ˜e lack of in˚ationary pressures may 
simply re˚ect delays in the transmission of wage 
2In NMS, in particular, labor shortages have signi˝cantly 
increased. In 2019, more than 40˛percent of ˝rms in NMS cited 
labor shortages as a major factor limiting production, up from only 
10˛percent in 2013. Estimated unemployment gaps also suggest that 
labor markets are notably tight in NMS. For previous analyses of 
drivers of wage growth, see Bonam and others (2019), Chapter˛2 of 
the May 2018 
Regional Economic OutlookŠEurope,
 and Chapter˛2 of 
the October 2017

, among others.
developments to prices, suggesting a pickup in 
in˚ation may be imminent. However, there might 
have been structural changes to the way ˝rms 
incorporate costs into their pricing decisions that has a˙ected the relationship between wage growth 
and in˚ation. If ˝rms and workers expect low 
in˚ation going forward, for example due to the 
improved credibility of the central bank, ˝rms may 
be reluctant to raise their prices even when faced 
with higher wage costs as they expect increases in 
costs to be only temporary. In such a situation, 
the passthrough of higher wages to prices would 
be muted due to lower expected persistence of 
cost and price changes. Alternatively, the rise in 
competition, either domestically or from abroad, 
may have limited the ability of ˝rms to pass 
cost increases to consumers for fear of losing 
market share. Another important consideration 
of a more cyclical nature is ˝rms™ pro˝tability, 
which determines how much and how fast wage 
growth feeds into prices. To the extent that ˝rms 
have bu˙ersŠcomfortable pro˝t marginsŠthey 
may be able to absorb higher wage costs without increasing prices.
Understanding the extent to which these potential 
explanations are behind the recent disconnect 
between in˚ation and wage growth has important 
implications for the in˚ation outlook in Europe 
and the appropriate policy response.
With this backdrop in mind, this chapter 
examines the following key questions:
Ł How large is the passthrough of labor costs to 
in˚ation in Europe, and how long does it take 
for wage growth to feed into prices?
Ł Have there been notable changes in the extent 
of passthrough over time?
Ł What factors in˚uence the extent of passthrough? How is the passthrough shaped 
by various country and sectoral characteristics?

feedback e˙ects of import prices and labor market 
slack to quantify the extent of passthrough 
from wages to prices. ˜e historical empirical 
relationship between year-over-year nominal wage 
growth adjusted for trend productivity growth 
and core consumer price in˚ation is examined 
for a sample of 27 European countries since 1995 
within a panel vector auto regression (PVAR) 
framework. ˜e analysis estimates a four variable 
PVAR, comprising import price in˚ation, nominal 
wage growth adjusted for trend productivity 
growth, core consumer price in˚ation, and 
unemployment gap.
3 Overall, this empirical 
approach sheds light on the dynamic nature of 
the passthrough from wages to in˚ation, while 
embedding the traditional Philips curve dynamics 
between wage growth, in˚ation, and labor market 
slack; and capturing ˝rms™ labor and imported 
input costs (see also Peneva and Rudd 2017; 
Chapter˛2 of the May 2018 
Regional Economic 
OutlookŠEurope
; and Bobeica and others 2019). ˜e baseline measure of wages is compensation per 
employee. Conceptually, compensation per hour 
worked may be more relevant for ˝rms™ pricing 
decisions if companies rely on temporary workers 
or are able to reduce hours and then pay only for 
hours worked. However, hours worked tend to 
be measured with more noise, and compensation 
per hours worked data are not available for all 
countries in the sample (OECD 2009).To examine the role of various factors in shaping 
the extent of passthrough, the chapter uses an 
extension of the PVAR model known as the 
interacted-PVAR (IPVAR) model. ˜e IPVAR 
speci˝cation allows the response of the variables of 
interest to shocksŠthat is, response of in˚ation to 
3˜e regressions use quarterly data, include four lags of each 
variable, and utilize Cholesky ordering, meaning that the variables 
are included in the model in the decreasing order of exogeneity. 
Import prices are assumed to be the most exogenous and the 
unemployment gap the most endogenous. Wage growth is assumed 
to have an immediate impact on in˚ation, but wages are assumed 
to take at least a quarter to respond to consumer price movements. 
˜e main results presented in this chapter are robust to alternative

a wage shockŠto vary depending on observable 
state variables (Towbin and Weber 2013). By 
using the full sample of countries and periods, the IPVAR approach has greater statistical power 
to detect di˙erences in the degree of passthrough 
when country characteristics change over time. 
It is worth noting that the analysis examines the 
role of each factor separately. Quantifying the 
relative importance of di˙erent factors is diˆcult 
within the IPVAR framework, given the limited 
country sample and time-period covered, as it 
requires suˆcient heterogeneity across factors. 
To the extent possible, the chapter attempts to 
examine whether these state-dependent di˙erences 
also hold within the NMS subsample, where the 
disconnect between wage growth and in˚ation 
has been most pronounced. ˜e link between 
wage growth and in˚ation in selected NMS at the 
sectoral level is also examined in Box˛2.1.
When discussing the ˝ndings of the IPVAR 
analysis, the chapter reports the cumulative 
response of in˚ation to a wage growth shock after 
12 quarters in the high versus low passthrough 
regime of the interacting variable, when the latter 
is a dummy (for example, pre- versus post-global 
˝nancial crisis, or high versus low in˚ation 
environment), or at the 25th and 75th percentile 
of the interacting variable, when the latter is 
continuous (for example, in˚ation expectations anchoring, corporate pro˝tability, labor share, and 
product market regulation).
4Wage Growth Leads to 
˜e analysis suggests that, historically, in the 
sample of European countries, wage growth leads 
to higher core in˚ation after several quarters. 
˜e initial impact of a wage shock on in˚ation is rather small, but it builds up over time, peaking 
after about six quarters before slowly dissipating 
(Figure˛2.2, panels 1˛and˛2). After three years, the 
cumulative impact of a 1˛percentage point increase

in wages is 1.1˛percentage point higher in˚ation 
in NMS and 1˛percentage point higher in˚ation 
in other European countries. Taking into account 
the dynamic response of wages to their own shock 
over this time period, the impact on in˚ation is 
a˛fraction of the impact on wages (Figure˛2.2, 
panel˛3). Overall, the passthrough ratioŠde˝ned 
as the ratio between the cumulative change in 
prices and the cumulative change in wagesŠis 
about a third.
The Passthrough Has Weakened in Recent Years
˜e passthrough of labor costs into core 
in˚ation seems to have weakened after the global 
˝nancial crisis. ˜e results obtained using the 
IPVAR framework indicate that after 2009, the 
cumulative impact of wage growth on European 
core in˚ation has decreased, with the passthrough 
ratio declining to less than 20˛percent (Figure˛2.3,

, ˝rms may have changed their price-setting behavior.
Intuitively, if ˝rms expect low in˚ation, they are 
likely to perceive cost increases as transitory and 
may be reluctant to pass higher labor costs onto 
consumers since they expect their competitors to hike their prices only moderately (Taylor 
2000). ˜us, price stability, for example due to 
improved in˚ation expectations anchoring, is 
likely to reduce the sensitivity of in˚ation to wage 
growth.
7 Downward nominal wage rigidities 
also tend to be more binding in a low-in˚ation 
environment (Daly and Hobijn 2014). Conversely, 
cost increases are likely to be perceived as more 
persistent in countries with high in˚ation and higher in˚ation expectations, in which case 7Similarly, empirical literature has established that lower overall

wage growth and in˚ation would be more 
closely linked.To shed light on this mechanism, the chapter 
performs two complementary exercises. First, it 
examines whether the link between wage growth 
and in˚ation depends on the prevailing in˚ation 
rate in the economy.
8 It then directly examines 
the role of in˚ation expectations anchoring in 
shaping the responsiveness of core in˚ation to 
wage growth.

empirical framework, uncovers a tight relationship 
between the prevailing in˚ation rate and the 
extent of passthrough from wages to core in˚ation:

in˚ation expectations anchoring, the analysis allows for the largest

is systematically lower and slower in periods 
of below-average in˚ation. In a low-in˚ation 
environment, de˝ned as periods during which 
core in˚ation is below the country average, 
a˛1˛percentage point wage increase raises in˚ation 
by a cumulative 0.3˛percentage point over three 
years, with an estimated passthrough ratio of 
only 11˛percent (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 and 2, 
section B). In a high-in˚ation environment, 
de˝ned as periods during which in˚ation is above 
the country average, the cumulative impact is 
three times higher, with a passthrough ratio of 
about 30˛percent.
A similar pattern is revealed using a direct measure 
of the degree of in˚ation expectations anchoring. 
˜e analysis employs a newly constructed index 
of in˚ation expectations anchoring developed 
by Bems and others (2018; see also Chapter˛3 
of the October 2018 
World Economic Outlook
). ˜e metric employed in this chapter measures 
the deviation of long-term in˚ation forecasts 
produced by professional analysts from the central 
bank™s target.
Intuitively, if in˚ation expectations are well 
anchored, predictions of future in˚ation should 
be, on average, close to the target pursued by 
the central bank. According to this metric, 
long-term in˚ation expectations are generally 
well-anchored in Europe. While two-year in˚ation 
expectations are somehow higher in NMS than in 
other European countries (Figure˛2.4, panel˛1), 
anchoring has improved signi˝cantly during the 
past two decades, in line with trends observed in 
other emerging economies. In contrast, in˚ation 
expectations have been broadly stable in EU15+3 
countries and, in fact, have remained stubbornly 
low in the 
euro area

Bank™s targetŠfor several years after the global

in˚ation expectations. Across all sample countries, 
labor cost increases have a more muted impact on 
in˚ation when in˚ation expectations are better 
anchored, as captured in the metric constructed by 
Bems and others (2018; see Figure˛2.4, panel 2). 
A 1˛percentage point wage increase raises in˚ation

when expectations are anchored within a low 
range (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 and 2, section C).
˜is ˝nding is even stronger in the NMS 
subsample, where in˚ation expectations became 
signi˝cantly better anchored in the 2000s. In fact, 
the improved anchoring of in˚ation expectations 
may be an important reason why the passthrough 
has declined over time in the sample countries 
analyzed in this chapter, as well as in several 
Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European 
countries studied by De˛Luigi and others (2019). 
In contrast, in the four largest 
euro area
 countries studied by Bobeica and others (2019), the degree 
of anchoring of in˚ation expectations remained 
relatively unchanged (Figure˛2.4, panel 2), with 
in˚ation expectations even drifting below target in 
recent years (Figure˛2.4, panel˛1).
10The Role of CompetitionFirms™ pricing strategies depend to a signi˝cant 
extent on their exposure to competition, either 
domestic or from abroad (Lamo and Smets 2009). 
In a more competitive environment, ˝rms may 
be reluctant to pass cost increases onto consumers 
due to fear of losing market share to competitors 
or being driven out of the market (see, for 
example, Carney 2015, and Obstfeld 2019).
11 ˜ree pieces of analysis in this chapter suggest the 
important role of competition in shaping the link 
between wage growth and in˚ation.
Europe is one of the world™s regions most open 
to international trade and most deeply integrated in global supply chains (see Huidrom and others 
2019). Yet, the numbers hide dramatic di˙erences 
in exposure to foreign competition across sectors 
10˜e di˙erence could also be due to a long-term restriction 
imposed by Bobeica and others (2019) that the gap between 
productivity-adjusted nominal wage growth and price in˚ation must 
disappear in the long-term. ˜e analyses in this chapter do not 
impose such a restriction.
11So far, there are limited signs of loss of competitiveness in the 
tradeable sector despite the faster growth in wages relative to pro
-ductivity. In the NMS, still-strong domestic demand generally led to 
a small deterioration in current account balances, but market shares 
have generally held up well.
of the economy. Import penetrationŠmeasured 
as the ratio of ˝nal imports to sectoral gross value 
addedŠis about 60˛percent in the manufacturing 
sector (Figure˛2.5, panel 1). In˛contrast, in the 
services sector, the import penetration ratio is 
less than 5˛percent. ˜ese patterns are consistent 
with higher barriers to trade in services, relative 
to the manufacturing sector, as discussed in Boz 
and others (2019). As a result of higher exposure 
to foreign competition, non-energy industrial 
goods prices tend to be closely correlated with 
producer prices in other countries (Carney 2017, 
Forbes 2019).
12 One would also expect a lower 
wage-to-in˚ation passthrough in this sector 
relative to services. 
Indeed, the analysis con˝rms that higher 
economy-wide wage growth is more likely to lead 
to higher growth in services prices, relative to 
non-energy industrial goods™ prices, which re˚ect 
mostly prices of manufactured goods (Figure˛2.3, 
panels 1 and 2, section D; Figure˛2.5, panel 
2). PVAR regressions suggest that in EU15+3 
countries, the extent to which economy-wide wage growth feeds into services in˚ation is nearly 
two times stronger than the impact of wage 
growth on non-energy industrial goods in˚ation. 
In NMS, prices of services are about four times 
more responsive to wage increases compared to 
manufacturing prices.A more granular sectoral analysis con˝rms the 
potentially important in˚uence of exposure 
to competitive pressures for the wageŒprice 
link. Using annual data on producer prices, 
productivity-adjusted wage growth, imports, and 
output across 55˛sectors in 32 European countries 
during 2000Œ14 from the World Input Output 
Database (WIOD) and Johnson and Noguera 
(2017), panel regressions reveal that the correlation 
between sectoral wage growth and growth in 
sectoral value-added de˚ators is signi˝cantly 
higher in sectors that have lower import

penetration.13 ˜is pattern holds even when 
restricting the analysis to the 19˛manufacturing 
sectors included in the WIOD. ˜is ˝nding is 
in line with Bobeica and others (2019), who examine di˙erences in the passthrough of wage 
growth to in˚ation in three broad sectors (namely, 
construction, manufacturing, and services) in 
Germany
, France
, Italy
, and Spain
. ˜ree out 
of those four economies have somewhat larger 
passthrough of wage growth to in˚ation in the 
less-traded services sectors. Box˛2.1 documents 
a similar pattern for a subsample of NMS, and demonstrates that even within the subsamples 
of manufacturing and services sectors, higher 
foreign competition is associated with a lower 
responsiveness of producer prices to wages.
Finally, the chapter also ˝nds some empirical 
evidence that more ˝erce domestic product 
market competition is associated with a somewhat 
lower passthrough of wage growth to in˚ation. 
Anecdotally, EU ˝rms that participated in 
the European Central Bank™s Wage Dynamics 
Network Surveys were more likely to indicate 
their preference to reduce other costs rather than 
increase prices in response to wage shocks when 
operating in a more competitive environment 
(Bertola and others 2012). IPVAR regressions 
based on OECD™s product market regulation 
(PMR) indices (shown in Figure˛2.5, panel˛3) 
also suggest that more vibrant product market 
competition and fewer barriers to entry mute the 
sensitivity of consumer prices to wage increases. 
˜e passthrough of wage growth to in˚ation is 
marginally higher when evaluated at the 75th 
percentile of a country™s PMR score (that is, 
in countries with higher regulatory barriers in 
product markets) than at the 25th percentile of the 
PMR index (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 and 2, section E). 
At a sectoral level, Box˛2.1 also ˝nds that stronger 
domestic competition, as captured by the Lerner 
13Due to the lower frequency and limited time coverage of the 
data, the analysis relies on panel regressions, which model growth in 
sectoral value-added de˚ators as a function of its lag and growth in 
productivity adjusted sectoral wage growth, controlling for countryŒ
sector and countryŒyear ˝xed e˙ects. ˜e latter capture the e˙ect of 
all country-speci˝c time-varying shocks, such as changes in in˚ation 
expectations, economic slack, commodity price shocks, and the like.

producer prices in the services sector.
˜is ˝nal section examines the relationship 
between corporate pro˝tability and the labor 
costŒin˚ation passthrough. Firms with higher 
pro˝t margins have room to absorb a higher wage 
bill without passing the cost onto consumers, for example, to retain market share. Overall, 
economy-wide pro˝t shares remain high in 
Europe, and in NMS in particular (Figure˛2.6, 
panel 1). At the end of 2018, corporate 
pro˝ts amounted to 47˛percent of gross value 
added in NMS and 40˛percent in EU15+3 
countries.14 However, the recent increase in 
productivity-adjusted wages went hand-in-hand 
with a decline in corporate pro˝t shares. Since 
the beginning of 2017, corporate pro˝ts declined 
each year by about 1˛percent of gross value added 
in NMS economies and 0.3˛percent in˛other 
European countries. ˜is pattern suggests that 
˝rms are indeed using their pro˝t bu˙ers to absorb 
the faster wage growth, rather than passing the 
higher labor costs to their clients.15 ˜e IPVAR analysis con˝rms the inverse 
association between the corporate pro˝t share and 
the wage-to-in˚ation passthrough. In countries 
and periods when the economy-wide corporate sector pro˝t share is relatively high, a signi˝cantly 
smaller share of wage growth ˝nds its way into 
consumer price in˚ation (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 
and 2, section˛F). A 1˛percentage point increase 
in labor costs leads to a cumulative increase in 
in˚ation of only 0.7˛percentage point during 
the three-year period, when evaluated at the 
75th percentile of the distribution of corporate 
pro˝tability. When corporate pro˝ts are relatively 
thin (when pro˝ts are at the 25th percentile of the 
distribution of corporate pro˝tability), the impact 
14In contrast, corporate pro˝ts account for only a third of gross 
value added in the United States.
15Admittedly, this pattern is to be expected: higher wages, unless 
accompanied by employment cuts, will have to translate into lower

of wage growth on in˚ation is 2.5 times higher, 
with a somewhat stronger passthrough.
Rising corporate pro˝t shares mirror the 
declining share of income that goes to workers. As 
highlighted in Chapter˛3 of the April 2017 
World 
Economic Outlook
, the labor share of income has 
been on a downward trend in many countries 
since the 1990s. A low labor share means that 
wage developments matter less for in˚ation. ˜e 
IPVAR regressions con˝rm this observation, 
with the cumulative impact of wage increases on 
in˚ation in a low labor share regime very similar 
to the high corporate pro˝t regime (Figure˛2.3, 
panels 1 and 2, section G).Finally, enhanced access to relatively cheaper and 
potentially higher-quality inputs, for example investment goods, allows ˝rms to pay higher

wages without raising prices (Andrews and others 
2018). ˜e relative prices of machinery and 
equipment have declined markedly since the 
1990s (Figure˛2.6, panel˛2; and Chapter˛3 of the 
April 2019 
World Economic Outlook
). ˜is is also linked to a more muted wage growthŒin˚ation 
passthrough (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 and 2, section 
H). More broadly, as the exercise discussed 
above demonstrates, healthy aggregate corporate 
pro˝tability and an increase in competition are 
not necessarily incompatible. Many factors may 
support corporate pro˝ts, even as wages rise, such 
as access to cheaper intermediate inputs, lower 
taxation or ˝nancing costs, the adoption of new 
technologies that may reduce the demand for 
labor, and the like.
Conclusions and Policy Labor markets remain strong in Europe, despite 
some recent softening discussed in Chapter˛1. 
Wage growth has risen above productivity gains, 
especially in NMS, yet signs of underlying 
consumer price pressures remain limited. ˜is 
chapter explored several factors that in˚uence 
the strength of the passthrough of wage growth 
to in˚ation.˜e evidence presented in this chapter suggests 
that, historically, wage growth has been an 
important determinant of price developments in 
Europe. ˜e cumulative impact of a 1˛percentage 
point increase in wages is 1.1˛percentage point 
higher in˚ation in European countries at the end 
of three years. ˜e overall passthrough ratio, which 
takes into account the response of wages to their 
own increases, is about a third.
However, there are several reasons to expect the 
recent pickup in wage growth to have a more 
muted impact on in˚ation than in the past. ˜e chapter ˝nds that the passthrough of wage growth 
to in˚ation is weaker when in˚ation and in˚ation 
expectations are subdued, corporate pro˝tability 
is higher, and ˝rms are exposed to ˝ercer 
competition.What do these ˝ndings mean for the in˚ation outlook and the appropriate policy response? 
As discussed above, a number of cyclical (for 
example, in˚ation, corporate pro˝tability) and 
structural (such as the degree of competition) 
factors shape the responsiveness of in˚ation 
to wage developments. Currently, in˚ation 
and in˚ation expectations are near historical 
lows for three quarters of European economies 
(Figure˛2.7). Corporate pro˝tability is still healthy. 
In NMS, corporate pro˝t shares have started to 
decline, consistent with ˝rms letting their pro˝t 
margins absorb the rise in labor costs, rather than passing these costs onto consumers. However, 
corporate pro˝tability remains high from a 
historical perspective and signi˝cantly above that 
of EU15+3. Finally, ˝rms continue to report very 
high levels of competition for their products.

aggregate level, more than two-thirds of ˝rms 
report increased competitive pressures compared 
to the precrisis era according to the latest Wage 
Dynamics Network Survey. All of these factors 
suggest that it is unlikely that the recent increase 
in wage growth will meaningfully spur in˚ation 
in the near term. ˜ese ˝ndings support the 
need for monetary policy in many European 
countries to remain accommodative for longer 
in order to guard against a downshift in in˚ation 
expectations, as discussed in Chapter˛1. However, 
as the prolonged period of accommodative 
˝nancial conditions may have created an 
environment conducive to greater risk taking, 
policy makers need to remain vigilant and guard 
against further buildup of ˝nancial vulnerabilities 
and other undesirable side e˙ects, as discussed in Chapter˛1 of the October 2019

Industry-based
 analysis reveals a strong link between sectoral wage growth and producer prices across 
70˛industries in eight of the European Union™s newer member states (NMS) during 1995Œ2016.
1,2 ˜is box 
presents estimates based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development™s Structural 
Analysis (STAN) Database, which includes 22 industries in the manufacturing sector and 40˛industries in 
the services sector. ˜e impact of wage growth on producer prices at the sectoral level is estimated using 
error-correction mean-group autoregressive distributed lag regressions since the annual frequency of the 
available data does not provide suˆcient time variation needed for the estimation of a panel vector auto 
regression (PVAR) model. Overall, a˛1˛percentage point increase in unit labor costs is found to increase 
producer prices by 0.9˛percentage point after three years. ˜is cumulative increase is the smallest in 
Poland
 and Hungary
 at about 0.5˛percentage point, and the largest in 
Latvia at 1.3˛percentage points.
3˜e transmission of wage increases to sectoral prices is stronger in the services sector compared to 
manufacturing industries, and in times of economy-wide excess demand. On average, the cumulative 
response of sectoral in˚ation to wage increases reaches 0.7˛percentage point in manufacturing and is close 
to 1˛percentage point in services. ˜e impact of labor compensation on producer prices is much stronger 
when the economy-wide output gap is positive, and more so in services. When the economy operates above 
potential, the response of price in˚ation in the services sector to a 1˛percentage point increase in wage 
growth exceeds˛1. In times of excess supply, labor compensation™s impact on prices is much more muted 
(Figure˛2.1.1). ˜is result mirrors the economy-wide ˝nding of a signi˝cantly higher passthrough of wage 
growth to in˚ation in a high-in˚ation environment (Figure˛2.3, panels 1 and 2, section B). 
Greater exposure to competition is associated with a weaker link between wage hikes and sectoral in˚ation. 
˜e role of competition is examined in subsamples of countryŒindustry groups exposed to either higher- or 
lower-than-average intensity of competition within each sector. Firms in the services sector with greater 
domestic market power, as captured by the Lerner Index, tend to fully pass the cost of higher wages onto their 
consumers. In contrast, ˝rms with lower market power limit price increases to only two-thirds of wage hikes. 
In the manufacturing sector, the evidence on the role of domestic market power is less clear-cut. Exposure 
to foreign competition also a˙ects the responsiveness of producer prices to wage growth. ˜e passthrough 
appears smaller in sectors that are more exposed to foreign competition, as captured in the ratio of imports of 
goods or services for ˝nal consumption to sectoral gross output.
˜is box was prepared by Volodymyr Tulin.
1˜e analysis is based on the following countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Slovak 
Republic, and Slovenia. Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania are excluded due to data limitations.
2For the Baltics, output volume is proxied by real value-added.
3˜is result is not fully comparable to the average economy-wide cumulative impact in NMS (Figure˛2.2), since the regressions in 
this box do not account for the dynamic response of wages to either their own shock during the time period or their relationship with 
prices due to insuˆcient time variation in the annual data used in this analysis.

High market power is an indicator that takes the value of 1 when the Lerner Index exceeds the sectoral average. Firms™ exposure to foreign trade is measured as the share of imports of goods and services used for ˜nal consumption relative to total gross output of the industry. Subsamples are partitioned into high or low regimes by median values within the two sectors in 2000, except for import of services, where a doubled threshold is chosen since median exposure is low.Figure 2.1.1.
