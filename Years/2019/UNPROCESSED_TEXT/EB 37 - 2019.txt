 Summary
  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting in early June indicates 
that, while further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the 
resilience of the economy, softening global growth dynamics and we
ak international 
trade are still weighing on the euro area outlook. Moreover, the prolonged presence of 
uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and 
vulnerabilities in emerging markets
, is dampening
 economic sentim
ent, notably in the 
manufacturing sector. In this environment, inflationary pressures remain muted and 
indicators of inflation expectations have declined. Therefore, a significant degree of 
monetary stimulus continues to be necessary to ensure that financi
al conditions 
remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build
-up of 
domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium 
term.
 Accordingly, the Governing Council adjusted its forward guidance on 
policy 
interest rates and underlined its determination to act 
if the medium
-term inflation 
outlook continues to fall short of its aim
. Survey indicators suggest that global economic activity continued to weaken in the 
second quarter of 2019 and the drop in
 the global services output 
Purchasing 
Managers' Index
 in June raises the risk of a more broad
-based deterioration in the 
global growth outlook. Global import growth shifted back into positive territory in April 
after four months of continued contraction, 
but heightened trade tensions persist. 
Global inflation decreased in May, driven largely by a slowdown in energy prices.
 Since the Governing Council™s meeting in June 2019, euro area long
-term risk
-free 
rates have declined amid market expectations of conti
nuing accommodative monetary 
policy. Sovereign spreads have remained broadly stable, albeit with a large decrease 
in Italian spreads. Equity prices have increased, supported by the low risk
-free rates, 
and spreads on corporate bonds have decreased. In fore
ign exchange markets, the 
euro has depreciated moderately in trade
-weighted terms.
 Following an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018
, e
uro area real GDP 
increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019.
 Incoming economic 
data and survey information continue to point to somewhat slower growth in the 
second and third quarters. This mainly reflects the ongoing weakness in international 
trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are part
icularly 
affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, activity in the services 
and construction sectors 
is resilient and the labour market continues to improve. 
Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favo
urable 
financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, as well as the mildly 
expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activity.

 Summary
  3 Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in Ju
ne 2019, from 1.2 % in May, as 
lower energy price inflation 
was more than offset by 
higher HICP inflation excluding 
food and energy. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely 
to decline over the coming months, before risi
ng again towards the end of the year. 
Looking through the recent volatility 
due to
 temporary factors, measures of underlying 
inflation remain generally muted. Indicators of inflation expectations have declined. 
While labour cost pressures have strengthened
 and broadened amid high levels of 
capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, the pass
-through of cost pressures 
to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. Over the medium term 
underlying inflation is expect
ed to increase, supporte
d by
 monetary policy measures, 
the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth.
 Monetary dynamics remained resilient despite the fading
-out of the positive impact of 
monthly net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) and weaker euro 
area economic growth. Credit to the private sector remained the main source of 
money creation and the contribution of net external assets also remained strong. The 
growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) remained relatively robust, 
benefi
ting from bank lending rates at new historical lows and favourable bank lending 
conditions, despite some tightening of credit standards on NFC loans in the second 
quarter of 2019. In May 2019 the net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs 
moderated 
after four consecutive months of strong issuance activity. Market debt 
financing costs for NFCs continue to be very favourable.
 Against this overall background, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB 
interest rates 
unchanged and expects
 them to 
remain at their present or lower levels at 
least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure 
the continued sustained convergence of inflation to its aim over the medium term.
 The Governing Council confirmed that the E
urosystem will continue reinvesting, in full, 
the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the 
APP for an 
extended period of time past the date when the key ECB interest rates
 are lifted
, and in 
any case for as long as necessary to maint
ain favourable liquidity conditions and an 
ample degree of monetary accommodation.
 The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and 
pro
jected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, 
if the medium
-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of its aim, the Governing 
Council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the infl
ation 
aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure 
that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.
 In this context, the 
Governing Council
 has tasked the relevant Eurosystem 
Committees with examining
 options, including ways to reinforce forward guidance on 
policy rates, mitigating measures such as the design of a tiered system for reserve 
remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset 
purchases.

t Survey indicators suggest that global economic activity continued to weaken in 
the second quarter of 2019.
 The global composite output Purchasing Managers™ 
Index (PMI) excluding the euro area was unchanged in June (see Chart 1), as a 
marginal increase in
 services output was offset by a decline in manufacturing. In 
quarterly terms
, however, the PMI declined in the second quarter to 51.5, from 52.8 in 
the previous quarter 
(on the back of a drop in both 
the 
manufacturing and services 
indices since March)
, 
which is 
consistent with a softening in global 
economic 
activity. 
The manufacturing output PMI has been decreasing steadily over the past year and in 
June fell below the 50 threshold indicating a contraction in activity. After a period of 
relative stability,
 the services index also declined in the second quarter, 
but continues 
to
 indicat
e an expansion. Developments were mixed across countries in the second 
quarter. Among advanced economies, the composite output PMI decreased in the 
United States and the Unite
d Kingdom (in the latter falling below the expansionary 
threshold in June), while it increased slightly in Japan. In emerging market economies, 
the composite output PMI remained broadly unchanged in China, while it decreased in 
India, Russia and Brazil. In
 Brazil, it fell below the expansionary threshold despite a 
moderate pick
-up in June.

 Notes: The latest observations are for June 2019. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to June 2019.
 The drop in the global services output PMI in 
the second quarter
 increas
es the 
risk of a more broad
-based deterioration in the global growth outlook.
 Global 
growth in investment has declined
 in the last few quarters
, mainly
 as a result of
 heightened uncertainty and tighter financing conditions (see Box 1)
. Aggregate private 
consumption growth has remained more resilient so far, supported by robust labour 
markets. However, the decline 
in the s
econd quarter 
in the services output PMI, which 
is closely related to consumption, poses downside risks to 
the latter™s
 near-term 
outlook.
 Some support for global economic growth could come from the recent 
loosening of 
global financial conditions,
 driven p
rimarily
 by market expectations of

growth 
outlook 
remain to the downside as uncertainty 
Œ particularly related to trade tensions 
Œ persists.
 After four months of continued contraction, gl
obal import growth shifted back 
into positive territory in April.
 According to data from CPB, global merchandise 
imports (excluding the euro area) grew marginally in April, following four months of 
continued contraction (see Chart 2). In emerging economies
, imports expanded for the 
first time in six months (by 0.9%, compared with a drop of 1.0% in March), while in 
advanced economies they shrank by 0.5%. A wider range of high
-frequency trade 
indicators (also covering May) suggest 
positive but 
still weak trad
e growth in the near 
term. Nonetheless, the new export orders PMI remained below the expansionary 
threshold in June (see Chart 2).

 Note: The latest observations are for April 2019 for global merchandise imports and June 2019 for the PMI.
 Heightened trade tensions continue.
 Trade 
tensions between the United States and 
China escalated in May, when the United States announced tariff increases on 
Chinese imports and China retaliated by raising its tariffs on US imports. 
At the G20 
summit in Osaka at the end of June
, however
, the two countries reached an 
agreement to restart trade talks. 
Moreover
, President Trump announced a relaxation 
of the restrictions on US companies selling equipment to Huawei Technologies which 
were announced by the US Department of Commerce in mid
-May.
 Other trade 
issues
 remain unresolved, however. The US administration 
has delayed 
tak
ing
 a decision on 
possible increases in car tariffs 
to
 mid
-November 2019, while talks with the EU on a 
new trade agreement, announced in July 2018, are still ongoing.
 Glob
al inflation decreased in May.
 Annual consumer price inflation in the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) countries 
decreased to 2.3% in May, from 2.5% in April, driven largely by a slowdown in energy 
prices. Excluding food and en
ergy prices, it slowed marginally to 2.1% in May. Tight

  6 States,
 have so far translated into only moderate wage increases, suggesting that 
underlying inflation pressures rema
in subdued.
 Oil prices have increased marginally since early June.
 Tensions in the Middle East 
due to the stand
-off between the United States and Iran, as well as the agreement by 
key oil producers to extend their supply cuts by nine months, have supported
 the oil 
price. Nonetheless, downward revisions of the expected demand for oil have eased 
market tightness and weighed on the price. Among non
-oil commodities, metal prices 
have increased amid supply constraints in the iron ore market, while food prices ha
ve 
remained broadly unchanged.
 Economic expansion in the United States remains solid but the pace of growth 
is likely to decelerate.
 US real GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.1% in the 
first quarter of 2019, up from 2.2% in the previous quarter. The 
acceleration in the first 
quarter reflected an upturn in government spending, private inventories and net 
exports, which were partly offset by slower private consumption. While overall GDP 
growth remains supported by strong fundamentals,
 notably a robust l
abour market, 
economic activity is expected to have decelerated in the second quarter of this year as 
the effects of the fiscal stimulus in 2018 faded and the positive inventory effect 
reversed. Inflationary pressures remain muted. Annual headline CPI infl
ation slowed 
slightly to 1.6% in June, from 1.8% in May. The decline was driven mainly by a sharp 
drop in energy prices. Inflation excluding food and energy increased marginally to 
2.1%.
 Economic activity strengthened in Japan in the first quarter of 2019,
 despite 
weaker sentiment.
 Real GDP increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter in the first quarter 
of 2019, after 0.5% in the previous quarter. Growth was mainly supported by net 
exports, as imports fell strongly, while domestic demand remained subdued. High 
frequency indicators point to a strengthening in domestic activity in the second quarter. 
Private consumption growth increased in April and May
; this
 partly reflect
ed the impact 
of the extended Golden Week holidays in early May, while the increase in durable
 goods purchases could reflect frontloading ahead of the VAT hike scheduled for 
October. Stronger consumption in turn supported imports, which rebounded in the 
second quarter from the exceptionally low levels recorded in the first. Consumer price 
inflation
 declined slightly in May to 0.7% from 0.9% in April, reflecting primarily the 
anticipated decline in accommodation service prices owing to a steep fall in demand 
following this year™s extension of the Golden Week holidays. Inflation excluding food 
and ene
rgy also moderated in year
-on-year terms, to 0.3% from 0.5% in April.
 In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth accelerated to 0.5% in the first quarter 
of 2019 from 0.2% at the end of last year, mainly on the back of Brexit
-related 
stock
-building.
 Domestic demand contributed positively, while net trade reduced 
GDP growth as imports surged. Business investment increased following four quarters 
of contraction. A strong quarter
-on-quarter growth contribution from inventories, as 
well as the exceptiona
lly high import growth, reflected increased stockpiling against a 
background of growing fears of a ﬁno
-dealﬂ Brexit at the end of March. Overall, 
economic activity is expected to remain muted in the coming quarters, given high 
Brexit
-related uncertainty an
d wider concerns related to global economic 
developments. Annual CPI inflation was 2.0% in June 2019, unchanged from May.

t  7 Economic growth in China slowed in the second quarter.
 Annual real GDP growth 
declined to 6.2% year

rter. Final consumption was 
the main contributor to growth. The decline in its contribution was offset by a rising 
contribution from capital formation, while the contribution from net exports declined. 
June data on industrial production, retail sales and f
ixed

growth has been picking up, after weaker outcomes in the previous two months. The

employment, July 2019 for the PMI and May 2019 for the unemployment rate.
 Rising employment continues to support household income and consumer 
spending.
 Private consumption rose by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 
2019, 
following somewhat weaker growth
 in the previous quarter. Household real 
disposable income has been largely insulated from the recent growth slowdown. 
Annual growth of real gross disposable income rose from 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 
2018 to 2.7% in the first quarter of 2019. 
Overall, 
employment growth has remained 
resilient 
during
 the recent growth slowdown, supporting labour income. In addition, 
lower direct taxes and social 
security 
contributions have contributed positively to 
households™ purchasing power, reflecting fiscal measures 
in a number of euro area 
countries (notably in France and Italy).
 The saving ratio increased further in the first 
quarter of 2019, as income growth outpaced consumption growth.

The latest survey results

, on average,
 in the second qu
arter of 2019. 
Moreover, 
the 
monthly 
industrial production index
 for
 capital goods production 
in April 
and May 
stood,
 on average
, at a level 
below the average
 seen
 in the first quarter of 
2019. Other indicators, such as new orders and new export orders
, are also consistent 
with 
muted 
investment growth in the near term in a context of global uncertainty and 
weaker foreign demand. In particular, a further 
increase
 in uncertainty regarding the 
outlook
 for global trade
 may pose a 
downside 
risk to investment 
growth by 
dampening
 order
s and production expectations and thus delaying investment decisions. With 
regard to construction investment, 
the index for
 construction production contract
ed in 
both April and May 
while the Purchasing Manager™s Index (
PMI
) and the
 European 
Commission™s 
confidence

 for the construction sector up to June still pointed to 
continued 
Œ but moderating 
Œ growth 
for construction investment 
in the second quarter 
of 2019.
 After an upward surprise in the first quarter of 2019, euro area 
trade does not 
appear
 to 
be 
gain
ing
 momentum.
 The positive
 (0.2%)
 net trade contribution to euro 
area GDP growth in
 the first quarter of
 2019 was primarily driven by extraordinarily 
strong exports to the United Kingdom
, which were 
most likely associated 
with
 an exceptional increase in inventories by companies 
in that country 
in the run
-up to the
 original
 Brexit 
date
. Available nominal data on euro area trade
 in goods
 until May are 
relatively volatile and point to a worsening of imports and exports 
in the se
cond quarter 
of 
2019 (-0.5
% and -0.4%
, respectively, in
 quarter
-on-quarter terms
). Th
is decline 
has mostly 
been driven by extra
-euro area trade developments. In particular, euro area 
exports to the United Kingdom posted a strong correction in April 
while
 exports to the 
United States, China and Turkey 
remained
 subdued. Looking ahead, leading 
indicators for euro area exports 
show
 no clear sign of a bottoming out. 
The flash 
PMI
 for new manufacturing expo
rt orders 
declined
 to 44.3 in July and remained in 
contractionary territory. The E
uropean 
Commission
™s assessment of order books fell 
to 
-14.1 in June, 
its 
lowest level since November 2013
. 
Shipping indicators, 
however
, 
provide a more optimistic picture for the coming months.
 Incoming data and survey 
resul
ts suggest
 somewhat weaker growth in the 
second and third quarters
 of 2019
. This softening of growth 
can be
 primarily 
attributed to weak global trade and the prolonged presence of uncertainties. For 
instance, although industrial production rose by 0.9%
 in 
May
, m
onth 
on month
, in April 
and May
 it remained on average at a level
 slightly
 below 
the
 average 
for
 the first 
quarter
 of 2019
. As regards more timely survey data, in the 
second
 quarter of 2019
 the 
European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator stood
, on average
, below its 
average 
level in the first quarter.
 Mean
while
, the composite output PMI rose slightly 
between the first and second quarter
s, 
before 
declining in July.
 Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by 
favourabl
e financing conditions.
 In addition, growth should also be underpinned by 
further employment gains
, rising wages, lower energy prices, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit 
somewhat slower 
Œ expansion in global activity. The results of the latest round of the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters
, conducted in early July, show that the 
private sector 
GDP growth forecasts for 2019, 2020 and 2021 have remained broadly 
unchanged compar
ed with the previous round conducted in early April

However, t
his was
 attributable 
mainly to calendar effects, 
particularly evident

excluding energy and food is subject to 
short

 which
 blurs the 
signal
s conveyed by this index regarding movements in

in June, as in the previous month
. Signals from o

 Monetary dynamics remain

) and weaker euro ar
ea economic growth.
 The annual growth 
rate 
of M3 
stood at
 4.5% in June
 2019, down from 4.8% in May
, on account of a negative base effect, thus 
returning to the levels seen in March 2019
 (see Chart
 9). M3 growth continued to be 
supported by lower opportunit
y costs of holding M3
. 
The positive contribution of
 net 
purchases
 under the APP to
 annual 
M3 growth
 has continued to fade out and is now 
marginal
. 
The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has also continued 
to 
grow at a robust

, 
unchanged from May
, 
is one percentage point 
higher than

Among
 the M1 
components, the annual growth of currency in circulation remained 
solid
, though not 
exceptionally high by historical standards
, 
pointing to
 no pervasive substitution into

. Looking ahead, the current level of real M1 growth continues to indicate that an

 The latest observation is for

2019. While c

, 
external monetary flows 
also contributed st

. The

. 
An 
important
 item that compensated 
for 
the declining mechanical 
contribution of the 
APP 
in recent months 
(see the red bars in Chart

 Euro area 
non-financial corporation (
NFC
) loan growth remained 
relatively 
robust, benefiting from bank lending rates at new historical lows
. The annual 
growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, 
securitisation 
and notional cash pooling) 
increased to 3.5% in June
 2019, 
from
 3.3% in May 
(see

 10). 
After having moderated until January 2019 (to 3.4%), annual 
NFC loan 
growth 
remained unchanged 
at 3.
8% in 
June 2019. This development
 has been in lin
e with 
the
 lagging cyclical pattern 
of NFC loans 
with respect to real economic activity 
and the slowdown in aggregate demand observed over 
the course of 
2018. 
NFC loan 
growth, however,
 remained 
not far from 
its September 2018 peak of 4.3%. Loans to 
househo

June 2019,
 unchanged from 
May.
 Overall, l
oan growth 
continue
d to benefit from historically low bank lending rates
 and the
 overall 
favourable 
supply of bank loans. In addition, banks have made progress in 
consolidating their balance sheets, although the 
volume

) for loans to enterprises tightened i
n the 
second
 quarter of 2019, 
mark
ing
 the end of the net easing period that 
had begun in 
2014. 
The net tightening of banks™ loan approval criteria was driven mainly by a 
tightening contribution of 
risk perceptions related to a deterioration in the general 
economic and firm
-specific situation
, whereas competition 
exerted pressure in the 
opposite
 direction
. At the same time
, credit standards for households

. 
Loan demand
, as reported in the survey,
 increase
d across all loan 
categories
 in the 
second
 quarter of 2019. 
Although financing needs for fixed 
investment and the low 
level of interest rates were supportive for NFC loan demand in 
the second quarter of 2019, financing needs for inventories and working capital were 
not, reflecting this factor™s sensitivity to the business cycle. Demand for housing loans 
continued to incre
ase in the second quarter of 2019, supported by the low interest rate 
level and housing market prospects, which were still improving. 
Euro area banks 
also 
indicated that they had improved access to retail and wholesale funding in the second 
quarter of 2019
, in particular for debt securities. Banks stated that the impact of 
regulatory or supervisory actions and non
-performing loans also had a tightening 
effect on credit standards. The tightening 
impact 
of non
-performing loans 
was less 
pronounced than in the 
previous semester
, but banks expect some reversal over the 
next six months.
 Very favourable 
bank 
lending rates continued to support euro area economic 
growth.
 In 
May 
201
9 the composite bank lending rate
s for 
both 
loans to NFCs 
and housing loans reached new
 historical lows
 of 1.57% and 1.73% respectively
 (see 
Chart
 11). 
These
 rates have 
fallen
 significantly and by more than market reference 
rates since the ECB™s credit easing measures were announced in June
 2014. 
They 
have also declined by more than 40 basis
 points 
since February 2016
, i.e. just before 
the last 
cut of the deposit facility rate (by 10 basis points to 
-0.4%).
 The reduction in 
bank lending rates 
for
 loans to NFCs
 and for 
loans to small firms (assuming that very 
small loans of up to •0.25
 million
 are 
primarily 
granted to small firms) was particularly 
significant in those euro area countries that were most exposed to the financial crisis. 
Overall, t
his indicates a more uniform transmission of monetary policy to bank lending 
rates across euro area c
ountries and firm sizes.

 Notes: Composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long
-term rates using a 24
-month moving average of new 
business volumes. The latest observation is for 
May 
2019. In May 2019 the n
et issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs 
moderated 
after four consecutive months of strong issuance activity.
 The latest ECB data 
indicate that, on a net basis, the total flow of debt securities issued by NFCs 
moderated 
in 
May 2019,
 but remained positive, as has been the case since the 
beginning of 2019. The increase in the cumulated net flow of issuance in the f
irst five 
months of 2019 was in line with the
 seasonal pattern observed
 over the last few years
. Furthermore, the five
-month cumulated increase in 2019 was the highest since 2012.
 From a more medium
-term
 perspective (
see C
hart
 12), the annual flows of debt
 securities 
remain low owing to subdued issuance activity in 2018. In May 2019 the 
annual net issuance of debt securities was slightly below •50 billion, which is close to 
the level at which the annual flows of debt securities seem to have settled since 
November 2018. 
Available market data suggest
 that net flows of debt securities issued 
continued to be relatively strong in June 2019 but remained virtually flat in July. I
n May 
2019 t
otal net issuance of 
quoted
 shares by NFCs 
turned slightly negative, thus 
continuing its downward trend that had started at the end of 2018 and was only broken
 temporarily in April 2019. As a consequence of this persistent weakness, in May 2019 
the
 annual flows
 of net issuance of quoted shares were the lowest on record since 
Octo
ber 2017.

 Notes: Monthly figures based on a 12
-month rolling period. The latest observation is for 
May 2019
. Financing costs for euro
 area NFCs 
increased marginally in May 2019 after 
having declined continuously since the end of 2018
. The overall nominal cost of 
external financing for NFCs, comprising bank lending, debt issuance in the marke

equity finance, 
stood at 
4.5% in May
 2019 and is 
projected
 to 
have also remained 
stable at that level in June and July. T

is estimated to 
be only 9 
basis points above the historical low of 
April 2019
 and much 
below the levels 
observed in

The estimated increase 
in the cost of financing

 that was only 
partially balanced by further declines in the c
ost of market

 1 What is behind the decoupling of global activity and trade?
 Prepared by Alina Bobasu, Simona Manu and Lucia Quaglietti
 This box looks at the softness in global trade observ
ed since the second half of 
2018, focusing in particular on the causes of its decoupling from economic 
activity.
 Having already slowed in the third quarter of 2018, world trade contracted at 
the turn of the year (see Chart A). The deceleration was broad
-based across regions. 
Trade deteriorated particularly sharply in China and in emerging Asia, which had 
recorded strong increases in 2017, but it also weakened in Latin America, Japan and 
the United States in the first quarter of 2019 (see Chart B). In contra
st, import growth 
surged in the United Kingdom, probably owing to stock building by UK firms in the face 
of Brexit
-related uncertainty. While global GDP growth has also slowed, the decline 
was less pronounced than for world trade. Due to significant moveme
nts in the most 
import
-intensive categories of expenditure, such as investment and inventories, over 
the business cycle, trade can be subject to larger swings than activity (see Chart A). 
For example, world trade remained subdued in the period from the sec
ond quarter of 
2014 to the third quarter of 2015, while in 2017 it significantly outstripped global 
activity growth. The decline in trade observed in recent quarters may reflect several 
factors. These include cyclical and compositional factors, but also in
fluences 
stemming from rising trade tensions between the United States and China.
5 This box 
aims to shed light on the reasons behind the recent weakness in global trade and its 
decoupling from activity.

 The decoupling of global trade and activity apparent since the second half of 
2018 largely
 reflects a weakening of global investment,
 although consumption 
also softened at the turn of the year.
 Estimates from standard import
-demand 
models suggest that both the previous rise in global trade in 2017 and the most recent 
slowdown since mid
-2018 can
 be accounted for by large fluctuations in global 
investment (see Chart C). The recent decline has also occurred on the back of a fall in 
consumption in some emerging market economies (EMEs).

non-linear deterministic trends are also included in the long

domestic demand is restricted to one. ﬁOtherﬂ includes contributions from relative prices, the trend and unexplained factors.
 The slowdown in investment is likely to have been accentuated by a number of 
headwinds weighing on the glo
bal economy.
 In order to shed further light on the 
drivers of the recent slowdown in investment globally, two Bayesian panel vector 
autoregressive models are estimated, one for advanced economies (AEs) and one for 
EMEs. The methodology accounts for cross
-country heterogeneity,
6 while the 
identification, based on sign restrictions, allows four main drivers of investment over 
time to be identified: uncertainty, financing conditions, demand shocks and supply 
shocks. The results of the models suggest that heigh
tened uncertainty and tighter 
financing conditions explain to a large extent the slump in investment in both AEs and 
EMEs in the second half of 2018 (see Chart D). Weaker EME demand prospects 
amplified the slowdown.
 From an output perspective, the decelera
tion in global investment has been 
mirrored by a sharp decline in manufacturing production.
 Much of the weakness 
in the global economy in recent quarters has been concentrated in the industrial 
sector, and within that in manufacturing output. In contrast, 
growth in the services 
sector has proved to be more resilient overall, although Purchasing Managers™ Index 
(PMI) indicators softened in the second quarter of this year. In the second half of 2018, 
industrial production contracted in Japan, in the euro area
 and in some Latin American 
countries. More recently, industrial production has also been slowing in the United 
States and China. Overall, countries with a larger industrial sector, greater exposure to 
industrial commodities and/or a heavy reliance on expo
rts in GDP experienced 
sharper growth slowdowns. The investment and manufacturing cycles tend to be 
                                                                    6  For a detailed explanation of the benchmark methodology and data

 25 closely intertwined. Production in the manufacturing sector is highly capital
-intensive, 
with capital goods forming a large part of manufacturing output. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that the slowdown in investment has been mirrored by a sharp decline in 
manufacturing output globally. 
 The global manufacturing slowdown was particularly pronounced in the 
electronics and automotive sectors and was also associated with a strong 
decline in trade flows in both sectors. 
As far as the automotive sector is concerned, 
the weakness at the global level partly reflected temporary factors, such as the 
bottlenecks in car production following the introduction of the new W
orldwide 
Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). However, medium
-term structural 
trends, such as increasing environmental concerns and policies, may also have 

played a role. In addition, in China, the tax rebates on car purchases, which helped 
boost car sales in 2015
-17, came to a halt in 2018. The weakness in the electronics 
cycle might relate to a slowing technological cycle in Asia, following a period of 
expansion in 2017 related to substantial investment in data centre capacity globally.

 Global investment is shown in 
deviation from trend/steady state and is based on an aggregation of country
-specific results based on GDP weights.
 Manufacturing and trade cycles tend to be highly correlated. This implies that 
swings in manufacturing output can have a significantly larger impact on global 
trade than on activity.
 The manufacturing sector remains highly trade
-intensive, as 
imports of manufacturing goods account for more than 50% of total gross global 
imports, but only make up 20% of total world value added. Hence, a sharp slowdown 
in manufacturing output leads to a more pronounced decline in global trade than in 

global GDP. ECB staff analysis indicates that industrial and trade cycles tend to be 
highly correlated, with world industrial output generally displaying higher trade 
elasticity than global GDP (see Chart E).

 High frequency indicators of world trade point to 
some recovery in the near term. However, this is expected to be mild, with trade 

growth picking up only gradually owing to a subdued outlook for investment in many 

economies. In addition, downside risks to the outlook for trade have partially 
materialised in recent months due to the implementation of higher tariffs, and the 
threat of a further escalation of trade tensions persists.

ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 5 / 2019 Œ Boxes Services trade liberalisation and global imbalances: a critical review of the empirical evidence 27 2 Services trade liberalisation and global imbalances:
 a critical review of the empirical evidence
 Prepared by Georgios Georgiadis and Andrej Mijakovic
 It is widely acknowledged that trade liberalisation raises aggregate welfare in 
the long
 run.
7 Trade liberalisation within the framework of multilateral cooperation 
has been a key factor driving global economic prosperity. Trade integration helped to 
drive economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the second part of 
the 20th century, 
thereby
 also helping to lift hundreds of millions of people out of 
poverty.
 However, trade liberalisation has
 been asymmetric
 in that it has
 focused on 
goods rather than services.
 In this context, liberalisation of services trade may also 
be expected to raise welfare in the long run. Beyond its effects on welfare, it has 

recently been argued by some in international fora such as the G20 that services 
liberalisation may also reduce global imbalances 
Œ 
i.e. the dispersion of current 
account surpluses and deficits across economies. This box critically reviews the 
rationale and empirical evidence underpinn
ing
 this cla
im.
 Global imbalances have been stable overall in recent years, 
although 
their 
composition 
has 
change
d somewhat
 (see Chart
 A).
 After a period of rising 
imbalances in the early 2000s, the global financial crisis triggered 
first 
a compression
, 
then
 a rotation in global imbalances from emerging market
 economie
s (EMEs) 
towards advanced economies. Since then, the magnitude of global imbalances ha
s 
remained broadly stable. Looking ahead, in its latest World Economic Outlook the IMF 
projects a gradual reduction in
 global imbalances, primarily driven by 
the fading 
surpluses of oil exporters, the euro area and Japan.

. As large and persistent current account deficits have preceded 
several 
financial crises that spilled over to other economies, global imbalances 
warrant 
monitoring
. Large and persistent current account deficits may raise economies™ 
dependence on global financial markets and accentuate the
ir vulnerability to swings in 
investor sentiment. Indeed, large and persistent current account deficits have 
historically 
often preceded
 financial crises. Moreover, many of these crises spilled 
over to other debtor economies, and 
even
 affected creditor economies. 
Therefore 
reducing global imbalances is perceived to be an important way to
 foster global 
economic and financial stability.
 It has recently been argued that asymmetric trade liberalisation since the 1990s 
Œi.e. the reduction of tariffs for goods but not for services
 Œ 
has contribut
ed to
global imbalances.
 Specifically, the argument rests on two pillars. First, it is argued
that 
since
 the inception of the 
World Trade Organization 
(WTO
) 
in 1995 the cost of
trading goods has decreased substantially due to sizeable cuts in tariff rates. In

contrast, the cost of trading services has remained broadly unchanged over the same
time period. Second, it is argued that as a result of such asymmetric trade
liberalisation, economies with a comparative advantage in goods manufacturin
g(services) experience a rise (fall) in their current account balances (see Chart B)
.Economic theory suggests that trade policy does not affect current account 
balances
 in the long run.
 The current account balance reflects a country™s net 
foreign lending
, i.e. domestic savings minus domestic investment. 
So for any policy to 
affect the current account, it must affect intertemporal saving and spending 
decisions. 

A 
change in trade policy which raises a country™s 
permanent 
income will cause a 
commensurate increase in its spending in every period and thus have no effect on net 
saving
 in any given period. In terms of the trade balance, the positive shock to demand 
for domestic 
goods 
relative to foreign 
ones 
would shift their relative price, leaving net 
expor
ts unchanged in relative terms.

, such as 
consumption habits or investment adjustment costs
, can 
delay the 
revers
ion to 
the long
-run equilibrium
. Against this background, it is 
possible 
in principle that 
the 
liberalisation of services trade could affect global imbalances temporarily
, by raising 
the 
current account balances of economies with a comparative advantage in services 
rather than manufactured goods and reducing those of economies with a comparative
 advantage in manufacturing.

Testing
 the hypothesis that lib
eralising services trade would reduce global 
imbalances requires the use of an empirical model for the determination of the 
current account balance that controls for fundamentals and policies.
 Given that 
in 
such a model 
the
 variable to be explained would b
e the current account balance 

relative to GDP, the analysis would implicitly also account for the effects of trade policy 
on output.
 The IMF™s External Balance Assessment (EBA) regression model is a widely 
established methodological framework for assessing
 the effects of 
fundamentals and policies on the current account.

IMF™s

current account balance relative to GDP, on the one hand, and economic 
fundamentals as well as policies

things
 for the assessment of countries™ external positions in IMF Article IV Reports and

model is specified in 
a reduced form, the individual transmission channels that give 
rise to the general equilibrium
 cannot be traced back. At the same time, by virtue of its

 form the EBA model can be used 
to 
analyse the effects of
 a wide range of 
fundamentals and policies that affect the current account.
 The results found u
sing this model suggest that liberalising services trade 
would reduce current account deficits in some debtor economies.
 As in Joy et al. 
(2018)
10 the IMF™s EBA regression model is augmented with an index for services 
trade restrictiveness constructed by the OECD.
11 Then, a counterfactual analysis of a 
reduction in barriers to services trade is considered
, in which all countries are 
assumed to reduce their services trade restrictiveness to the level
 of the least 
restrictive country.
12 Changing the values of the right
-hand side variables in the fitted 
EBA regression model then implies corresponding changes in the predicted current 

account balance relative to GDP
. Given that the EBA model also controls for the 
business cycle, the counterfactual results are best interpreted as medium
-term effects. 
The results
 Œ 
largely in line with those in Joy et al. (2018) 
Œ 
suggest 
that the current 
account deficits of debtor economies such as the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and the
 United 
States
 would be reduced by 1.2 and 0.8 percentage points relative to GDP, 
respectively (see Chart C). Moreover, 
China™s
 current account surplus would turn into 
a moderate deficit, moving closer to balance in absolute terms.

 C).
13 In particular, the liberalisation of services trade in this counterfactual exercise would 
raise the current account balances of some countries which already exhibit surpluses, 
such as Germany and Japan, and exacerbate pre
-existing deficits in many EMEs. The 
reason for this finding is tha
t 
in general advanced economies have already liberalised 
services trade substantially, while EMEs tend to 
have
 more restrictions
 in place
. 
Accordingly
, advanced economies would gain access to relatively more new export 
markets than EMEs, thereby improving their services trade balances
 while worsening 
those of EMEs.
 Overall, the counterfactual analysis suggests that while the concentration of 

countries™ current account imbalances would be reduced, the magnitude of 

global imbalances would remain 
largely 
unchanged 
overall 
(see Chart D).
 The 
Hirschman
-Herfindahl index of concentration of countries™ current account imbalances 
Œespecially deficits 
Œ measured as a share of world GDP is reduced by 25%, while the
magnitudes of cumulative surpluses and deficits are essentially unchanged.
14 For
example, as mentioned above, the current account deficit of the U
nited 
States, which
accounts for a large share of global, cumulated current account deficits
, would be
reduced and

given that the overall magnitude of current acc
ount deficits is

32 assessment of the effects of services trade liberalisation would also have to 
include an analysis of stock imbalances.
 For example, an economy™s current 
account moving
 from 
a balance
d position
 to a 
surplus following services trade 

liberalisation may be stabilising
, although it raises 
the 
current account imbalance 
when the economy exhibits large initial external debt stocks. This could be an 
important element in assessing the effects of services trade liberalisation
, as despite 
the compression in flow imbalances stock imbalances have continued to widen since 

the global financial crisis
. Another caveat is that with the rise of multinational firms it 
has become increasingly difficult to measure and interpret current account 
imbalances.
15 Overall, 
the evidence available so far suggests that while services trade 
liberalisation may further foster global economic prosperity and alleviate 
imbalances in a few prominent economies, it should not be expected to 
significantly
 reduce
 flow imbalances from a global perspective, even 
temporarily.
 While services trade liberalisation could reduce current a
ccount 
imbalances temporarily for some countries, the evidence
 available
 also suggests that 
this would not 
result in
 a sizeable reduction in global imbalances.

 for around 9% of euro area GDP
 (
see Chart A).
17 In 2018 FDI liability 
flows 
became positive, suggesting disinvestments of either foreign parents outside the 
euro area or affiliates resident in the euro area, then
 FDI asset flows turned negative, 
implying disinvestments of either parents 
resident 
in the euro area or foreign affiliates 
outside the euro area. It is important to track gross flow dynamics as they can signal 
changes in international market conditions.
18 Like 
other mature and developed 
economies, the euro area tends to be 
a net foreign lender and, despite the reversal in 
gross flow
s, it
 post
ed net FDI outflows (gross asset 
flows 
minus gross liabilit
y flows
) within the historical range
 in 2018
. Cumulated gross FDI flows
 continued the 
reversal
 in early 2019 but they may be beginning to normalise. Liabilities gross flows 
recently 
recorded a recovery, which resulted in net capital inflows in the euro area, although 
this is likely to be temporary
.

This 
box discusses evidence obtained from 
a 
four
-quarter sum of foreign direct investment flows. It is 
common practice to assess sums 
or average developments
 as these
 smooth out some of the volatility of 
the high
-frequency foreign direct investment data. Developments in quarterly data were also checked 
and 
the 
major fin
dings still qualitatively hold.
 17  
On an asset/liability basis, direc
t investment 
is classified
 according to whether the investment relates to 
an asset or a liability for the country compiling the statistics. For example, a country™s liabilities include 
foreign parents™ equity investments in affiliates resident in that country because those investments 

represent claims that foreigners have on assets in the reporting country
. 
On the same basis, in the 
compilation of FDI statistics, parent companies resident in a euro area country and investing
 in debt 
issued by their affiliat
es 
resident 
outside of the
 euro area 
are assets for the euro area. S

a drying

tend
 to generate financial flows 
that 
pass
 through the economies
 hosting a large number of SPEs. In the euro area SPEs are 
prevalently located in
 Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium. As 
SPEs

the countries in which they are located become transit economies for

 asset flows 
were 
also considerably

 Euro area foreign direct investment since 2018: the role of special purpose entities
  38 centres 
show a similar 
disinvestment 
pattern
 on both sides,
 with two main differences 
with respect to the United States. Disinvestments only 
started 
in the second part of 
2018 and were larger on the asset side, which, for the euro 
area, resulted in net FDI 
inflows from offshore centres and net FDI outflows to the United States. A common 
rationale for these capital movements is that 
certain measures included in the US 
corporate tax reform
24 may have played an important role in driving
 gross flows to and 
from the euro area.
25 Liability and asset flows of offshore centres to/from the euro 
area have also been affected as they tend to reflect
 the activity of 
the 
intermediary 
entities 
resi
dent in these countries, whose transactions offset pa
rt of the outflows from 
the United States.
 The 
repatriation of foreign earnings by US multinationals mainly affected FDI 
flows to Europe, whereas developing economies (excluding offshore centres) 
have been largely unaffected (see Chart D)
.26 There are sever
al factors 
contributing to the asymmetric behaviour of US multinationals. First, Europe remains 
the main recipient of US funds. At the same time, mergers and acquisitions represent 
the largest share (about 70%) of to
tal euro area 
gross 
FDI 
inflows and outf
lows but 
only a minor share of the gross FDI inflows and outflows of emerging economies 
(around 20
-30% respectively). Greenfield investments are, however, prevalent in 
developing economies. The decomposition of investment by type of financial 
instrument sh
ows that 
SPEs have primarily 
contributed to the flow reversal through a 
divestment in equity FDI in the euro area, 
while reinvested earnings were 
unaffected. 
Debt 
FDI
 was affected, albeit to a lesser extent as 
volumes of debt FDI gross flows in 
the countri
es 
concerned 
(Luxembou
rg, 
the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland) are 
normally smaller than those of equity FDI gross flows
. Therefore, the different 
composition of the FDI flows is likely to have limited the opportunities for US 
multinationals to carry out 
such operations 
to the same extent 
in emerging economies.
                                                                     24  The US corporate tax reform, 
signed by President 
Donald 
Trump on 22 December 2017
, create
s incentives for the repatriation of deferred profits held by US multinationals abroad through the switch from 
a 
worldwide corporate tax system
 to a territorial tax system. 
Under t
he reform
, repatriated profits of US 
multinationals from their foreign affili
ated companies are in principle no longer taxable in the U
nited 
States
 and are subject to a one
-off mandatory repatriation tax. Moreover, the reform has improved the tax 
attractiveness of the U
nited 
States
 relative to Europe (through a reduction in the sta
tutory corporate tax 
rate and more favourable deduction rules for new investment) and introduced several new anti
-base 
erosion measures. See

 Euro area foreign direct investment since 2018: the role of special purpose entities
  40 this measure 
can
 signal
 that US parent companies 
disinvested or
 repatriated profits 
through their affiliate
-fellow enterprises
 resident in the 
euro area. However, it can also 
indicate that euro area
 parent
 companies 
recalled 
home
 profits held at their 
affiliate
-fellow enterprises
 resident 
in the United States
 or disin
vested in the country
.29 Bearing these definitions in mind,
 approximately one
-third of 
the 
contraction in gross 
FDI 
liabilities
 in the euro area in 2018 was due to reverse investments.
30 In conclusion, the episode of reversal of gross FDI flows in the euro 
area
 seems 
to have been primarily related to the activity of SPEs
. When 
disentangl
ing flows 
pertaining to SPEs 
from the flows of
 other
 resident companies
,31 it appears
 that 
SPEs are solely responsible for the 
aggregate contraction in euro area 
FDI flows on 
the
 liabilit
y side (Chart C)
. It seems that m
ergers and acquisitions 
and greenfield 
investment
s remained resilient in 2018, which
 suggests that these flows are unlikely to 
have had negative implications for 
real activity
 thus far. However, while 
the situat
ion 
may normalise
 going forward, 
it is still 
too 
early to 
assess
 the 
possible effects of transit 
FDI
 on real activity in the euro area
 over the longer term.
                                                                       29  Transactions between fellow enterprises 
are now 
included in 
FDI
 statistics 
follow
ing
 the adoption 
by the 
IMF 
of the sixth edition of the balance of payments and international investment position manual (BPM6)
, as 
they likely result from the influence of the common direct investor.
 30  In Luxembourg, which accounts for the greatest part 
of the retrenchment, reverse investments 
are 
responsible for around
 34% of the gross liabilities reversal at the end of 2018. In Belgium reverse 
investments are the sole 
cause of the
 reduction in 
liabilities. Conversely
, disinvestments from the 
Netherlands
 and Ireland were driven 
purely 
by a drop in inward investment, with no significant evidence 
of intra
-group or intra
-fellow equity and lending transactions.
 31  The breakdown
 of 
FDI
 assets and liabilities 
for SPEs is not available for Ireland. It can be ass
umed, 
however, that the 
strong positive correlation
 (0.94) 
between SPE
 liabilit
y flows 
and
 inward 
FDI flows
 also 
holds in this country. This 
statistical regularity
, which is obtained from a panel regression on Luxembourg,
 the Netherlands
 and Belgium,
 prove
s rather stable over time

 Sources of economic policy uncertainty in the euro area: a machine learning approach
  41 4 Sources of economic policy uncertainty in the euro area:
 a 
machine learning approach
 Prepared by 
Andrés Azqueta
-Gavaldón, Dominik Hirschbühl, Luca 
Onorante and Lorena Saiz
 Global
 policy
 uncertainty 
has recently 
increased and remains relatively high.
 Uncertainty about global trade disputes, the economic challenges stemming from 
climate change and geopo
litical factors are contributing to increased levels of 
policy
-related uncertainty in Europe. Understanding
 the
 sources and dynamics
 of 
uncertainty which hits the economy 
is valuable for policymakers, including central 
banks.
 Firms are particularly sensiti
ve to uncertainty when making their investment 
decisions.
32 In response to uncertainty shocks, they may reduce their investment, 
hiring or orders for foreign intermediates, leading to 
a deceleration in trade and 
aggregate 
investment
. Consumers, in turn, may
 react to increased uncertainty by 
postponing consumption and increasing precautionary savings, 
as reflected in the rise 
in the household saving rate
 in 2018. This can lead to a contraction in international 
trade and domestic economic activity.
33 In this bo
x, an indicator of economic 
policy uncertainty 
(EPU) is presented 
which applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to newspaper 
articles
. While there has been a recent rise in uncertainty measures, conventional 
techniques fail to fully capture countr
y-specific characteristics. The economic policy 
uncertainty index developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016)
34 (the BBD approach) 
is produced by counting the number of press articles describing policy uncertainty 
issues using a list of 
keywords
. However, in
dividual components of policy uncertainty 
are not identified with this method, since the list of 
keywords
 retrieves all articles 
without regard to the specific source of uncertainty (i.e. fiscal, monetary or trade policy 
uncertainty). 
To 
dig into 
the 
diffe
rent sources 
of uncertainty, the approach described i
n Azqueta
-Gavaldón (2017a, 2017b)
35 is used
. This approach applies a
 machine 
learning algorithm
 (latent Dirichlet 
allocation
, LDA)
36 to all news articles containing 
words 
related 
to ﬁeconomyﬂ and ﬁuncertai
ntyﬂ.
37 LDA is unsupervised in the sense that 
the algorithm infers the themes in the set of documents without any labelling of the 
                                                                    32  See Gulen,

  42 articles or training of the model before the articles are classified. 
LDA analyses a 
set
 of 
documents and
 allocates words to topics on the basis 
of 
how often they occur together 
in the same document. 
In other words, a topic 
is a set of related words that 
frequently 
occur together
. Each document
, in turn,
 can be represented as a ﬁmixture of topicsﬂ, 
where the t
opics are those defined by the allocation of words
.38 LDA is more robust 
than other techniques 
because it 
is not dependent 
on the ex
 ante choice of specific 
keywords. 
In addition
, words that frequently occur together in a document are 
assigned to the same t
opic, 
which is what 
makes the results of LDA more intuitive 
than 
those of similar
 techniques. The only choice the modeller 
needs to make 
is the number 
of topics in
to
 which to 
divide the corpus of documents.
 Topics framed by the LDA characterise sub
-compone
nts of policy uncertainty 
in an intuitive and language
-independent manner.
 The LDA algorithm 
is run on 
a total of 171,107 news articles
 collected from the most 
popular 
news
papers
 in 
Germany, France, Italy and Spain during the period 
from 
January 2000 to Ma
y 2019. 
Table 
A shows the most representative words per category retrieved by the algorithm 
for each country. As can be seen, the lists of words that form each topic seem coherent 
in the sense that it is not difficult to infer 
the 
topic 
from the words,
 eve
n across different 
languages. One caveat of the analysis is that the LDA algorithm used is static
, i.e.
 the 
selected words are the same over the whole sample period
.39 The EPU index series built using unsupervised machine learning closely 
resembles the BBD 
EPU index series in the euro area, although the level
s of 
some peaks differ.
 In order to validate
 this method, Chart A compares the aggregate 
euro area uncertainty index (built by aggregating each individual
 EPU category across 
each country)
40 with the BBD EPU index. The indices are highly correlated (at 0.85), 
and both spike during the Iraq War (March 2003), the European sovereign debt crisis 
(2010
-2014) and the announcement of the results of the referendum on Britain™s 
membership of the EU (B
rexit) (June 2016). While the similarities are strong, the most 
significant spike in the BBD index occurs during the month of the Brexit referendum 
(June 2016), while in the LDA
-based index it takes place during the sovereign debt 
crisis (August 2011).
                                                                     38  The prior distribution
s for the
 weights of each topic within a document and 
for 
the probability of each word 
being assigned to a topic 
are drawn from
 a Dirichlet probability distribution.
 39  Given that the set of words that characterise a topic might change over time, a dynamic LDA algo
rithm 
would be more suitable for categorising new data (i.e. future news articles).
 40  Building the EPU 
indices for each country required several steps.
 First, each article was labelled 
according to its most representative topic (the topic with the highest
 percentage in the article). Second, a 
raw count of the number of articles 
on each 
topic in each month was produced. Since the number of 
artic
les is not constant over time, 
each
 raw time series was divided
 by the total number of articles.

 A Euro area LDA

 (index: mean = 100)
  Sources: 
Economic Policy Uncertainty website (
www.policyuncertainty.com
) and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes:
 The euro area LDA
-based EPU index is composed of the four country EPU indices (
equally weighted
). Each individual index is 
derived from 
the 
number of 
news
 articles whose most representative topi
c is one of the 
eight 
categories 
listed in 
Table 
A divided by the 
total number of news
 articles containing the word ﬁtodayﬂ
 (ﬁheute
ﬂ, ﬁaujourd™huiﬂ, ﬁoggiﬂ, ﬁhoyﬂ). The BBD EPU index corresponds to the 
average EPU index for Germany, France, Italy and Spain
 taken from the Economic Policy Uncertainty website. Each final time series is 
standardised with a mean of 100 and one standard deviation.
 The sub
-components of the index suggest that since 2016, t
rade, domestic 
regulation and fiscal policy 
have been 
the m
ain sources of policy uncertainty
 (see Chart B).
 The contributions of individual uncertainty components to overall 
economic policy uncertainty have been quite dynamic since 2016
. In the year of the 
Brexit referendum (2016), the main drivers of policy uncer
tainty in the euro area were 
related to monetary policy, European regulation and trade. By contrast, in 2017 a 
reduction in policy uncertainty was explained by a big drop in uncertainty related to 
monetary policy. The last time the ECB cut interest rates w
as in 2016, when it also 
stated 
that rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period, 
thereby clarifying future interest rate polic
y for a relatively long 
time 
ahead. As for 
2018, and so far in 2019, a steady and pronounced increase in the euro area EPU 
index can be observed, driven in particular by trade
-related uncertainty, but also to 
some extent by uncertainties related to domestic regulation (e.g. uncertain effect
s of 
new emission standards) and fiscal policy (e.g. enforcement of EU budget rules in 
some Member states). 
These 
appear mainly to 
reflect 
(i) global trade disputes 
involving 
the 
United States
 and China that 
are
 likely to affect 
euro area 
exports/imports; 
(ii
) uncertainties surrounding
 the Brexit negotiations;
 and (iii
) concerns regarding 
domestic and fiscal policies in some euro area countries
. 
They do 
not appear to reflect uncertainties associated with the conduct of monetary policy.

 What is 
behind the change in the gap between services price inflation and goods price 
inflation?
  46 5 What is behind the change in the gap between services 
price inflation and goods price inflation?
 Prepared by Luigi Ferrara
 Services price inflation tends to be much higher than non
-energy goods price 
inflation.
 This
 tendency has not only been a f
eature of the euro area economy over 
the past 20 years but has also been observed in the US economy. The gap and its 
variation over time, which implies a changing speed in the evolution of relative prices, 
indicate that aggregate inflation developments typ
ically reflect more than a 
generalised change in the purchasing power of money. Understanding the nature of 
the demand and supply forces that underlie relative price developments is an 
important element of inflation analysis. Against this background, this 
box reviews 
some of the features and sources of the gap between services price inflation and 
non-energy industrial goods
 price inflation in the euro area.
41 The gap 
between services price inflation and goods price inflation 
has 
narrowed in the period follow
ing
 the financial crisis.
 Since 1999, HICP services 
price inflation in the euro area has been, on average, 1.9%, whereas non
-energy 
industrial goods price inflation has been about 0.6%. The gap between the two rates 
has been positive at all times during th
e past 20 years (see Chart A). However, the gap 
declined from an average of 1.5 percentage points in the period 1999
-2008 to an 
average of 1 percentage point in the period 2008
-19. The narrower gap reflects a 
larger decline in average services price inflat
ion (2.3% to 1.5%) than in average 
non-energy industrial goods price
 inflation (0.7% to 0.5%) from the first period to the 
next
. These developments 
have occurred against the backdrop of a 
different demand 
environment in the euro area 
since
 the crisis. In open economies
, a higher 
level
 of 
demand typically benefits the price of non
-tradable services more than the price of 
tradable goods. 
It is therefore likely that t
he larger decline in services
 price
 inflation 
than in non
-energy industrial g
oods price
 inflation has 
to some extent
 reflected
 the 
weaker demand conditions in the euro area after the crisis. The focus of this box, 
however, is on the role of unit labour costs and import prices in explaining relative 
inflation developments in service
s and non
-energy industrial goods.
                                                                     41  For an analysi

A Services
 and goods 
price 
inflation 
and the 
gap between the two
 (annual percentage changes and percentage points)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The services/goods price inflation gap is the difference between the annual rates of change in the HICP components ser
vices and 
non-energy industrial goods. The spike in services price inflation in 2015 is due to Eurostat™s methodological changes to
 the treatment of 
package holiday prices in Germany.
 The decline in services and 
non-energy industrial goods price
 inflation 
is fairly 
broad based in terms of 
the respective sub
-components.
 Chart B shows this in 
terms of their contributions to services and
 non-energy industrial goods price
 inflation 
respectively, with the changes from the first period to the second largely reflecting 
changes in inflation rates rather than changes in the weights of components.
42 With 
the exception of communication services, a
ll sub
-components have recorded lower 
average contributions to services and 
non-energy industrial goods price
 inflation in the 
post
-crisis period than previously (see Chart B). The less negative average inflation 
rate for c
ommunication services
 is, to a la
rge extent, accounted for by 
a less 
pronounced trend decline in the price of telephone services
 and equipment. This 
slower trend decline likely reflects some fading out of the longer
-term impact of 
large
-scale liberalisation of the telecommunications secto
r and of the IT revolution in 
the early 2000s. The drop in the average contribution of miscellaneous services to 
overall services price inflation is largely due to developments in 
medical
 and education 
services
, including the abolition of medical fees and 
education fees over a number of 
years in some euro area countries. The main driver of the smaller contribution to 
inflation from r
ecreation and 
personal 
services has been the slowdown in r
estaurant 
services 
prices growth; this likely reflected a drop in de
mand in some countries in the 
aftermath of the crisis but also specific tax reductions in others. The decline in the 
contribution from transportation services reflected lower price increases for c
ar 
maintenance and repair
, which were likely linked to the c
ar scrapping schemes 
introduced following the crisis and the associated renewal of the stock of cars and 
                                                                    42  The average weight of household services declined by 0.2 percentage points over the two periods and 
the weights of recreation and transportation services by 0.1 percentage 
points, while the average weight 
of miscellaneous services increased by 0.3 percentage points and that of communication services 
remained unchanged. Within 
non
-energy industrial goods
, the average weight of durables declined by 
0.2 percentage points, that 
of non
-durables increased by 0.2 percentage points and that of semi
-durables 
remained unchanged.

 What is behind the change in the gap between services price inflation and goods price 
inflation?
  48 reduced need for repairs in subsequent years. Lower r
ent inflation has been 
the main 
driver of 
the decline in the contribution from h
ousing services
 inflation.
43 The declines 
in the contributions from the 
non-energy industrial goods
 sub
-components have been 
more muted than those for services. The decrease in the contribution from 
non-durable
 goods has reflected price developments in different 
goods, espec
ially 
those 
for personal care. The decline 
in semi
-durable 
goods inflation has 
mirror
ed slower price dynamics in 
both clothing a
nd non-clothing items. 
Slower car and 
furniture
 price increases
, the latter particularly relevant in countries that experienced 
the pre
-crisis housing boom, have been behind the slowdown in durable goods 
inflation. A factor that is likely to have dampened price dynamics across a broad range 
of non
-energy industrial goods is an increase in competition, fostered by the rapid 
growth o
f online businesses. On the whole, this granular perspective suggests that the 
changes in the inflation gap between services and 
non-energy industrial goods
 may 
reflect both general factors and the accumulation of idiosyncratic developments for 
individual 
euro area countries and HICP items.

 Wages and productivity are typically seen as some of the main general factors 
behind t
he gap
 between services price inflation and goods price inflation
. This 
can be seen by looking at production sect
ors and making a broad association between 
manufacturing and the production of 
non-energy industrial goods
 on the one hand, 
and between market services and the production of consumer services on the other 
hand. 
Over the 
past two decades, productivity growth 
in the euro area 
has been much 
stronger

 What is behind the change in the gap between services price inflation and goods price 
inflation?
  49 over to the market services sector with its non
-tradable goods
. The importance of 
wage growth in determ
ining services price increases is strengthened by 
the 
different 
cost structure of the two sectors.
 Labour costs are 
estimated to
 have
 represent
ed about 
40% of the cost structure in services an
d about 20% in industry excluding 
energy and construction in bot
h 2008 and 2016.
44 Looking at the synthesis of wages 
and productivity in terms of unit labour cost growth, t
he decline in the gap
 between 
services price inflation and goods price inflation
 in the post
-crisis period has coincided 
with the corresponding decli
ne in the gap between the 
unit labour cost
 growth of the 
two sectors. There has been a 
large decline 
(of about one
-half of a percentage point) 
in 
average unit labour cost
 growth in the services sector 
in the post
-crisis period, while 
average 
unit labour co
st growth in 
manufacturing
 has remained stable across the two 
periods. Although average growth in wages (compensation per employee) and 
productivity declined in both sectors, the decline in wage growth has been much larger 
than that of productivity in the 
services sector 
(see Chart 
C).

s: Eurostat

 Notes: Labour productivity is shown on an inverse scale. Market services are defined as s
ervices excluding public administration, 
education, health and social services
. Another general factor explaining the gap 
between services price inflation and 
goods price inflation 
is the different exposure to import price developments.
 The
 direct import c
ontent of non
-energy industrial goods is about 12%, compared with 
about 1% for services. These ratios remained broadly unchanged between 2005 and 
2017.45 A comparison of the GDP deflator (a broad measure of domestic price 
developments) with the import defla
tor (a broad measure of foreign price 
                                                                    44  These estimates are obtained from the euro area input
-output tables provided by Eurostat by dividing 
compensation of employees by the total costs of the sectors 
(where total 
costs comprise: foreign and 
domestic inputs of goods and services
; taxes less subsidies
; and compensation of employees
). 45  These estimates are based on Eurostat™s input
-output tables, which provide the breakdown across 
sectors for private con
sumption and imports of final consumer goods and services for the years 2005
-17. 
The ratio between the import content of the two sectors would likely be smaller if the indirect import 
content 
Œ which represents intermediate imported inputs used for the pro
duction of domestic goods and 
services 
Œ were also included, as it tends to be larger for services than for goods.

  50 developments) shows that the latter has generally been more subdued and saw a 
stronger decline between the pre
- and post
-crisis periods (the average increase in the 
GDP deflator fell from 2.0% to 1.1%, while that of th
e import deflator fell from 1.8% to 
0.6%).
46 The subdued foreign cost growth has thus likely had a considerably larger 
dampening impact on non
-energy industrial goods price inflation than on services 
price inflation. This may help to explain why non
-energy 
industrial goods inflation has, 
on average, been only 0.5% in the post
-crisis period. However, these developments 
have contributed to a widening rather than a narrowing of the gap between services 
price inflation and non
-energy industrial goods price infla
tion.
 This suggests that the 
factors behind the diminishing gap were more on the services side.
 One more general factor that may have operated largely on the services side is 
the evolution of administered prices excluding food and energy.
 Most of these 
administered prices are typically part of the services components of the HICP, rather 
than the 
non-energy industrial goods
 components. The lower average 
growth rate 
of administered prices excluding food and energy 
in the post
-crisis period has thus 
contribute
d to the decline in the gap 
between services price inflation and goods price 
inflation 
(the average growth of administered prices has been 1.7% since 2009, 
compared with an average of 2.0% during the period 2001
-08).
47 Overall,
 the 
narrowing 
gap 
between ser
vices price inflation and goods price 
inflation 
helps to explain the lower
 HICP inflation excluding food and energy.
 The change in the gap seems to have largely reflected the relatively high decline in 
unit labour cost growth in the services sector that ha
s dampened services inflation. 
Services accounted for 0.37 percentage points of the 0.5 percentage point decline in 
average HICP inflation excluding energy and food from 1.6% in the pre
-crisis period to 
1.1% 
in the period 
since 2009.
 However, HICP inflation excluding food and energy 
would have declined even more had the weight of the services component not 
changed. While the decline in inflation between the two periods was stronger for 
services than for non
-energy goods, the average s
ervices price inflation rate remained 
visibly higher. The increase of the weight of services in HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food, from an average of 57% in the period 1999
-2008 to an average of 61% in the 
period 2009
-19, thus gave more prominence t
o the higher inflation rate of services in 
underlying inflation developments.
                                                                       46  Developments in the effective exchange rate of the euro do not support the narrowing of the inflation gap 
since, on the whole, the second 
period has seen a depreciation of the exchange rate, although the 
second period has been marked 
Œ like the first one 
Œ by large fluctuations in the euro exchange rate. 
Similarly, import prices for non
-food consumer goods have increased by 1.1%, on average,
 since 2009, 
whereas they declined by 0.3%, on average, in the period 2006
-08 (no data are available before 2006).
 47  The impact of changes in indirect taxes has been similar on service
s price inflation

cific recommendations for economic policies under the 2019 European Semester
  51 6 Country
-specific recommendations for economic policies 
under the 2019 European Semester
 Prepared by Nico Zorell
 On 5 June 
2019 the European Commission issued 
its annual 
policy 
recommendations for 
EU 
Member States 
under the 
2019 European Semester.
 The European Semester is the EU™s annual policy coordination cycle. In this respect, 
the country
-specific recommendations (CSRs) 
are a source of guidance
 for Member 
States when designin
g their 
economic and fiscal policies
 for the following year. 
This 
box examines 
all
 policy recommendations addressed to euro area countries, with the 
exception of those pertain
ing
 to 
fiscal policy
.48 The 2019 recommendations 
call on 
Member States to 
strength
en their 
economic resilience 
and 
growth potential
. The implementation of well
-designed 
structural 
reforms 
is essential for reducing vulnerabilities in 
euro area countries
, 
rendering those countries 
better able to withstand economic shocks.
49 Reforms are 
als
o needed to meet structural challenges facing euro area countries, including 
digitalisation and demographic change.
 The
 2019 CSRs
 cover structural policies
 and policies related to labour markets, 
public administration and the financial sector
. According to the Commission™s 
CSR classification, the majority of euro area countries received recommendations in 
each of the broad policy areas covered (see Chart A). T
he number of euro area 
countries with CSRs in the 
ﬁpublic administration and business 
environmentﬂ 
category 
remained broadly stable. However, within this category more countries received CSRs 
related
 to the business environment and judicial system this year, which appears 
warranted given the importance of high
 quality institutions for resil
ience and long
-term 
growth.
50 As in 2018, the ﬁlabour market, education and social policiesﬂ category
 remains a priority. Within this category, r
ecommendations related to workers™ skills and 
lifelong learning gained importance, 
reflecting
 the 
increasing 
cha
llenges posed by 
digitalisation
. By contrast, o
nly a few countries received CSRs on wage
-setting 
arrangements
. 
Although
 favourable economic 
conditions
 have led to a decline in 
unemployment rates over recent years, the negative 
effects
 of limited labour mar
ket 
adaptability 
in some euro area countries 
could become more apparent when the 
economic cycle turns.
 Overall, the 
2019 CSRs p
lace
 greater emphasis on investment
-enhancing 
structural policies
 and financial sector policies.
 In
 contrast to last year, in 201
9 all 
euro area countries received
 at least one
 CSR related to 
the Commission™s ﬁstructural 
policiesﬂ category, covering, inter alia, regulatory frameworks, competition, 
network 
industries
, and 
research and innovation
. This in part reflects the focus of th
is year™s 
CSR package on identifying structural 
investment
 bottlenecks. This focus should be 
seen in the context of broader efforts by the Commission to strengthen the 
link 
                                                                    48  For

chart excludes 
Greece
. In 2018 the country did not receive CSRs as it
 was under an eco
nomic adjustment programme. It has been under 
enhanced surveillance since August 2018 and is therefore now part of the European Semester.
 Overall, t
he 2019 CSRs 
for countries with excessive macroeconomic 
imbalances cover a broader range of policy areas tha
n those for other 
countries.
51 Chart B shows the average number of policy areas covered by the CSRs 
across three groups of euro area countries, with the groups corresponding to the 
Commission™s assessment as to whether a country has excessive macroeconomic 
imbalances, imbalances or no imbalances.
52 The Commission™s analysis suggests 
that the average number of policy areas for countries with excessive imbalances is 
higher than for other euro area countries and that this gap widened compared with 
2018.                                                                     51  According to 
Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 
November 2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances
, the term ﬁ
imbalances
ﬂ means any trend g
iving rise to macroeconomic
 developments which are adversely affecting, or have the
 potential adversely to affect, the proper functioning of the
 economy of a Member State or of the economic 
and
 monetary union, or of the Union as a whole
. The term ﬁe
xcessiv
e imbalances
ﬂ means
 severe 
imbalances, including imbalances that jeopardise or risk jeopardising the proper functioning of the 
economic and monetary union.
 52  Under the macroeconomic imbalance procedure
, there are three possible outcomes: ﬁno imbalancesﬂ, 
ﬁimbalancesﬂ or ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ. If the 
European 
Commission identifies imbalances, the country 
concerned will receive policy recommendations 
designed
 to address them. When the imbalances are 
assessed as being so severe that they are found to be ﬁexc
essiveﬂ, the Commission can take further 
action by recommending that the Council activate the excessive imbalance procedure.

European

ﬁcivil 
justiceﬂ). 
CSRs for public finances and taxation are not included. 
The country groups are based on the Commission™s assessme
nt under 
the EU™s macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP). The composition of the country groups was stable in 2018 and 2019. 
For the sake 
of comparability across time, the chart excludes 
Greece
. In 2018 the country did not receive CSRs as it was under an 
economic 
adjustment
 programm
e. It has been under enhanced surveillance since August 2018 and is therefore now part of the European 
Semester.
 Continued weak CSR implementation 
by Member States, including those with 
excessive imbalances, 
remains a challenge.
53 In February 2019
 the European 
Commission concluded that 
none of the 2018 CSRs for euro area countries had been 
ﬁfullyﬂ implemented. ﬁSubstantialﬂ progress was only visible for around 5% of the 
CSRs. The remaining 95% of policy recommendations had either 
not been 
implemented or, at best, had been implemented to ﬁsomeﬂ extent. The CSR 
implementation record has therefore continued to deteriorate in line with the trend 
seen over recent years 
(see Chart 
C). Moreover, countries with excessive imbalances 
do not 
seem to have taken 
further 
decisive policy action to step up the implementation 
of their CSRs.
 In order to reap the full benefits 
of the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures, other 
policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer
-term growth 
potential and reducing vulnerabilities.
 In particular, t
he implementation of structural 
reforms needs to be substantially stepped up, with the 2019 CSRs serving as the 
relevant signpost.
 While the CSRs provide important guidance to all countries, 
the 
corre
ctive arm of 
the macroeconomic imbalance 
procedure 
(MIP) might offer a 
well
-defined process to assist the most vulnerable 
countries
, in particular.
 In addition, 
a more rigorous 
prioritisation of CSRs according to their macro
-critical relevance could 
encour
age compliance with the MIP and also help incentivise countries to take firmer 
ownership of structural reforms.
 If appropriately designed and implemented, 
EU tools 
offering financial support and technical expertise for important structural reforms could 
also help to provide 
the right incentives for 
such
 reform
s and national ownership.

  55 7 Priorities for fiscal policies under the 2019 European 
Semester
 Prepared by Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Nadine 
Leiner
-Killinger
 On 
5 June
 the European Commissio
n issued its 201
9 European Semester 
Spring 
Package of policy recommendations for 
EU 
Member States.
 The
 package 
includes country
-specific recommendations (CSRs) for economic and fiscal policies in 
2020 for all Member States.
54 It also contains recommendation
s regarding the 
implementation of the European Union™s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) for some 
countries.
55 With regard to fiscal policies, t
he recommendations are based on the 
Commission™s 2019 spring forecast and its assessment of countries™ policy plans as 
reflected in the 
updates 
of the 
stability and convergence programmes
 released in 
April
. This box examines the 
fiscal policy 
recommendations
 addressed to the euro 
area countries.
 The examination shows that 
in countries with high 
levels of 
government debt
, building buffers to strengthen resilience in cyclical downturns 
remains a priority for fiscal policies. At the same time, countries that hav
e achieved 
sound fiscal positions could utilise some fiscal space for measures to support 
economic growth.
 The 
2019 S
pring 
Package 
confirms the pattern of a significant 
divergence
 of 
fiscal positions across countries.
 According
 to the European Commission™s
 2019 spring forecast, seven euro area countries are assessed to have reached sound fiscal 
positions with underlying budgetary positions close to or above their medium
-term 
budgetary objectives (MTOs) at the beginning of 2019 (see Chart
 A). This 
help
s to
 reduce government debt
 ratios, provides policy space for measures aimed at raising 
potential output growth,
 and bolster
s the resilience of 
public finances ahead of 
a possible 
downturn
. At the same time, a number of countries are still some distance 
away fro
m their MTOs, most notably countries with government debt
-to
-GDP ratios of 
more than 90%. They remain vulnerable to an economic downturn and financial 
market volatility.
                                                                     54  See also the box entitled ﬁ

 (percentages

  Source
s: European Commission (

 calculations.
 Notes: The 
distance from a country™s MTO is measured as the difference between the structural balance and the MTO. Countries no 
further than 0.25% of GDP from their MTOs are cons
idered to have reached them (see also the 2019 edition of the European 
Commission™s Vade Mecum on the Stability and Growth Pact). The chart excludes Greece, which does not have an MTO for 2019
. Following its exit from the 
economic
 adjustment 
programme, 
Greece has set an MTO for the period 2020
-22. In most cases, the distance from the MTO in countries with high levels of 
government debt reflects overall limited adjustment progress in recent years
. As shown in Chart
 B, most euro area countries with governm
ent debt above 90% of 
GDP implemented large fiscal adjustments in 2012
-13, as measured by the change in 
the structural balance. This indicator comprises headline budget balances net of the 
impact of the economic cycle and one
-off measures. For some countri
es with high 
levels of government debt, the adjustments exceeded the requirements under the 
SGP, in part reflecting financial market pressures. Thereafter, in the period 2014
-19 fiscal adjustment slowed considerably. It remained below the SGP™s benchmark 
requirement of 0.5% of GDP in all these countries, except Portugal, which has come 
closest to its MTO within this group (see Chart
 A).
56 Conversely, the structural 
budgetary positions of Spain and Italy have deteriorated over recent years, thus 
widening the 
gaps vis
-à-vis their MTOs. Moreover, the overall limited improvement in 
structural balances in recent years tends to overstate the efforts actually undertaken 
by governments. This is because declines in government interest expenditure as a 
percentage of GD
P, as well as revenue windfalls reflecting extraordinary revenue 
increases during the past economic expansion, have contributed to favourable 
developments in structural balances.
                                                                     56  According to the 
2019 stability and convergence programmes
, a few countries 
have updated their MTOs. 
Luxembourg has raised its MTO for 2020 by 1
 percentage point and Italy™s has been raised by 
0.5
 percentage points. In contrast, Portugal, Slovenia and Sl
ovakia have lowered their MTOs for 2020.

 Notes: 
The horizontal 
line 
refers to 
the 
benchmark requirement under the SGP for an annual improvement in the structural balance of 
0.5% of 
GDP. The chart excludes Greece, which did not set an MTO during this period.
 While the CSRs set fiscal policy priorities for 2020 that differ across countries, 
they all emphasise the need to achieve a more growth
-friendly composition of 
public finances
. Countries that have not yet achieved their MTOs are advised to align 
their fiscal adjustment efforts with the requirements of the SGP. 
This is 
consistent
 with 
the need for countries with high debt and remaining fiscal gaps to build fiscal buffers 
that 
would 
ensure their resilience
 if downside risks 
to the economy 
materialise. 
However, it would require sizeable additional fiscal adjustment measures on the part 
of such countries (see Chart
 C). Given the asymmetric nature of the SGP, countries 
that have achieved
 their MTOs do not receive a recommendation regarding the use of 
policy space accumulated under its rules. Germany is recommended, ﬁwhile 
respectingﬂ the MTO, to ﬁuse fiscal and structural policies to achieve a sustained 
upward trend in private and public 
investmentﬂ which is in line with government plans. 
Countries with 
available fiscal space 
could utilise part of it to support economic
 growth
. 
Moreover, the recommendations generally emphasise the need for a more 
growth
-friendly composition of public finan
ces to enhance potential output growth, for 
example, through increasing the quality of investment in infrastructure and education, 
taking into account differing needs across countries.
 On 
5 June
 2019 the European Commission also issued recommendations for 
some euro area countries regarding the implementation of the SGP.
 The 
Commission adopted reports for Belgium
, France, 
Italy 
and Cyprus 
under Article
 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
in which it 
assesses
 their
 compliance with the Treaty™s deficit and debt criteria.
 In the case of 
Belgium, the report concludes that at the current juncture 
it is not 
possible to 
fully 
determine
 whether the debt criterion is complied with
, mainly 
owing
 to uncertainty 
regarding the 
extent to which 
an increase in advance corporate income tax payments 
collected in 2017 and 2018 is of a structural nature. For France
, the report concludes 
that the deficit and debt criteria should be considered as currently complied with. For

, among them, the

of 
a significant devia
tion in 2019
, and a projected headline deficit above 3% of GDP in 
2020. 
On 3
 July 2019 
the Commission 
concluded that an EDP was no longer 
warranted for Italy at this stage. It took account of 
the mid
-year budget for 2019 as well 
as a decree
-law adopted by 
the Italian government on 1
 July
, which provided for an 
additional structural effort of 0.45% of GDP in 2019
. 
Based on this
 information
, the 
Commission assessed
 Italy to be broadly compliant with the requirements under the 
preventive arm of the SGP in 2019
. 
It stated
 that it would 
closely 
monitor the execution 
of the amended 2019 budget and 
would 
assess 
the
 compliance of the 2020 draft 
budgetary plan 
with the SGP 
in 
the 
autumn.
 For Cyprus, the Commission considers 
that 
no further steps to
wards
 a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should 
be taken
, despite the deficit having breached the 3% 
of GDP 
threshold in 2018 as a 
result of one
-off support to the financial sector. This is because Cyprus 
exceeded
 its 
MTO
 in 2018 and is project
ed to be fully compliant with all 
SGP 
requirements in 2019 
and 2020.
 Finally, t
he Commission recommended 
that
 the
 EDP for 
Spain be 
abrogated, based on the 2018 budget outcome
, and the 
Economic and Financial 
Affairs 
Council
 adopted a corresponding decision

 1 Global value chain participation and exchange rate 
pass
-through to export and import prices
 Prepared by Georgios Georgiadis and Johannes Gräb
 Many studies
 suggest that advanced economies™ import prices have become less 
sensitive to exchange rate movements
 over the last few decades. Since 
exchange 
rate movements 
would in this case result in
 smaller changes in trade prices and 
quantities, exchange rate
s would
 have also become less important
 in the transmission 
of domestic and international shocks
, which has important implications for monetary 
policy and the way it is transmitted to the economy
. This article suggests that part of 
the likely decline in exchange 
rate pass
-through to import prices is a result of the rise 
of global value chains. As production increasingly relies on
 imported intermediate
 goods, production costs and hence export prices become more sensitive to exchange 
rate changes. However, this effe
ct also increasingly offsets the variation in import 
prices
 caused by exchange rate changes. Hence the existence of cross
-country 
production linkages may amplify exchange rate pass
-through to export prices but 
thereby dampen exchange rate pass
-through to i
mport prices.
 1 Introduction
 The degree to which exchange rate changes 
feed through
 to import prices
 is 
commonly referred to as the
 ﬁexchange rate pass
-through
ﬂ to import prices.
 Assuming that export prices are rigid or even fixed in the exporter
™s 
currency
, a 
depreciation of the importer™s currency implies that import prices in that currency 
increase. However, the amount by which import prices in local currency change in 
response to a given change in the exchange rate may vary. The extent to which t
hey 
react is the degree of exchange rate pass
-through to import prices. Understanding and 
assessing 
this 
pass
-through is essential for monitoring and forecasting domestic
 inflation, and hence for the calibration of monetary policy.
 A salient feature 
of adv
anced economies
 during the last 
few 
decades has been 
a likely decline in exchange rate pass
-through to import prices
.58 A wide range of 
estimates suggest that the sensitivity of many advanced economies™ import prices to 
changes in their nominal effective ex
change rates has decreased since the late 1990s
.                                                                     58  See Campa, J. and Goldberg, L

 Global value chain participation and exchange rate pass
-through to export and import prices
  61 Another 
striking
 feature of the global economy during the last 
few 
decades has 
been the rise of global value chains.
 The increasing dispersion of 
stages of
 production 
was s
purred by 
a number of factors. The 
decline in costs of transportation 
and logistics allowed firms to take advantage of large wage differences between 
advanced and emerging market economies through the internationalisation of supply 
chains. A
dvance
s in information a
nd communication technolog
ies in turn made the 
complex coordination of production processes at distance possible
.59 Moreover, 
the 
adoption of trade
-liberalising policies
 over the past few decades created an 
environment conducive to the creation of globalised production chains.
 The f
ragmentation of production chains across borders has been accompanied 
by an increase in the cross
-border flow of intermediate goods.
 The
 regional 
dispersion of
 the research and development underlying the iP
od, the manufacturing of 
its components, their
 ass
embly
, as well as 
the
 sale and distribution
 of the iPod
 in local 
markets is a 
well
-known
 example of 
production 
chain fragmentation;
60 another 
example is the role of Germany as the regional hub in ﬁFactory Europeﬂ. A 
consequence of 
fragmenting production chains internationally is 
a continuous rise 
Œ at 
least until the eruption of the global financial crisis 
Œ in the share of trade accounted for 
by intermediate goods relative to that 
of final goods
. 
Trade in intermediate goods and 
ser
vices now accounts for 
a very large share of 
overall trade 
flows in goods and 
services.
61 Global value chains may have a wide range of economic effects.
 Several studies 
have explored the effects of global value chains by looking at the increased fragmentati
on of production across borders. Drawing on newly developed input
-output tables, a series of 
studies have developed frameworks to measure trade in valued added and an economy's 
and individual sectors™ integration in global value chains.
62 Building on these 
insights, 
other studies have looked at the economic implications of global value chains. For 
example, participation in global value chains appears to boost growth,
63 amplify 
cross
-country monetary policy spillovers,
64 strengthen supply
-side interlinkages and
 thus 
                                                                    59  See, for example, Baldwin, R.,

 Global value chain participation and exchange rate pass
-through to export and import prices
  62 increase inflation correlations,
65 render an economy's income distribution more uneven 
and raise current account surpluses (or lower current account deficits).
66 This article 
examines
 the role of global value chain
 participation
 in
 exchange 
rate pass
-through to import and export prices
.67 The mechanism posited has two 
components. First, the exchange rate pass
-through to the export prices of an 
economy™s trading partners is strengthened by their increased use of intermediates
 imported from that economy (i
.e. their increased participation in global value chains). 
Second, the greater pass
-through to its 
trading partners™ 
export prices leads to a 
weakening of the economy™s exchange rate pass
-through to import prices.
 The mechanism can best be described by an 
example 
in which the world 
consists of only two
 economies, namely Home and Foreign.
 For simplicity, it is 
assumed that export prices are fixed in the currency of the producer and that firms™ 
mark
-ups are constant. The currency of Home depreciates against t
he currency of 
Foreign. If there are no global value chains, production costs in Foreign are not 
affected by an appreciation of its currency against the currency of Home, as all 
intermediate inputs used in production are sourced domestically. As a conseque
nce, 
exchange rate pass
-through to export prices
 in Foreign is zero. In Home, however, the 
same appreciation of the currency of Foreign implies a one
-for
-one increase in import 
prices, i.e. exchange rate pass
-through to import prices in Home equals unity. 
So if the 
currency of Foreign appreciates by 10% against the currency of Home, export prices 
in Foreign are unchanged and import prices in Home rise by 10%.
 Exchange rate pass
-through to export and import prices changes in the 
presence of global value 
chains.
 With value chain integration, exchange rate 
pass
-through to export prices in Foreign is positive rather than zero, and exchange 
rate pass
-through to import prices in Home is less than one. For example, suppose 
half of the inputs in Foreign producti
on are imported from Home. A 10% appreciation 
of the currency of Foreign implies a reduction in its production costs by 5%, so it can 
cut its export prices by 5%. The decline in Foreign™s export prices offsets part of the 
rise in import prices paid by Home
 that is implied by the depreciation of its currency
 against the currency of Foreign. Specifically, because Foreign™s export prices have 
been cut by 5% following the depreciation of Home™s currency, import prices in Home 
increase by less than 10%. Most imp
ortantly, the reduction in exchange rate 
                                                                    65  See Bems, R. and Johnson, R.,

  63 pass
-through to import prices in Home depends on the degree of Foreign™s value chain 
participation with Home.
68 Since 2000
, as advanced economies have increased participation in global 
value chains, the evidence 
suggests that their
 exchange rate pass
-through
 has 
declined for
 import
 prices
 and increased for export prices
 (see Chart 1)
. The 
estimated exchange rate pass
-through to import prices for the early 2000s is around 
42%, i.e. a 10% nominal effective exchange 
rate depreciation was followed by an 
increase in import prices by 4.2% on average across advanced economies. For the 
late 2000s, the figure is estimated to have fallen to around 30%. Global value chain 
participation of advanced economies rose in the same p
eriod, with the ratio of 
domestic value added to gross exports 
Œ the VAX ratio 
Œ falling from 83% to 78%. A 
smaller VAX ratio indicates that a larger share of the value added embedded in an 
economy™s gross exports was created using imports rather than dome
stically 
produced intermediates.

. The article presents empirical evid
ence
, consistent with the mechanism 
described
 above
, that changes in exchange rate pass
-through to export and 
import prices are in part due to an increase in global value chain participation.
 In particular, the evidence suggests that economies which have p
articipated 
increasingly in global value chains have exhibited rising exchange rate pass
-through 
to export prices; in turn, economies whose trading partners have become increasingly 
                                                                    68  Of course, if Home also uses i
ntermediat
es imported from Foreign, the same 
mechanism
 that produces a 
decline in exchange rate pass
-through to import prices in Home carries over to import prices in Foreign. 
However, it can be shown that
, in general equilibrium after all rounds of adjust
ment
, exchange rate 
pass
-through to import prices still declines and exchange rate pass
-through to export prices still rises as 
economies participate more in global value chains.

  64 integrated in value chains with them have exhibited falling exchange rate 
pass
-through to import prices.
 The 
finding that
 global value chain participation may reduce economies™
 exchange rate pass
-through to import prices
 has important implications
 for the 
conduct and transmission of monetary policy
. In particular, when exchange 
rate 
pass
-through to import prices is low, an exchange rate depreciation may lead to only 
very limited expenditure
-switching effects under which exports would rise and imports 
would fall
.70 Moreover, the associated pressures on import prices, and hence 
cons
umer prices, would be minor. Overall, in a low import price pass
-through 
environment exchange rate movements are accompanied by smaller changes in 
import prices and quantities, reducing the role played by the exchange rate channel in 
transmitting domestic 
and international shocks.

 Section 2 reviews the evolution of 
exchange 
rate pass

 as well as

 Global value chain participation
 Measuring global value chain participation is challenging
. One
 widely
-used 
measur
e that indicates how much a country is using imports in its production of 
exports 
is an economy™s
 ratio of domestic value added
 to gross exports, the ﬁVAXﬂ 
ratio. Low values of the VAX ratio
 indicate that a large share of an economy™s 
gross 
exports 
reflect
 value added through 
foreign inputs
. The production of the iPod may 
again serve as an illustrative example. While the iPod is exported from China, 
the 
actual 
value added 
in China is very limited, consisting
 mainly 
of low
-skilled assembly 
services
. 
The majo
r part of the value is 
sophisticated intermediate inputs produced 
by 
firms in the U
nited 
States
, Japan, 
South 
Korea and Taiwan
.78 Hence, China has a low 
ratio of domestic value added to gross exports of the iPod and is, according to this 
                                                                    77  For evidence on the decline in

 Historical data on the VAX rati

thus represents imported va

 Very recently, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, measures of global

chains.

 has 
been geographically widespread
, the
 causes
 of 
the 
slowdown are
 unlikely 
to be

 (see Chart 5)

forward include 
reduc
ti
ons in the length of firms™ supply chains
 aimed at improving risk 
management (for example in response to the 2011 earthquake in Japan), the 
                                                                    79  The

2011 and the 2016 edition the period from 2000 to 2014. Unfortunately, the two editions are not 
consistent in terms of country and sector coverage. For this reason, the data from the two WIOD editions 
can in
 general not be combined to construct consistent measures of global value chain participation for 
the entire period from 1995 to 2014.

. 3 The impact of participation in global value chains on 
exchange rate pass
-through to export and import prices
 The use of imported intermediates in the context of global value chain 
participation may affect the sensitivity of trading partners™ production cost
s and export prices to exchange rate changes, and hence exchange rate 
pass
-through to import prices
. As explained above, w
hen production 
in Foreign 
uses intermediate inputs
 imported from Home
, a
n appreciation of
 the currency
 of 
Foreign against the currency
 of Home reduces Foreign™s
 production costs. 
This 
fall
 in 
production costs 
in Foreign may translate into a reduction in
 export prices. 
The drop in 
Foreign™s export prices dampens the rise in Home™s import prices that is caused by the 
depreciation of its cu
rrency. The testable prediction from this line of thought is that 
economies which participate to a larger extent in value chains with the rest of the world 
by using imported intermediates should exhibit greater exchange rate pass
-through to 
their export pr
ices, and that economies should exhibit lower exchange rate 
pass
-through to their import prices when the intermediates they produce are used by 
the rest of the world in its production.
 The mechanism through which exchange rate pass
-through to import prices
 is 
modified
 by global value chain participation 
also
 arise
s in 
general equilibrium.
 A standard structural two
-country general equilibrium model with imported 
intermediates used in production predicts that under producer
-currency pricing 
Œ i.e. 
when export
 prices are sticky in the currency of the producer 
Œ Home™s exchange rate 
pass
-through to export prices increases with its global value chain participation, i.e. it

alternatives to producer

83 Under producer
-currency pricing export 
prices are sticky in the currency of the producer, while under local
-currency pricing 
export prices are sticky in the currency of the 
importer and under dominant
-currency 
pricing, export prices are sticky in the currency of a third country, typically the US 
dollar. Although the mechanisms linking global value chain participation and exchange 
rate pass
-through to import and export prices 
may differ somewhat across different 
export pricing paradigms, higher levels of home (trading
-partner) global value chain 
participation are associated with a higher 
(lower) 
exchange rate pass
-through to 
export (import) prices for all pricing paradigms (see
 Chart 6 and Chart 7). This even 
applies to the case of flexible prices, under which the currency in which export prices 
are invoiced is immaterial.

  72 4 Empirical 
evidence on the effect of
 global value chain 
participation 
on exchange rate pass
-through to exp
ort and 
import prices
 The role of the rise in global value chain participation in the change in exchange 
rate pass
-through to export and import prices over time is analysed in a panel 
regression framework.
 The
 time
-varying, country
-specific estimates of ex
change 
rate pass
-through to export and import prices estimated 
in Section 2
 using 
rolling
-window regressions
 are used as the dependent variable
 in the second step
 of 
the analysis. The explanatory variables on the right
-hand side of the equation include 
the VAX ratio as a measure of economies™ global
 value chain participation 
(see Box 2)
. Box

 used to gauge the 
role
 of 
the rise in 
global value chain participation 
in
 the change in 
exchange rate pass
-through
 to export and import prices over time (see Section 
4). First, the time
-varying estimates of exchange rate pass
-through 
to export prices 
 obtained from 
the rolling
-window regressions in equation (1) in Box 1 are related to the home economy™s degree of 
global value chain participation in the panel regression
 =+++
+
++  (3)
 where 
 is the home economy™s VAX ratio and 
 is a vector of additional controls that include 
trade openness (measured as 
the ratio of 
imports to GDP) as well as the volatility in domestic inflation 
and the nominal effective exchange rate.
84,85 The regression also controls for unobserved, 
time
-invariant country
-specific characteristics, 
, that may have a bearing on cross
-country 
differences in exchange rate pass
-through
. These country fixed effects
 capture
, for example,
 cross
-country differences in the structure of invoicing currenc
ies
 for
 exports and imports (
see the 
discussion on
 Chart
s 6 and 7
), which change
s only very slowly over time.
86 The regression also 
controls for the effects of unobserved,
 time
-varying factors that are common to all countries, 
. These time fixed effects capture
, for example, the fact
 that estimated exchange rate pass
-through 
and global value chain participation fell synchronously across countries during the global fin
ancial 
crisis. Finally, the regression controls for two other factors that have been suggested to have 
contributed to the change in exchange rate pass
-through in the literature: 
the share of energy in 
export and import bundles, 

, 
and the rise
 in globalisation and hence competitive pressures 
                                                                    84  The estimates of exchange ra
te pass
-through used as dependent variables are generated regressands, 
which is less problematic than in case of generated regressors as this does not imply correlation between 
an explanatory variable and the regression error
 by construction.

  74 The results are also consistent with the hypothesis that
 the increasing degree 
of global value chain participation has contributed to the decline in the 
estimated exchange rate pass
-through to import prices
. The regression results 
are consistent with the hypothesis that an increased degree of global value chain
 participation on the part of economy 
i™s trading partners 
Œ reflected in a reduction in the 
latter™s VAX ratio, 
 Œ reduces the sensitivity of Home import prices to exchange 
rate changes (Table 1, column 2)
. The estimates are also consistent wit
h the 
hypothesis that a decline in the share of energy in total imports and an increase in 
competitive pressures among exporters in the context of greater globalisation have 
contributed to the reduction of estimated exchange rate pass
-through to import pri
ces, 
as argued in existing literature.
90,91 Because the regression framework does not identify structural innovations that 
have underpinned the rise in global value chain participation, it 
is difficult to
 quantify 
the latter™s
 historical 
contribution to the 
overall 
variation in 
estimated 
exchange rate pass
-through over time.
 However, assuming that changes in global 
value chain participation are exogenous and uncorrelated with changes in other 
potential determinants of exchange rate pass
-through (which may wel
l not be the 
case), a rough calculation is possible. Under these assumptions, the observation that 
the VAX ratios of the economies in the sample considered have fallen on average by 
about 5 percentage points, together with the relevant coefficient estimate
 in column 1, 
Table 1, would imply that the rise in global value chain participation has raised 
exchange rate pass
-through to export prices by 5 percentage points 
Œ which is very 
close to the 7 percentage point increase actually estimated. Similarly, the o
bservation 
that the rise in the integration of the rest of the world in value chains with the 
economies considered in the sample as reflected in a fall in the VAX ratios on average 
by about 4 percentage points, together with the relevant coefficient estima
te in column 
2, Table 1, would imply that the rise in global value chain participation has reduced 
exchange rate pass
-through to import prices by 1.3 percentage points, which is 
around 20% of the overall 
decline.
 5 Conclusion
 The decline in exchange rate 
pass
-through to import prices in advanced economies, 
documented in several contributions to the literature, has important monetary policy 
implications.
 In
 an environment with limited exchange rate pass
-through to import 
prices,
 expenditure
-switching 
effect
s in response to exchange rate depreciations are 
muted and 
exc
hange rate depreciations are
 associated with only minor 
increases
 in 
import and hence consum
er price inflation
. It is thus important to understand the 
mechanisms that have given rise to this dec
line.
                                                                     90  Because
 real
 total factor productivity
 is measured as an index
, the 
country
-specific 
trading
-partner 
average 
cannot be calculated
. However, given that such averages will be very similar across economies 
in 
the
 sample, they are absorbed in the period fixed effects.
 91  Available panel data on currency invoicing shares suggest that invoicing patterns have remained broadly 
unchanged over time. Accordingly, there is little evidence to suggest that 
changes in 
exchang
e rate 
pass
-through relate to changes in 
pricing 
paradigms.

 Prepared by Marta Rodríguez
-Vives and Linda Kezbere
 At a time of high government indebtedness, low structural economic growth and 
ageing populations, a key element in today™s policy debate is the role of gov
ernment in 
providing its services and distributing resources to society. Government decisions on 
tax and social benefit systems have an important bearing on macroeconomic 
performance in the euro area. This article focuses on how social spending on 
individu
al households or on the provision of collective goods and services is organised 
in euro area countries. Choices made concerning the level and structure of social 
spending are country
-specific and reflect societal policy preferences. The aim of this 
article
 is to review government social spending across euro area countries and how it 
has evolved since the pre
-crisis period. It also zooms in on the different social 
insurance systems in euro area countries in terms of pensions and health and looks at 
spending 
on education. We devote particular attention to the analysis of pensions, as 
pensions represent the biggest social spending item in all countries. The article 
suggests that countries should look for policies and reforms to ensure the 
sustainability of soci
al spending, especially in view of ageing populations and possible 
negative economic shocks.
 1 Introduction
 Inequality is now at the centre of the international policy agenda because 
growing inequalities 
have the potential to 
undermine future economic 
deve
lopment and reduce intergenerational social mobility and social cohesion
. In particular, 
government decisions on tax and social benefit systems have 
a large 
bearing on macroeconomic performance. 
In this context, policymakers are seeking to 
identify the 
most coherent composition of public finance
s to foster ﬁinclusive growthﬂ.
 The policy guidelines on fiscal and structural reforms under the country
-specific 
recommendations (CSRs)
92 issued under the 
European Semester
 are also supportive 
of 
the inclusive gro
wth agenda
. Public finance theory divides government functions into allocation, 
stabilisation and distribution
.93 First, 
government
s intend to achieve an efficient 
use of resources in the economy
. 
Second, f
iscal policies are important in stabilising 
income 
and consumption over the economic cycle.
94 Third, fi
scal policies are
 also
 instrumental in mitigating income inequality 
resulting
 from market forces (market 
                                                                    92  See the CSRs issued for individual countries on the European Commission 
website
. The recommended 
reforms are aimed at boosting jobs and
 economic
 growth, while maintaining sound public finances and 
social f
airness
 in euro area countries
. 93  See 
Musgrave
, R.A.
, The Theory of Public Finance: 
A Study in Public Economy
, McGraw Hill, New York
, 1959
. 94  The impact of fiscal policy on the economy is not limited to discretionary
 fiscal policies
 alone. During 
recessions
, tax receipts automatically decline and unemployment
-related spending increases, while 
other government expenditure is largely unaffected, giving rise to ﬁautomatic fiscal stabilisersﬂ. Such 
automatic stabilisers also help to supp
ort aggregate demand during downturns. Other structural or 
temporary fluctuations in government revenue or expenditure will also have an impact on aggregate 
expenditure and income.

  77 inequality).
 Redistribution
 can be measured as t
he percentage reduction 
in 
market 
income inequality 
due to direct government action (via direct taxes and cash 
transfers).
 Social spending 
can be defined as government
 expenditure on social 
protection, education and health
.95 These resources are 
intended
 to relieve 
households
 of 
the financial burden of
 a number of risks and 
basic 
needs. In practice, a 
large part of social spending is in the form of social transfers in cash made directly to 
individual households, such as pensions, unemployment and sickness 
benefits and 
social assistance benefits. Other sp
ending is provided in kind
, either on
 a collective 
basis, i.e. directly produced and distributed by the government, or on an individual 
basis, distributing market goods and services to individual households 
(or reimbursing 
the costs thereof
). As explained 
in Box 1, these different ways of providing public 
goods and services have a significant impact 
Œ directly or indirectly 
Œ on household 
disposable income and, consequently, on consumption.
 Social spending can be analysed by using classification of the func
tions of 
government (COFOG
) data.
96 The delineation of social spending includes 
distributive 
expenditure on social protection and pre
-distributive expenditure 
that 
supports 
long
-term growth (
e.g. 
education and, to a lesser extent, health). Investment 
in inf
rastructure is also conducive to growth
, according to economic literature, but it 
does not 
fall within our
 categorisatio
n of social spending
. Social spending represents the largest component of government expenditure 
in all 
euro area countr
ies, and 
pension
 payments 
make up 
the largest share.
 Social spending has increased steadily since 2001
,97 both 
in nominal terms and 
as a 
percentage 
of 
total government expenditure, albeit with some volatility expressed as a 
percentage of GDP during the crisis period
. 
In th
e euro area
 in 2017
, social spending 
account
ed for
, on average, around 
70% of 
total 
government 
expenditure (see Table 1) 
and amounted to 
31% of GDP
, or •
3.5 trillion
. Social protection is by far the largest 
component
 of social spending in euro area countries
, 
accounting for, on average, 
42% 
of total 
government 
expenditure and 
around 
20% of GDP. 
There are clear differences 
between countries
 in 
the level of 
social protection
, which accounts for 
one third of total 
govern
ment 
expenditure 
in 
Malta and Latvia 
and approx
imately
 half
 in 
Finland 
and Germany
. The main 
component 
in every country is 
expenditure on 
pension
s (old age 
and survivors
™), which averages 
12.4% of GDP, followed by sickness and disability, 
famil
ies
 and chil
dren, unemployment and social housing. 
Despite the 
pension reforms 
undertaken 
in 
many euro area countries, pensions represent the main burd
en for 
governments
. On the other hand, euro area countries have contain
ed expenditure 
on health and education in rece
nt years. Expenditure on health and education
, 
                                                                    95  This definition, which includes the government functions with the larges
t social impact on households,
 is 
chosen for 
the purpose of 
this article
. A range of definitions of social spending are in use, from a narrow 
one including only social transfers in cash or in kind associated with social protection, to wider definitions 
tha
t also include environmental protection, housing and community amenities, and recreation, culture 
and religion.
 96  The latest available COFOG data refer to 2017. The data are in nominal terms, i.e. comparisons over 
time also reflect inflation differentials
, and comparisons of levels across countries reflect price level 
differences. See

 There is no one
-size
-fits
-all optimal level of social spending as a share of the 
economy
. The optimal composition of social spending 
takes into account 
microeconomic factors
 (e.g. 
the efficiency of social spending systems
) and 
macroeconomic 
factors (e.g. 
the size of the fiscal multipliers
). 
This 
is an argument 
for 
growth
-friendly fisca
l instruments, 
based on 
the underlying idea that the composition 
of public finances 
has an impact 
on long
-term output
. It involves 
political choices and 
societal preferences
 Œ such as 
the optimal size of government
,98 the fiscal 
governance framework
, and th
e t
ax system
 to finance social spending. It also has 
implications for 
debt sustainability, interaction with other economic policies, 
demography and existing political capital for implementing 
fiscal
-structural
 reforms in 
a satisfactory manner. 
In fact, pol
itical pressure to 
reverse 
reforms that burden older 
citizens 
could
 grow
 as a consequence of the increasing age of the 
median voter. 
In 
addition, as t
he ratio of contributors to beneficiaries shrink
s, questions 
of 
intergenerational fairness
 arise.
 Social i
nsurance systems and the way public goods and services are provided 
differ substantially across 
euro area 
countries
. Countries
™ systems 
did not 
converge 
over 
the last decade
, as societal preferences are different.
 Some countries 
have a 
ﬁpublic
-integrated 
model
ﬂ which links budgetary financing with 
providers of 
goods and services that 
are part of 
the general government sector. In other countries, 
the government predominantly purchase the goods and services from 
market 
producers 
under a ﬁ
public
-contract mode
lﬂ. Therefore social spending is represented 
differently in national accounts
 across countries, 
affecting 
the interpretation of 
cross
-country comparisons
. Estimates of 
social security pensi
on obligations
 are 
also 
diverse across countries, depending on whet
her 
pension schemes 
are more publicly 
or privately organised. In general, a majority of euro area countries have significant 
                                                                    98  There is huge variation in performance and efficiency across countries, but studies tend to suggest a

  79 publicly organised schemes, while the Netherlands 
and, to a lesser extent, Ireland 
also have considerable
 private pillars.
 As a con
sequence of this diversity, a
 comprehensive assessment of social 
spending requires the analysis of microeconomic data and tax systems
 in 
individual countries
. Aggregate data need to be interpreted with caution and 
complemented with 
further 
studies
. For ins
tance
, 
it is important to monitor closely the 
costs incurred in the provision of public services and to further analyse 
the efficiency of 
public spending in the context of spending reviews (i.e. how to maximise the economic 
effect of spending using the ava
ilable resources). Regarding the tax systems in place, 
apart from the progressivity of direct and indirect 
taxes and 
the efficiency of the tax 
administration, 
there is widespread use of 
tax 
exemptions
 on pensions, health or 
housing in euro 
area 
countries. 
It is difficult to calculate the impact
 of these exemptions
 on the government accounts and their mitigating effect on income distribution
. 
However, that is outside the scope of this article.
99 This article is structured as follows:
 Section 2 analyses the 
evolution of social 
spending since the pre
-crisis years and its linkages to household disposable income 
and consumption; Section 3
 discusses the distributive function of public finance in 
euro area countries, with a descriptive analysis of the differences 
in social insurance 
systems and a focus on pensions as the largest social spending item in every euro 
area country; and Section 4 concludes.
 2 The 
evolution of the composition of social spending in the 
euro area
 The euro area has witnessed an increase in 
both 
its 
overall and its social 
expenditure
-to-GDP ratio, albeit 
with some 
volatility during the crisis period
. Chart 1 illustrates trends in cyclically adjusted primary expenditure
 relative to GDP
 and 
the social spending categories at euro area level durin
g the period 2001
-2017. During 
the pre
-crisis phase (
Phase I), primary expenditure 
(i.e. total 
government 
expenditure 
minus interest payments) 
was relatively stable. During the financial crisis, the sharp 
deterioration 
in GDP 
in 2008
-2010 was accompanied b
y a temporary spending 
stimulus (
Phase II). This 
was 
reflected in the 
increase in 
the cyclically adjusted primary 
expenditure
 ratio
. After 
the financial crisis peaked in 2010, the 
primary expenditure 
ratio 
started declining (
Phase III), reflecting euro are
a countries™ 
adjustment 
policies in 
view of 
rising 
debt sustainability concerns. 
Since 
the normalisation of fiscal policies in 
2014 (Phase IV), 
the 
primary expenditure
 ratio
 has remained stable at 
around 
45% of 
GDP
, one
 percentage point 
of GDP above the pr
e-crisis 
level.
                                                                     99  A recent micro
-simulation study suggest
s that the revenue cost of pension
-related tax expenditure is 
heterogeneous, ranging from very sizeable foregone revenue
s in the Baltic countries and Portugal (more 
than 13% of old
 age pension expenditure), 
to 
a neutral 
impact 
in Spain 
and 
Luxembourg, 
and 
extra 
revenue of 
1% in Malta 
and almost 5% of old 
age pension expenditure 
in Greece 
(due to the solidarity 
tax
). See Barrios, S., Moscarola, F.C., Figari, F. and Gandullia, L., ﬁ

 Notes: Phase I is the pre
-crisis period (2001
-2007). Phase II is the first part of the crisis (2008
-2010), when most countries responded 
with emergency expenditure increases. Phase III is the consolidation phase (2011

eady

. Significant progress in reducing fiscal imbalances was achieved

2013. 
Phase IV

(since 2014

. Unemployment

 Pension spending 
in 
the euro area generally rose faster than potential GDP as a 
result of ageing populations
. As shown in Chart 
2, befo
re the onset of 
consolidation
, increases 
in pension expenditure as a percentage of potential GDP (Phases I and II) 
were 
particularly strong in Portugal
, Greece
, France and Finland. On the other hand, 
several countries experienced increases below the increases in their potential GDP, 
particularly during the period 2000
-2007 (Phase I). This was the case for Latvia, 
Lithuania, Austria, Slovakia, 
Germany
 and Spain i
n particular. 
During the 
consolidation 
period (Phase III)
, increases 
in pension expenditure relative to potential 
GDP 
continued in 
a majority of countries, while reductions occurred 
notably 
in Greece 
and Ireland
. However, these reductions
 were smaller than
 the increases in the years 
before.

. As illustrated in Chart 3, 
significant 
increases
 in expenditure on health as a percentage of potential GDP

rise in the health expenditure ratio at the euro area level
. Only Germany

 saw health expenditure 
growth
 slightly below that of potential GDP
. The

marked a trend
 shift, as m

experienced 
a slowdown in health

, which is of special interest since 
these reforms might have particul

 6% to 13%, becoming 
almost as large as the young

re was a general
 drop in

 Other
 components of social spending 
also 
show di
verging trends
. In particular, 
the behaviour of unemployment benefits is very het
erogeneous across time and 
countries, mainly due 
to 
its economic stabilisation function. While 
expenditure on 
unemployment benefits generally increased in the pre
-crisis period and in 
the first part 
of the crisis
 (2008
-2010), it 
has 
tended to decrease 
sinc
e 2011
. Unemployment rose 
significantly in most countries in the wake of the global financial crisis, but the rise in 
unemployment was much sharper and longer
-lasting in some countries (
e.g. 
Greece, 
Spain 
and Italy) than in others (
e.g. 
Germany 
and the Netherlands). 
Expenditure on 
sickness and disability, famil
ies
 and children
, social housing and 
combating 
social 
exclusion were on a decreasing trend before the 
crisis 
years (up to 2005), but have 
since 
increased steadily. This was in particular on acc
ount of expenditure related to 
social exclusion, such as social assistance 
for those at 
high risk of poverty 
or in difficult 
circumstances. The rest of 
this 
article focus
es on analysing the three main 
components of social spending, namely pensions, health 
and education.
 Box 1
  Social
 spending and household disposable income and consumption
 Government expenditure on social functions 
has an impact on 
household disposable income 
and consumption.
 Final consumption of households
102 is the 
total 
amount of goods and services 
bought by 
households for everyday use. It 
is the largest GDP expenditure component 
in the euro area 
(around 54
% of GDP in 201
8). A large part of the social spending of government consists of social transfers to households, 
eith
er in cash or in kind.
 Social transfers in kind can be provided in two ways: 
purchased market 
                                                                    102  Final consumption of households also includes an estimate of consumption of services provided by 
owner
-occupied dwellings

  84 production or government output
. In the former case, the government buys goods and services from 
market producers and provides them to individual households eithe
r free of charge or at reduced 
prices, such as reimbursements of healthcare costs or rent costs. In the latter case, government 
output is provided directly to the households, including transfers of a collective nature, such as health 
and education services
 financed and provided directly by the government. Costs related to social 
transfers of a collective nature include compensation of employees, consumption of fixed capital, and 
intermediate consumption of goods and services used to produce them. By convent
ion, social 
transfers in kind are part of government final consumption.
 In 2017 for euro area countries, social transfers directly targeting individual households 
range
d between 9.9% 
of GDP (
in Ireland
) and 25.8% 
of GDP (
in France
) (see Chart A).
 Social 
transfers
 are mainly paid in cash (blue bar
s in Chart A
). However, for some euro area countries (
the 
Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France)
, social transfers in kind 
purchased 
on the 
market 
(yellow 
bars)
 represent more than one fif
th of total social 
transfers
. Chart A

 Increases in social 
transfers 
in cash directly raise household gross disposable income that 
can be used either for final c
onsumption or 
for 
saving.
 Chart B shows the components of 
household disposable income as a percentage of GDP in euro area countries in 2017.
 In euro 
area countries in 2017, net social transfers in cash received by households ranged between 9% and 
22% of GD
P, of which the bulk was paid by government
103 (above 80% in most euro area countries). 
Only in the Netherlands is the share of government
-paid benefits significantly lower (around 60%), 
owing the importance of the second 
(private) 
pension pillar for the pay
ment of pension benefits (see 
Box 2).
                                                                     103  Social transfers in cash are also paid to households by financial and non
-financial
 corporations (e.g. 
second
-pillar pension benefits, sickness and disability pay and family and health benefits for their 
employees) and by non
-profit institutions serving households (NPISH).

 3 Zooming
-in on the social 
systems in the euro area
 The social systems chosen by 
euro area 
countries, 
and 
the reforms of th
ose systems, have an effect on government spending patterns and levels.
 How 
much countries spend on health or education reflects a wide spectrum of market, 
poli
tical and social factors, as well as diverse financing and organisational structures 
of their national systems. Cross
-country comparisons of government social spending 
need to be interpreted with care in view of the different social systems and models that
 exist. This section provides an overview of the different pension, healthcare, and 
education systems in the euro area and how government expenditure might be 
affected by the choice of a particular 
model.
 Pensions
 The set
-up of pension systems var
ies
 signi
ficantly across euro area countries.
 This can be attributed 
both 
to historical differences 
and to the 
different stages 
they are 
at in the 
pension system reform process. In particular, how pension systems are 
organised in
to
 public and private schemes ha
s an impact on sustai
nability risks. 
In all 
euro area countries, government
-managed pension schemes play
 an important role in 
the provision of pension benefits.
 In 2017
, 
government expenditure on old age and 
survivors
™ pensions
104 ranged
 from 15.1% 
of total gove
rnment expenditure 
in Ireland 
to 33.5% in Greece (see Chart 5
).                                                                     104  While in several countries disability pensions are part of the
 social security scheme, these data are 
excluded for comparability reasons, because in COFOG data disability benefits are reported together 
with other sickness benefits.

5 Government expenditure on pensions (2017)
 (percentage
s of total government expenditure)
  Source: Eurostat.
 Pension systems are traditionally divided into three 
pillars.
105 The first pillar 
consists of
 a mandatory public social security scheme
 based
 on the pay
-as-you-go (PAYG)
 principle
. It is usually a defined
-benefit scheme, but notional
 defined
-contribution or points systems 
also 
exist in euro area countries. 
Such 
PAYG 
schemes often include old
 age, survivors
™ and disability pensions. 
The second pillar 
includes social insurance schemes that are employment
-related and generally set up 
by employers
 for 
their
 employees
. These schemes are mainly funded, 
and can be 
either define
d-benefit 
or defined
-contribution plans. Funded and unfunded schemes 
for government employees are also included in the second pillar
. 
Voluntary private 
schemes
 make up the third pillar
, but are not part of social insurance
.106 These are 
important in 
countries where the government encourages such saving schemes by 
providing additional financial support, such as subsidies or tax incentives (e.g. 
Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Malta, Austria
, Portugal and Slovakia).
 In addition, there may be schemes aimed a
t poverty alleviation that provide 
a basic pension or social assistance independently of employment
-related 
contributions.
 These schemes are usually not part of the social insurance system, 
but the expenditure on these benefits may be included in pension e
xpenditure.
 Table 2
 summari
ses the pension schemes in euro area countries 
under the 
first 
and second pillar
s. All euro area countries have first
-pillar pension schemes 
covering large parts of the workforce. These are by far the largest source of 
government
 expenditure on old age, survivors™ and disability pensions. In most euro 
                                                                    105  Pension schemes can be classified along several dimensions. In addition to the thre
e pillars, they can be 
either unfunded, where current benefits are financed by current contributions, or funded, where current 
contributions are invested to fund future benefits. Pension schemes can also be broken down into 
defined
-benefit and defined
-cont
ribution schemes. In defined
-benefit schemes, the benefits are 
determined by a formula, either alone or with a guaranteed minimum amount payable (ESA 2010 17.57). 
In defined
-contribution schemes, the benefits are defined exclusively in terms of the level o
f the fund built 
up from the contributions and the increases in value that result from the investment of such funds (ESA 
2010 17.54).
 106  The contributions to these saving schemes are made from disposable income of households. The 
benefits paid out are not 
part of government expenditure, but rather life insurance and ann
uity 
entitlements of households. 
Life insurance and annuity entitlements consist of financial claims that life 
insurance policy holders and beneficiaries of annuities have against corporation
s providing life insurance 
(ESA

  88 area countries these schemes are defined
-benefit schemes. In three countries 
(Ireland, Greece and the Netherlands) retirement benefits are paid at a flat rate, 
irrespective of the co
ntributions or other criteria determining the level of benefits. This 
flat rate pension can be supplemented by other public or private schemes. 
A few 
countries also have notional defined
-contribution or points
 systems

 Eurostat 
published a new comprehensive and harmonised data
set
 on pension entitlements in 
social insurance at the end of 2018.
108 The new data
set
 aims to establish complete and consistent 
coverage of social insurance pension entitlements (first and second pillars) and
 to ease comparability 
across countries.
109 It 
contributes to the 
understanding of household wealth
, irrespective of how the 
national pension systems are organised. It 
also 
supplement
s information on government finances
. At 
the same time, it should be stress
ed that 
the results are 
neither
 a direct 
measure of the sustainability 
of 
unfunded pension schemes nor of countries™ overall fiscal sustainability.
110 For that purpose, the 
concept of pension entitlements needs to be extended to also include entitlements tha
t will be 
accrued in the future (implicit liabilities) as compared with future social contributions and tax 
payments (implicit assets).
111 At 
the 
European level
, the impact of pension schemes on 
the 
sustainability of public finances 
is measured in 
the 
Econom
ic Policy Committee
™s 
Ageing Report 
on the basis of 
complex estimations of future pension contributions and benefits, as well as demographic 
changes
.112 The new data
set covers pension schemes classified in the first and second pillars of the 
three
-pillar pre
sentation traditionally used for a comprehensive description of retirement
 income systems.
 It brings information on the second
-pillar pension schemes already included in 
the
 ﬁcoreﬂ national accounts framework (
ESA 2010
) together with information on unfunded government 
pension schemes and social security pensions (first pillar). Third
-pillar saving schemes are not 
included in the new 
dataset, as they are voluntary.
 Table A 
provides 
an overview of the pension schemes class
ified 
on the basis of 
a set of 
criteria.
 First, pension schemes are split into non
-general government schemes (columns A 
to C) and general government schemes (columns D to H), depending on the classification of 
the entity that retains the ultimate responsi
bility for any deficit in funding.
 The pension 
schemes are further broken down into defined
-contribution 
schemes 
(columns A and D) and 
                                                                    108  The reporting requirements are defined in Table 29 of

  Pension entitlements are recorded in this table on an accrued

 This approach
 takes into account pension benefits to be paid in the future to people who have already retired and to 
people of working age based 
only 
on the contributions they have made to date
 (contingent 
liabilities)
.113 For defined
-benefit pension schemes
, actuarial ca
lculations are needed to estimate the 
present value of the accumulated pension entitlements.
 Such calculations rely on various 
assumptions
,114 such as the discount rate, wage growth
 and
 demographic 
variables, 
which have a
n impact on the final result. The choice of these assumptions has been harmonised 
insofar as 
possible 
across all euro area countries in order to achieve better cross
-country comparability. A real discount 
rate of 3% (nominal discount rate of 5%) is used to 
estimate the present value of all future pension 
benefits to be paid (2015 is the base year for the first publication of this set of data). Wage growth is 
important because
 future pension benefits will 
generally 
be calculated as a share of 
final 
salary, 
average 
salary 
over a period
 of employment
 or lifetime earnings. 
The 
wage growth assumptions 
(reflecting productivity growth per capita) of the Ageing Working Group provide the basis for a 
harmonised approach and preserve the inevitably heterogeneous growth 
paths across euro area. 
Future life expectancy plays an equally important role, as it determines the 
average 
expected number 
of years the pension benefits 
will 
need to be paid. Eurostat™s most recent population projections
 (EUROPOP2015)

 Pension reforms in 
a majority of euro area countries 
in the last decade have 
focused on raising the retirement age.
 In several countries the retirement age is 
linked or will be linked to changes in life expectancy (e.g. in Belgium, Estonia, Greece, 
Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia and
 Finland). Table
 3 shows 
the statutory retirement age in euro area countries 
in 201
9 along with the early 
retirement age and average effective age of retirement, which takes into account 
people retiring early or late. In several euro area countries the ret
irement age is 
different for men and women, but there is a trend towards equalising them in future in 
most countries.
 Incentives 
for 
retiring earl
ier
 or late
r than 
the statutory retirement age 
influence
 the effective age of retirement.
 Some countries allow early retirement with full 
benefits once a sufficient number of years of contributions have been accumulated. In 
over half of euro area countries, however, early retirement results in reduced pension 
benefits, while there may be addit
ional benefits for deferring retirement beyond the 
normal retirement age. The average effective age of retirement is below the statutory 
retirement age in most countries, indicating that early retirement schemes are widely 
used.
 In addition to increases in
 the retirement age linked to life expectancy, there 
may be additional, sometimes automatic, sustainability measures built into the 
pension systems
. Many countries apply formulae that closely link pension 
entitlements to the contributory career. The aggreg
ate replacement ratios
118 in Table 3 
show that the pension income from all three pension pillars replaces between 33% of 
working age income (in Ireland) and 86% (in Luxembourg). In Ireland and the 
                                                                    118  The ratio of income replacement from pension benefits show
s how much of the income earned by 
a working person in the pre
-retirement years is replaced by pension benefits
. The replacement ratio is 
above 60% in Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal and Slovakia.

rules applied 
may

age pension expenditure in total government expenditure (see Chart 5 above).

the rest of the countries, the levels of pension benefits depend on the length of career

The r

 In addition, the evolution of the benefit ratios during retirement is determined 
by the indexation rules.
 Most
 euro area countries apply indexation to pension 
benefits. This is linked to price, wage or GDP increases or a combination thereof. On 
the other hand, there are sustainability mechanisms to reduce pension benefits based 
on life expectancy at the time of retirement or on the ratio of contributions to pensions

 This
 implies that the
 benefit is provided only if the 
person™s 
income or wealth is below 
a certain threshold.
 Min

in Spain
 (12%, see Chart 6), followed by Ireland and the
 Netherlands (both above 8%). 
On the other hand, in several countries there is no means

(Estonia, Latvia and 
Finland) 
or very little paid out after means
-testing (Luxembourg, Lithuania and 
Germany). However, most means
-tested expenditure is related
 to benefits linked to 
social exclusion, such as social assistance payments, which are also paid beyond 
retirement age.

 Healthcare expenditure 
is 
shared between government and households in 
different proportions, dependin
g on the healthcare financing schemes in the 
different 
countries.
 Direct government financing is more common in countries where 
there is universal healthcare funded by the government. This means that health 
services are provided and paid for directly by th
e government, with hospitals managed 
by the government (whether owned or rented) and medical staff paid by the 
government. In other countries financing may be provided 
mainly 
through mandatory 
health insurance, where the government is not the direct provid
er of the healthcare 
services and instead buys them from private providers. Both direct government 
financing and mandatory health insurance are usually part of government expenditure. 
Government expenditure may also be complemented by private health insura
nce 
arrangements and payments directly from households (out
-of-pocket expenses).
 In 2016 d
irect government financing and mandatory health insurance 
accounted for 
over 50% of 
total 
health expenditure in all euro area countries
 except Cyprus (42%)
.121 In about half of all euro area countries, the main financing of 
health expenditure was through mandatory health insurance, as shown in Chart 8 
(Germany, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Belgium, Estonia, 
Austria, Slovenia and Lithuania). How
ever, in Finland, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, 
Malta and Latvia, direct government financing made up the majority of the health 
expenditure. In Greece, health financing is broadly divided among government 
financing, mandatory insurance and out
-of-pocke
t expenses of households, while in 
Cyprus it is almost equally divided between direct government financing and 
out-of-pocket expenses of households. In four countries 
Œ Malta, Greece, Latvia and 
Cyprus 
Œ out-of-pocket expenses of households cover over one
-third of health 
spending. In Slovenia and Ireland, voluntary health insurance finances over 10% of 
total health expenditure.

 Chart 9 shows the expenditure categories for government health 
expenditure for three groups of euro area countries 
Œ one group mainly directly 
government financed and two
 groups with mandatory health insurance financing. For 
the countries where health expenditure is predominantly directly financed by 
government (Ireland, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, Portugal and Finland), the 
share of compensation of employees in t
otal health expenditure is quite high, ranging 
from 30% to 55%. At the same time, the share of intermediate consumption spending, 
i.e. expenditure related to purchases of goods and services used in the production of 
final health services, is also significa
nt (20%
-37%). Social transfers related to health 
expenditure that are predominantly provided in kind 
(reimbursements of purchases of 
medical goods and services) 
are relatively low in these countries.

 Not
e: The chart is divided into three sections: Direct government financing (
health expenditure is predominantly directly financed by 
government); Mandatory insurance I (
hospitals are not part of the government 
sector); Mandatory insurance II (
public hospitals are
 part 
of the government sector).
 The countries where the government health expenditure is financed mainly 
through mandatory health insurance can be distinguished 
according to whether 
public hospitals are recorded as part of the government sector for statistical 
purposes.
 The first group (Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) have 
a very low percentage of expenditure on compensation of employees (3%
-6%) 
and 
intermediate consumption (2%
-3%). These numbers are explained by the fact that 
hospitals, including public hospitals, are regarded as market producers, providing their 
services on a commercial basis. Therefore, their expenditure is not part of governme
nt expenditure on health. The largest part of the expenditure (over 70%) is in the form of 
social transfers in kind, composed of reimbursements and payments from health 
insurance companies for medical goods and services provided to households. In the 
secon
d group of countries that finance government health expenditure mainly through 
mandatory health insurance (Estonia, Greece, France, Lithuania, Austria, Slovenia and 
Slovakia), the structure of health expenditure is different, as the public hospitals are pa
rt 
of the government sector. Thus the shares of compensation of employees (16%
-40%) 
and intermediate consumption (11%
-28%) in total health expenditure are higher than for 
the first group and social transfers in kind are generally lower. An exception is Slo
vakia, 
where social transfers in kind are above 70%.
 Going forward, 
healthcare reforms
 may affect w
ages of medical
 and non

personnel, prices of

 and capital investment
, and there may be 
legislated
 changes in targets for future healthca

Cyprus (see Chart 10
). The bulk of expenditure is on pre
-primary, primary and 
secondary education, with less spent on tertiary education. This is associated with 
nearly full enrolment rates in primary and secondary education, due to compulsory 
education. But even at pre
-primary
 level (age four and above) enrolment rates in all 
euro area countries are close to or above 80%.
123 In Finland and the Netherlands 
expenditure on tertiary education is above 3% of total government expenditure.

 4 Conclusions
 The composition 
and levels 
of social spending var
y significantly across 
countries
. The trends identified at the euro area level are heterogeneous at national 
level, reflecting differences in starting positions and societal preferences.
 Overall, 
countries 
have 
not converge
d in 
terms of the 
architecture 
of 
their social systems 
over 
the la
st decade. 
Cross
-country comparisons confirm 
that to 
secur
e fiscal sustainability
 in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, while balancing economic stabilisation and 
equity objectives
, countries need to pursue differentiated fiscal policies commensurate
 with the architecture of their social system
. The policy guidance 
contained in the
 CSRs 
issued annually under the European Semester 
is also
 relevant in this context. The 
CSRs highlight 
the 
tailored reform
s needed to tackle the key challenges 
in 
each 
Membe
r State in the next 12
-18 months.
 Changes in euro area public expenditure since 2001 illustrate the risks that 
fiscal vulnerabilities 
pose to 
the sustainability of growth
-friendly expenditure 
policies.
 Pension
 expenditure is at a historical peak in several
 Member States and 
will 
grow further in many countries in the absence of reforms
. The ageing impact will peak 
when the baby

has 
retired
, which will be around 2040
 in 
some 
euro area countries
, but later in others

Countries with public PAY

 systems
 will be particularly strongly affected, posing
 questions regarding intergenerational 
fairness
, as the ratio of contributors to beneficiaries is shrinking and recent estimates 
of accrued

-date liabilities 
in 
social security amount to 
more than 200% of GDP in 
most countries. Moreover, ageing is expected to lead to an increase in health 
expenditure and a decline in labour supply, growth and innovation, while precautionary 
savings are pote
ntially rising.
 Many countries need to build fisca

previous sustainability

undertake further reforms as needed to strengthen their national arrangements.
 This is particularly relevant 
in view of 
the fiscal

CSRs for countries with already high government debt ratios and only limited fiscal 
space. Particular attention should be devoted to ensuring 
there are 
sufficient

, as such spending has been shown to ha
ve positive effects on 
long

action will be needed 
to make 
health systems more 
efficient
. Recommendations also 
call for further 
improvement in 
the targeting and 
efficient use 
of r

 in the CSRs.

warrant continuous monitoring 
Œ these risks could affect the stability and efficiency of 
the financial system and the 
economy

risk spillover. Third, the article discusses how, and to what extent, publicly available 
data allow the identified monitoring needs to be met and, by providing some examples 
of indicators on market dev

availability and reliability of data. Finally, it covers selected statistical initiatives that 
attempt to overcome outstanding challenges.
 1 Introduction
 The ECB has been analysing the crypto
-asset phenomenon with a view to 
identify
ing
 and monitor
ing
 potential implications for monetary policy and the 
risks crypto
-assets may 
pose to
 the smoo
th functioning of market 
infrastru
ctures and payments, as well as for the stability of the financial 
system
.124 This task begins with the development of a monitoring framework to 
provide the data and insights that are necessary to continually gauge
 the 
extent and 
materiality of 
evolving crypto
-asset
 risks 
with a view to ensuring preparedness 
for any 
adverse scenari
os. For its monitoring activities, the ECB relies to a great extent on
 publicly 
available third
-party aggregated data
. A great deal of aggregated information is 
available on public websites, which can provide
, for instance,
 metrics for 
crypto
-asset
 networks, estimates of market capitalisation, prices and trading volumes on 
crypto
-exchanges and 
the amount of 
funds 
raised
 when a crypto
-asset is offered to the 
public 
in ﬁinitial coin offeringsﬂ
 (ICOs
). These sources differ with regard to the 
methodolog
ies 
they 
use, the completeness of 
data 
coverage and access to the 
underlying raw information, 
to name but a few areas
. Processing the underlying raw 
information (when available) 
brings
 with 
it considerable 
uncertainty
 about data 
availability and quality
 owing, in part, to a lack of 
regulation 
of some players
 along the 
crypto
-asset value chain, wh
ose
 unsupervised
 activity
 in a borderless environment 
often hinder
s access to reliable information. 
Statistics and supervisory
 reporting 
mechanisms do not generally
 cover crypto
-assets (e.g. 
the 
exposures of supervised 
institutions
 to these assets
).                                                                     124  In 
2018 the ECB established the Internal Crypto
-Assets Task Force (ICA
-TF), with a mandate to deepen 
the analysis of crypto
-assets. For a summary of the outcome of the ICA
-TF™s analysis, see

 Understanding the crypto
-asset phenomenon, its risks and measurement iss
ues  101 Build
ing
 a crypto
-asset monitoring framework on this basis requires caution 
on 
account of the data issues, and a stepwise approach to filling gaps
. First, 
it is 
important
 to identify monitoring needs based on an accurate characterisation of 
crypto
-assets that allows the scope to be clearly defined. On this basis, once the 
relevant data sources have been identified, data can be collected and quality checks 
applied to ensure
 data 
quality and the consistency of
 methodologie
s and definitions. 
Whenever possible, the ECB complements aggregated data with granular 
breakdowns 
to enable the calculation of customised indicators. 
Nevertheless, 
important gaps remain unaddressed in the c
urrent framework, such as data on 
financial institutions™ exposures. Further work is also needed to extract relevant 
insights from the public networks
. This article is organised a
s follows
. Section 2 
describes the characteristics of 
the 
crypto
-asset
 phenomenon,
 in order 
to 
arrive at a 
clear defin
ition of
 the scope of
 monitoring activities. Based on this characterisation, Section 3 aims to identify
 the 
relevant crypto
-asset risks and the economic connections, ﬁgatewayﬂ functions and 
other channels 
thr
ough which
 these risks 
may
 spread to
 the financial system and the 
broader e
conomy. Section 4 
discusses
 the indicators for monitoring crypto
-assets, 
based on 
publicly available data
, 
the availability and reliability of data
 (including 
examples based on sele
cted indicators for monitoring market developments), data 
gaps and ongoing 
statistical initiatives that attempt to o
vercome outstanding 
challenges. Finally, the article offers a number of conclusions and points to the way 
forward for monitoring crypto
-asse
ts.
 2 Characterising elements of crypto
-assets
 The phenomenon of crypto
-assets can be defined and analysed from different 
perspectives
, namely the
ir
 underlying technology
, the
ir
 features and 
the 
economic implications 
that 
such assets
125 may have
. Whereas the
 use of 
cryptography is implicit in the c
hoice of the term ﬁ
crypto
ﬂ-asset
, 
traditional assets such 
as money and financial instruments can also be recorded by means of 
the
 same
 technology 
Œ typically distributed ledger technology (DLT). Therefore, DLT is no
t a 
factor in differentiating the new phenomenon from other assets that are recorded 
digitally via more traditional technologies. Moreover, the issuer of any digitally 
recorded asset is, in principle, free to change the technology used for its recording. 
This implies that the use of DLT as a defining element of crypto
-assets would hamper 
the comparability of data over time and limits its informational content
. To ensure 
the 
consistency of its analysis
 over time and across technologies
, 
the ECB has chosen to
 define crypto
-assets
126 as ﬁa new type of asset 
recorded in digital form and enabled by the use of cryptography that 
is not and 
does not represent a 
financial 
claim on, or a liability of, any identifiable entity.ﬂ
 The
 focus is therefore on the regulatory, economic and business dimension of 
                                                                    125  In this article the ter
m ﬁassetﬂ is used to refer to something of value to some market participants. It is not 
used in a legal or accounting sense.

 Understanding the crypto
-asset phenomenon, its risks and measurement issues
  102 crypto
-assets as a new asset class, rather than on the use of technologies that are 
currently needed for its existence
 but 
are 
not specific to it. The fact that a crypto
-asset 
does n
ot constitute a claim on any identifiable entity means that its value is supported 
only by the expectation that other users will be willing to pay for it in the future, rather 
than by a future cash flow on which users can form their expectations.
 The main 
characterising element of a crypto
-asset is that it is not a claim on 
either an issuer or a custodian.
 However, its users attach value to it because they 
believe
 that
: i) its supply will remain limited, and ii) market participants will agree on 
who is enti
tled to sell any of the units in circulation.
 Scarcity of a crypto
-asset and the 
possibility to prove who can dispose of each of its units allow the existence of a 
crypto
-asset market, where 
users on the supply side
 can offer their units for sale and 
users
 on the 
demand side are willing to bid.
 A trusted bookkeeper 
would norma
lly support such beliefs by keeping a central 
record of 
how many
 units of an 
asset have been issued and 
who holds them at 
any point in time
. Market participants 
might
 try to sell units
 they do not own or to sell 
units they own
 a number of
 times. That can be difficult when dealing with physical 
goods, wh
ose counterfeiting
 requires
 specific skills and physical resources and can 
typically be vetted by experts
, who can 
differentiat
e a dupli
cate from 
a genuine asset. 
When an asset is in digital form, counterfeiting is
 as easy 
and as 
cheap as copy
ing
 and past
ing
. For this reason, in the case of assets in digital form, a trusted central party is 
usually tasked with controlling the number of uni
ts (notary function) and is responsible 
for
 keeping track of
 who owns what (bookkeeping function).
 Cryptographic techniques are used 
to replace the trusted bookkeeper in the 
recording of crypto
-assets, 
with a view to
: i)
 rul
ing
 out any unexpected increase 
in
 crypto
-assets 
issued on a distributed ledger,
 and
 ii) getting
 the network of 
users to agree on who owns what
 (further eliminating the
 need for a trusted 
bookkeeper
). A distributed ledger is essentially a record of information
 Œ or database
 Œ that
 is sha
red across a network of users, 
eliminating the need
 for a central party to 
deal with the validation process. The key innovation brought by DLT is 
the ability to 
distribute
 the validation of
 the recording of
 new 
assets, 
and 
of their subsequent 
transfer,
 among
 a set of users who do not necessarily trust 
one another and may have 
conflicting incentives. The network of users can be unrestricted and 
can 
allow 
anybody to take part in validation
, with no 
proof of identity required
, as is typically the 
case for c
rypto
-assets. Validation requires a voting process among DLT network 
users, whose 
individual 
vot
ing power
 depends on the specific protocol used
 and should prevent
 the formation of coalitions able to take 
control of
 the network.
 In the case of unrestricted
 DLT networks
, which are generally 
used for 
recording
 crypto
-assets
, there is no clear governance.
 In fact, distributed 
validation is typically the only governance tool available to agree on who owns 
what number of units. That hinders the usability of the c
rypto
-asset.
 To the 
extent that the validation
 mechanism aims to prevent
 a single user (or 
a relatively 
small coalition 
of users
) from
 being 
able to modify the content and functioning of a 
distributed ledger, 
coordinating
 any change is difficult. Even when
 a sufficient number 
of users agree 
to
 update the
 protocol
 used
, other users are free to decide whether to 
accept the new rules or continue with the old ones.

  103 emerge
, whereby two sets of users 
rely on different sets of 
information on individual 
holdings and may never reconcile their views
. Any asset in digital form can be recorded by means of DLT, without necessarily 
differing from its non
-DLT equivalents in terms of economic impact and 
legal 
nature 
Œ hence the same 
regu
lation
 could potentially apply
. Recording an asset 
on a distributed ledger does not change its
 economic
 characteristics 
or the set of 
attached risks that warrant scrutiny by regulators
. 
Assets
 that 
constitute a claim on an 
identifiable entity do not fall u
nder the definition and analysis of crypto
-assets 
in this 
paper, regardless of the technology used for their bookkeeping
. 
This
 paper does not 
therefore 
cover 
private 
financial assets such as financial instruments and funds in the 
form of electronic money, 
or 
commercial bank money
. Neither does it cover 
central 
bank 
money in the form of banks™ 
reserves
, cash
, or the widely researched but yet 
theoretical concept of a central bank digital currency
. 3 Crypto
-asset risks and linkages that warrant monitoring
 The financial system may 
be subject to
 risks from crypto
-assets to the extent 
that 
both
 are interconnected
; spillover effects may also be transmitted
 to the 
real economy.
 In particular, crypto
-assets may have implications for financial stability 
and interf
ere with the functioning of payments and market infrastructures, as well as 
implications for monetary policy. ECB analysis
127 shows
 that, while these risks are 
currently contained and/or manageable within the existing regulatory and oversight 
framework
s, lin
ks with the regulated financial sector may 
develop and 
increase over 
time and 
have
 future implications. The discharge of 
the 
Eurosystem™s responsibilities, 
namely to define and impleme
nt monetary policy and to promot
e the smooth operation 
of payment systems, as well as 
the 
Eurosystem™s
 tasks in the areas of banking 
supervision and financial stability, may be affected. 
Accordingly, the analysis 
concludes
 that the ECB should continue monitoring crypto
-assets, raise aware
ness 
of their risks and develop preparedness for any future adverse scenario. This 
section 
aims to
: i) provide an overview of risks stemming from crypto
-assets
, and ii) identify 
the main connections that may facilitate the transmission of these risks to th
e financial 
system and the economy, with a view to informing and calibrating monitoring efforts
. Crypto
-asset risks 
primarily 
originate from: i) the lack of an 
underlying claim,
 ii) 
their (partially) unregulated nature
, and 
iii) the absence of
 a formal gov
ernance 
structure.
 i) 
Since crypto
-assets have no underlying claim, such as the right to a future cash flow 
or to discharge any payment obligation, they lack fundamental value. This makes their 
valuation difficult and subject to speculation. As a result, c
rypto
-assets may 
experience extreme price movements (volatility risk), thereby exposing their holders to 
potentially large losses. Depending on the circumstances of a possible price crash, the 
effects may be passed on to the creditors of the holders (if th
e positions involve 
leverage) and other entities.
                                                                     127  See

 issues
  104 ii) 
Crypto
-assets
, as defined in this article, can hardly fulfil the characteristics of 
payment and financial instruments
128 and, as such, fall outside the scope of current 
regulation.
129 Given that they are un
regulated, their holders do not benefit from the 
legal protection associated with regulated instruments. For instance, in the event of 
bankruptcy or hacking of a crypto
-asset service provider that controls access to 
customers™ holdings of crypto
-assets (e.
g. custodian wallet providers), the holdings 
would neither be subject to preventive measures (e.g. safeguarding and segregation) 
nor benefit from schemes or other arrangements to cover any losses incurred. In view 
of the current state of law, there is limi
ted scope for public authorities to regulate 
crypto
-assets.
130 Any such intervention may be further complicated by the lack of 
governance and distributed architecture of crypto
-assets (see below), as well as their 
cross
-border dimension.
 iii) 
As the use of D
LT allows crypto
-assets to dispense with an accountable party, the 
roles and responsibilities for identifying, mitigating and managing the risks borne in the 
crypto
-asset network cannot be (clearly) allocated. From this characteristic derive, 
among others,
 heightened money laundering and terrorist financing risks, to the extent 
that there is no central oversight body responsible for monitoring and identifying 
suspicious transaction patterns, nor can law enforcement agencies target one central 
location or en
tity (administrator) for investigative purposes or asset seizure.
131 In view 
of the lack of formalised governance, it may also be difficult to address operational 
risks, including cyber security risks, and the risk of fraud. In fact, in the broader 
crypto
-asset ecosystem, the provision of certain services (e.g. trading) is often 
centralised. In such cases, the service providers can be identified and held 
accountable. However, this is not always possible in decentralised models, which 
minimise or do away with 
the role of intermediaries.
 The extent to which the financial system and the economy may be exposed to 
crypto
-asset risks depends on their interconnectedness.
 In particular, i) 
holdings of crypto
-assets, ii) investment vehicles, and iii) retail payments 
represent the main linkages between the crypto
-asset market on the one hand 
and the financial systems and the broader economy on the other hand.
                                                                     128  In its ﬁ
Report with advice to the European Commission o
n crypto
-assets
ﬂ (January 2019), the European 
Banking Authority (EBA) states that, to qualify as e
-money, assets must satisfy the definition of 
electronic 
money
 as set out in the 
second Electronic Money Directive (
Section 2.1.1
). In particular, the assets 
must 
represent a claim on the issuer (thereby excluding crypto
-assets as defined in this article). In parallel, the 
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) considers
 that assets like bitcoin are unlikely to 
qualify as financial instruments (see ES
MA™s ﬁ

Individuals and financial institutions
, including credit institutions/investment 
firms, payment institutions a
nd e
-money institutions, are not prohibited by EU 
law from holding or investing in crypto
-assets.
132 Crypto
-assets can be accessed 
by anyone with an internet connection, with no need to open an account with a 
crypto
-asset service provider. Financial institutions may invest in crypto
-assets and/or 
engage in trading and market making activities. Credit ins
titutions may also provide 
credit to clients to acquire crypto
-assets or loans collateralised with crypto
-assets, as 
well as lend to entities that deal with crypto
-assets. Moreover, financial institutions can 
provide other crypto
-asset
-related services (e.
g. custody services) that may result in 
enhancing the accessibility and fostering the use of crypto
-assets, thereby 
incentivising crypto
-asset holdings and investments. These activities may be 
motivated, among other things, by financial institutions™ inter
est in applications relying 
on DLT.
 ii) 
Derivatives and i
nvestment vehicles connect investors with the crypto
-asset 
market without them having to hold crypto
-assets directly.
 Investment vehicles 
include exchange
-traded products (ETPs) and contracts for dif
ference (CFDs) that 
track crypto
-asset prices. In addition, ICOs 
Œ a largely unregulated way for firms to 
raise capital by generating new crypto
-assets in a way similar to initial public offerings 
Œ have started to raise interest among investors since 2017
, motivated by high returns 
on investment. It should be noted, though, that these ﬁcoinsﬂ may vary significantly in 
terms of their characteristics and functions: for instance, they may offer forms of 
investment in a company that may be linked to securities
, or merely grant access to 
(future) products/services offered by the issuer. Suffice it to say, for our purposes, that 
these ﬁcoinsﬂ may not qualify as crypto
-assets as defined in Section 2, to the extent 
that they have an issuer.
 iii) 
Under certain circu
mstances, crypto
-assets may be used for retail 
payments.
 Use cases range from merchant payments, international remittances and 
business
-to
-business (B2B) cross
-border payments, to micro
-payments and 
machine
-to
-machine (M2M) payments,
133 and may be driven by 
DLT
-driven efficiency 
gains as these segments are generally characterised by complexities and high costs. 
It should be noted that, while holders of crypto
-assets can transfer crypto
-asset units 
without an intermediary by accessing directly the decentralise
d crypto
-asset network, 
user convenience has led to the emergence of service providers that facilitate the use 
of crypto
-assets for payments, e.g. by handling payments on behalf of merchants that 
accept crypto
-assets and by reducing their exposure to price
 volatility. Often, though, 
end-users still make and/or receive payments in national currency(ies) and are not 
required to hold crypto
-asset balances, whereas the role of crypto
-assets is limited to 
enabling a back
-end channel for the transaction, particul
arly in cross
-border 
payments.

. Other functions (e

crypto
-assets
135 in exchange for either fiat currencies or other crypto
-assets.
 Trading platforms may differ 
in their 
business models and 
the 
services 
they 
provide. 
Some trading platforms may publi
sh market quotes based on their clients™ trading 
activity and
, by doing so
, facilitate price formation. Trading platforms may also be 
distinguished based on whether or not they hold crypto
-assets on behalf of their 
clients, and execute trades on their book
s as opposed to the DLT network(s). Some 
centralised platforms may provide custody services beyond what is needed to 
execute/settle a trade, in which case they also act as custodian wallet providers (see 
below) on a permanent basis.
 Custodian wallet provid
ers allow 
the storage of
 cryptographic keys that are 
used to sign crypto
-asset transactions.
 The involvement of a custodian wallet 
provider is generally requested by crypto
-asset investors because of its convenience 
and on the premise
 that cryptographic ke
ys will be stolen less easily than from a 
personal device. Custodian wallets can be either hosted online (also called ﬁhot 
walletsﬂ
, entailing
 the 
storage of keys on a device that is connected to the internet 
that 
allow
s the initialisation of transactions 
at any time) or offline (also called ﬁcold walletsﬂ
, entailing
 the 
storage of keys with 
no connection to the internet until the user needs to 
authorise a transaction). Hot wallets are vulnerable to hacking via the internet. Cold 
wallets, on the other hand, are less convenient to use frequently but are protected 
from hackers and can also be kept
 in devices that 
can be
 physically locked in vaults. In 
some cases, the custodian directly holds the crypto
-asset units via its cryptographic 
key on behalf of the investor.

137 The 
European Banking 
Authority (EBA) also foresees the development of a 
monitoring template that competent authorities can issue to financial institutions 
to identify and measure the level and type of crypto
-asset activity.
138  In an extreme scenario, if euro 
cash and electronic 
payment instruments 
hypothetically gave way to crypto
-assets for retail payment transactions,
 there 
could be significant 
implications for monetary policy and economic activity.
139 However, given the characteristics of the crypto
-asset phenomenon, particularl
y high price volatility, it is difficult to envisage crypto
-assets fulfilling the role of a 
monetary asset in the near future. Having said that, new developments aiming to 
mitigate volatility risks (i.e. ﬁstablecoinsﬂ) may prove more attractive or suitable
 for payment use cases.
  Finally, 
financial market infrastructures (FMIs), particularly payment systems, 
securities settlement systems and central counterparties, carry the risks of 
crypto
-assets and may act as channels for the transmission of these risks 
through the financial system. First, financial market infrastructures may be 
exposed to risks from their participants™ crypto
-asset activities to the extent that 
adverse crypto
-asset market conditions or other adverse events may 
compromise participants™ abi
lity to meet their obligations. In this case, 
crypto
-asset market
-based shocks could be passed from one participant or 
infrastructure to another/others. Second, financial market infrastructures may 
pose risks if they clear crypto
-asset
-based products or us
e crypto
-assets for 
settlement, collateral or investment. As it currently stands, European law 
effectively limits the usage of crypto
-assets as settlement assets in financial 
market infrastructures and sets requirements for collateral or investments that 
crypto
-assets do not currently meet.
140 Moreover, for EU central counterparties 
to clear crypto
-asset products, they would need to obtain authorisation from their 
national authorities subject to demonstrating how risk management requirements 
were to be fulfil
led in the light of the specific characteristics to be addressed.

 Understanding the crypto
-asset phenomenon, its risks and measurement issues
  108 4 Current i
ssues 
in measuring the crypto
-asset phenomenon
 To properly assess crypto
-asset risks and their potential impact on the financial 
system and the economy, it is necessary to complem
ent the qualitative analysis 
on the linkages described (see Section 3) with quantitative information.
 On the 
one hand, the public nature of crypto
-asset DLT networks generally ensures 
transparency, i.e. transaction data are open for the public to see and v
erify. On the 
other hand, the decentralised and (partially) unregulated nature of crypto
-asset 
activities makes it difficult to obtain specific data (e.g. the number of individual users) 
and to organise systematic data collection efforts. In this context, 
public websites that 
track crypto
-asset prices only provide a rough indication of market trends. Overall, 
available data on crypto
-assets are neither complete nor fully reliable for the purposes 
of monitoring market trends to the degree of detail necessary
 to gauge their risks. 
Moreover, they only allow the monitoring of global trends with very limited country 
segregation. This section will discuss the current shortcomings in data collection and 
analysis, providing concrete examples, and will propose possib
le options to overcome 
major constraints.
 4.1
 Stepwise approach to the monitoring framework of 
crypto
-assets
 Publicly available aggregated data already provide some tools for measuring 
crypto
-asset risks and their linkages with the regulated financial syst
em.
 These 
data, subject to passing quality checks and being complemented with other data from 
commercial sources, provided the basis of a crypto
-asset dataset as the first step in 
the ECB approach to monitoring this phenomenon.
 Using
 application 
programming 
interface
s (APIs
)141 and big data technologies
, it has been possible 
to create an 
automated set of procedures for collecting, handling and integrating several data 
collections with 
a view to deriv
ing
 customised indicators. 
The ECB collected d
ata f
rom 
publicly available and commercial data providers consider
ing 
available 
documentation, coverage 
and the availability of very granular aggregates or raw data. 
The granularity of data
, coupled with applied data quality control measures
, enable
d the calcul
ation of customised and methodologically consistent indicators. Preparing 
consistent indicators require
d the development
 of mappings and 
the 
harmonisation of 
information
.142 Crypto
-asset indicators 
tailored to this monitoring exercise have been grouped
 in fo
ur categories covering 
i) markets, ii) gatekeepers, 
iii) linkages
, and 
iv) 
ICOs
.                                                                     141  APIs enable users to access data providers™ 
databases
 by mean
s of an automated set of queries 
provided via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP 
Œ the protocol underlying internet websites) and return 
data.
 142  For example, the calculation of the market capitalisation
 required to cross
-map and harmonise identifiers 
and n
aming conventions for crypto
-assets as data from 
different providers needed to be 
integrated
 in 
order to use circulating supply as a preferred component for this indicator
. Harmonisation of units also 
added an extra layer of complexity
, as it required 
synt
hetic exchange rates to be calculated for all 
crypto
-assets covered in the dataset.

  109 i) 
Market indicators cover pricing and trading information, including derivatives 
markets. The monitoring tool allows selecting any crypto
-asset or a group of 
crypto
-assets fr
om a pool of over 2,000 assets currently traded and constructing 
indicators on prices, traded volumes and market capitalisation in selected units of fiat 
or crypto
-assets. Furthermore, it includes indicators focusing on trading vis
-à-vis fiat 
currencies. W
ith respect to derivatives, the indicators offer a detailed overview of 
bitcoin futures contracts traded on the institutionalised exchanges of the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
 ii) 
The indicators on gateke
epers cover trading platforms and wallets, as well include 
some information on payments. The indicators on trading platforms show trading 
volumes and pricing by selected platform or a set of platforms grouped according to 
their country of incorporation, fe
es option, centralisation or decentralisation feature 
and other factors. Additionally, indicators on arbitrage have been developed. With 
respect to wallets, information on the classification of wallets by type, supported 
crypto
-assets and security features
 are collected. The payment segment contains 
indicators on the number and locations of ATMs supporting crypto
-assets, which are 
those that enable the user to buy and sell a particular crypto
-asset against fiat 
currencies. Moreover, some information on card
s supporting crypto
-assets is 
included. Such cards enable payment in fiat currencies using crypto
-assets as a 
deposit. Furthermore, some indicators based on on
-chain transactions are provided.
 iii) 
An important category of indicators aims to cover to the e
xtent possible the linkages 
of the crypto
-asset markets with the financial systems and the real sector of the 
economy. The indicators from this category cover for example ETPs offering 
exposures to crypto
-assets and indicators based on statistics 
on holdin
gs of
 securities
143. iv) 
The final part concerns the indicators for ICOs, i.e. amount of funds raised and 
features, e.g. their legal form, the underlying blockchain and the country of 
incorporation.
 However, there are still important gaps in the data, 
particularly relating to 
certain i
nterlinkages 
and to 
payment transactions
, including the use of
 layered 
protocols
 (see Section 4.2)
. First, a major data gap exists with respect to the 
interlinkages 
with
 the 
real and financial sector
s, including 
the 
amount
 of banks™ or 
financial corporations™ direct holdings of crypto
-assets
 and
 information on lending for 
purposes of investing in crypto
-assets. Another area concerns transactions with cards 
supporting crypto
-assets, sales of merchants accepting crypto
-assets
 and the 
value of 
withdrawal transactions from crypto
-asset ATMs. Finally, 
an analysis of 
the information 
on transactions using layered protocols is 
required to capture the actual extent of the 
use of crypto
-asset DLT networks for settlements
. The dataset 
for the crypto
-asset 
monitoring framework is
, by definition
, a constantly evolving product
, as it has to keep 
up with changing monitoring needs, reflecting rapid changes in the market, whil
e remaining proportionate to the potential risks pos
ed by the crypt
o-asset market.
                                                                     143  See

 As a second step in the development of a monitoring framework for 
crypto
-assets, it is envisaged that major data gaps should be closed.
 Overall
, 
the first step in the data processing cycle has been completed
, paving the way for the 
next ste
ps covering further work on indicators and data
, which would close the 
identified data gaps. 
Actions derived from
 feedback from this data processing cycle 
are
 expected to enhance the data and analytical infrastructure. Work will continue 
to
 further 
develop
 the indicators based on the granular data from trading platforms, 
blockchains and official data collections and statistics on the crypto
-asset market, 
consistent with the monitoring needs and proportionate to the potential risks posed by 
this market.
 4.2
 Availability and reliability of data on on
-chain, off
-chain and 
layered protocol transactions
 To assess the availability and reliability of data on crypto
-assets, it is important 
to 
differentiat
e between
 ﬁon-chain
ﬂ and 
ﬁoff
-chain
ﬂ crypto
-asset transactions
. On-chain crypto
-asset transactions are those recorded directly on a distributed ledger. 
Off
-chain transactions are recorded either on the book of an institution, for instance in 
the case of trading platforms, or in a private network of users 
that
 use the
 distributed 
ledger of a crypto
-asset to record the net transactions among participants only at a 
later stage.
 On-chain transactions
 Information concerning on
-chain data is often publicly available, although it
s analysis 
can be complex
. Most DLT protocols differ from the record
-keeping 
that is 
typical of financial accounts systems
, where an amount of an asset is
 transferred
 by reduc
ing 
the sender™s account 
by that precise amount 
and 
by crediting it to
 the 
receiver™s account
. Crypto
-asset
s are usually transferred
 in a way
 similar to
 that 
of cash
 transactions:
 when a user receives a 
quantity
 of crypto
-assets, those units are 
not divisible and have to be sent 
all 
together in 
a future
 transaction
.144 Therefore, 
a sender needs to specify what pa
rt of 
the crypto
-asset
 units 
jointly obtained in a 
previous transaction 
should 
be transferred
 to the receiver(s) and what part 
should 
come back as
 ﬁchange
ﬂ. Identify
ing
 the value of a crypto
-asset transaction and 
whether different 
crypto
-asset wallets belo
ng to the same individual 
(or institution
) is 
currently a 
difficult
 task.
 However, it is likely to become even more challenging in the future. 
Chang
e can either be allocated
 to the 
same 
wallet 
from which the transaction 
originated 
or 
be routed to 
another w
allet control
led
 by the 
sender.
145 A number of 
initiatives are being developed by the community of crypto
-asset users to make 
                                                                    144  These indivisible units are sometimes called ﬁunspent transaction outputsﬂ (UTXOs).
 145  Understanding which part of the outputs of a transaction is the intended transfer and which constitutes 
change to the sender is not t
rivial. See

 Understanding the crypto

  111 identification of these transactions more difficult. Such initiatives include the possibility 
of a number of senders combining their
 crypto
-asset transactions
.146 On-chain data 
recorded
 on the distributed ledger 
of 
a crypto
-asset can refer to 
transactions in 
other assets
, which
 are recorded and transferred by means of 
an associated 
layered protocol
. While
 the
 distributed ledger
 is typica
lly used to 
record only one 
ﬁnative
ﬂ crypto
-asset, 
its transactions can be used to record free
-form 
text. Concretely, this text can contain the confirmation that 
other assets
 have been 
transferred
 using a distinct protocol.
147 Since a superficial analysis of
 the on
-chain 
transaction would only disclose a negligible transaction in the native crypto
-asset, one 
needs to interpret the transaction knowing the details of the layered protocol in order to 
conclude that possibly a sizeable transaction has occurred in 
the second asset.
 Off
-chain transactions
 Various methodological choices are applied in constructing and supplying the 
very rudimentary information of the price and market capitalisation of a 
crypto
-asset.
 In general terms, the aggregated price information 
of a crypto
-asset is 
determined
, among other things,
 by the selection of trading platforms, the underlying 
trading volumes, conventions concerning the 24
-hour close
-of-business time, factors 
to address low liquidity levels, failures of 
trading platforms
, d
ata and connectivity. 
Without applying any selection criteria, 
pricing of 
crypto
-asset
s is very
 disperse.
148 Pricing information feeds further into the calculation of the m
arket capitalisation 
indicator, 
together 
with the crypto
-asset supply information for 
which various options 
exist.
 Off
-chain transactions are a growing phenomenon 
that 
aim
s to overcome the 
constraints
 of distributed ledgers used for crypto
-assets
. In an unrestricted DLT 
network, the validation of new transactions has to be costly to preserv
e the integrity of 
the system and relatively slow to allow sufficient time for all users to agree on the latest 
valid set of transactions before a new one is validated. ﬁChannelsﬂ have been 
introduced as a solution for clusters of users to settle transacti
ons faster among 
themselves and, as in net deferred settlement typical of some market infrastructures, 
only use the unrestricted distributed ledger for the ﬁultimateﬂ settlement of net 
transactions.
 Pricing and trading information
 Even when a business rela
ted to crypto
-assets is 
covered
 by regulation, 
as should be the case with crypto
-asset trading platforms, there are instances 
where no accountable party takes the role of operator
. This is true of some trading 
platforms that are ﬁdecentralisedﬂ, since they
 rely on validation by DLT network users 
to execute a trade. Moreover, trades agreed on decentralised trading platforms 
typically involve the mutual transfer of two assets, which are settled as two individual 
transactions that can hardly be identified as c
onstituting a single trade.
                                                                     146  See 
Pay
-to-Endpoint
 and 
Coinjoi
n initiatives.
 147  The same approach could be used to record and transfer either traditional assets or crypto
-assets.

 One of the main differentiating factors with respect to trading activities and 
the 
resulting pricing are 
the 
fee characteristics of crypto trading platforms.
 Among
 trading platforms
, those with zero
-fee 
or transaction
-fee mining
 feature
s might 
be problem
atic
 in the context of pricing and trading volume
 data reliability
. On zero
-fee 
platforms, traders are able to trade freely without fees
, regardless of how many trades 
they 
make
, which may lead to higher trading volumes. Similarly
, trading platforms with 
a transaction
-fee mining feature 
offset
 transaction fees 
with
 trading platform
 native 
tokens. 
A reward 
of this nature 
might incentivise traders to trade more to receive 
tokens 
that
 offer valuable options as voting rights on the pla
tform or a dividend. Both of 
the
se forms
 can lead to market manipulation of simultaneously selling and buying the 
same asset to create misleading and artificial 
market 
activity
, also called wash trading.
 Low liquidity, unusual price spikes and erratic trading behaviour in the 
round
-the
-clock market 
also 
contribute to the challenges 
of pricing 
crypto
-assets
. Unlike any other market, the crypto
-asset market operates 24 hours 
per day
, with 
no standardised ﬁcl
ose of businessﬂ time. Data aggregators provide lower 
frequency data
, e.g. daily
, in line with their preferred time
 frame convention
, which may 
not coincide with 
that of 
other providers. To address the issue of low liquidity, data 
providers adjust the cont
ributions of the prices achieved on the less liquid exchanges 
in the overall indicator of a price of a crypto
-asset. Unusual spikes and erratic trading 
behaviour are also corrected using boundaries or other exclusion criteria based on 
benchmarks supported 
by, for example,
 website traffic indicators and expert 
judgement. The issue contributing to the difficulty in getting reliable data covers also 
the lack of standard naming convention for crypto
-assets and their identifiers.
 The u
ninterrupted provision of d
ata by trading platforms might be affected by 
technical issues related to the substantial risks of cyberattack, fraud and 
hacking.
149 In cyberattacks
, such as denial
-of-service 
attacks,
 the perpetrators seek 
to make 
a machine or network resource unavailable 
to its intended users by disrupting 
the service of a host connected to the 
internet
. This is 
typically accomplished by 
flooding the targeted machine or resource with request
s. 
The h
acking of user or 
platform
 accounts may lead to 
the 
bankruptc
y of 
trading p
latforms,
 especially those 
with 
unsuitable
 technological infrastructures operating in a legally uncertain global 
virtual environment. Theft, cybercrime and other criminal 
activities
 have 
affected an 
estimated 6% of 
the 
total supply of bitcoin and do
 not in
clude the unreported cases of 
individuals who 
have 
lost bitcoins to hackers. With respect to the interruption of data 
provision, typical issues 
that 
data aggregators or exchanges 
experience take the form 
of service outage
s, connec
tivity errors and unstable
 APIs.
 Market capitalisation information
 In order to calculate market capitalisation the price of a crypto
-asset 
has
 to be 
complemented with information on the aggregate supply
, which can be 
measured in
 several ways
. Specifically, four main measures of supply can be 
                                                                    149  See

 distinguished: i) circulating supply
, ii) total supply
, iii) maximum supply
, and iv) 
variations of inflation
-adjusted supply
, which take into account future supply within a 
specific time horizon (usually 
five years). Circulating supply is the best approximation 
of the units of a crypto
-asset that are circulating in the market

f units that will ever exist in the lifetime of this crypto

used

 indicators
, the most important methodological choices include the coverage of 
crypto
-assets and pricing sources, 
index rebalancing and weighting scheme
s. With 
respect to the selection of crypto
-assets, market capitalisation is the main criterion 
used. Pricing sources are selected based on their liquidity, reliability and 
fulfilment of
 various selection criteria
, e.g.
 compliance with 
anti
-money 
laundering policies. 
Weigh
ting schemes are also based on market capitalisation
, often applying caps and 
trading volumes. Rebalancing is 
carried out
 periodically
, typically on a monthly 
frequency
, but can 
also be in close to real
 time.
 Summing up
, two aspects for future work emerge from the analysis of issues 
concerning
 measuring the crypto
-asset phenomenon.
 The f
irst
 is to deal with 
the 
complexity and growing challenges 
of analysing on
-chain and layered protocol 
transactions. Wit
h respect to off
-chain transactions
, given the many
 methodological 
options, further 
analysis
 should focus on increasing 
the 
availability
 and transparency 
of the reported data and 
the 
methodologies used, harmonising and enriching 
metadata
, and developing be
st practices for indicators on crypto
-assets.
 4.3
 Selected measurement issues with rudimentary indicators of 
crypto
-asset market developments
 While one of the basic indicators of the size of the crypto
-asset market that is 
often used is the growing number 
of crypto
-assets created over time, 
only a 
fraction of these crypto
-assets is traded persistently.
 Out of the thousands of 
crypto
-assets created so far, around 35% have been recently traded on trading 
platforms (see Chart 
1) and 5% have been traded every d
ay since the beginning of 
2018. Similar developments can also be observed when looking at the indicator of the 
number of trading pairs. 
The number of crypto
-assets traded on a daily basis (
i.e. 
within 24
-hour intervals) recovered from 
lows
 of around 1,300 
at the turn of 2018 and 
2019 to 
reach 
just over
 2,200
 in April 2019. April 2019 numbers are relatively close to 
the 
record high
 of 2,456 crypto
-assets traded on a daily basis
, recorded in September 
2018. 
From a
 trading persistency
 perspective
, around 700 c
rypto
-assets have been 
traded every day since the beginning of 2019
, one-third of them since the beginning of 
2018. In terms of trading pairs, recent numbers point to more than 5,100 pairs traded 
on a daily basis
, up from 
the
 3,000 pairs traded in 
the 
first quarter of
 2019. 
Every
 day 
since the beginning of 2019
, 1,603 pairs have been traded
, one-third of this 
amount 
since the beginning of 2018
.

 If another
 indicator, market capitalisation, is used for gauging the size of the 
crypto
-asset market, the size varies by 20%, depending on whether the 
circulating supply or the maximum supply is chosen as the underlying 
measure.
 Recent m
arket capitalisation based on
 the circulating supply
 (estimated at 
USD 165 billion)
 has 
returned to 2017 levels
, having peaked
 at the 
end of 
2018, strongly mirroring developments in 
the 
pricing of crypto
-assets as measured
, for 
example,
 by the CRIX index
159 (see Chart 2). Three
-quarters
 of 
the 
total market 
capitalisation 
is accounted for
 by five crypto
-assets
, which 
also make up
 half of the 
total circulating supply of crypto
-assets (
see 
Chart 3). Market capitalisation of 
bitcoin 
alone constitutes 50% of 
the 
total
, while its total circula
ting supply amounts to 
slightly 
less than one
-third of 
the 
total for crypto
-assets. Prices of the
se five crypto
-assets 
strongly shaped the general pricing trends of the total crypto
-asset markets. Using 
the 
maximum supply of crypto
-assets to calculate the market capitalisation would 
mean a 
20% 
increase 
in 
the indicator value, with half of 
this
 attributed to bitcoin. In line with the 
bitcoin protocol
, the maximum supply of bit
coin would be reached in 2140.
                                                                     159  CRIX,

 The total market pricing and market capitalisation trends were strongly shaped 
by the aggregate prices of each of the five aforementioned crypto
-assets, which 
on a disaggregated basis fluctuated significantly across trading platforms.
 Disregarding differences in 
the 
trading and transaction fees 
of various platforms, 
as 
well as 
transaction processing times and potential price movements between 
tran
sactions
, the price heterogeneity for crypto
-assets is significant (see Chart

the volumes of

that 
are cleared in euro and in other fiat

cleared in euro
 hovered
 broadly around 10% of all

, compared 
with
 an increasing share 
of 
up to 81% for

trades took place
, by and large
, on centralised trading platforms
. However
, activity on 
decentralised trading platforms seem
s to be picking up but still 
accounts for less than
 1% of trading volum
es. From the geographical perspective, trades on platforms 
located in Europe 
amounted to
 24% of all trading,
 with the highest trading volumes 
recorded on platforms in Malta and the U

, while trades on platforms

in the U

 and Spain. With respect to
 cards supporting 
crypto
-assets
, there are a few new options
 of cards
 in Europe
 that can be loaded with 
major crypto
-assets
, e.g. bitcoin, 
Ethereum or litecoin. Regarding wallets, the ma
jority 
are target
ing
 the major crypto
-assets and 
are
 becom
ing 
more multi

, with some supporting close to 100 crypto
-assets. For the majority of wallets
, users 
control their private keys as oppose
d to 
the 
less popular options of storing 
privat
e keys 
with a third party. 
Despite the reportedly growing interest of merchants in accepting 
crypto
-assets as 
a form of 
payment,
161 no hard data on underlying transactions are 
available
. However
, purchase transactions of goods
 or services
 with settlement in 
crypto
-assets in Europe are estimated to be 
insignificant.
 The number of on
-chain transactions for major crypto
-assets 
is
 growing, but 
it 
only give
s a partial view of total crypto
-asset transactions 
as off
-chain 
transactions are not 
tak
en into account
. The
 number of transactions per day on the 
bitcoin blockchain shows 
a steady increase since spring 2018. Transactions on the 
Ethereum blockchain 
are 
currently at the 
0.5 million
 level
, after 
peaking in January 
2018 at 
1.3 million 
per day
. T
ransactions on the 
bitcoin cash blockchain recently 
showed an upward trend

This f

ed a few extreme spikes in winter 2018
 after the split of this crypto
-asset.
 Finally
, transactions on the litecoin blockchain 
remained rather stable at around 25
,000 
transactions per day. 
Comparing the values of the transactions recorded on these 
blockchains with the trading values on trading platforms, the on
-chain transactions 
account for a small fraction of the value of off
-chain transactions (see Chart 8).

 Despite
 the broad decline in
 the 
off

crypto
-assets
, following a peak at the end
 of 
2018, in 
the crypto
-asset market a high 
number of crypto
-assets 
continue to be 
traded every day on the trading platforms and 
activity 
is stable 
on some
 institutionalised exchanges. This
 assessment 
can 
also 
be supported by the growing 
values 
of on

 and off

 transactions per day for 
major crypto

On the other hand, price dispersion of crypto
-assets across 
trading platforms is substantial, driven to some extent by wash trad
ing. Moreover, the 
lack of detailed information on crypto
-asset transactions hinders analysis.
 4.4
 Statistical initiatives to improve 
information on crypto
-assets
 Statistical issues related to crypto
-assets, also within the broader topic of 
fintech, have b
een followed by the central bank community, for example the 
Irving Fisher Committee (IFC) on Central Banking Statistics
.162 Specifically
, the 
IFC has set up a working group 
on fintech data issues
163 whose objective 
is to analyse 
and make possible recommendatio
ns for central bank statistics. The aim 
of the IFC™s 
work is twofold. First, it is 
to take stock of existing data sources
 and assess central 
banks™ additional information needs
, which should be addressed through the IFC 
survey of the member central banks. 
Second, it is to 
investigate key data gaps
, together with the costs and benefits of initiatives to address them
, 
and provide 
guidance for developing adequate statistical definitions.
 Furthermore, the statistics community
164 has started to investigate 
the 
sta
tistical classification of crypto
-assets in the 
System of National Accounts
 (SNA), which may have significant implications on the measurement of GDP 
and other key indictors and provide further insight into crypto
-asset
-related 
activities.
 National accounts
 are
 a data 
source for various economic indicators
, such 
as 
GDP
 and its components and derived indicators
, which provide insight
, for 
example,
 into
 the size of the economy and the main drivers of economic activity. 
The 
statistical classification of 
crypto
-assets and related activity in the SNA may 
significantly impact key indicators, including the GDP for some countries, depending 
on the method chosen.
165 Complexity in 
the 
statistical classification of crypto
-assets 
derives from the very characteristic
 of crypto
-assets not represent
ing
 a financial 
claim 
on, or 
a liability of
, any identifiable entity. 
Developing harmonised statistical treatment 
of crypto
-assets in line with the general national accounts guidance for income, value 
generation, asset creati
on and accumulation would provide further insight and help to 
address existing data and analytical challenges.
 Within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), t
he ECB has established 
an informal network on crypto
-asset data to analyse options to enhanc
e information on crypto
-assets.
 Following
 on from 
the 
initial internal 
work 
at 
the ECB
, an informal network of representatives from the ESCB was created to analyse the 
                                                                    162  For more information see the

 Statistical initiatives involving central banks can provide valuable contributions 
to closing the identified crypto
-asset data gaps in the future.
 There has been no 
comprehensive global initiati
ve for developing and compiling statistics on crypto
-assets 
in a structured way before. In the future, central banks can provide input with respect to 
the new data sources for information on the interlinkages of crypto
-assets. Drawing from 
the available to
ols, central banks could contribute to closing data gaps via initiatives 
towards increased availability and transparency of data, indicators and methodologies, 
best practices, as well as potential statistical compilations.
 5 Conclusions
 Crypto
-assets are e
nabled by DLT and characterised by the lack of an 
underlying claim.
 In the light of the implications they might have for the stability and 
efficiency of the financial system and the economy, and also 
for
 the fulfilment of the 
Eurosystem™s
 functions, crypto
-assets warrant continuous monitoring. To this
 end, the 
ECB 
has 
set up a dataset based on high
-quality publicly available aggregated data 
complemented with 
other 
data from some commercial sources using API and big data 
technologies.
 Howev
er, important gaps and challenges remain: exposures of financial 
institutions to crypto
-assets, i
nterlinkages
 with the regulated financial sectors
 and payment transactions 
that include the use of
 layered protocols are 
all examples of 
domains 
with
 prominent
 data gaps
. The challenges in measuring the phenomenon of crypto
-assets are diverse and 
relate both to on
-chain and off
-chain data.
 Specifically
, it is hard to retrieve public 
data on segments of the crypto
-asset market that remain 
off
 the radar of public 
authorities; some relatively
 illiquid trading platforms may be affected by wash trading; 
and there is no consistency in the methodology and conventions used by 
institutionalised exchanges and commercial data providers. Moreover, new and 
unexpected data nee
ds may well arise with further advancements in crypto
-assets 
and related innovation.
 Statistical initiatives by the ECB and the central banking community are expected 
to provide a valuable input to efforts aimed at closing the data gaps associated 
with cry
pto
-assets.
 Looking ahead, the ECB will continue to work on indicators and 
data by dealing with the complexity and growing challenges encountered in analysing 
on-chain and layered protocol transactions. Furthermore, investigation will continue 
regarding th
e new data sources for information on interlinkages of crypto
-assets. With 
respect to the off
-chain transactions, amid a multitude of methodological options, further 
work will focus on increasing the availability and transparency of the reported data and 
the methodologies used, harmonising and enriching the metadata and developing best
