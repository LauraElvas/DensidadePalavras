  2 Update on economic and 
monetary 
developments
 Summary
 The information that has become available since the Governing Council
™s monetary 
policy
 meeting in March confirms slower growth momentum extending into the current 
year. While there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic dom
estic factors dampening 
growth are fading, global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth 
developments.
 The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the 
downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geop
olitical factors, 
the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. 
At the same time, 
further employment gains and rising wages continue to underpin the resilience of the 
domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. 
However
, an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable 
financing conditions and support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that 
inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% 
ove
r the medium term. 
Significant monetary policy stimulus is being provided by 
the 
Governing Council™s
 forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the 
reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of 
targeted 
lon
ger-term refinancing operations 
(TLTROs
). Survey indicators of global economic activity have weakened in the first quarter of 
2019. In particular, global trade has continued to slow down amid the turning of the 
global industrial cycle and heightened trade 
tensions. Global inflation has subsided in 
the first months of this year, largely on account of a lower contribution from the energy 
component.
 Euro area government bond yields overall declined somewhat as global risk
-free rates 
decreased
 and the EONIA for
ward curve shifted downwards
. Developments in 
sovereign bond spreads exhibited some heterogeneity across the euro area. Equity 
prices rose amid lower risk
-free rates and stable and low volatility. Accordingly, yield 
spreads on corporate bonds narrowed. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro 
remained broadly unchanged
 in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, 
following an increase of 0.1% in the third quarter
. 
Incoming data continued to be wea
k, 
mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand, compounded by country and 
sector
-specific factors.
 As the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat 
longer
-lasting, the slower growth momentum is expected to extend into the current 
year. 
Looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind.
 The 
euro area expansion will con
tinue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, 
further employment gains and rising wages
, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat 
slower 
Œ expansion in global activity.

 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
  3 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% i
n March 2019, after 1.5% in February 2019, reflecting mainly a decline in food, services 
and non
-energy industrial goods price inflation.
 On the basis of current futures prices 
for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months. Measur
es of 
underlying inflation have remained generally muted, but labour cost pressures have 
strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening 
labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase graduall
y over the medium term, supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures, the 
ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.
 Regarding monetary developments, 
broad money (M3) growth increased to 4.3% in 
February 2019, from 3.8% in January. M3 growth con
tinues to be backed by bank 
credit creation and the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor 
to broad money growth. The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations 
rebounded to 3.7% in February 2019 and has moderated in rece
nt months, reflecting 
the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth. The annual growth 
rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3% in February.
 The 
euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2019 suggests tha
t overall bank 
lending conditions remained favourable.
 Combining the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis, the Governing Council concluded that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for 
the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 On the basis of this assessment, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB 
interest rates unchanged and
 continues to expect them to re
main at their present 
levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to 
ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term.
 The Governing Council confirmed that the Eurosystem will continue to reinvest, in full, 
the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase 
programme for an extended period of time past the date when 
the Governing Council
 star
ts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to 
maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary 
accommodation.
 The Governing Council 
reiterated its readiness to 
adjust all of its instruments, as 
appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing 
Council™s inflation aim in a sustained manner.
 The precise terms of the new 
TLTRO 
series
 will be communicated at one of the 
Governing Council™s forthcoming meetings. In particular
, the pricing of the new 
TLTRO
-III operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank
-based 
transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the 
economic outlook. In the context of the ECB™s regular assessment, t
he Governing 
Council will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of

 Global
 survey indicators 
point to some deceleration in global activity in the first 
quarter of 2019
. The global composite output 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) excluding the euro area
 rose
 in March
 (see 
Chart
 1), as an increase in the services 
sector more than
 offset a marginal decline in manufacturing
. 
In quarterly terms, 
however, 
the PMI 
in the first quarter of 2019 is below the level recorded in 2017 and 
the first half of 2018, consistent with some deceleration in the global growth 
momentum. Across advanced 
economies, the US Markit 
PMI 
was
 broadly unchanged 
while the all
-industry survey indicator published by the Institute for Supply 
Management (ISM) declined from rather high levels 
during
 the first quarter
. PMIs also 
decreased in the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and Japan, on the back
 of weaker 
readings
 in 
March
. 
In
 emerging market economies, 
the 
quarterly PMI 
picked up
 strongly 
in Brazil
, while 
decreasing
 in India and
 Russia
. The PMI remained unchanged in
 China
 in the 
first quarter
, 
although it recorded a strong
 increase in March

 Global trade indicators signal 
a continued weakness 
at the start of the year.
 The 
volume of
 merchandise imports 
decreased by 
1.9% in 
January
 2019, 
in 
three

 terms
, particularly 
on account of sharp 
declines
 in Asian 
countries
. This decrease is partly related to the 
significant volatility 
of 
Chinese trade 
data
 around the Lunar New Year
, 
which makes it difficult to interpret the January data
. At the same time, 
the PMI new export orders
 remained 
below the expansionary 
threshold in 
March 
(see Chart 2).
 A broader measure, based on a principal component 
of leading indicators of global trade
, qualifies this picture and 
points to 
a marginal 
increase
 in world trade 
in 
the first quarter of 
2019, following subdued developments in 
the second
 half of last year.

This pattern has been 
amplified at 
the current juncture by the fact that 
much of the weakness in the global
 economy has 
been concentrated in industrial
 activity. 
In fact, t

be highly correlated

lobal merchan
dise imports
 and March
 2019 for
 the PMIs.
 World tr
ade has also been 
affected by other factors, including
 heightened trade 
tensions
. US imports from China have
 fallen particularly sharply 
in the industries
 affected by the tariffs, 
but a sharp
 moderation has
 also occurred across other Asian
 economies
. While this could be a sign of weaker
 domestic demand in China, it could 
also be the
 result of industry
-specific developments,
 particularly 
in electronic products 
and cars. Both
 sectors 
are highly trade
-intensive
 and have a high share in
 Asian trade
. Box 1 discusses the role that a maturing tech cycle may have played in the trade 
slowdown observed in China and other key Asian economies.
 Global inflation remained stable in February.
 Annual consumer price inflation 
in the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development
 (OECD
) countries 
remained unchanged in February at 2.1%, 
following a sequence of declines since the 
peak registered in October last year. E
xcluding food and energy 
prices, OECD annual 
inflation 
slowed marginally to 2.1%
. 
Tight labour market conditions across major 
advanced economies have so far translated into only moderate wage increases, 
suggesting that the underlying inflation pressures remain subdued
. 
Looking ahead, 
inflation is expected to 
remain subdued
 in the short
 term, 
while 
diminishing spare 
capacity at the global level is expected to support underlying inflation
 in the medium 
term
. Oil prices 
have 
continued to increase since mid

. After the surge in 
mid

 release of data showing an improvement in OPEC+ 
compliance with its supply

further

March to a level of around

  7 the cartel has decreased
 since January 2019
. Moreover, US sanctions 
against
 Iran 
and Venezuela continued to affect supply, exacerbated further by power outages in 
Venezuela
, which weighed on output. Among non
-oil commodities, metal prices
 and food prices have
 remained broadly unchanged since early March.
 The expansion in the US remains sustained, but shows signs of maturing
. US real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.2% in th
e fourth quarter of 2018. The
 increase in real GDP in the
 fourth quarter mainly reflected positive
 contributions from
 private consumption and non
-residential
 fixed investment, while the contributions
 from 
net exports and government spending were
 negative. 
While overall GDP growth 
remains supported by strong fundamentals,
 economic activity i
s expected to 
decelerate
 in the first
 quarter
 of this year
, amid one
-off adverse factors
 Œ such as the 
partial government shutdown 
Œ and mixed incoming data
. At the same 
time, 
inflationary pressures 
remain contained, in
 spite of rising wages. Annual headline 
CPI 
inflation
 slowed down slightly to 1.5% in February. The decline in inflation was mainly 
driven by a
 sharp drop in energy prices. 
CPI i
nflation excluding
 food and e
nergy prices 
dropped 
marginally
 to 2.1% in
 February. 
By contrast, 
in line with 
a tight labour market
, 
average hourly earnings rose by 3.4% y
ear-on-year, continuing an upward trend that 
started in
 2015. Economic activity slowed in Japan in early 2019
, 
following a rebound towards 
the end of last year
. Real GDP increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth 
quarter of 2018, mainly supported by domestic demand, particularly non
-residential 
investment
. 
However, h
igh frequency indicators
 point to a
 slowdown in underlying 
momentum at the
 start of the year
. 
Industrial
 production was very weak, currently 
standing below the Q4
 2018 levels. January
-February
 average real goods exports are 
lower
 than last year, suggesting ongoing weakness in
 external demand
. Consumer 
price inflation continued to
 slow at the start of 2019, largely reflecting
 developments in 
food and energy prices.
 Annual headline inflation declined to 0.2% in both
 January 
and February, reflect
ing
 mostly a
 decline in the energy price contribution
 and strong 
declines in
 fresh food prices. Core inflation (i.e. excl
uding
 food and
 energy) has picked
 up slightly to 0.3%
. In the United Kingdom, GDP growth slowed markedly in the final quarter of 2018 
in an environment of high uncertainty related to Brexi
t. Quarterly r
eal GDP
 growth
 slowed to 
0.2% in the fourth quarter of 
last
 year, following robust growth in 
the 
previous quarter
. Short
-term indicators suggest 
continued subdued 
GDP growth in the 
first quarter of 2019, as 
elevated 
Brexit
-related uncertainty
 dampen
s consumption and 
investment. Despite slowing global growth momentum, UK exports rebounded 
strongly in the second half of the year, aided by a slight depreciation 
of the pound 
sterling. However, net trade continues to contribute negatively to growth
, as imports 
rebounded 
even 
more strongly 
Œ in large part as a result of stockpiling by firms and 
consumers in anticipation of Brexit. After a slight up
-tick in the middle of 2018, annual 
CPI inflation has continued to decline, falling to 1.8% in the first
 two months of 2019. 
This is 
well below 
the depreciation
-induced 
peak at 
3.0% seen one year earlier and 
reflects both the waning impact of earlier strong rises in import prices 
and rapid 
declines in energy prices from the autumn of 2018

  8 Economic growth 
is

slightly

confirmed by the

. 
Annual headline CPI 
inflation 
eased

 Spreads on Italian sovereign

spreads on Portuguese sovereign bonds declined by 7 basis points, to 0.86%.
 Broad indices of euro ar
ea equity prices 
rose amid lower risk
-free rates and in 
an environment of broadly stable volatility
. Over the review period equity prices of 
euro area banks 
and non
-financial corporations increased by 3.4% and 2.9% 
respectively
. 
Despite some negative macro
economic surprises, which led to swings in 
equity valuations, 
equity prices rose 
throughout the review period. This was possibly 
on account of the declines in risk
-free rates in the context of stable and historically low 
expectations among
 market 
participants regarding future equity volatility. Among other 
factors, continued positive earnings and fewer concerns about geopolitical tensions 
also contributed to support equity valuations.

increased by 0.

quarter of 201
8, only 
marginally up compared with the previou
s quarter, but still below the economic 
expansion observed in the first half of last year 
(see Chart
 5). D
omestic demand
 and net trade contributed positively to GDP growth in the fourth quarter, while changes in 
inventories had a substantial curtailing eff
ect
. In annual terms, this resulted in a 1.8% 
increase in real GDP in 2018, which is well below the 2.4% rate of growth recorded in 
the previous year.
 Although soft 
economic indicators
 remain robust overall compared 
with historical averages, they have cont
inued to fall short. Particular vulnerabilities in 
the manufacturing and tradable goods sectors reflect a downturn in external demand 
which, combined with
 some country and sector
-specific factors,
 suggests a continued 
weak growth momentum in the first quar
ter of 2019.

The

 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Economic activity
  12 (expressed as a four
-quarter moving average) increased
 from 12.0% in the third 
quarter of 2018 to 12.1
% in 
the fourth quarter.
 Euro area labour 
markets 
remain robust, despite some slowdown
. Employment 
increased by 
0.3% in 
the last quarter of 2018
, 
following an increase of
 0.2% in the third 
quarter
. Overall, employment increased by 1.5% in 2018. Employment growth slowed 
down somewhat in the second half of 2018, but remained strong compared with 
developments in GDP growth. 
Continued employment growth combined with a drop in 
GDP growth in 2018 led to 
a moderation in productivity growth, following a modest 
pick
-up in 2017.
 This may partly reflect the fact that 
adjustments in employment 
tend 
to 
lag behind 
changes
 in output. One reason 
for this may be
 that firms are cautious in 
their 
recruitment
 decisions
, 
in part owing
 to limited flexibility 
regarding
 adjustment
s to
 longer
-term employment contracts.
 Recent short
-term labour market indicators continue to point to positive but 
moderating employment growth in the first quarter of 2019.
 The euro area 
unemploy
ment rate stood at 7.8% in 
both January and Febr
uary 2019
, down from 
7.9% in the last quarter of 2018
. 
This, together with the s
urvey indicators 
on employment, 
point
s to 
further employment growth, but at a lower rate than before

the

 rate
. Private consumption is expected to continue 
to rise
 at robust rates.
 Recent 
data 
on retail trade and new passenger car registrations 
point to continued growth in 
consumer spending in the first quarter of this year. The l
atest 
survey results signal
 ongoing, 
albeit moderating, 
employment 
growth. This should continue to support 
household 
income and thus consumer spending.
 Moreover
, households™ net worth 
continued to increase 
in the fourth quarter of 2018
, 
thereby
 providing
 further 
support 
to 
private consumption
. Considered together, these factors should explain why during 
the first quarter of 2019 
consumer confidence 
partly recovered from its decline over 
the course of 2018 and continued to stand at a level well above its long

  13 Business investment s
lowed in the fourth quarter of 2018, and short
-term 
indicators point to a possible further slowdown in the first quarter of 2019.
 Despite
 remaining positive, q
uarter
-on-quarter
 non-construction investment growth 
declined from 1.0% in the third quarter of 2
018 to 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Available short
-term indicators for the first quarter of 2019 also point to a weakening in 
growth. Compared 
with
 the fourth quarter of 2018, available data for the first quarter of 
2019 suggest a fall in the produ
ction of capital goods. This also reflects the recorded 
decline in industrial confidence as well as higher financial volatility. On a more positive 
note
, capacity utilisation remains high
, pointing to supply
-side constrain
ts which might 
call for increas
ed investment. Looking forward, investment dynamics are expected to 
remain moderate. As the business cycle matures, business investment is 
expected
 to 
decelerate in tandem with weakening external and domestic demand. In this context, 
the assessment of export 
order books 
and production expectations in the capital 
goods sector point
s to continued weakness 
so far in 2019
. 
By contrast, w
hile profit 
dynamics (i.e. internal funds for investment) slow
ed, banks continue
d to report a 
positive net demand for loans used for investment purpose
s in the first quarter of 
2019. Euro area 
trade re
gained some momentum at the start of 2019 but according to 
leading indicators it may be short
-lived
. According to the latest monthly nom
inal 
data
 (for January 2019),
 intra
-euro area exports recovered 
by 
1.5%
, month 
on month,
 following a decrease
 of 
0.6%
 in December 2018.
 Extra
-euro
 area exports expanded at 
a stronger rate 
of 
0.8
%, month on month, compared with 0.3% in December 2018.
 Growth
 in t
otal imports remained weak
 in January 2019
 at 
0.3%
 in month

terms,
 up from 
0.1% in December
 2018.
 Intra
-euro area
 and extra
-euro area
 flows 
advanc
ed at the same pace. While euro area trade in goods
 strengthened
 at the start 
of 2019, the recov
ery 
was nevertheless insufficient to fuel stronger
 growth over the 
first q
uarter. Looking forward, euro area trade 
is expected to remain
 weak
 in the first 
part of 2019.
 The latest economic indicators suggest 
a sizeable
 moderation in the pace of 
economic 
expansion
. Industrial production (excluding construction) 
experienced a 
rebound in the first quarter of 2019. Production showed positive signs for the first time 
since 2017, increasing slightly by 0.4% 
in quarter
-on-quarter terms
 compared with the 
1.2% dro
p in
 the 
fourth 
quarter
 of 2018
. 
Survey data 
signal a slowdown in 
growth 
dynamics 
in the near term. The composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index 
(PMI) 
averaged 5
1.5
 in the 
first 
quarter of 201
9, compared with
 52.3
 in the 
fourth 
quarter
 of 
2018. Meanwhil
e, 
the European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator
 (ESI)
 dropped to an average of 106.0 in the first quarter of 2019, compared with 108.9 
in the 
fourth quarter of 2018
. 
While
 the ESI 
stood 
above 
its
 long
-term average
, 
the PMI 
remained between the th
reshold of 50 (which separates contraction from expansion in 
activity) and its historical average of 52.9.
 This moderation 
reflects
 in part a 
slowdown in external demand
, 
compounded 
by some country and sector
-specific factors
. While t
he impact of 
some 
coun
try 
and sector
-specific idiosyncratic factors on 
economic activity 
is dissipating, global 
headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth
 and the rebound 
is sluggish.
 Overall, growth is expected to 
continue at a slow pace.

  14 Looking forward, the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures will continue to back 
domestic demand.
 Private consumption is supported by 
healthy labour market

 improve
, supported by 
growing household wealth.
 Bus

. The results of the latest round of the

the previous round 
conducted in
 late January
. At the same time, the figure for 2021 
remained unchanged at 1.4%.
 The risks surrounding the euro area g
rowth outlook remain 
tilted to the 
downside
. This reflects the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, 
the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.

declined
 to 1.4% in March 2019, from 1.5% in February 
(see Chart

 took 
place despite higher energy price inflation and

excluding

s: The latest observations are for 
March 2019 (flash

. Growth rates for 2015 are distorted upwards owing to a 
methodological change (see 
the box entitled ﬁ
A new method for the packa
ge holiday price index in Germany and its impact on HICP 
inflation rates
ﬂ, Economic Bulletin

). Measures of underlying inflation
 remained generally muted and
 continued
 their 
recent sideways movement.
 HICP 
inflation excluding energy and food 
declined to 
0.8% in March, from 1.0% in February. The extent to which this decline was affected 
by developments in more volatile prices, for instance for travel and clothing, or by the 
timing of the Easter holidays, can 
be assessed only with the release of the full HICP 
breakdown. 
Other measures of underlying inflation, including the Persistent and 
Common Component of Inflation (PCC
I) indicator and the Supercore indicator
1, which 
are only available for the period to 
Febru
ary
, also pointed to a continuation of the broad 
sideways movement of recent months
. Nonetheless, 
all
 of the statistical and 
model
-based measures remained 
above
 their respective lows in 2016.
 Looking 
ahead, measures of underlying inflation are expected to 
increase gradually, driven by 
stronger
 wage growth and the pick
-up observed in domestic producer price inflation.
 Supply chain price pressures for HICP non

 continued 
to increase
. This build
-up is visible in
 the later stages

  16 further 
in 
February, standing at 1.2%
, up from 0.8% in January
. At the very early 
stages of the pricing chain, price pressures recovered somewhat; the annual 
percentage changes in both oil and non
-oil commodity prices moved back into positive 
territory in February and continued to increase in March
. Recent developments in wage growth 
continue to 
support the notion of a 
gradual buil
d-up in domestic cost pressures.
 Annual g
rowth in compensation per 
employee 
was 
2.2% in 
the fourth quarter of 
2018, remaining
 above its long
-term 
average
. The decline 
from 2.5% in 
the previous quarter 
was linked to one
-off 
payments in 
that quarter
. 
As n
egotiated wage growth 
had 
continued to increase
, rising 
from 2.1% in 
the third quarter of 
2018 to 2.2% in 
the fourth qu
arter, the decline in 
growth of compensation per employee was 
reflected 
in 
a declining wage drift
. More 
generally, wage 
growth 
indicators now stand
 visibly
 higher than in the first half of 2016. 
These developments are in line with increasing 
tightness in t
he labour market.
 The impact of r
ising labour cost pressures 
on overall domestic price 
developments
 was
 cushioned
 by profit margins.
 Price pressur
es as captured in 
unit labour costs continued to intensify
 in the 
fourth 
quarter of 2018
, mainly reflecting a 
continued weakening in
 labour 
productivity
 growth. Notwithstanding, the annual 
percentage change in the 
GDP deflator 
remained relatively stable, hovering between 
1.3% and 1.5% in 2018, as t
he overall weakening in the cyclical momentum of the 
economy
, toget
her with deteriorations in the terms of trade (related particularly to the 
past 
increases in 
oil price
s), weighed on p
rofit margin developments.
 Market
-based measures of lon
ger
-term inflation expectations 
declined
, while 
survey
-based
 expectations remained stable
. The five
-year forward inflation
-linked 
swap rate five years ahead stood 
at 1.36%, around 
15 basis points lower than the level 
prevailing
 in 
early March
 (see
 Chart
 8). 
Despite its further decline, which continues a 
downward tr
end beginning
 in November 2018, t
he risk
-neutral probability of negative 
average inflation over the next five years
, implied by inflation options markets
, remains 
negligible. Nevertheless, the forward profile of market
-based measures of inflation 
expectati
ons continues to point to a prolonged period of low inflation with only a very 
gradual return to inflation levels 
below, but 
close to, 2%. 
The results of the ECB 
Survey 
of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the 
second
 quarter of 2019
 show average 
headline 
inflation expectations 
for the euro area of 1.4% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 
1.6% in 2021. This represents downward revisions
 of 0.1 percentage points for each 
of these years compared with 
the previous survey
, mainly attributable to a weaker 
growth outlook and downward surprises in recent inflation outcomes.
 According to the 
SPF, average longer

sed
 to

around the rates observed since early 2018
 (see Chart

The phasing

that

 (see Box 4 
ﬁThe

economic activity in the euro area
ﬂ), these developments are consistent with the 
current moderation in real economic activity.
 Looking ahead, the current level of real

s: Credit to the private sector includes MF
I loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of securities issued by the euro area private

As such, it also covers the Eurosystem™s purchases of non

programme.
 The latest observation
 is for 
February 
2019. M3 growth remained resilient to the fading

. From a counterpart perspective, t
he positive contribution to M3 growth from general 
government securities held by the Eurosystem decreased further
 (see th

phasing
-out of
 net purchases under the 
APP. Until October 2018 it
 had been largely offset by a
n increase in the contribution 
from credit to the private sector
 (see the blue bars in Chart
 9). While credit to the 
private sector has 
remained the largest driver of broad money growth
 in recent 
months, its contribution has stagnated. Since October 2018 an increasingly positive 
contribution from net external assets
 (see the yellow bars in Chart

increasing issuance activity of MFI longer

dampened money creation (see the dark green bars in Chart 9).
 Following a decrease in
 January, the

increased again

. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the 
private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling) 
increased to 3.2% 
in 
February from 3.0% in
 January
 (see Chart
 10). 
This was due to a 
rebound
 in the annual growth rate of 
loans to NFCs
, which increased to
 3.7% in 
February
 from 
3.4% in 
January
, 
mainly reflecting a base effect. Looking b
eyond 
short
-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans 
to 
NFCs
 has been on a 
moderating path in recent months, in line with the typical lagged reaction to the 
slowdown in economic activity
 observed since early 2018
. At the same time, the 
annual growth rate of loans to 
household
s remained stable at
 3.3% in February
. The 
expansion 
in loan growth has been supported by the significant decline in bank 
lending rates across the euro area since mid
-2014 (notably owing to the ECB™s 
non-standard monetary policy measures) and 
by 
overall improvements in the supply 
of, and demand for, bank loans. In addition, banks have made progress in 
consolidating their balance sheets, although the 
volume
 of non
-performing loans 
(NPLs) remain
s high in some countries and may cons
train financial intermediation.

favourable than expected by banks in the previous survey round. At the same time

Net demand for loans to enterprises remained stable in 
the first quarter of 2019, 
after 
having
 increase
d since the second quarter of 2015, and was mainly supported by the 
low general level of interest rates. At the same time, net demand for housing loans 
continued to increase in the first quarter of 2019, also
 driven mainly by the low general 
level of interest rates. Euro area banks 
again 
confirmed that the ECB™s asset purchase 
programme had a positive impact on their liquidity position and market financing 
conditions and a negative impact on their profitabilit
y over the past six months, which 
included 
the 
Eurosystem™s net asset purchases until December 2018. The APP had an 
easing impact on banks™ credit terms and conditions and a positive impact on their 
lending volumes. In addition, while the ECB™s negative de
posit facility rate (DFR) had 
an adverse impact on banks™ net interest income, it continued to support lending.

2019 the composite bank lending rate for loans to NFCs remained broadly 
stable at 1.6

is close to its historical low in May

The composite bank 
lending rate for housing loans remained stable 
in February
 at 1.
80%, also close to its 
historical low 
in December 2016 (see Chart

loans to NFCs and households have 
fallen
 significantly and by more than market 
reference rates since the ECB™s credit easing measures were announced in June
 2014. The reduction in bank lendi
ng rates 
for
 loans to NFCs, as well as 
for 
loans to 
small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to •0.25
 million are 
primarily 
granted 
to small firms), was particularly significant in those euro area countries that were most 
exposed to the financial 
crisis. This indicates a more uniform transmission of monetary 
policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and firm sizes.

 turned positive again after being negative in the last two months of 
2018. This
 is in line with the
 seasonal patterns 
observed
 over the last few years
, in 
which issuance at the beginning of the year has tended to rebound following a period 
of weakness in the last few months of the previous year.
 From a more medium

were slightly above •40

seem to have settled since November 2018. 
Available market data suggest
 that net

moderated in March 2019, albeit remaining positive. I

. Financing costs for euro area NFCs 
declined marginally in January 2019 from 
the level recorded at the end of the previous year
. The overall nominal cost of

equity finance, 
declined to 
4.7% 
in January
 and is 
projected
 to 
have declined 
significantly further in February and March 2019
. 
The cost of financing 
in March 2019 
is estimated to 
be only 16

 and 
much 
below the levels observed in 
the

The estimated decrease 
in 
the cost of financing 
since the end of the

 reflects
 a decrease in
 both the 
cost of

a somewhat lesser extent, by the decline in risk premia.

the global 
economy
 Prepared by 
Marcel Tirp
ák A maturing tech cycle has been 
one of the
 factor
s behind the significant trade 
slowdown in China at the turn of the year.
 The tech cycle argument rests on the 
fact that China and other key Asian economies, 
inclu
ding Japan
, are closely integrated 
through supply chains concentrated
, especially
, in the production of computers and 
other electronic devices 
Œ the tech sector
3. The maturing tech cycle 
may
 reflect 
a number of
 factors: 
it could be associated with more str
uctural sector
-specific drivers
, such as the 
possibility of an 
increasing level of saturation in the global market for 
smartphones and for new data centres
; it could relate to mini
-cycles linked to
 the
 launch of new models of tech products
; or it may signa
l, more generally
, a turn in the 
global business cycle. This box reviews basic characteristics of the Asian tech sector 
and shows that it 
has 
played an important role in the recent weakness in China™s trade. 
At the same time, 
the box
 also suggests that the
 trend
 in 
the global tech cycle 
associated with weaker trade in Asia 
may be 
bottoming out
. Weak merchandise imports from other key Asian economies 
have accounted 
for
 a substantial 
share
 of decelerating 
Chinese 
imports in 
recent 
mont
hs (see 
Chart
 A).
 Imports from the United States 
have 
also declined, partly as retaliatory 
tariffs on soybeans 
have 
diverted Chinese demand for soybeans to Brazil. At the same 
time, China 
has significantly increased imports of various commodities, including 
crude 
oil.
                                                                     3  For the purposes of

even more pronounced when looking at exports, where tech products account, on 
average, for more than a quarter of exported goods from the r

 Japan and Korea are

tech production, which is 
subsequently 
exported, declined to 27% in 2015 from 40% 
only a decade ago, pointing to its declining dependence on intermediate goods 
sourced from the r

whether domestic macroeconomic developments could provide useful signals also for 
global

 While the global tech cycle turn

, a
n orderly slowdown followed 
by some stab

 looking ahead
. Recent 
indicators of the tech cycle point to a slowdown in the global tech cycle (see

by the

some bottoming out this year
, after falling in 2018. Second, while the global 
PMI f
or 
new export orders in the manufacturing sector 
has remained below the 
expansion
-contraction threshold of 50, the pace of its decline 
in recent months has 
been significantly less steep 
than in
 the first half of 2018. 
Although
 it covers a broader 
set of ex
ported products, it also 
shows
 a fairly high correlation with sectoral stock 
prices and thus could provide some further evidence of stabilisation
 in the global tech 
sector
. And third, 
Korean exports of semiconductors 
Œ often used as another leading 
indicat
or of activity in the tech sector 
Œ have recently shown signs of stabilisation. 
Broader indices of activity in the technology sector, which are published with a 
somewhat longer lag and include 
the US Tech Pulse

, and global trade in 
electronic compone

also suggests some limited weakening in the sector™s growth 
momentum.

 Emerging market currencies: the role of global risk, the US dollar and domestic forces
  26 2 Emerging market 
currencies: the role of global risk, th
e US 
dollar and domestic forces
 Prepared by 
Massimo Ferrari
 Exchange rate movements against the US dollar are an important factor 
shaping the outlook in emerging market economies as a large share of their 
credit, trade and debt is priced in dollars.
 Abrupt
 swings in emerging market 
exchange rates are typically lin
ked to capital outflows, tighter financing conditions and 
heightened financial instability. The drivers of those movements are, however, difficult 
to disentangle, as global and domestic forces jointly determine the relative strengths of 
these currencies. T
his
 box presents a methodology 
for
 separating out the
 four main 
drivers of 
emerging market
 exchange rate swings: spillovers from US shocks, global 
risk appetite, interest rate effects and idiosyncratic domestic shocks.
 It uses the 
methodology to 
analyse th
e factors behind
 the sharp depreciation and subsequent 
recovery of 
emerging market 
currencies over the course of 2018.

 Between January and August 2018 emerging market currencies depreciated
 markedly.
 Emerging market currencies experienced a sharp sell
-off over the first eight 
months of 2018 coupled with capital outflows and rising financial market volatility (see 
Chart A). The composite index of the nominal effective exchange rates of emerging 
market c
urrencies fell by 3.6% between January and August of that year, while 
bilateral exchange rates against the US dollar reacted much more strongly, weakening 
in some cases by more than 20%. The abrupt financial market swings in some 
countries have posed a thr
eat to financial stability, with potential spillovers to 
advanced economies. Large currency depreciations also increase funding costs for 
emerging market economies, whose financial systems typically raise liquidity in US 
dollars, lowering economic growth p
rospects.

 Emerging mar
ket currencies: the role of global risk, the US dollar and domestic forces
  27 Interest rate differentials alone do not explain exchange rate movements
. The 
theoretical concept of uncovered interest rate parity postulates that interest rate 
differentials determine exchange rate movements. It 
states that 
developments in 
the 
difference in interest rates between two countries 
should determine 
the change in 
the 
bilateral exchange rate, with the high
-yielding currency depreciating vis
-à-vis the 
low
-yielding currency. In practice, however, a large part of exchange rate movements 
is not explained by interest rate differentials and is often attributed to changes in the 
risk premium.
4 The risk premium correlates with various economic forces which are 
not well captured by short
-term interest rate differentials, including, for example, 
measures of investors™ risk appetite or market volatility. Interest rate differentials 
indeed explain very little of the changes in emerging market exchange rates against 
the US dollar in 2018 (see Chart B).

 The latest

 is 
for 31 August 2018.
 A better understanding of the drivers of currency movements is provided by a 
model which augments the standard interest rate regression with measures of 
global risk appetite and US factors.
 Beyond interest rates, there are two main 
forces behind emerging market currency movements: changes in global risk appetite 
and the spillovers from developments in the United States. Global risk appetite affects 
currencies because a higher risk appetite am
ong market participants tends to lead to 
inflows of capital into emerging markets, which results in an appreciation of their 
exchange rates. The unique position of the US dollar in the international monetary 
system also plays an important role. When the US
 dollar is strong, which happens in 
periods of positive economic growth momentum and high interest rates in the US 
                                                                    4  See for example Fama, E.F.,

 Emerging market currencies: the role of global risk, the US dollar and domestic fo

  28 economy, capital tends to flow from emerging markets to the United States, and 
emerging market currencies depreciate. This is a channel throu
gh which US shocks 
spread to emerging market economies.
 Verdelhan
 (2018)
5 provides a simple framework to assess the relative 
significance 
of each of the two forces
 for movements in emerging market 
currencies
.6 The standard model in which exchange rate chan
ges are related to 
interest rate differentials is augmented by two components. One, which can be called 
a ﬁdollar factorﬂ, aims to identify the effect of developments in the United States on 
emerging market currencies. It is added by inserting a component 
into the regression 
which measures the average change in emerging market exchange rates against the 
US dollar. Since a purely US
-based shock might be expected to have a similar effect 
on all US dollar bilateral exchange rates, looking at changes that are c
ommon to a 
number of such exchange rates should reveal shocks that are specific to the US 
dollar.
7 The second component accounts for risk
-driven movements in emerging 
market currencies which do not stem directly from US shocks and is generally labelled 
in 
the literature as the ﬁcarry factorﬂ. It is defined as the difference between exchange 
rate changes of high
-yielding currencies and those of low
-yielding currencies. When 
investors engage in carry trades 
Œ i.e. sell assets in low
-yielding currencies to buy
 assets in high
-yielding currencies 
Œ they become exposed to global risks through the 
exchange rate. This is because high
-interest rate currencies tend to depreciate during 
periods of economic downturn or adverse risk sentiment. Therefore, when global risk
 rises, the difference in exchange rate returns between the two portfolios widens, 
mechanically making this component highly correlated with global risk. Adding these 
two variables to the baseline model significantly increases the share of variation in 
eme
rging market currencies that can be explained.
8 The residual element that is not 
explained by these global or US factors reflects country
-specific developments. It may 
include developments not entirely captured by short
-term money market rates such as 
dome
stic political instability, changes in expectations of the future path of the domestic 
economy or market sentiment towards the currency.
 This model suggests that the sell
-off during the first 
eight months
 of 2018 was 
mainly driven by spillovers from the U
nited 
States
 and rising global risk 
aversion (
see Chart 
C). In the period to August 2018, the decomposition highlights 
two main forces behind the depreciation of emerging market currencies against the 
US dollar: spillovers from US shocks and global risk. Th
is is in line with the tightening 
of financial conditions in emerging markets and rising US yields observed over the 
same period. Notable outliers are Turkey and Argentina, where domestic political 
tensions are likely to have been the main drivers of excha
nge rate developments. The 
model also shows that domestic monetary policies 
Œ aimed at increasing interest rate 
                                                                    5  Verdelhan, A., ﬁThe Share of Systemic Variation in Bilateral Exchange Ratesﬂ, 
Journal of 
Finance
, Vol. 
73, No 1, 2018.
 6  This model is design to analyse floating currencies of countries with free capital mobility. Clearly, if the 
exchange rate is controlled (for example it is pegged to the US dollar), its variations cannot be explained 
directly by macroeconomic developments.
 7  A simple average of bilateral exchange rates is preferred to the US dollar nominal effective exchange rate 
because the latter could be driven by shocks to the bilateral exchange rates of large trading partners of 
the United States.
 8  The additional regressors increase the in
-sample fit of the model from 0.02% to 27% over the entire 
sample and to almost 40% for advanced economies.

 that spillovers from the U

global risk aversion were the main contributors to the widening in spreads, with 
a more limited role being played by the

 NFC spreads. The model is estimated 
using daily data over the period since July 2006.
 Last observation: 
21 March
 2019.
 The global risk factor is dominant 
in explaining widening NFCs spreads 
over 
the fourth quarter of 
2018. Other risk asset markets also declined over this period, 
as shown by a significant fall in 
NFC equity prices
. One dividend discount model 
suggests that the decline in equity prices was 
not primarily driven by downward 
revisio
ns to analyst
s™ expectations regarding future corporate profitability, but by an 
increase in 
equity 
risk premia. 
Thus the increase in the global risk component was 
likely related to a broader deterioration in risk sentiment across risk asset markets. 
The s
ource of this was most likely a 
rise
 in macroeconomic and political uncertainty, 
primarily in relation to global trade disputes. Since the turn of the year, 
the 
global 
risk 
fac
tor has again been prominent in driving the moderation of spreads
, reflecting a 
broad
-based return of 
risk to a swathe of risk asset markets, including credi
t and 
equity markets. This was spurred by dissipation 
in perceived risks, supported by the 
communication by the Federal Open Market Committee 
at its January meeting
 that it 
would 
be patient with future adjustments to its policy rate.
 The contribution of euro area monetary policy to the widening
 of corporate 
spreads is limited
. The BVAR model suggest
s that only 5 basis points of the total 60 
basis 
point
s of widening in corporate bon
d spreads can be attributed to euro area 
monetary policy. This conclusion is also supported by other evidence. 
Throughout 
2018, spreads 
in both CSPP eligible and ineligible bonds increased by
 a similar 
magnitude
. 
This stands in contrast to developments
 fol
lowing the announcement of 
the CSPP in March 2016, 
at which point 
spreads 
in eligible bonds fell 
to a greater 
extent than
 those of ineligible bonds

 The predictive power of real M1 for real economic activity in the euro area
  35 4 The predictive power of real M1 for real economic activity 
in the euro area
 Prepared by Alberto Musso
 Real M1
 growth in the euro area has been moderating in recent quarters, adding 
to concerns about the economic outlook given the robust relationship between 
the business cycle and narrow money.
 This box shows that the leading and 
pro
-cyclical properties of real M1
 for real GDP remain a robust stylised fact in the euro 
area.
 Moreover, there are indications that
 these properties reflect the 
predictive 
capacity
 of narrow money, beyond the influence of interest rates
. At the current 
juncture, 
models exploiting the pred
ictive power of real M1 
suggest that
 the 
steady 
decline 
in real M1 growth 
from its most recent peak in mid
-2017 points 
to 
very 
low risks 
of recession in the euro area up to
 the beginning of 2020.
 The leading and pro
-cyclical properties of real M1 with resp
ect to real GDP in 
the euro area remain a robust stylised fact.
 These properties
, which can be found 
for the relationship between real narrow money and real economic activity in both 
levels and growth rates, 
have been documented in variou
s publications for
 earlier time 
periods.
13 An illustration of such 
properties
 can be derived from a 
visual 
examination
 of monthly data from January 1970 to 
February
 2019 for annual growth in 
real M1
, 
which is defined as the nominal narrow money aggregate M1 deflated by the H
ICP. 
Specifically, it is notable that this growth rate went
 well into negative territory for 
prolonged periods just before (or in coincidence with) all historical 
euro area 
recessions
, as 
dated by the CEPR Euro Area Business Cycle Dating 
Committee (
see 
Cha
rt A).
                                                                     13  See for example Brand, C., Reimers, H.

. In terms of turning points in the levels of real M1 and real GDP, s
tatistical 
indicators suggest that 
the lead and pro

M1 in relation to peaks and troughs in real GDP represent
 a historical regularity.
 Indeed
, 
concordance indices
14 calculated at different leads and lags
 indicate
 that 
turning points in real M1 tend to lead turning point
s in real GDP by four quarters

estimated to spend almost 90% of the time in the same business cycle

the fourth quarter of

the first 
quarters of 
1970, 1980, 1990 and 1999, respectively
. Empirical evidence suggests that the predictive power of 
real 
M1 for real output 
in the euro area is not 
simply a reflection of information contained in
 the yield 
curve.
 Against the background 
of the ample evidence pointing to the leading 
properties of the slope of the yield curve for predicting recessions, it is natural to ask to 
what extent the leading and pro
-cyclical properties of real M1 are driven by the pattern 
of the yield curve 
Œ and to
 what extent controlling for yield curve constellations would 
obviate 
narrow 
money as a predictor for economic activity. 
Historical data for the euro 
area suggests that the slope of the yield curve exhibits a positive co
-movement with 
respect to real M1, w
ith a lead of two quarters. 
In line with this historical regularity, 
concordance indices at different leads and lags indicate that 
turning points in the slope 
of the yield curve tend to lead turning points in real GDP by 
six quarters
, on average, 
and that,
 with that lead
, the slope of the yield curve and real GDP are estimated to 
spend a
bout 60% of the time in the same business cycle 
phase (
see 
Chart C).
 This 
regularity reflects the fact that interest rates
 do indeed
 represent key variables in 
driving portf
olio decisions by households and
 non-financial corporations. However, it 
does not necessarily imply that the predictive power of real M1 for real economic 
activity in general, and 
for 
recession risks 
in particular
, is 
entirely
 driven by its relation 
to
 the
 yield curve. In fact, 
the 
concordance

stronger degree of co

l econometric analysis based on 
probit
 models exploiting the predictive power of real M1 does not point to significant 
recessionary risks in the euro area for 2019
 and early 2020
. On the basis of
 data 
since
 1970, 
the probability of a contraction in euro ar
ea real GDP derived from a probit 
model based on real M1 (lagged by 12 months) increased sharply before
 all 
previous 
euro area recessi
ons (
see 
Chart D), pr
oviding strong evidence o
f the usefulness of 
narrow money 
in predict
ing
 recessions in the euro area. 
Forecasts based on this 
model point to recession risks increasing slightly
 in 2019
, from about 1% in January 
2019 to between 
5% and 
7% in the second half of 2019
 before
 falling to below 5% in 
February 2020, that is to say
 remaining very low (
blue line
). Controlling for the slope of 
the yield curve changes results only marginally (
yellow
 line). 
Overall, the current level 
of real M1 growth is still comfortably above the zone that would be associated with 
risks of a recession in the near future.

been influenced by spec
ial factors, including cash pooling effects and the Eurosystem™s asset purchase 
programme, what matters for the assessment of the recessionary risks are turning points in the level of 
real M1 rather than those in the annual growth of real M1. Since real M1

 1 The 
economic 
impli

area and global perspective
 Prepared
 by Vanessa Gu
nnella and Lucia Quaglietti
 The risk of a trade war came sharply into focus in 2018, as protectionist threats by the 
US 
Administration and its trad
ing
 partners 
were followed by concrete actions
. 
Tensions 
rose
 over
 the summer and, while 
these have been 
defused
 on some fronts, 
the risk of further escalation remains material
. 
The impact of 
the measures 
implemented so far
 on the global and euro area economic outlooks
 is expected to 
remain contained
. However,
 large negative effects could materialise
 if trade tensions 
were to escalate 
further
. 
Uncertain
ty
 relat
ed to protectionism is weighing on economic 
sentiment
 and it
 may raise further
, potentially eroding
 confidence 
and affecting the 
euro area and
 the
 global economy more significantly. The complexi
ty of intertwined 
international production chains could also magnify the impact. Against this backdrop, 
th
is article reviews the changes in the trade policy landscape over the past decade
. It 
discusses the macroeconomic implications of the recent surge in 
protectionism and 
evaluates the possible effects that an escalation in trade tensions could have on the 
global economy and the euro area.
 1 Introduction
 Trade integration has slowed over the last decade
. The process of trade 
integration started after 
the Second 
World War. It gained
 new impetus in the 1980s 
and had a
 golden age in the period 1990
-2008, when total trade in goods and services 
increased from 39% to 61% of world GDP. Since then, trade has slowed (
to its
 current
 58% of world GDP)
, while prot
ectionism has been on the rise, driven by an increase 
in non-tariff and, more recently, tariff barriers. At the same time, public support for 
globalisation has declined on both sides of the Atlantic. 
While factors such as Brexit 
and Euroscepticism have cha
llenged the principles of freedom of movement and 
economic integration in Europe, the benefits of free trade have been openly called into 
question in the United States. 
Trade tensions escalated in 2018 and, as protectionist 
threats by the US 
Administration
 and retaliatory responses by its main trad
ing
 partners 
were followed by concrete actions
, the risk of a trade war 
came
 sharply into focus.
 Rising protectionism could harm trade and activity.
 There is widespread 
consensus among economists on both the overa
ll net benefits of trade openness and 
the need to 
cushion
 the 
negative impact it has had on certain
 groups in society
. 
However, raising 
trade barriers
 is not the 
solution to the latter
. R
eversing 
trade 
integration
 may
 put at risk the net economic gains 
tha
t it generated
. 
By unravelling the 
long
-term benefits of closer trade and investment links
, 
retreating into protectionism 
also 
has the potential to unsettle global financial markets.

 2 A changing trade policy landscape
 The trade policy landscape has undergone 
a significant tran
sformation over the 
last decade
. The 
drive
 toward
s economic integration 
that
 characterised previous 
decades has
 now faded, 
which is evident in the slow 
pace of trade growth
 in recent 
years. 
Having expanded at approximately twice the rate of global GDP in the years 
leading up to
 the global financial crisis
, the ratio of average imports to GDP growth 
Œ or 
the income elasticity of 
trade 
Œ has fallen to around 
1 since 2011.
17 By 2016 
there was 
a growing consensus that lower trade growth had become a permanent feature of the 
world economy. 
For example, 
ECB
 analysis
18 concluded that global trade was unlikely 
to revert to 
its
 pre
-crisis 
trend 
and th
at post
-2011 developments constitute a ﬁnew 
normalﬂ.
 Several reasons have been identified
 that
 explain the recent decline in trade 
activity
, including compositional effects and structural factors.
 Analysis by the 
ECB and
 the International 
Monetary Fund (
IMF)
19 suggest
s that geographical shifts in 
economic activity and changes in the composition of aggregate demand (e.g. to 
services, which are less
 trade intensive
, although they are becoming increasingly 
more so
) may have been weighing on the
 sensitivity of trade to economic activity. 
Specifically, 
it is
 found that a
round
 half
 of the slowdown in trade elasticity between the 
periods 1995
-2007 and 2012
-16 was due to
 composition
al factors
, namely the 
growing weight in the world economy of emergin
g market countries, which typically 
have 
a lower trade intensity 
than
 advanced economies. 
Moreover, c
ountries such as 
China have progressively moved from being assemblers of foreign inputs
 to 
relying 
                                                                    17  In countries that are not financially globali
sed, investment must be funded 
by
 domestic
 savings. In 
countries that are financially globali
sed, investment can also b
e funded through borrowing from abroad, 
hence
 domestic investment and domestic savings 
are not
 as closely
 correlated
. The
 correlation between 
domestic savings and investment across OECD countries bounced back to almost 70% in 2017, from 
less than 50% betwe
en 2000 and 2006 
Œ a further sign that 
the
 process of de
-globalisation might 
have 
be
come
 entrenched

 Steadily

 the 
decline in trade activity.

 levelled off

recent months
.22 At the same time,
 the use of regulatory measures and non
-tariff 
barriers such as export subsidies, restrictions on licensing or 
foreign direct investment,
 and domestic clauses in p
ublic procurement
, has increased, leading to a
n overall
 surge in trade distortions

umber of new

 23  Trade polic
ies
 have 
been driven by 
unilateral actions. 
Since
 the Doha trade round
 came to a 
standstill
, countries have increasingly relied on preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in order to gain access to new 
markets and resolve trade
-related issues that are currently not addressed within the World Trade 
Organization 
(WTO
). The number of PTAs surged from 5
0 in the early 1990s to around 200 in the early 
2000s. All WTO members have concluded at least one PTA; some, such as the European Union, Chile 
and Mexic
o, have concluded more than 20.

 The economic implications of rising protectionism: a euro area and global perspective
  43 of 
measures imposed. 
The use of i
ndirect measures
, such as state loans to exporting 
companie
s, has also increased gradually.
 The 
rise in protectionism implies that a progressively larger 
share of global 
trade 
has been affec
ted by 
trade distortions.
 Data from the Global Trade Alert 
database show that b
y 2017 more than 
50% of exports from 
G20 countries was 
subject to 
harmful
 trade measures, up from 
20% in 20
09 (see 
Chart 1
). Accordingly, 
tr
ade growth has decelerated 
more
 sharp
ly in those sectors 
in which
 extensive 
discriminatory measures 
have been
 adopted
 than in 
sectors 
that
 have 
benefited from 
trade liberalisation.
 Along with these developments, public support for trade openness has 
declined, 
while protectionism
 has increased
 globall
y. Perceptions 
of the risks 
associated with
 open trade have added to the broader list of concerns related to 
globalisation.
25 For example, free trade is sometimes believed to have made 
countries more vulnerable to international crises and spillovers
 from abroad. Given its 
distributional consequences, free trade is also 
considered to be
 a factor behind 
the 
rising inequality both within and across countries.
26 However,
 the merits of free trade 
are also widely
 recognised. 
International trade allows count
ries to specialise 
in the
 production 
of goods in which they have a comparative advantage, while at the same 
time enabling 
consumers to enjoy a greater variety of consumption goods.
 Empirical 
studies have found that t
rade openness 
has led to higher 
income per capita 
across 
countries, spurring
 productivity
 growth
 and help
ing
 to 
reduc
e poverty 
globally.
27 Nevertheless, 
the benefits 
of trade openness a
nd their distribution across social 
groups
 vary between countries
. Factors 
such as
 the nature of export 
specialisation, 
the degree of production diversification and the quality of 
a country™s institutions are 
found to be important pre
-conditions for
 the benefits of
 trade openness to 
be fully 
realised.
28 Some have also
 challeng
ed the benefits of free trad
e by 
claim
ing
 that 
ﬁunfair practicesﬂ have damaged domestic growth and job creation.

 4 The macroeconomic implications of rising protectionism
 This section discusses the
 short and long
-term macroeconomic implications of rising 
protectionism from a theoretical and 
a model
-based perspective. 
Section 4.1 
describes
 the channels through which higher tariffs m
ay affect activity and trade. 
In 
view of the
 progressive deterioratio
n in global and euro area activity and trade data in 
recent months, 
Section 
4.2
 investigates whether the tariff measures implemented in 
2018 m
ight
 have 
been a 
contribut
ing factor
, including 
as a result of uncertainty effects. 
Finally, S
ection 
4.3 
discusses the possible consequences of a 
renewed
 surge in trade 
tensions.
 4.1
 Channels of transmission of rising protectionism
 Rising protectionism can affect economic activity through several channels.
 Higher import duties increase trade costs, 
which may 
alter both
 the 
quantity and 
the 
price of internationally traded goods. 
This
 is often referred to as the trade channel of 
transmission. 
The existence of complex 
global production supply chains
 can amplify 
th
is effect. 
In addition
, higher 
trade costs
 can aff
ect financial flows and
 credit 
conditions
. This 
may
 occur
, for example,
 if 
increased
 uncertainty 
over
 future trade 
policy leads to financial stress and a broad reassessment of ri
sk premia. T

 The economic implications of rising protectionism: 
a euro area and global perspective
  48 economic activity
, depends on several factors, including
 whether
 trading partners 
retaliate and
 whether the dispute 
remains confined 
to a small number of countries, 
rather than developing
 into a full
-blown trade war.
 The impa
ct on 
economic 
activity 
in the country imposing tariffs 
depends on a) 
whether imported goods can be substituted by domestic production
, and b) 
whether trad
ing
 partners retaliate.
 To the extent that 
the 
higher trade costs brought 
about by higher tariffs are not absorbed in lower profit margins 
for
 producers, import 
prices rise and relative prices change. Higher import prices 
push up
 domestic firms™ 
production costs and domestic inflation, 
thereby 
lowering
 households™ real disposable 
income. These effects weigh on consumption, investment and employment, 
and have
 a n
egative impact on activity. However
, 
the 
higher prices of imported goods m
ay also 
induce domestic customers to switch from imported to domes
tica
lly produced goods
. 
The relative importance of these two effects
, and the net impact on economic growth
, depends on the degree of substitutability between domestically produced goods and 
imported goods. If imported goods can be easily substituted through d
omestic 
production, consumption and activity rise.
33 The positive impact on activity could be 
lessened if the exchange rate appreciates following the increase in import prices.
34 In 
addition
, if
 the 
trad
ing
 partners 
hit
 by the tariffs retaliate
 Œ as 
is often
 the case
 Œ any 
potential benefit could be reversed. D
omestic firms
 lose c
ompetitiveness in foreign 
markets, and exports and activity fall as a result. As such, rising trade distortions imply 
higher trade costs for all countries involved, which may hinder 
the optimal allocation of 
resources. All economies involved are, in the end, worse off.
 In a trade dispute involving two countries, t
hird countries m
ay temporarily 
benefit from rising protectionism
. Specifically, 
third countries can gain market 
share in co
untries 
where
 tariffs 
have 
risen
. For example, in a trade dispute concerning 
exclusively the United States and China, euro area goods would gain competitiveness 
vis
-à-vis US goods in China and vis
-à-vis Chinese goods in the United States. This 
stem
s from t
he fact that higher tariffs make US goods more expensive in China and 
Chinese goods more expensive in the United States, with bilateral trade flows 
between the two eventually declining. The extent to which third countries benefit from 
this trade diversion 
depends on how easily a country can substitute imported products 
from 
different countries
. 
Higher
 substitutability 
implies
 more 
trade diversion.

 economic literature
, the dynamic effects
 of protectionism are similar to a negative 
supply
-side shock
, as its effects are recessionary
 and
 inflationary, with 
an 
ambiguous or minor 
impact
 on 
the trade
 balance. S

ﬁExporter™s value added that goes to the United States through other countriesﬂ is the value added in intermediate products p
roduced by 
an exporter which is used by third countries to produce goods to be exp
orted to the United States. For the euro area aggregate, only 
extra
-euro area countries are considered as other countries. The following abbreviations are used: CA for Canada, CN for China, MX 
for 
Mexico, JP for Japan and KR for South Korea.
 While the pace
 of expansion might have slowed in recent years, GVCs
 remain
 highly fragmented and 
can amplify the 
impact
 of tariffs on 
trade
 and activity.
 GVCs have become increasingly 
complex,
 with goods crossing borders multiple times 
during the production process. Although
 analysis
35 by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
suggests that 
GVCs™
 pace 
of expansion 
might have slowed since 2011, 
production remains highly
 fragmented across borders
. This is well illustrated in
 Chart 5, which co
nsiders the GVC linkages embodied in 
exports of goods to the United States from several trad
ing
 partners. In the case of the 
euro area, o
nly around one
-third of exports are consumed i
n the United States (
see 
the blue part
s in Chart 5). In fact, a significant share of euro area exports to the United 
States consists of intermedia
te goods which are used in the production of goods in the 
United 
States
 and then re
-exported to third countrie
s (see the 
yellow pa
rts in Chart 5). 
In turn, d
omestic production and exports include intermediate inputs from third 
countries. For example, euro area exports to the U
nited 
States
 include
 goods from 
countries 
that
 are closely embedded in European productio
n chains, such as, for 
instance 
central and eastern European
 countries in the automobile sector (
see the 
grey
 part
s in Chart 5). Euro area exports also include value added from the United 
States itself (
see 
the red part
s in Chart 5). Finally, euro area exp
orts are sometimes 
first shipped for processing to third countries, such as Mexico, before being exported 
to the United States (
see 
the blue
-shaded part
s in 
Chart 
5).

 The economic implications of rising protectionism: a euro area and global perspective
  50 In
 a world characterised by 
complex GVCs
, goods cross borders several times
 and
 tariff
 costs
 accumulate 
owing to
 the
 cascading effect
. This occurs when
 tariffs are applied to intermediate goods. Intermediate inputs incur tariff costs every 
time they are shipped to another country for further processing
. B
y the time the 
finished good
s have
 reach
ed the final consumer, the final price 
may have risen
 significantly
. Moreover, 
imported intermediate goods are often used in domestic 
production. 
When these goods are subject to tariffs, 
domestic producers in the country 
imposing the tariffs 
may
 also
 suffer
. Higher production costs 
are likely to be
 passed 
on through
 the various stages of the value chain, with demand, production and 
investment
 being
 negatively affected in all phases. In addition, tariffs are typically 
levied on a good™s gross value of 
imported goods. Therefore, if foreign inputs account 
for a large share of exports, a low nominal tariff can translate into a high value
-added tariff for the exporter. Compared 
with
 a situation in which the 
entire
 value added of 
goods is produced domestical
ly, tariffs m
ay have
 a proportionally larger impact on 
the 
profits of exporting firms,
 thereby increasing
 the incentive to pass
 the higher costs on 
through the 
value chain. 
Third
 countries involved in intermediate stages of production
 may
 also face
 higher
 production costs, 
reducing the
 possible benefits 
of trade 
diversion.
 An increase in uncertainty
, coupled with financial stress
, could also amplify the 
impact of rising protectionism on economic activity
. There are several ways in 
which elevated uncertainty
 about future trade policies can dampen demand. 
For 
example, households 
may delay
 spending when economic prospects become more 
uncertain
. Furthermore, f
irms 
may 
reassess their 
economic 
prospects
 amid rising 
uncertainty, taking a ﬁ
wait and see
ﬂ approach and 
postpon
ing
 investment.
36 In 
response to uncertainty shocks, firms can 
also 
adjust their inventory policies by 
disproportionately cutting their
 foreign
 orders 
of 
intermediate
 goods, 
with a 
disproportionate impact on international trade flows.
37 An uncertain trade policy 
outlook 
may also give 
firms a reason to delay ent
ering
 a foreign market 
or upgrad
ing
 the
ir technology. 
Finally, elevated uncertainty may push up borrowing costs for 
households and firms as investors demand greater compensation 
to p
rotect 
themselves 
against future risks.
38 The materialisation of a global uncertainty shock
, such as a trade war
, may 
also drive
 investors to shift their 
portfolio
s to safe
-haven 
currencies
, with implications for the allocation of capital flows across count
ries.
 Higher 
trade costs 
can 
also weigh on productivity.
 The tighter
 financing conditions
 associated with rising uncertainty can raise the cost of capital, with a negative impact 
on investment that could hinder productivity growth in the countries affected
 by the 
tariffs. T
rade barriers can 
also 
lead to 
the 
misallocation of production factors across 
firms and countries.

 Can

detect
ed in the data? Some initial 
evidence
 In the United States, f
irms o
perating in the targeted sectors 
seem to have
 initially circumvent
ed part of the adverse
 impact of
 tariff
s by frontloading their 
imports.
 US imports from China 
of 
products targeted by the US tariffs 
increased
 before the tariffs came into effect and decline
d in the afterma
th (
see 
Chart 6).
40 Total 
US imports 
also rose
 sharply
, by 9.1% 
year 
on year in the third quarter of 2018
, partly 
reflecting firms™ stockpil
ing
. The increase was associated with a surge in inventories, 
while business investment 
declined
. 
Alt
hough this suggests the presence of 
frontloading effects,
 the sharp rise in imports 
may also reflect
 buoyant US domestic 
demand on the back of procyclical fiscal stimul
i and strong labour market conditions.

 Trade diversion effects m

The latest observation is

 September 2018.
 The impact of rising tariffs on financial markets appears to have remained 
confined to the targeted sectors.
 Global financial markets have 
generally been 
resilient to 
the 
announcements of new tariff
s. This may reflect the fact that the
y have 
thus far 
target
ed only a small fraction of gl
obal trade. At the same time, 
US 
companies 
potentially affected by higher tariffs
, such as those
 highly exposed to regions outside 
the United States in terms of revenue generation
, have 
clearly 
underperfor
med (
see 
Chart
 8). 
An 
analysis
 by the ECB
 indicates that underperformance in the affected 
sectors can almost always be traced back to changes in risk premia, whereas 
fundamentals 
Œ such as earnings expectations a
nd credit risk 
Œ do not change much.

five
 underlying sectors in the S&P 500
 for which trade and value added data w

(Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples and Information Technology) and 20% of the total market 
capitali
sation of the S&P 500. The NAICS classifi
cations used constitute 58% of the total US trade in goods in 2016.
 Beside
s its
 impact on financial markets, rising protectionism can also affect 
sentiments more broadly
. 
Recent survey
-based indicators point 
to some tangible 
moderation in 
activity in 
China
, with trade disputes often 
being identified
 as one 
of the 
factor
s contributing to 
the 
weak Chinese investment 
seen 
in recent quarters. 
However,
 th
is decline in investment
 might also 
have 
been driven by tighter domestic credit 
conditions. As discussed in 
Section 4.1, the extent to which Asian economies
™ exports 
to China are embedded in China
™s exports to the United States (
e.g.
 as components 
of Chinese products), US tariffs could also impinge on their exports via the regional value 
chain. There seems to be 
a negative correlation between the exposures of Asian 
countries to the Chinese
-US supply chain and 
the 
changes in countries™ 
manufacturing 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) since January 2018, which 
suggests that rising 
tariffs m
ay be affecting sentiment ac
ross the region (see Chart
 9). In the United States
, consumer and business confidence indicators have fallen somewhat in recent months, 
although they 
remain close to historically high levels. US firms, however,
 have
 become 
increasingly worried about the ef
fects of trade tensions, and a 
number of companies
 report
 that they
 have reassessed their capital investment plans in 
the 
light of tariff

external demand for euro area goods.
 Extra
-euro area exports have 
been particular
ly weak since the start of 2018, with the decline

 by a

™ investment growth and
, historically
, tend to display a relatively high negative 
correlation with some measures of uncertainty, such as the VIX
43. While this suggests 
that uncertainty related to rising protectionism might have affec
ted euro area exports, 
it is difficult to disentangle this possible effect from other factors
, including
 the 
introduction of new emission standards in Europe
, specific adverse changes 
to

 What m
ight
 be the impact of a 
renewed
 escalation of trade 
tensions? Some model
-based simulations
 The risks
 related to a further ex
acerbation of trade tensions remain prominent, 
as more concrete actions could follow.
 To assess the 
impact of a 
renewed
 escalation of trade tensions, this subsection investigates 
the 
scenario 
of 
a hypothetical 
trade war in which the United States increases
 ta
riff and non
-tariff barriers on
 imports 
from all trading partners 
by 10%, and the other countries retaliate symmetrically. The 
impact would
, of course
, be much more pronounced in 
the 
case of 
a free
-for
-all, 
full
-blown trade war
. 
 Despite their 
limitations, model
-based estimates 
can help 
to gaug
e some of the 
medium and long
-term implications of an escalation in trade tensions
. Two 
different methodologies are used to shed light on both medium and long
-term 
outcomes. The IMF™s Global Integrated Mon
etary and Fiscal Model (GIMF)
46, in 
combination with the ECB™s G
lobal model
47, are employed to investigate the effects of 
a trade war scenario over a medium
-term horizon. Under this scenario
, not only trade, 
but also confidence effects are assessed

 The economic implications of rising protectionism: a euro area and global perspective
  57 equilibrium model is used. 
In this model, 
tariff and non
-tariff barriers are 
assumed to be 
10% higher on a permanent basis, thereby 
allowing
 long
-term 
predictions
 to be 
made.
49 In the simulations of medium
-term effects, 
an escalation of trade tensions
 might have a 
significant 
direct 
impact
 on US activity, compounded by 
heightened financial stress and a drop in confidence.
 An increase in tariff and 
non-tar
iff barriers
 on imports induces domestic consumers and firms to switch to 
domestically produced goods. However, this effect is likely t
o be more than offset by 
the 
increase in prices and 
the
 reduction in exports resulting from 
the 
retaliatory 
measures 
take
n by
 all trading partners. 
Consequently
, the direct effects on US GDP 
are negative and could lower activity by 1.5% (relative to the baseline after the first 
year). Confidence effects
 stemming from
 a tightening 
of financing condition
s could 
depress US GDP
 further. For the purpose of this scenario, confidence effects are
 simulated assum
ing
 an increase in corporate bond risk premia of 50 basis points and a 
fall in stock prices of two standard deviations in all countries
.50 Although some countries m
ay initially
 benefit from trade diversion, global trade 
and 
global 
activity are expected to decline significantly.
 Chinese producers may 
improve their
 competitiveness in third countries 
vis
-à-vis
 US producers, as all US 
trading partners would 
raise tariff and non
-tari
ff barriers
 on imports from the United 
States in the simulated scenario
 (see Chart 12 for the first
-year effects).
 Therefore, in 
this simulation
, the trade effects on China™s GDP are slightly positive (+0.6%) and 
are 
only partially outweighed by confidence
 effects. Turning to the euro area, despite 
some possible gains in export market shares, the spillovers arising from the 
deterioration in global confidence would most 
probably
 outweigh the gains in 
competitiveness, thus causing an overall 
modest 
decrease i
n activity. Finally, global 
trade an
d global activity 
could fall by more than 2
.5
% and 1% respectively 
as a result 
of the combined negative effects via 
the 
trade and 
the 
financial channels
.                                                                     49  While measures are assumed to be in place for 
only 
two years when assessing the medium
-term effects, 
in the steady
-state simulations it is presumed that all substitutions and adjustments have 
been made
, given that increases in trade costs are pe
rmanent.
 50  The results of the simulations are predicated on
 some important modelling choices.
 Trade
 disputes 
are 
assumed to 
last only two years
, and it is 
assume
d that
 additional fiscal revenues generated by tariff 
increases are used to reduce budget deficits rather than to support demand. 
Monetary 
policy and 
exchange rates are assumed to react e
ndogenously in all countries. The results should therefore be 
treated with a
 degree of caution.

 Heightened trade tensions

ce effects

 some production processes c
ould

ould
 be severely affected
, with real 
exports declining by 26.6% 
and
 imports decreas
ing
 to a l
esser
 extent (22.8%), with an 
overall negative net trade effect on activity. The 
large impact on US flows 
reflects the 
fact
 that US exports to and imports from all trading partners face higher tariffs. 
By 
contrast, 
China is likely to incur more limited lo
sses (
see 
Chart 13), a
s lower exports to 
the United States are partly offset by higher exports to those countries 
in which
 China 
has improved its
 price competitiveness vis
-à-vis US producers. Similarly, other 
countries could 
improve their
 competitiveness in Chinese markets at the expense of 
the United States
, replacing them as a source of exports to China.

. 52  The estimated impact on trade is sensitive to the choice 
of trade elasticities. The 
rather sizeable 
response of trade volumes to higher tariffs 
in our simulations 
reflects the specific characteristics of this 
class of models. It is well documented
 in the academic literature that standard macroeconomic models 
fin
d lower price elasticities than models estimated at 
the 
sectoral level. Aggregating those sectoral 
elasticities to the country level leads to higher elasticities
, which are heterogeneous across countries and 
depend on the

1  Assessing the impact of the threat 
of 
auto tariffs on the global economy and the
 euro area
 Prepared b
y Vanessa Gunnella
 This box assesses the possible impact of an increase in tariffs on automotive imports to the 
United States.
 The simulations assume an increase 
in tariffs on US car imports from all trading 
partners except Canada and Mexico
.53 Trading partners would retaliate symmetrically
54. Vehicle production is organised in very complex cross
-border supply chains.
 Sector 
interconnectedness is extremely high across
 the
 countries
 party to the 
United States
-Mexico
-Canada 
Agreement
 (USMCA
). Taken together, vehicles assembled in Canada and Mexico and exported to 
the United States contain 
levels of 
US value added as high as 22% (
see the 
red pa
rt in Chart A).
 Conversely, v
ehicles imported from Japan, Korea and Germany 
have
 little US content (around 2%). 
Exports to the United States also consist of intermediate inputs used by the US domestic vehicle 
industry to produce cars for domestic consumption and export (
see the 
yellow
 part i
n Chart A). 
Therefore, while 
tariffs on US car imports could 
be discriminatory against
 foreign producers, US 
domestic production and exports could also suffer from the increase in 
the prices of 
car parts 
(proportionately to the red and the yellow
 parts in Chart A). In particular, foreign carmakers exporting 
                                                                    53  A side agreement 
within the USMCA trade deal excludes the application of Section 232 tariffs (inclu
ding a 
potential auto tariff) on Canada and Mexico.
 54  Specifically, countries hit by the 25% tariff on cars would retaliate by targeting the US car sector and by 
raising tariffs on the products that had previously been involved in retaliatory action.

 The steady

s on US vehicle imports 
would be concentrated 
in 
the car sector.
 Simulations performed using the

model
 described above suggest that 
US consumers 
could
 switc
h to vehicles 
produced in the 
United 
States or 
in Mexico and Canada (which are not subject to the tariff measure)
 and the production of 
vehicles would be partly relocated 
there.
 As a consequence, 
the car industry in 
the United States 
would increase its 
val
ue added
 by 12%
 (0.1% of US nominal value added) as
, also
, would 
Canada 
and Mexico (14
% and 10% 
increase in value added 
respectively). In terms of value added, the 
Japanese and the euro area car sector
s would incur a loss 
of around 10% and 4% respectively. 
Retaliatory tariffs and the increase in input prices could affect other sectors in the United States, 
thereby offsetting the 
positive 
effect
 arising from gains in competitiveness for US car producers.
 The e
ffects of tariffs
 are amplified by the car industry™s cross

 Chart B compares the we

understate the welfare effects by at least 10% in the case of the euro area. The amplifying effects of 
GVCs are even more evident in the case of the United States,

imported intermediate inputs. The role of GVC
s is particularly interesting in the case of Canada. 
Without accounting for GVC effects, Canada would 
experience
 some gains in terms of welfare.

 Overall, the impact of rising tariffs on cars is assessed 
as being
 more pronounced for 
car-exporting countries and could be intensified by confidence effects.
 Although
 world unit 
production of cars is large, the auto industry accounts for 
only 
a small share of value added

countries. 
It is estimated that t

t on the euro area as a whole 
would be
 small, 
even
 when the 
magnifying effects of global supply chains are taken into account.
 However
, the consequences of an 
increase in car tariffs m
ay weigh 
significantly
 on some countries. 
It is assessed that a
 possible
 increase in tariffs 
would
 have some negative effects in the United States and in th

 a large exposure to the US market

South 
Korea and Japan. 
In addition, c

could 
have a

  5 Conclusions
 Taken in isolation, the repercussions of the tariffs implemented in 2018 pose 
only a modest adverse risk to the global and euro area outloo
ks. Preliminary 
evidence indicates that, in order to circumvent the effect
s of rising tariffs, firms 
operating in the targeted sectors may have been frontloading their import orders.

 The economic implications of rising protectionism: a euro area and global perspective
  62 While trade flows in the affected sectors may have started to decelerate after the tariffs 
came into effect, particularly in China, the 
impact
 of implemented tariffs and tariff 
announcements 
owing to
 uncertainty effects appears to have remained c
onfined to
 the targeted sectors for the time being.
 If trade tensions 
were to 
escalate
 once again
, however, the
 impact
 would 
be larger.
 Model
-based simulations indicate that the medium
-term direct impact of 
an escalation
 could
 be sizeable, compounded by heightened f
inancial stress and a drop 
in confidence. Despite some trade diversion effect
s, euro area and global trade and, 
therefore, activity
, would decline. The longer
-term effects
 would be even more 
pronounced.
 Trade liberalisation within the framework of multilat
eral cooperation has been a 
key factor 
driving
 global economic prosperity
. Trade integration helped 
to 
driv
e economic growth in advanced and developing economies in the second part of the 
20th century, 
while also helping to pull hundreds of
 millions 
of 
people out of poverty. 
At 
the same time,
 although 
free trade is 
often 
seen as 
one of the
 factor
s behind rising 
inequality both within and across countries
, w
inding back globalisation is the wrong 
way
 to address
 these negative effects
. 
A retreat from openness 
will only fuel more 
inequality,
 depriving 
people of the undisputed economic advantages that
 trade and 
integration bring
. 
Instead, c
ountries should seek to resolve any trade disputes in 
multilateral for
a. By encouraging regulatory convergence, 
multilateral 
cooperation
 helps 
to 
protect people from the unwelcome c
onsequences of openness, and 
therefore remains crucial as a 
respon
se to concerns about 
the 
fairness and equity of 
trade.
 The distributional and social effects of greater economic integration should 
also be addressed by targeted policies that achieve fairer outcomes
, including, for 
example, redistributive policies
 or adequate training and educational measures

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and

  63 2 Fiscal rules in the euro area
 and lessons from
 other 
monetary unions
 Prepared by Nadine Lein
er-Killinger and Carolin Nerlich
 This article compares the fiscal rule framework in the euro area 
with
 the frameworks
 in 
the fiscally more integrated United States and Switzerland, with the aim 
of draw
ing
 lessons for 
ways in which 
fiscal rules 
could be ref
ormed 
in 
European Economic and 
Monetary Union (
EMU
). Both the United States and Switzerland have a history of 
balanced budget rules that help stabilise government debt in 
individual 
states
/cantons 
at moderate 
and broadly comparable 
levels. The recent shift
 towards balanced budget 
rules in the euro area is an important achievement
 in this direction
, and has contributed to better 
average 
underlying budgetary positions. Still, the fiscal rule 
framework needs to be rendered more effective in reduc
ing
 high 
level
s of government 
debt 
and their 
dispersion across the euro area. 
Reducing the heterogeneity of 
government debt positions
 is also a
n important
 prerequisite for setting up a 
well
-governed 
common macroeconomic stabilisation function at the centre 
of EMU 
in 
case of deep economic crises
. This
 in turn would help
 to
 contain the procyclicality of 
fiscal rules at the country level.
 1 Introduction
 In 
European 
Economic and Monetary Union
 (EMU)
, the single monetary policy 
is complemented by fiscal policies that are 
under the responsibility of national 
governments
. These budgetary policies are subject to a common set of fiscal rules 
and country
-specific arrangements. After the recent financial and economic crisis, 
which followed a period of good economic times that we
re not used sufficiently to build 
up fiscal buffers, the EU™s common fiscal framework was strengthened. Among other 
things, the measures introduced placed a stronger focus on reducing government debt 
ratios to sound levels. They also included a fiscal comp
act, which contains a 
close
-to
-balance provision for countries™ medium
-term budgetary objectives (MTOs). 
Countries must transpose this into national law, preferably at constitutional level.
 While work to further improve the functioning of EMU continues, pr
ogress 
towards more fiscal integration has so far been limited.
55 The 
statement issued 
following the 
Euro Summit of October 2014 
said
 that 
ﬁcloser coordination of economic 
policies is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of 
the Economic and Monetary 
Unionﬂ
 and pointed to the importance of preparing ﬁ
next steps on better economic 
governance in the euro area
ﬂ. Subsequently, the ﬁFive Presidents™ Reportﬂ, issued in 
2015, laid out proposals for completing EMU. It stressed that ﬁP
rogress must happen
 [..] 
to
wards a Fiscal Union that delivers both fiscal sustainability and fiscal 
stabilisation
ﬂ.56 This reflects the fact that, unlike other monetary unions, EMU is not 
                                                                    55  Fiscal integration is defined, for the purposes of this article, as the partial transferral of 
fiscal resources 
and competences in the area of fiscal policy 
to the central level of government from the lower levels. 
Stronger fiscal integration can be 
expected to eventually result in a system of fiscal federalism (see 
Section 4).

from 
the 
fiscal rule frameworks
 that are 
in place in 
other, fiscall
y more

. Specifically, it looks into the fiscal rules that are in place 
in the United States and Switzerland, which are examples of monetary unions with a 
federal structure, fiscal rules at the federal and sub
-federal levels and a
 sizeable 
budget at the centre. Importantly, these monetary unions differ from the euro area in 
that they are also political unions, in the sense of being a single nation or federal state.
 The
 finding
s show that the increased emphasis in the euro area countries on 
balanced budget rules has brought 
EMU
 closer to 
the set
-up in the
 United 
States
 and Switzerland
. These countries have a long history of balanced budget 
rules at the sub
-federal levels, which ha
s led to, overall, lower and less diverse 
government debt ratios than in the euro area. To achieve a comparable outcome, the 
EU™s fiscal framework still needs to be rendered more effective in reducing high 
national government debt burdens. This would make 
the countries in question less 
vulnerable to economic downturns and the euro area as a whole more resilient. 
However, balanced budget rules may make it more difficult for governments to use 
fiscal policy in a sufficiently countercyclical manner, particular
ly in deep economic 
downturns. In other monetary unions, such rules at the sub
-federal levels are 
accompanied by the possibility to stabilise the economy from the centre or, to a lesser 
extent, through ﬁrainy dayﬂ funds at the sub
-federal level.
 This artic
le is structured as follows
. Section 2 takes stock of the main fiscal rules 
governing fiscal policies in the euro area. It concentrates on the fiscal rules 
established at the country level and how they are linked with the common EU 
governance framework. Se
ction 3 describes major fiscal developments since the crisis 
with a view to identifying whether the strengthening of the fiscal governance 
framework has had a perceptible impact. Section 4 captures major features of the 
fiscal rule frameworks that govern b
udgetary policies in the United States and 
Switzerland. On the basis of this analysis, Section 5 aims to inform the discussions on 
how to deepen EMU and how to rectify the shortcomings of the existing fiscal 
framework. Section 6 concludes.
 2 Fiscal rules i
n the euro area
 Fiscal rules are an essential part of the fiscal frameworks needed to achieve 
sound public finances
. Sustainable fiscal positions are particularly important in a 
monetary union, as individual countries cannot use
 monetary and exchange rate 
policies
 to
 respond to country
-specific shocks
. Furthermore, as the recent European 
                                                                    57  For details, see the

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  65 sovereign debt crisis has demonstrated, unsound fiscal positions in one country can 
lead to spillover effects on others, thereby affecting the monetary union as a whole.
 Numerical fiscal rules are widely accepted as supporting the achievement of sound 
fiscal policies and are therefore essential to ensure sustainable public finances. 
Moreover, their positive impact on public finances can be further strengthened through 
market
 discipline (see Box 1). As the experience with the sovereign debt crisis has 
shown, insufficient compliance with fiscal rules in favourable times may come at a high 
cost. If fiscal rules allow too little flexibility in recessions, however, they may constr
ain 
countries´ ability to stabilise their economies during an economic downturn. This is 
likely to be the case especially for countries that have not built up sufficient fiscal 
buffers. It is therefore important that fiscal rules ensure that
 fiscal policie
s are 
sufficiently countercyclical over the business cycle.
58 This calls for structural fiscal 
rules that correct for the impact of cyclical developments. Beyond this, however, some 
form of effective risk sharing, for example through a fiscal capacity at th
e centre of a 
monetary union, appears necessary to combat deep economic recessions.
59 The rationale for fiscal rules is well established in the literature.
 The
ir main 
objective is to 
constrain
 the use of policy discretion in order to promote sound 
budgetary
 policy
-making
 and to overcome the tendency of governments to allow 
deficit and debt levels to increase over time (known as the ﬁdeficit biasﬂ)
. Numerical 
fiscal rules 
are defined for the purposes of this article as 
provid
ing
 a permane
nt 
constraint on fisc
al policy as 
expressed in terms of a summary indicator of fiscal 
performance, such as the government budget deficit, debt or a major 
budgetary 
component
.60 Fiscal policies in the e
uro area countries are 
governed by supranational as well 
as national fiscal 
rules.
 For example, at the supranational level, the euro area 
countries are subject to nominal fiscal rules under the EU™s Stability and Growth Pact 
(i.e. the Maastricht Treaty™s 3% deficit
-to
-GDP and 60% government debt
-to
-GDP 
limits). They are also requi
red to achieve and maintain their country
-specific MTOs, 
which are defined in terms of the structural balance. The structural balance is a key 
indicator for the governance framework in the euro area and reflects a country™s 
underlying budgetary position, w
hich filters out the impact of the business cycle and 
one-off factors on the headline budget balance. Adherence to these supranational 
fiscal rules is governed by the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and 
Growth Pact. Unlike in
 other 
monetary
 unions
, such as the United States and 
Switzerland (see 
Section
 4), the supranational rules apply to national fiscal policies 
and not to a federal budget
. At national level, today™s fiscal rules in the euro area are to 
a large extent determined by the fisc
al compact, which entered into force in 2013.
61                                                                     58  Moreover, it can be argued that fiscal rules may help to build up fiscal space. See for example Nerlich, C.

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  66 The fiscal compact requires countries to have a rule in place to ensure a balanced 
general government budget in structural terms over the medium term and a correction 
mechanism to be automatically triggered in
 the event of significant deviations from the 
fiscal target. This rule is to be transposed into national legislation, preferably at 
constitutional level. In addition, several countries have also their own specific rules 
framework in place.
 Over the past 20
 years the number of national fiscal rules in place has 
approximately tripled in the euro area countries, reflecting in particular an 
increase in balanced budget rules
. Whereas at the beginning of the century there 
were only around 20 national fiscal rules
 altogether in the euro area countries, the 
number has now increased to 62, according to the European Commission™s fiscal rules 
database (see Chart 1). Countries have deployed different types of numerical fiscal 
rules. Balanced budget rules have gained par
ticular prominence among the euro area 
countries, increasing from ten in 2000 to 35 by 2017 and accounting for now almost 
60% of all rules.
62 Debt rules, which existed in only three euro area countries in 2000, 
have also become more established over the las
t two decades and now account for 
roughly one
-quarter of all rules. By contrast, expenditure rules and revenue rules play 
a relatively limited role in most euro area countries.

terms than suggested

particular

layers of public finances, including for example municipalities.

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  67 area countries now have at least one fiscal rule in place that puts a restriction on public 
finances at the general government level. This compares with the early years of the 
euro area, when a large majority of rules
 constrained only a small fraction of the 
general government sector and were sometimes linked only to regional or municipal 
levels. Second, rules have been strengthened in recent years by setting them at 
constitutional or equivalent level. This, in princip
le, helps to reduce the risk of 
short
-sighted, discretionary fiscal policies, which are often seen as responsible for the 
accumulation of high public debt. Third, all euro area countries have at least one fiscal 
rule in place that is defined in structural 
terms and thus takes account of the impact of 
cyclical developments. In earlier years, countries were often constrained only by 
ceilings in nominal terms. Fourth, the monitoring of compliance with fiscal targets has 
been strengthened considerably, with ind
ependent fiscal authorities, equipped with a 
relatively broad mandate for surveillance, now established in all euro area countries. 
Fifth, although practical experience is still scarce, fiscal rules are increasingly 
supported by more credible enforcement m
echanisms, which in some cases would be 
triggered automatically, for deviations from fiscal targets.
 Most of the
se improvements in national fiscal rules
 have taken
 place during 
the 
current decade
, 
as a result of
 important institutional changes at the 
supranational level.
 Most important in this respect has been the requirement to fully 
transpose the fiscal compact into national legislation, with the aim of increasing 
national ownership of the EU governance framewo
rk. This can be considered a 
regime shift compared with the beginning of EMU, when countries™ national fiscal rules 
were designed independently of each other.
63 The Budgetary Frameworks Directive, 
as part of the ﬁsix
-packﬂ legislation of 2011, also required
 country
-specific numerical 
fiscal rules. Moreover, in 2013 the ﬁtwo
-packﬂ Regulations specified that independent 
fiscal institutions should take on a more prominent role in monitoring fiscal rule 
compliance at national level.
 As a result, 
national fiscal 
rules 
have become more similar 
across countries
 and are better aligned with the EU governance framework at supranational 
level
. All euro area countries now have a balanced budget rule in place restricting the 
general government budget, following the instit
utional changes mentioned above. 
Moreover, the provisions in 
several euro area countries 
include an 
explicit reference to 
the 
Stability and Growth Pact
. Some countries have 
de jure 
even stricter features than 
foreseen
 in the 
Pact
, 
mostly
 because of
 a stron
ger automaticity of their enforcement 
mechanism
s. 
At the same time, fiscal rule frameworks continue to differ across 
countries, mainly reflecting national preferences and different federal structures. 
Differences also relate to the national ownership of th
e fiscal rules and their 
effectiveness in terms of compliance.
                                                                     63  In February 2017 the European Commission published its assessment of the
 fiscal compact 
transposition, which concluded that most contracting parties had fully transposed the fiscal compact into 
national legislation, although only 11 at constitutional or comparable level. See ﬁ

Commission presented under Article 8 of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the

 Fiscal rules in the eu

  68 Box 
1  Rules, markets and fiscal discipline in a monetary union
 Prepared by Maximilian Freier and Sarah Ciaglia
 There are in principle t
wo 
mechanisms for
 curb
ing
 unsound fiscal policies: a rule
-based 
fiscal 
governance framework 
and market discipline.
 The respective roles of fiscal rules and 
market 
discipline
 are part of the ongoing discussion on the reform of the EMU governance 
framework.
64 Drawing on the academic literature, this box discusses t
he two mechanisms and also 
their potential interaction.
 A rule
-based
 governance framework 
requires in principle two components, namely rules for 
fiscal policy and a means for their implementation
. Fiscal
 rules typically take the form of 
numerical limits on
 budgetary aggregates
 (see Section 2). 
Government fiscal policies have to be 
assessed and their compliance with the fiscal rules ensured
. The effectiveness of this process 
depends critically
 on the independence
 of policy assessment and
 powers of enforcemen
t.65 In EMU
, the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council conduct surveillance 
of Member States™ budgets 
with the aim of preventing deficit biases. Additionally, independent fiscal institutions at the national 
level (ﬁfiscal councilsﬂ) assess compliance w
ith national fiscal provisions 
(see 
Table A, 
left
-hand column)
. The r
ule
-based 
fiscal 
framework
 in EMU
 has
 drawn criticism 
primarily
 for 
its lack
 of 
enforceability and complexity.
 First, w
here 
governments 
retain sovereignty over their fiscal 
policies
, it 
can be difficult to ensure that they
 abide by previously agreed rules.
66 Some of the 
academic literature refers to the Stability and Growth Pact as a ﬁfailureﬂ, given the significant number 
of violations of its numerical fiscal rules that have gone unsancti
oned.67 Second, the success of a 
rule
-based framework 
critically depends on simplicity, particularly when its enforcement depends on 
public scrutiny and political pressure. In EMU, the Stability and Growth Pact started with simple 
numerical limits for defic
it and debt. The framework was then reformed and a degree of flexibility was 
included in the implementation of the rules in order to better account for cyclical developments, the 
cost of structural reforms and crisis
-related, exceptional fiscal burdens.
68 This has come at the cost of 
less transparency and tractability
.                                                                     64  For an example, see

  69 However, empirical analyses find that 
rule
-based
 fiscal governance framework
s do have a 
noticeable 
constraining effect on fiscal policies.
69 In the absence of robust enforcement 
mechanisms, 
fis
cal rules
 rel
y on broad political and 
public
 support
. Accordingly, ﬁownershipﬂ of fiscal 
rules is often identified as an important determinant of their effectiveness.
70 While there have been 
many
 violations of the numerical fiscal rules of the Stability and
 Growth Pact in EMU, average deficits 
have declined considerably compared with the pre
-EMU period. The convergence towards agreed 
MTOs in many countries or the clustering of public deficits just below the 3% threshold in others 
provides some indication tha
t Member States have internalised at least part of the EU™s 
rule
-based 
fiscal governance 
framework in their fiscal policymaking systems.
71 Recommendation
s for 
consolidation under the excessive deficit procedure are translated into government fiscal plans 
almost in full and are implemented to a substantial extent.
72 Turning to market
 discipline
, this is defined as a mechanism by which governments are 
steered by market price signals towards sound fiscal policies, thus reducing the risk of future 
debt restructur
ing.
 This mechanism relies 
on financial markets
 taking into account fundamentals 
(current and expected fiscal policies) when determining the credit risk premia
 included in 
governments™ financing costs. Governments tend to adjust their budgets to changes in the risk 
premium paid on their debt.
73 It is widely accepted that for this mechanism to work there has to be 
Œ among other conditions, such as open markets and
 transparency of policies 
Œ some likelihood that 
the debt of governments pursuing unsound fiscal policies will not be repaid 
(see 
Table A, right
-hand column)
.74 In EMU, this is embedded in the ﬁno
-bailout clauseﬂ (
Art
icle 125 of the Treaty on the 
Functionin
g of the European Union).
 The
 market 
discipline 
mechanism 
has been characterised as being ﬁtoo slow and weak or too 
sudden and disruptiveﬂ
.75 First, in a monetary union 
Œ where close economic integration implies 
greater spillover
 effects in a crisis 
Œ there could be considerable incentives for the union to come to 
the aid of a member state at risk of losing market access. If a commitment not to bail out a member 
state is not fully credible, this could compress risk premia for gove
rnments.
76 Second, the literature 
finds that market interest rates do not necessarily reflect news on fiscal developments in a reliable 
and consistent manner, and prices can overreact, particularly in times of economic crisis.
77 It is 
                                                                    69  For a recent metaanalysis, see

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  70 argued that in EMU this
 may have contributed, on the one hand, to excessively loose fiscal policies 
before the sovereign debt crisis and, on the other, to overly severe 
austerity
 measures
 during the 
crisis.
78 At the same time, however, the literature in general does find that mar
ket discipline 
effectively 
reduce
s the deficit bias of governments.
 Research on market discipline in EMU shows that market 
prices reflect fiscal developments, thereby providing an indication that the no
-bailout clause remains 
credible.
79 Studies also provid
e evidence that European governments effectively adjust their policies 
to changes in market prices.
80 While 
rule
-based fiscal governance
 and market discipline are often portrayed as two separate 
mechanisms, they do in fact affect each other
. Typically, the literature finds that the two 
mechanisms reinforce each other.
81 For example, fiscal rules 
can help governments to credibly 
commit to fiscal targets and thus reduce market interest rates on public debt.
82 Moreover, the 
assessment of fiscal de
velopments in the context of the fiscal governance mechanism may provide 
useful information to market participants for the pricing of sovereign risks.
83 Vice versa, higher 
market interest rates as a result of higher credit risk would
, all else being equal,
 lead to a deterioration 
of 
a fiscal position. This may make it more difficult for countries to comply with the provisions of the 
governance framework.
 In conclusion, both 
rule
-based fiscal governance framework
s and market discipline 
appear to 
contribute to
 the constraints on fiscal policies in EMU.
 However, both mechanisms have 
limitations and vulnerabilities. Against this background, institutional changes to EMU should be 
carefully assessed with regard to their impact on the governance framework and the ma
rket 
disciplining mechanism.

  3 Fiscal 
developments in the 
euro area
 Sin
ce the peak of the financial crisis in 200
9, the euro area as a whole has made 
significant
 progress towards restoring sound fiscal position
s, which has 
coincided with the steps taken to strengthen the 
framework of fiscal rules
. From 
its peak in 2009 at 4.5% of GDP, the euro area aggregate structural deficit declined to 
0.7% of GDP in 2018 (see Chart 2). The euro area as a whole has thus moved to an 
underlying budgetary deficit that comes very close to t
he floor of 0.5% of GDP set by 
the fiscal compact. This has been an important contribution to bringing government 
debt in the euro area onto a downward trajectory. Indeed, the euro area aggregate 
debt-to
-GDP ratio gradually declined from its peak of 94.2% 
of GDP in 2014 to 86.9% 
of GDP in 2018. It remains, however, far above its pre
-crisis level (65% of GDP in 
2007).

 These favourable trends for the euro area as a whole 
mask 
very heterogeneous 
fiscal developments at the country level
. On the one hand, an increasing number of 
countries 
are
 assessed 
as 
record
ing
 broadly sound fiscal positions. In
 2018, on the 
basis of
 the European Commission™s 2018

Forecast, 11 countries 
are expected to have achieved structural balance positions that 
are in line with the 
lower bound set by th
e fiscal compact 
(see 
Chart
 3). This compares
 with only three 
countries
 prior to the crisis
 in 2007.
84 This
 favourable trend may be taken as a
n indication that 
the increasing focus on balanced budget rules at the country level 
is having a first perceptible 
impact.
85 On the other hand, as shown in Chart 2, a number 
of euro area countries continue to record large structural budget deficits. 
These 
countries remain far from their country
-specific MTOs and the floor enshrined in the 
fiscal compact, which
 makes it 
more difficult to bring
 their 
high government debt ratios 
down 
to lower levels.

only entered into force in 2013.
 85  It should be acknowledged, however, that the structural balance may overstate the country™s underlying 
budgetary situation somewhat as it may reflect extraordinary revenue growth over and above the 
long
-term trend.

e number of countries complying with their 
country

cal

 As can be seen from Chart 4, in some countries with high government
 debt (i.e. 
Belgium, France and Italy), structural deficits still remain far from their MTOs because, 
during the period from 2011 to 2018, they declined on average by less than the 0.5% of 
GDP benchmark adjustment foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact.
 While in 
2011
-13 all the countries shown in Chart 4 (apart from Belgium) achieved an 
adjustment which was, amid financial market pressure, greater than the benchmark 
requirement, in more recent years none of the countries shown achieved the required 
adjus
tment. Consequently, these countries were not building the buffers that would 
allow them to avoid fiscal tightening in the next downturn. This can have an impact on 
the resilience of the euro area as a whole.

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  75 4 Fiscal 
frameworks in other monetary unions
 Comparing the public finances and fiscal frameworks of the euro area, t
he 
United States and Switzerland reveals some similarities but also important 
differences
. As in the euro area countries, balanced budget rules at the sub
-federal 
level are well established in both the US states and the Swiss cantons, although they 
have be
en in place for a much longer period than in the euro area. However, the size 
and role of the central budget differs substantially between the euro area on the one 
hand and Switzerland and the United States on the other. This includes the 
stabilisation fun
ction of the central budget, which can limit the procyclicality of fiscal 
rules at the lower level. A better understanding of the institutional settings in these two 
monetary unions and how they compare with the situation in the euro area may 
therefore pro
vide insights, particularly in view of the ongoing discussions on how to 
deepen fiscal integration in EMU. This section therefore takes a closer look at how 
public finances are governed in the United States and Switzerland, with a particular 
focus on the d
esign, strictness and enforcement mechanisms of fiscal rules at 
sub
-federal level.
 Public finances in the 
United States
 and Switzerland differ from those in the 
euro area.
 In the United States, most of the overall general government debt, which 
has continu
ously increased over the past decades, has been generated at the federal 
level (see Chart 6). In Switzerland, the federal level is responsible for roughly half of 
total public debt, which peaked in 2005 (see Chart 7). In the euro area, there is no 
equivale
nt at the central level besides the EU budget, which is very limited in size and 
also has a very limited borrowing capacity. Moreover, neither in the United States nor 
in Switzerland is public debt at the sub
-federal level as heterogeneous as across 
countr
ies in the euro area (see Chart 8 and Chart 5).

 Three institutional aspects seem to play a particular role in explaining
 the 
differences 
in public finances across the monetary unions.
 First, differences 
relate to fiscal federalism, its main purpose and how strongly it is establi
shed in the 
respective monetary unions.
86 In the United States, fiscal federalism mainly takes the 
form of countercyclical stabilisation policies, from the centre to the state level. The US 
states can rely on some public risk sharing in the form of temporar
y transfers from the 
federal budget in the event of idiosyncratic shocks, complemented by ﬁrainy dayﬂ 
funds established at state level (see also Box 2).
87 In Switzerland, fiscal federalism is 
well established
 in the form of a permanent transfer system betwe
en the centre and 
economically less strong cantons
. 
In the euro area, however, fiscal federalism is very 
limited. The EU budget has very limited resources (of around 1% of total GDP), which 
are mainly used for redistribution purposes in the form of EU cohe
sion funds to foster 
economic convergence in poorer regions. Public risk sharing is still limited to very 
specific situations under strict conditionality, while there are no funds available at 
central level to provide a countercyclical stabilisation functi
on for the Member States in 
the event of severe common or asymmetric shocks. Second, in the US states and the 
Swiss cantons public finances are also strongly influenced by an effective no
-bailout 
clause.
88 Third, differences relate to the fiscal rule framew
ork for the various layers 
and how effectively it works as a disciplinary device. While these three aspects are 
                                                                    86  Fiscal federalism 
is concerned with the way
 the various public functions are assigned to different levels of 
government and how the 
relevant
 fiscal instruments are distributed to 
enable 
these functions
 to be 
carried out
. Depending on the design of fiscal fed
eralism, it can fulfil very different functions, such 
as 
providing redistribution, stabilisation or risk
 sharing among the 
sub
-federal
 entities
. See also Darvas, Z., 
ﬁFiscal federalism in crisis: lessons for Europe from the US
ﬂ, Bruegel Policy Contribution, Issue 7, 2010.  
 87  In the United States, 13% of state
-specific shocks to GDP can be expected to be smoothed by the federal 
tax
-transfer and grant syst
em, compared with 62% through private risk
-sharing instruments (i.e. market 
transactions). See Asdrubali, P., Sorensen, B., and Yosha, O., ﬁChannels of Interstate Risk Sharing: 
United States 1963
-1990ﬂ, 
Quarterly Journal of Economics
, Vol. 111, No 4, 1996.
 88  In Switzerland, the no
-bailout clause took effect in 2003 after the 
municipality of L
eukerbad defaulted on 
its debt and the canton of Valais was not held responsible.
 In the United States, no state has defaulted on 
its debt since the default of Arkansa
s in 1933.

fiscal rules. Although balanced budget rules are in place in almost all 50 states, they 
differ in terms of stringency. A few states have very stringent balanced budget rules 
which prohibit deficits being carried over into the next budget year. Other states allow 
more leeway during the budgetary process, for example in form of escape clauses, 
and compliance with rules is enforced rather loosely. In some US states the balanced 
budget rules just need to be complied with ex ante, while in others investment 
expenditure can be deducted from nominal targets, thereby providing accounting 
leeway. Fiscal targets are set in either annual or biennial terms. Public finances in the 
US states 
are also disciplined by a no

  78 centre to the states and rainy day funds help as countercyclical devices.
89 At the 
federal level, the government™s borrowing capacity is restricted by a nominal debt limit, 
whi
ch can, however, be lifted upon parliamentary approval.
 In Switzerland, the fiscal rules, which are autonomously set by the cantons, are 
relatively diverse.
 Most of the 26 cantons have balanced budget rules in place, some 
of which are established at consti
tutional level. Only a few cantons target their total 
cantonal budgets, while in several cantons public investment is explicitly excluded.
90 Some cantons strictly enforce compliance with their fiscal targets. For example, if the 
budget deficit exceeds a cer
tain threshold, they are obliged to either increase taxes 
(e.g. in St. Gallen) or to specify future expenditure cuts ex ante. Rule compliance is 
partly also promoted through direct democratic instruments of budget control, such as 
referendums. Other canton
s, however, have fiscal rules that are less stringent, for 
example with broadly defined escape clauses. At the federal level, fiscal discipline is 
ensured through a strict debt brake established in 2003 at constitutional level, which 
applies to the general
 government sector as a whole. 
 The differences in the fiscal rule frameworks of the euro area, the United States 
and Switzerland can be captured by a rule stringency index
. As shown in Chart 9, 
this is a simple composite index based on publicly available 
indices for the three 
monetary unions. These are, for Switzerland, the index developed by Kirchgässner 
and Feld, for the US states the index developed by Hou and Smith and further by 
Mahdavi and Westerlund, and for the euro area countries the index of the 
European 
Commission.
91 As these studies use their own categorisation, it is necessary to 
translate them into a single scoring system. For reasons of simplicity and also owing to 
a lack of publicly available information at the same granular level across regi
ons, the 
composite index shown here is closest to the index developed by Kirchgässner and 
Feld. Thus the composite index is derived from three criteria: (i) whether a balanced 
budget rule is in place, (ii) whether there is clear intra
-year monitoring of th
e budget, 
and (iii) whether there is a stringent and credible enforcement mechanism. Each 
criterion is given a score of one, indicating that the feature is present, or zero, if not. 
The overall score is then found, which can be strong, medium, weak or not 
existent. 
The higher the score, the more stringent the rule.
 Overall, countries™ fiscal rules in the euro area seem to be more stringent than 
the sub
-federal rules in the other two monetary unions
. On the basis of the 
composite index, 40% of the fiscal rul
es in the euro area countries are very stringent, 
                                                                    89  Several empirical studies show that the fiscal stimulus provided at federal level essentially offset the 
procyclical tightening embedded in US states™ rules in 2009. See for example Aizenman, J. and Pasricha,

 Notes: The index is 
based
 on,
 for the euro area
, the European Commission
™s fiscal 
rules database (2017)
, for the United States
, the fiscal 
rules index by Hou and Smith
 (2010) a
s well as Mahdavi and Westerlund (2011),
 and for Switzerland
, the index by 
Fel
d and Kirchgäss
ner (2008)
. It covers rules at sub
-federal levels in the United States and Switzerland, and at national level in the euro area.
 At first sight
, the 
above finding that 
fiscal rules in the euro area 
are 
more 
stringent 
than those in other monetary unions 
might be surprising
. Public debt in 
the euro area countries is on average higher and more heterogeneous than the 
sub
-federal debt
-to
-GDP ratios in the U
nited States and Switzerland. However, in 
contrast to the euro area countries, public finances in the US states and the Swiss 
cantons are able to benefit from a sizeable fiscal budget at the centre and, in the 
United States, rainy day funds that facilitate
 more countercyclical fiscal policies. 
Moreover, the results for the euro area can be seen as a first indication that the 
considerable institutional changes implemented in recent years are bearing fruit, even 
though their positive impact on public finances
 has not yet become fully visible. 
Furthermore, as the no
-bailout clause is seen as being effective at the sub
-federal 
levels in the United States and Switzerland, this may also explain why both federations 
allow themselves to have less stringent rules.
                                                                     92  In fact, assessments even seem to di
ffer of the rules within a monetary union. For the United States, for 
example, studies differ in their assessment of the strictness of the states™ rules. Moreover, the studies 
used for the index have different reference dates: for the United States the dat
a are from 2006, for 
Switzerland from 2008, and for the euro area from 2017. However, in contrast to the euro area, changes 
in the fiscal rule frameworks in the United States and Switzerland have been marginal in recent years.

  80 Box 2  Rainy day funds 
Œ evidence from US states
 Prepared by Sebastian Hauptmeier, Nadine Leiner
-Killinger and Carolin Nerlich
 Fiscal rules are often criticised for being procyclical and for not providing sufficient incentives 
to build up fiscal buffers.
 Dur
ing a recession, rules may provide insufficient fiscal room for manoeuvre 
to stabilise the economy. One possibility for smoothing the impact of the business cycle on fiscal 
positions is to create a ﬁrainy dayﬂ fund. This is a fund dedicated to stabilising 
the budget by saving 
funds in economic good times and depleting them in economic weak times. This box looks at the 
experience in the United States with rainy day funds and a possible way forward for the euro area.
 In the United States, almost all states ar
e equipped with some form of rainy day fund as a 
countercyclical tool to complement the balanced budget requirements.
 The availability of such 
budget stabilisation funds is seen as important given that state governments 
Œ when faced with an 
economic downtu
rn and related shortfalls on the revenue side of their budgets 
Œ have limited options 
for stabilising the economy, as their ability to borrow is constrained. Indeed, increasing taxes or 
cutting spending in a procyclical manner would risk worsening a downtu
rn. The rainy day funds 
constitute an institutional feature of the budgetary procedures at state level. Their average size is 
relatively small. Over the period 2000
-17, the funds accumulated in rainy day funds averaged only 
around 0.2% of US GDP, and peake
d in 2017 at close to 0.3% of GDP. Chart A shows the evolution of 
aggregate US state rainy day fund balances over 2000
-17 against developments in the output gap 
(as a proxy for national cyclical conditions). Indeed, as expected, the aggregated rainy day fu
nds 
balance follows a roughly countercyclical pattern, in the sense that dissaving occurs when the output 
gap is worsening and vice versa. It is noteworthy that available funds were used almost in full during 
the 2001 recession and built up again thereafte
r, while aggregate funds dropped much less 
significantly during the Great Recession. Given the relatively small size of the funds, they are typically 
only sufficient to smooth normal cyclical fluctuations; more severe recessions require additional 
support 
from the federal budget. During the Great Recession significant funds derived from the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act at the federal level were used to further compensate state 
budget shortfalls.

  81 While the governance structure of rainy day funds differs widely among US states, some 
common patterns can be observed.
 As indicated in Table A, all rainy day funds are subject to 
specific conditions regarding the build
-up and withdrawal of funds. 44 states have rules in place that 
make the deposit of funds in the rainy day funds dependent on a number of specified conditio
ns; 20 
states base them on measures of volatility (e.g. revenue volatility deriving from cyclical developments 
related to oil or housing). Nine states make the withdrawal of funds dependent on economic 
conditions, six on revenue volatility and two on both.
 Eleven states foresee a fixed period for 
repayment.

95  5 Lessons for the reform of fiscal rules in the euro area
 With the increase in balanced budget rules, the fiscal rule framework in the euro 
area has come closer to that in the United States and Switzerland, but important 
differenc
es remain.
 The increased reliance in the euro area countries on balanced 
budget rules will eventually help to bring government debt ratios to lower and less 
divergent levels. Though the reflection of the fiscal compact in national rules is still 
recent, it
 is thus a major achievement that should ultimately help to increase the 
resilience of the euro area. At the same time, an important lesson from the United 
States and Switzerland is that their on average much lower debt ratios at sub
-federal 
level and less
er dispersion are the result not only of a much longer history of balanced 
                                                                    93  See

 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  82 budget rules but also of a degree of risk sharing and a fiscal stabilisation function at 
the central level.
 The lessons for EMU are thus twofold
. First, the fiscal framework needs t
o be 
rendered more effective in ensuring sound fiscal positions and reducing high levels 
and dispersion of government debt ratios across the euro area. As shown in Section 3, 
while the euro area as a whole can be considered to have achieved an underlying 
budgetary position of almost close to balance, some countries with high debt remain 
distant from such an outcome. This needs to be addressed. Second, r
educing the 
heterogeneity of 
public 
debt positions across euro area countries would also be an 
important p
rerequisite for setting up 
a common macroeconomic stabilisation function 
at the centre in case of deep economic crises. This, in turn, would help to contain the 
procyclicality of fiscal rules at the country level. Against this background, the review of 
the
 ﬁsix
-packﬂ legislation, scheduled for this year, will provide an opportunity to 
consider adjustments to the framework that could be conducive to further fiscal 
integration in the euro area.
 Looking at
 the first lesson, shortcomings in the current applicat
ion of the fiscal 
rules as set by the 
Stability and Growth Pact
 need to be remedied
. As shown in 
Section 3, some countries are not building up the buffers that would allow them to 
avoid fiscal tightening in a downturn. This can have an impact on the resili
ence of the 
euro area as a whole, notably in the light of the absence of a central fiscal capacity.
96 First
, 
under the Stability and Growth Pact™s corrective arm, 
underlying 
budgetary positions need to improve faster than 
is 
currently the case.
 The 
ﬁsix
-packﬂ legislation introduced annual nominal headline deficit targets under the 
excessive deficit procedure. If a country™s 
economic growth outpac
es that foreseen in 
the 
excessive deficit procedure
 recommendation
, it can achieve the nominal headline 
deficit ta
rgets with a smaller or even without the prescribed structural effort. These 
ﬁnominal strategiesﬂ help to explain why, for example, Spain and France delivered a 
structural effort below the 0.5% of GDP benchmark requirement in the period following 
the 2012
-13 recession (see Chart 4). Such developments harbour a risk that countries 
will leave an excessive deficit procedure with elevated structural deficit and debt ratios 
that reduce their potential to support the economy during the next downturn. This 
would s
uggest reducing the emphasis on the nominal headline deficit targets under 
the Stability and Growth Pact™s corrective arm.
 Second, the 
Stability and Growth Pact
™s debt rule should be reviewed to ensure 
a reduction of high government debt.
 The debt rule rig
htly 
takes account of
 low 
nominal growth 
and inflation 
as relevant factor
s, as these render compliance with it 
procyclical in a downturn. However, the current application of the rule needs to be 
addressed where it treats countries™ compliance with the prev
entive arm of the Stability 
and Growth Pact as the core mitigating factor. Specifically, countries that do not and/or 
are not expected to deliver the full structural effort towards the MTO under the 
preventive arm are currently still considered as being br
oadly compliant with the 
preventive arm and therefore compliant with the debt criterion. Such broad instead of 
                                                                    96  On 22 January 2019 
the 
ECOFIN 
Council 
approved 
recommendations for 
the conduct of 
fiscal policies
 in 
the current year
, highlighting the need to ﬁrebuild fiscal buffers, especially in euro area countries wi
th high 
levels of public debtﬂ.

 Œ Articles
 Fiscal rules in the euro area and lessons from other monetary unions
  83 full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact delays the needed progress towards 
the MTO.
97 Third, 
under the Stability and Growth Pact™s preventive arm, 
the application of 
flexibility needs to be reviewed 
to avoid an 
excessive slowdown in 
progress 
towards MTO
s.98 According to the common position on flexibility, which was 
endorsed by the ECOFIN Council in
 early 2016, budgetary adjustment requirements 
can be reduced in exchange for 
additional structural reforms and 
government 
investment
, among other things
. However, it should be ensured that the additional 
leeway granted is reduced if structural reforms are
 reversed or government 
investment is more limited than initially planned.
  Turning to the second lesson
, 
the experience in the U
nited 
States
 and 
Switzerland suggests that rules at the 
level of individual euro area countries 
should be
 supported by some cen
tral stabilisation
. Over the past 15 years the 
fiscal rule framework in the euro area has been reformed, with, overall, a shift away 
from nominal targets and towards a stronger recognition of the impact of the business 
cycle on budgetary outcomes.
99 Provide
d the good economic times are used 
effectively to build up buffers, this helps to provide stabilisation in downturns. In this 
respect, countries could benefit from enhancing their institutional toolbox by, for 
example, creating rainy day funds that could l
imit procyclical fiscal policies. Over the 
longer horizon, however, setting up a well
-governed central stabilisation facility would 
support adherence to the strengthened fiscal framework in the euro area in deep 
downturns. As the overall moderate and broad
ly comparable government debt ratios 
at the state/canton level in the United States and Switzerland show, reducing high 
levels and the heterogeneity of government debt positions across the euro area 
countries appears to be an important prerequisite in this
 respect.
 Generally, as the experiences in the U
nited 
States
 and Switzerland 
have 
show
n, once government debt ratios are 
relatively
 low and less divergent
, countries 
might be able to afford to set their fiscal rules more autonomously
. Experience in 
other m
onetary unions suggests that market discipline can reinforce the ownership of 
sub
-federal fiscal rules.
 Moreover, sub
-federal entities have found effective and 
credible fiscal rules to be in their long
-term interest because 
unsound fiscal policies 
Œ result
ing 
in 
excessively high debt levels 
Œ place a burden on future generations
 by increas
ing
 financing costs in the economy and undermin
ing
 growth and employment.
 This has also led
 sub
-federal entities
 to
 take strong ownership of their (self
-imposed) 
fiscal ru
les
. Overall, experiences with fiscal 
rule 
frameworks in other fiscally more 
integrated monetary unions provide insights for reforms in EMU, but 
differences will and should remain
. 
As also the high and rising government debt 
                                                                    97  The

 6 Conclusions
 This article™s main findings can be summarised as follows
. A comparison of the 
fiscal rule framework applic
able in euro area countries with that in the fiscally more 
integrated U
nited 
States
 and Switzerland can provide 
guideposts
 for completing 
EMU.
 Both the U
nited 
States
 and Switzerland have a history of balanced budget rules 
that help stabilise government deb
t in states and cantons at moderate and not overly 
divergent level
s. The increased emphasis in the euro area 
on balanced budget rules
 is an important achievement. The fact that the majority of euro area countries 
are
 currently 
recording 
underlying budgetar
y positions that are in line with a balanced 
budget over the medium term is 
also 
a first indication that balanced budget rules have 
become more effective.
 Still
, a number of countries, notably those with high 
government 
debt, need to 
progress further towar
ds their 
MTOs
. The fiscal 
rule 
framework can be rendered 
more effective in this regard. 
Generally, if
 euro area countries build up buffers to avoid 
fiscal tightening in a downturn, national budgets can 
fulfil their 
function as stabilisation 
tools. 
Reducing
 the heterogeneity of debt positions across euro area countries
 would
 also
 be an important 
prerequisite 
for setting up 
a common macroeconomic 
stabilisation function 
for deep crises as
 in other monetary unions, thereby also 
supporting the single monetary po
licy.   StatisticsS 1ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 3 / 2019 - StatisticsContents  1 External environment
