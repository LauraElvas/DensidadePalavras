  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 The incoming information that has become available since the Governing Council™s 
decision to end net asset purchases in December 2018 has 
continued to be weaker 
than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and 
sector
-specific 
factors.
 In particular, the persistence of uncertainties relating to 
geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism 
is weighing on economic sentiment
. At the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics 
and rising wag
e growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually 
rising inflation pressures. This
 underlying strength
 of the economy 
supports 
the 
Governing Council™s
 confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to 
levels that are below
, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 
Nevertheless, s
ignificant 
monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further build
-up of domestic 
price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This will 
be provided by 
the
 Governing Council™s
 forward guidance on the key ECB interest 
rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets. 
The Governing Council 
confirmed that it 
stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as 
appropriate, to ensure 
that inflation continues to move towards the Governing 
Council™s inflation aim in a sustained manner.
 The global economic growth momentum has slowed recently amid geopolitical 
uncertainties and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. Global trade decelerated 
towards the end of 2018 as downside risks related to unresolved trade disputes 
remained prominent and growth in emerging markets slowed down. While financial 
conditions are favourable overall, the weaker global growth momentum has fuelled 
stock market vola
tility. A more accommodative monetary policy stance has been taken 
in China in the light of the slowing growth momentum.
 Euro area 
government
 bond yields declined somewhat 
as 
global risk
-free rates 
decreased and sovereign bond spreads in the euro area rema
ined stable. Despite 
heightened intra
-period volatility
, 
equity prices 
in the euro area stayed, overall, broadly 
unchanged
. 
Similarly, y
ield spreads on corporate bonds 
increased only modestly
. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro 
depreciated 
in trade
-weig
hted terms.
 Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, 
following growth of 0.4% in the previous two quarters. Incoming data have continued 
to be weaker than expected 
resulting from a slowdown in external demand 
which was 
compounded by several
 country and sector
-specific factors. While the impact of some 
of these factors is expected to fade, the near
-term growth momentum is likely to be 
weaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion wil
l continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment

 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
  3 gains and rising wages, lower energy prices, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat 
slower 
Œ expansion in global activity.
 Euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.6% in Dece
mber 2018, from 1.9% in 
November, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming 
months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally mute
d, but labour cost 
pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity 
utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is 
expected to increase over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s 
monetary 
policy 
measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth.
  Overall, t
he risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the 
downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors 
and the threat of
 protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial 
market volatility.
 The monetary analysis shows that 
broad money (M3) growth 
decreased
 to 3.7% in 
November 2018, after 3.9% in October. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank 
credit creatio
n. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to 
broad money growth.
 The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations 
stood at 4.0% in November 2018, after 3.9% in October, while the annual growth rate 
of loans to household
s remained broadly unchanged at 3.3%. 
The euro area bank 
lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending 
conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and 
demand for bank credit continued to ri
se, thereby underpinning loan growth.
 The 
outcome of the economic analysis
 and the signals coming from the monetary 
analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still 
necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to
 levels that are 
below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 Based on 
this assessment, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB 
interest rates 
unchanged
 and continues 
to expect them to remain at their present 
levels at least through the summer o
f 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary 
to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term.
 Regarding 
non-standard monetary policy measures, 
the Governing Council confirmed 
th
at the Eurosystem will continue to reinvest
, in full, the principal payments from 
maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended 
period of time past the date when 
the Governing Council
 start
s raising the key ECB 
interest r
ates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity 
conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

uncertainty remains 
as to 
whether the

as well as
 political and 
geopolitical uncertainties, including risks related to Brexit.
 Financial conditions remain accommodative
 overall
, whi
le 
concerns over US 
and global economic activity have fuelled stock market volatility.
 In China, fiscal 
policy 
and monetary policy 
have 
eased in response to 
a weakening
, in particular
, of the manufacturing sector. Market expectations 
of further 
interest 
rate increases in the 
United 
States
 have eased somewhat, amid a further decline in Treasury yields, partly 
reflecting developments in term premia. Looking ahead, the Federal Open Market
 Committee
 (FOMC

 Global 
inflation slowed 
in 
November
. Annual consumer price inflation in the 
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD) 
moderated to 2.7
% in
 November
, 
largely as a result of easing energy prices, 
while 
inflation excluding food and energy 
decreased marginally to 2.2
%. 
Global inflationary 
pressures are expected to remain contained. 
Wage growth in advanced economies 
continues to be moderate, desp
ite a tightening of labour markets and rising capacity 
constraints
. Oil markets have 
remained broadly stable
. Oil prices declined in the fourth quarter 
of 2018, mainly on account of oversupply fears related to the waivers on the US 
sanctions on Iranian oil
 exports, coupled with continued high production growth in the 
United States. These effects initially outweighed the possible price effects of 
production cuts by OPEC and a group of allied oil
-producing nations, particularly 
because market uncertainty pers
isted regarding the cuts agreed on 7 December 2018. 
However, prices recovered after data releases indicated lower than expected 
production levels, and Brent crude oil prices stood at USD 61 per barrel on 22
 January. 
Non
-oil commodity prices have 
increased 
slightly, mainly on the back of food price 
increases.
 The US economy recorded strong growth in 2018, in the context of a 
pro
-cyclical fiscal stimulus, but lower confidence and weaker than expected 
data have clouded the growth outlook.
 Real GDP growth expan
ded at an 
annualised rate of 3.4% in the third quarter of 2018 
Œ well above potential 
Œ albeit 
slowing from 4.2% in the previous quarter on the back of declining net exports and
 decelerating private fixed investment. The US government shutdown has added to
 the 
uncertainty generated by US trade policy in respect of China and is (temporarily) 
weighing on US economic activity in the near term. Headline consumer price inflation

  6 declined to 1.9% in December due to a sharp deceleration in energy prices, while 
ave
rage hourly earnings remained strong. Against this background, the FOMC raised 
the federal funds rate target range at its December 2018 meeting by 25 basis points, 
as expected, and slightly lowered its projections for GDP growth and core inflation for 
the 
next years. 
 In Japan, 
real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2018
 is set to return to positive 
growth, but inflation remains weak.
 Volatility in GDP in 2018 was mainly due to the 
impact of natural disasters and extreme weather condition
s. Looking ahead, the 
economy is expected to remain on a moderate growth path, supported by highly 
accommodative monetary policy and the domestic capital expenditure cycle. The 
reflation momentum in the economy has weakened, with headline inflation declining 
significantly in Dec
ember due to the recent softening of oil and food prices.
 In the United Kingdom, 
growth looks set to decline after a robust outturn in the 
third quarter of 2018.
 The strong qu
arter
-on-quarter growth of 0.6% in the third 
quarter reflected a temporary boost 
to consumption and public investment, as well as 
a strong rebound in exports. However, business investment fell for the third 
consecutive quarter. Overall, activity is expected to remain muted in the medium term. 
Annual CPI inflation decreased slightly to 
2.1% in December, resulting in a fourth 
quarter average of 2.3%, following strong declines in previous months. 
 The Chinese economy is losing growth momentum, with the manufacturing 
sector in particular showing signs of weakening.
 In December 2018, the 
man
ufacturing PMI dropped below 50 for the first time since 2017, while the services 
sector 
Œ less exposed to the US trade tensions 
Œ was more resilient. The People™s 
Bank of China enacted new policies to cushion the slowdown, including a 100
-basis 
point redu
ction in the required reserve ratio in early January and a new lending facility 
to support small firms in December. New fiscal policy measures are also expected, 
although fiscal spending by local governments may face constraints. Annual headline 
CPI inflat
ion fell to 1.9% in December, reflecting a lower contribution from non
-food 
items, while core inflation remained steady. Producer price index inflation decelerated 
sharply to 0.9% in the same month in response to lower oil and commodity prices, 
and also to
 the slowdown in Chinese manufacturing activity.

 Over the review 
period
, equity prices of euro area banks 
and non

ns increased by 
around 1%
. 
Elevated levels of global uncertainty, coupled with negative 
macroeconomic surprises, led to a broad

of the year. Thereafter, equity markets partly recovered from earlier losses and 
volatility became more muted.

despite a gra
dual increase in 
2018, 
corporate bond spreads 
still 
remain below the levels observed in March
 2016, 
prior to the announcement and subsequent launch of the corporate sector purchase 
programme.
 The euro overnight index average (EONIA) was
, on average
, -36 basis points 
over the review period.
 Excess liquidity 
declined by around •43 billion to around 
•1,847 billion. This decline was mainly driven by an increase in net autonomous 
factors and, to a lesser extent, early repayments in the second series of targeted 
longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-II).
 The E
ONIA forward curve shifted downwards somewhat over the review period.
 The curve
 remains below zero for horizons prior to 2021, reflecting market 
expectations of a prolonged period of negative interest rates.
 In foreign exchange markets, the euro 
has deprec

 in trade

(see Chart
 4). Over the review period the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro, 
measured against the currencies of 38 of the euro area™s most important trading 
partners, 
depreciated 
by 
1.0
%. This resulted from a broad
-based depreciation of the 
euro against most major currencies. In particular, the euro depreciated against the 
Japanese yen (
by 
3.4
%) and the British pound (by 2.9%), while it was broadly 
unchanged against the US dollar. The euro also weakened against the Ch

the 
Turkish lira, the Brazilian real and the Russian rouble
, which continued to recover 
some of their previous losses.

 Rising employment

d to support 
household income 
and consumer 
spending
. Private consumption rose by 0.1%, quarter on
 quarter, in the third quarter 
of 2018, following 
a similar rate of expansion 
in the previous quarter.
 Temporary 
bottlenecks in car production following the introduction of the new Worldwide 
Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP)
 had an adverse imp
act on 
economic activity and, in particular, the consumption of durable goods
. Growth of 
consumption of non
-durable goods
, i.e. food and energy
, also slowed down
. As this 
component
 of 
consumer
 spending 
has arguably been 
more sensitive to
 past increases 
in 
oil 
prices
, and oil prices weakened in the fourth quarter, its
 weakness 
is also to some 
extent of a more 
temporary
 nature.
 By contrast
, in line with 
strong
 growth in 
the 
real 
compensation of employees
, consumption of services, the largest component
 of 
cons
umer spending
, 
remained robust.
 Despite the recent deceleration in growth, p
rivate consumption
 is 
expected 
to 
regain momentum going forward.
 Recent data on the volume of retail sales and 
new passenger car registrations point to 
slow but steady
 growth in co
nsumer 
spending 
in the 
fourth 
quarter of 
2018. Other indicators
, however, 
support the picture of 
more 
resilient 
consumption dynamics. The latest survey results signal further labour market 
improvements, which should 
continue to 
support 
household
 income and
 consumer 
spending. Moreover, households™ net worth continued to increase at robust rates in the 
third 
quarter. Although consumer confidence has 
been on a broadly 
declin
ing trend 
since the end of 2017
, it still stands 
above its long

For
 the

 quarter of 2018, short

growth. 
In October and November m
onthly data on capital goods production 
stood on 
average at the same level as in the third 
quarter, when 
growth was 
0.9% on a quarterly 
basis
, which points to a further slowdown in non

. 
Indicators such 
as capacity utilisation
, confidence and 
new 
orders 
are also consistent with slower 
growth in the fourth quarter
. With regard to c
onstruction investment, construction 
production 
contracted in October and November, while PMI and confidence indices for 
the construction sector up to December still 
point
ed to continued 
Œ but moderating 
Œ growth in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2018
. Investment i
s expected to continue to grow, 
though at a slowing pace
. The 
slightly declining path 
expected 
for non
-construction 
investment growth will be driven 
by weakening domestic and foreign demand as well as 
decreasingly
 favourable 
financial conditions
. Also prof
its, which are firms™ main source of funding for 
investment, seem to be growing at a declining rate.
 According to the euro area 
sectoral accounts for the 
third
 quarter of 2018, 
non-financial corporations™ 
gross 
operating 
surplus
 slowed strongly in year
-on-year terms
. 
Moreover
, uncertainties 
surrounding 
Brexit, trade protectionism and the general outlook for global growth, inter 
alia, 
may already be 
proving unfavourable
 to investment decisions. As regards 
construction investment, households™ 
increasing
 inten
tions to buy or renovate, 
constructors™
 buoyant price and employment expectations
, and stable issuance of 
building permits, amid persistent limits
 from labour shortages and insufficient demand,
 point to 
a positive
 Œ but softening 
Œ momentum in the construc
tion sector 
going 
forward.
 After disappointing in the third quarter, growth in euro area foreign
 trade 
appears set to decline further in the fourth 
quarter of 2018.
 The pace of euro area 
export growth slowed down substantially (to 0.1%) i
n the third quarte
r, whereas growth 
in imports eased (to 1.0%). As a result net trade exerted a drag on economic activity 
with a large negative contribution to GDP growth (of 0.4
 percentage point). Based on 
information up to November, euro area foreign trade is assessed as 
having further 
weakened in the fourth quarter, reflecting a moderation in growth in intra
-euro area 
trade amid weak foreign demand. The expansion of export volumes of goods 
(obtained by deflating trade values by producer price indices) remained very modera
te 
(at 0.8%, quarter on quarter), while import growth is likely to have undergone a 
correction (to 
-0.8%) in the fourth quarter. 
Survey indicators with leading properties
 for 
trade,
 such as the 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) for new manufacturing export 
orders and the 
European Commission™s
 assessment 
of 
export order book levels
, also 
anticipate a gloomier outlook towards the end of the year.
 Incoming data have been weaker than expected, reflecting a diminishing 
contribution from external demand and some c
ountry and sector
-specific 
factors.
 While some of these factors are likely to unwind, this may suggest some 
slower growth momentum ahead.
 Following growth of close to zero in October, 
industrial production (excluding construction) 
declined by 1.7%, month o
n month, in 
November. As a result, on average over these two months production stood 0.7% 
below the level seen in the 
third 
quarter of 2018, when it

further employment gains and rising wages, lower energy prices, and the
 ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ expansion in global activity.

 The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the

 Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in December 2018, down from 1.9% in 
November (see Chart
 7).
 This de
crease 
mainly 
reflected 
lower 
energy price inflation 
and also, to a lesser extent, lower food price inflation
. The decline in headline inflation 
since its peak in October 2018 was largely due to energy inflation, which was pushed 
down by a base effect and the impact of recent declines in oil prices. The decli
ne in oil 
prices and the corresponding futures prices after mid
-November was more substantial 
than had been expected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections. This 
mechanically implies a weaker short
-run outlook for headline inflation 
(see the box
 entitled ﬁ
The mechanical impact of changes in oil price assumptions on projections for 
euro area HICP energy inflation

 inflation for non

strengthen in

its lows in early 2018

producer price inflation for non
-food consumer goods increased further to 0.9% in 
Nove
mber, its highest r
ate since April
 2012, and above its long

Overall, price pressures 
in the later stages of the supply chain for 
industrial 
goods 
remained steady
, albeit 
with a risk of 
the 
continued weakness in the early stages 
filtering through
. Rising
 labour cost pressures did not translate into further increases in overall 
domestic price pressures recently as they were buffered by profit margins.
 Price pressur
es from labour costs continued to intensify
 in the third quarter of 2018 
due to
 higher
 growth
 in 
compensation per employee as well as weaker
 growth in 
productivity
. Still, the annual percentage change in the 
GDP deflator 
remained stable 
at 1.4% in the first three quarters of 2018, as t
he overall weakening in the cyclical 
momentum of the economy
, together with deteriorations in the terms of trade (related 
particularly to the past 
increases in 
oil price
s), weighed on p
rofit margin developments.
 These latest developments in the GDP deflator and its decomposition are 
characteristic of a more mature pha
se of a demand
-driven recovery
1. Both market
-based and survey
-based measures of longer
-term inflation 
expectations declined.
 The five
-year forward inflation
-linked swap rate five years 
ahead stood at 1.54% on 
23 January 2019, around 9 basis points lower th
an the level 
that
 prevailed in mid
-December. The forward profile of market
-based measures of 
inflation expectations continues to point towards a prolonged period of low inflation 
with a very gradual return to inflation levels below, 
but close to, 2% (see
 Chart
 8). The 
risk
-neutral probability of negative average inflation over the next five years 
implied by 
inflation options markets remains negligible, which suggests that markets currently 
consider the risk of deflation to be very low.
 The results of the EC
B Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2019
 show average 
headline 
inflation expectations 
for t
he euro area of 1.5% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.7% in 
2021. This represents downward revisions of 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point to 2019 
and 2020, respectively, compared with 
the previous survey
, mainly attributable to oil 
price developments.
 According to t
he SPF, average longer
-term inflation expectations 
were 1.8%, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point.

 Broad money growth moderated in November.

7% in November
 from 
3.9% in

 (see Chart

The reduction in 
net asset purchases (from •80

 billion in April
 2017, to •30
 billion in 
January
 2018, and then to 
•15 billion 
in October 2018
) has 
led to a smaller positive 
impact of the APP 
on M3 growth. The annual growth rate of M1, which again made a 
significant contribution to broad money growth
, decreased 
to 6.
7% in 
November
 (down 
from 6.
8% in 
October
). Money growth continued to 
be bolstered by
 sustained 
economic 
expansion
 and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid 
instruments in an environment of very low interest rates.

 Note
s: Credit to the private sector includes MFI loans to the private sector and MFI holdings of securities issued by the euro are
a private 
non-MFI sector. 
As such, it also covers the Eurosystem™s purchases of non
-MFI debt securities under the corporate sector purchase 
programme.
 The latest observation is for 
November
 2018. Credit to the private sector remained the largest driver of broad money growth.
 From a counterpart perspective,
 the positive contribution to M3 
growth from general 
government securities held by the Eurosystem decreased further
 (see the red bars in 
Chart
 9) in the context of the aforementioned reduction in monthly net purchases 
under the APP. 
It
 has been largely offset by a moderate increase in the
 contribution 
from credit to the private sector since late 2017 
(see the blue bars in Chart
 9). 
This 
marks an ongoing shift towards more self
-sustained sources of money creation, with 
credit to the private sector surpassing Eurosystem purchases of general 
government 
debt securities as the largest contributor to M3 growth 
since
 October
 2018. 
By 
contrast, government bond sales by euro area monetary financial institutions (MFIs) 
excluding the Eurosystem dampened M3 growth (see the light green bars in Chart

  17 The annual growth of loans to the private sector remained stable in November.
 The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (ad
justed for loan sales, 
securitisation and notional cash pooling) 
was unchanged 
in 
November
 at 3.3% (see 
Chart
 10). 
It
 benefited from increases
 in the annual growth rate of 
loans to NFCs, 
which

, 
and of loan
s to 
household
s, which increased from 3.2% in October to
 3.3% in November
. 
The
se slight 
increases in loans to NFCs and households were offset by a decrease in the annual 
growth rate of loans to financial intermediaries, 
leading to no 
change
 in the growth r
ate 
of loans to the private sector
 overall.
 While the annual growth rate of loans to 
households for house purchase remained moderate from a historical perspective, 
loan 
origination was strong
. The recovery in loan growth has been supported by the 
significa
nt decline in bank lending rates across the euro area since mid
-2014 (notably 
owing to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) and 
by 
overall 
improvements in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans. In addition, banks have 
made progress in conso
lidating their balance sheets, although the 
volume
 of 
non-performing loans (NPLs) remains high in some countries and may cons
train 
financial intermediation.

 Notes: Loans are adjusted

 According to the 
Janu
ary

, credit standards for loans to enterprises 
and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged in the
 fourth quarter of 2018. These developments follow a considerable overall net easing 
of credit standards since 2014. Competitive pressures continued to contribute to an 
easing of credit standards for loans to enterprises and housing loans, while lower risk
 perceptions only contributed to an easing of credit standards for housing loans. 
Increasing net loan demand is largely due to the low general level of interest rates, 
fixed investment, inventories and working capital, merger and acquisition activity,

reported that regulatory or supervisory actions led to a further strengthening of their 
capital positions in the second half of 2018 and a tightening of their credit standards 
across all loan categories. With regard to the impact of NPL ratios on lending policies, 
euro area banks reported that these ratios had a tightening impact on their credit 
standards for loans to enterprises and housing loans over the past six months, which 
is expected to persist and to affect all loan categories.
 Very favourable lending rates continued to support euro area economic growth.
 In

6%, which 
is close to it

The composite 
bank lending rate for housing loans remained stable

81%, also close 
to its historical low

for loans to NFCs and households have 
falle
n significantly and by more than market 
reference rates since the ECB™s credit easing measures were announced in 
June
 2014. The reduction in bank lending rates 
for
 loans to NFCs, as well as 
for 
loans 
to small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to 
•0.25
 million are 
primarily 
granted to small firms), was particularly significant in those euro area countries that 
were most exposed to the financial crisis. This indicates a more uniform transmission 
of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro a
rea countries and firm sizes.

 1 Recent developments in oil prices
 Prepared by Dominic Quint
 Against the background of 
large swings in oil prices in recent months, this box 
assesses the key drivers of oil market dev
elopments. While demand has been 
relatively stable, supply factors have been the main driving force behind recent oil 
price volatility.
 The past few month
s have seen a marked turnaround in oil prices accompanied 
by a strong increase in 
implied
 price 
volati
lity.
 After rising since the summer of 
2017 and peaking at USD
 86 per barrel in early October
 2018, the Brent crude oil price 
has undergone a marked correction, falling by around 40% by the end of 2018 
(see 
Chart
 A). A similar correction occurred four year
s ago. Oil prices dropped 
sharply 
in 
2014 after a period in which Brent crude had traded at around USD
 110 per barrel for 
several years. And in 
January
 2016 prices fell to below USD
 30 per barrel. These 
periods of oil price collapse tend to be accompanied 
by a high degree of uncertainty. 
Based on United States Oil Fund options, the Oil Volatility Index (OVX) captures 
expectation
s regarding
 oil price

3 Advances in extraction technology and investments in pipeline systems and rail 
capacity have allowed US producers to expand production, making the United States 
an important fac
tor in global oil supply. Its share in aggregate supply increased 
significantly between 2011 and the summer of 2014 (see Chart
 B). In late 2014 
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) appeared 
to change their strategy, aband
oning production quotas in an attempt to regain market 
share and, according to some market analysts, crowd out US supply by driving oil 
prices below levels at which US shale oil producers could be profitable.
4 OPEC™s 
actions led only to a short
-lived curta
iling of shale oil production. In late 2016 it 
had to 
reconsider its approach 
as global demand worries led to further declines in oil prices. 
In addition, OPEC™s strategy had put strains on the public finances of its members and 
fiscal sustainability 
indic
ators 
deteriorated sharply between 2014 and 2016 for most 
OPEC 
countries.
5 Once oil prices started to increase again in 2017, US producers 
quickly regained market shares.

 Despite

  22 oil exports, starting from November
 2018. By October
 2018 
Iranian oil exports 
had already 
decreased by about 0.35
 million b
arrels per 
day.
7 At the same time, the 
market had been concern
ed about whether OPEC would react by increasing 
production to compensate 
for 
the loss of 
Iranian 
production in global markets
. Starting 
in 
early October, 
however, 
there was a marked correction
 in prices
. Saudi Arabia and 
Russia provided reassurance
s that t
hey would indeed increase production if needed 
after the implementation of t
he sanctions.
 Further downward pressure came from the 
US 
Government™s decision to grant six
-month waivers for imports of oil 
to 
key 
customers of Iran. 
Together with major non
-OPEC 
producers, OPEC agreed on 
production cuts in early December
 2018. However, the proposed cuts were at the 
lower end of what markets considered necessary to have a lasting impact on prices, 
while there were also doubts about the extent to which members would
 comply with 
the production cuts.
8 Consequently, the decline in oil prices did not halt until the 
beginning of 2019 after initial indicators for December pointed to a significant drop in 
OPEC production.
 Growth in aggregate demand for oil has been more sta
ble over 
recent 
years
, but 
is expected to decline in 2019
. Over the past decade, energy consumption in 
non-OECD countries, particularly in China, has been the main driver of global oil 
demand 
(see C
hart
 C). However, rising demand in emerging and developing
 economies was balanced by slowing demand in OECD countries. More recently, with 
economic expansion having slowed somewhat in emerging and developing 
economies, there has been a degree of convergence in oil demand growth in OECD 
and non
-OECD countries. Wit
h global economic activity
 expected to moderate 
somewhat during 2019, forecasts for oil demand growth have been 
revised 
down
wards
 by the International Energy Agency in recent months. This has put 
additional pressure on prices, particularly in the second ha
lf of December, amid a 
broad
-based correction in global financial markets.
                                                                     7  This is less severe than in 
2012 when sanctions 
caused 
Iran™s oil exports to 
fall 
by a
round 1
 million 
barrels per day
. 8  The unity among OPEC members was further challenged by Qatar™s decision to
 withdraw from OPEC.

 Note: The l

the 
other major producers that

s an important factor 
in 
oil price dynamics.
 Large 
conventional 
ﬁswing producer
sﬂ like Saudi Arabia still play an important role. For 
example, i
t is still only OPEC countries that have sufficient spare capacity to increase 
production in response to sudden peaks in demand.
9 Nonetheless, OPEC™s strategy 
of lowering oil prices in 2014 and 2015 did not succeed in permanently crowding out 
US shale oil 
production, suggesting that, over longer horizons, OPEC™s ability to 
stabilise prices around desired levels has diminished. While conventional extraction 
methods are usually less costly than shale oil production, 
most 
traditional oil
-exporting 
countries
 need higher oil prices
 to balance 
their
 public
-sector budgets
.10 However, the 
shale revolution has helped to limit upward pressures on oil prices, as US production 
tends to increase once prices rise above break
-even levels. 
According to a
n energy
 survey 
condu
cted 
by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas, 
operating 
existing wells can 
be profitable in 
a price 
range 
of USD
 25-35 per barrel
. For the 
exploitation of new 
wells
, however, 
producers need prices 
to be somewhat higher 
(see C
hart
 D). Overall, the shale revol
ution has change the structure of the oil market. OPEC 
strategies now need to take into account the endogenous reaction of shale 
oil 
producers
. Competition from shale oil may reduce the power of traditional oil 
producers 
to drive 
up prices beyond a given l
evel over long horizons. At the same 
time, the process of OPEC adapting its strategies to the new source of competition 
has introduced some volatility 
in 
oil prices in recent years, including 
during the second 
half of 2018.
                                                                     9  The spare capacity of OPEC is estimated at between 1
 million and 2
 million barrels per day, i.e.
 it should 
be able to increase production by this amount within 30 to 90
 days. The United State™s ability 
to increase 
supply 
significantly at short notice is 
still 
limited. To increase production by
 0.5
 million barrels per day

producers 
would need six months 
to step up drilling activities

  25 2 Driving factors 
of 
and risks to domestic demand in the
 euro 
area
 Prepared by 
Malin Andersson and Benjamin Mosk
 Activity in the euro area i
s expected to continue to expand
 at a moderate pace
, 
while more elevated uncertainty points to intensified downside risks to the 
growth outlook.
 Heightened uncertainties at the global level, the prospect of Brexit, 
escalati
ng protectionism
, volatility in 
emerging market economies (
EMEs
) and policy 
uncertainty in some parts of the euro area pose 
major 
challenges 
to 
the sustainability 
of domestic demand going forward. 
According to t
he 
December 2018 
Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic 
projections
,11 the growth outlo
ok is 
expected 
to be underpinned by 
sustained growth 
in 
domestic demand over the next 
few 
years, 
notwithstanding
 a very 
limited contribution 
from 
net exports and inventories (see Chart A). 
Even though 
growth is expected to slow, 
which is consistent with
 a maturing business cycle
 in which 
labour supply shortages increase
 in some 
countries
 and saving ratio
s recover from 
their 
low levels, activity is expected to be relatively resilient 
owing 
to a number of 
factors
, including
 the 
expected 
continued expansion of
 global activity, the 
accommodative monetary policy stance supporting financing conditions, improving 
labour markets, 
rising wages 
and some fiscal loosening. This 
box reviews the factors 
underpin
ning
 domestic expenditure and assesses the potential adverse 
effects on 
domestic activity 
of 
heightened global uncertainty.

 factors of and risks to domestic demand in the euro area
  26 moderation 
in 
euro area real GDP growth
12 in the first three quarters of 2018 was 
partly related to 
growth in 
private consumption, which slowed up to th
e third quarter. 
Consumer confidence declined in the course of 2018
, but has remained above its 
long
-term average. Looking forward, consumption growth is expected to continue to 
evolve in line with real disposable income developments. The main contribution
 to real 
disposable income
 growth
 stems from real labour income growth (see Chart B), which 
is expected 
to be driven to an increasing extent by wage developments and less by 
employment growth. This composition partly explains the slowdown in consumption 
growth
, as the latter typically reacts more strongly to changes in employment than to 
income. The terms of trade 
Œ reflecting the relation
ship between
 export prices 
and import prices 
Œ are expected to improve and 
to 
provide additional support 
to 
disposable i
ncome
13 as oil prices are 
assumed 
to fall back
 after having risen in the 
third quarter of 2018
, 
subject to the caveat that
 oil prices 
can be highly volatile, 
as 
recent
ly witnessed
. 
Property income 
is also expected to continue to support real 
disposable inco
me. While fiscal policies overall have contributed negatively to 
disposable income in recent years
, in line with the cyclical mechanism of fiscal 
stabilisers, they are expected to give some support to disposable income in 2019. In 
addition, progress achiev
ed in household sector deleveraging should also 
support
 consumption, although household debt is still at a relatively high level. All in all, real 
disposable income will underpin private consumption while 
at the same time 
allowing 
a gradual build
-up of hou
sehold savings.

 Driving
 factors of and risks to domestic demand in the euro area
  27 In the context of a maturing business cycle, growth in business investment is 
still expected 
to continue,
 despite a more uncertain environment
. Business 
investment will be underpinned by domestic demand developments, capacity 
constraints and profitability in line with historical patterns (see Chart C)
, albeit 
exhibiting a slowing pace as the business cycle matures
 and profit and demand 
conditions
 weaken
. Financial conditions remain accommodative
, but are expected to 
gradually become less supportive 
of 
investment. In addition, improving balance sheets 
and easing liquidity needs for euro area firms 
will 
also 
support
 business investment. 
As 
for 
the h
ousing market, short
-term indicators at the turn of the year 
Œ such as 
subdued 
Purchasing Managers™ Index 
levels and construction production 
Œ reflect 
rising labour shortages in some countries and point to a near
-term deceleration in 
housing investment gro
wth. Nevertheless, the medium
-term upturn in housing 
investment should continue from below pre
-crisis levels in many of the larger euro 
area countries, supported by house price developments.

 Note: 
The latest observations are for the third quarter of 
2018
. There are also signs that growth is increasingly supported by structural factors 
as well as 
cyclical 
ones
, despite some vulnerabilities.
 The re
duction 
in 
macroeconomic imbalances, notably in former programme countries, and structural 
reforms have strengthened the euro area™s resilience 
and 
the effectiveness of 
monetary policy. This 
should also reduce adverse repercussions of idiosyncratic 
shocks 
in euro area countries. At the same time, potential vulnerabilities stem from
, 
among other things,
 still high public and private debt levels, 
non-performing loans 
on banks™ balance sheets, below pre
-crisis household savings and remaining structural 
rigidit
ies in some countries.
 The resilience of the domestic demand components could be particularly 
challenged by increasing global uncertainty related 
inter alia 
to an escalation in 
trade tensions.
 As 
for 
private consumption, data suggest that labour income gro
wth 
can be expected to continue
 to support household spending, despite possible adverse 
impacts from global trade uncertainty. This is evidenced by survey data on

 The 
adve
rse 
impact 
of 
heightened global uncertainty could potentially be 
greater for 
business investment than 
for 
private consumption, 
according to 
survey data and model evidence.
 While uncertainty is difficult to measure, 
heightened uncertainty has a well
-documen
ted adverse impact on business 
investment decisions.
14 As evidence of this impact, country surveys suggest that 
increasing global uncertainty is causing some delay in investment decisions.
15 In 
order to assess the impact, two simulations were run using the E
CB™s multi
-country 
forecast model.
16 In both simulations
, 
the residuals of the investment equations for the 
largest euro area countries in the model were shocked to replicate an increase in the 
VIX volatility index (see Chart E), 
exploiting historical corre
lations between the 
VIX 
and the residuals. In 
the first
 scenario, 
the VIX was increased by 
one standard 
                                                                    14  In 
response to uncertainty shock
s, firms can adjust their inventory polic
ies
 by 
disproportionately 
cutting 
their orders of foreign intermediates, leadi
ng to a bigger contraction in international trade flows than in 
domestic economic activity
 (see, for example, 
Novy, D.
 and 
Taylor, A.M.
, ﬁTrade and Uncertainty
ﬂ, CEP 
Discussion Paper
, No 1266
, Centre for Economic Performance, May 
2014
). An uncertain 
trade policy 
outlook gives firms a reason to delay entry in
to a foreign market (extensive margin) and to delay 
upgrading their technology (intensive margin) (

in 
particular private consumption, will remain a 
key driver of activity over the next 
few 
years, albeit with a diminishing contrib

, reflecting the expected maturing of the business cycle. Meanwhile, increasing

 The
 mechanical imp

energy inflation
  31 3 The mechanical impact of changes in oil price
 assumpti
ons on projections for euro area HICP energy 
inflation
 Prepared by Mario Porqueddu
 Inflation proje
ctions are based on 
models, assumptions and e
xpert judgement. 
These include 
assumptions
 regarding the
 future evolution of oil prices.
 In the 
case of the Eu
ros
ystem/ECB projection exercises, 
the 
inflation 
projections are 
based
 on the assumption that oil prices 
will
 evolve 
in line with
 the 
average 
futures pri
ces 
observed over a two
-week period p
rior to t
he projection cut
-off date. Using the oil price 
futures
 has 
an important bearing on the projections for HICP energy inflation. For 
instance, the
 pattern of HICP inflation in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff 
projections 
entailed,
 among other things,
 a strong decline in the contribution of energy 
inflation, from 0.
6 percentage point in 2018 to 0.2 percentage point in 2019 and 0.1 
percentage point in 2020 and 2021 (see Chart A).
17 However, t
he cut
-off date for the 
assumptions underlying these 
projections 
was 21 November 2018
, 
and oil prices and 
their corresponding fut
ures paths fell
 significantly after this date.
 While they 
have 
recovered somewhat 
lately 
compared 
with
 the end of 2018, they remain on balance 
substantially 
below the levels on the cut
-off date
. This box documents the mechanical 
implications 
of a shift in 
the oil price assumptions for the projections of the energy 
component of HICP inflation.

 Energy prices mirror oil price developments closely, but there is some 
deviation between the two.
 This is because energy items such as gas and electrici
ty 
have a looser relationship with oil prices 
tha
n do fuels (for which the relationship is 
very close). Moreover, the impact of taxes and margins also plays an important role in 
shaping energy price developments.
19 Nevertheless, developments in the annual r
ate 
of change in oil prices are typically a fairly reliable gauge for developments in the 
annual rate of change in energy prices (see Chart C).

 corresponds to the average 
over the

 ending on 23 January 
(1.14 
USD

5% above the December 2018 hypothesis.
 This means 
that almost all of the change 
in oil prices in euro corresponds to the downward shift of the oil price futures curve in USD.
 The implications of the recent oil price developments are a reminder 
of the 
uncertainty 
regarding energy inflation 
proj
ections
. The 
option
-implied density 
distribution of oil prices is wide (see the bands in Chart B)
, corresponding to an 
interquartile range of between around 
USD 53 per b
arrel and 
USD 69 per barrel on 
average in 2019
 (22% below and 2% above the assumptions 
underlying the 
December 2018 Eurosystem staff projections). Cross
-sectional distributions of future 
oil prices in expectation surveys offer another way to look at the uncertainty 
surrounding the projections for energy inflation. For instance, on average, t
he participants in the ECB™s Survey of Professional Forecasters for the first quarter of 
201920 expected oil prices to stand at around USD 64 per barrel in 2019 (implying a 
steeper upward path than the oil futures curve), with a one standard deviation range
 in 
individual expectations of around USD 5 per barrel.
 Overall, changes in oil prices also have a notable impact beyond energy prices.
 It is important to 
bear in mind
 that changes in oil prices not only have direct effects on 
energy prices
, they
 also 
have
 indirect effects on other consumer prices via cost and 
demand chan
nels. While the cost advantage of lower oil prices may to some extent be 
passed on to consumer prices, the increase in purchasing power can be expected to 
support consumption and economic a
ctivity more generally, thereby exerting 
Œ with 
some delay 
Œ upward pressure on consumer prices.
 In addition, it is important to 
monitor to what extent oil price changes may influence inflation expectations. The full 
impact of changes in oil prices therefo
re needs to be assessed in the context of a 
fully
-fledged projection exercise.

 1 Twenty years of the ECB Survey of Professional 
Forecasters
 Prepared by Rupert de
 Vincent
-Humphreys
, Ivelina Dimitrova, Elisabeth 
Falck and Lukas Henkel
 It is twenty y
ears since the ECB first launched its Survey of Professional Forecasters 
(SPF). The survey asks for point forecasts and probability distributions for HICP 
inflation, HICP inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, real GDP growth 
and the unempl
oyment rate at six horizons, as well as
 point forecasts for wage growth, 
the exchange rate, the oil price and the ECB™s policy rate. All quantitative data 
collected in the survey are systematically published shortly after the completion of the 
survey. This
 makes the SPF the most long
-standing, comprehensive and transparent 
survey of the aggregate euro area economy.
 The past twenty years have seen a wide variety of economic conditions, including the 
Great Moderation, with relatively high economic growth and 
stable inflation, the 
financial crisis and, more recently, a prolonged period of subdued inflationary 
pressures. This article documents the evolution of the SPF through this changing 
economic landscape and what we have learned from it. The SPF remains as u
seful for 
economic analysis and as relevant to the monetary policy debate today as it was when 
it was first launched.
 1 Introduction
 to the Survey of Professional Forecasters
 Inflation expectations play a central role in the ECB™s 
economic and 
monetary 
ana
lyses
, 
particularly in view of 
its 
mandate 
to maintain price stability in the 
euro area.
 The ECB
 sets monetary policy
 with the aim of
 maintain
ing
 annual euro 
area HICP inflation at a rate
 below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 In this 
context, p
riva
te agents™ inflation expectations 
can affect the economy, because they 
can influence 
economic decisions in areas such as 
saving, 
consumption and 
investment, as well as wage and price setting
. The role of inflation expectations in 
determining actual wage an
d price inflation can be modelled in a forward
-looking 
Phillips curve relationship. 
Similarly, financial market participants™ inflation 
expectations 
can directly influence 
the pricing of 
some
 financial instruments, such as 
nominal bonds, and thus directly 
affect the transmission of monetary policy to the real 
economy.
21 In addition, inflation expectations also 
serve as a valuable cross
-check on 
the inflation outlook in the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which in 
turn inform monetary policy d
ecisions.
 The ECB therefore closely monitors private 
                                                                    21  For more information on market

ty years of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters
  35 agents™ inflation expectations 
using a range of sources, not least the results of its own 
quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).
 The SPF has measured inflation expectations and other macroec
onomic 
expectations since the beginning of monetary union.
 At 
the time of its launch,
 the 
SPF was the only gauge of private sector macroeconomic expectations for the euro 
area as a whole
. The 
survey 
collects information on the expected rates of 
consumer 
price 
inflation, 
wage growth, 
real GDP growth and unemployment in the euro area at 
several horizons, ranging from the current year to the longer term.
 In addition, 
respondents provide expectations for exogenous variables 
underpinning their 
forecasts
, such as
 the oil price and the exchange rate, and qualitative comments that 
enrich their quantitative forecasts. Thus the overall survey results provide a 
comprehensive depiction of experts™ aggregate assessment of the macroeconomic 
outlook.
 Expectations are sampl
ed at different horizons for different purposes
. In the 
shorter term, expectations are collected for the current and the following two calendar 
years, as well as two rolling horizons, one year and two years ahead of the latest 
available data. The evolution
 of shorter
-term expectations allows us to track how the 
professional forecasting community is assessing new information about the shocks 
hitting the economy, e.g. from the incoming data, as well as learning about the effect of 
a given shock. In this conte
xt, calendar year point forecasts can easily be compared 
with those published in other surveys or with
 Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections
. The rolling horizons are better suited to measuring how perceptions of risk 
and uncertainty evolve over t
ime, because these abstract from the natural decline in 
uncertainty that tends to occur as the forecast horizon shrinks. Finally, longer
-term 
expectations can reveal information about the perceived steady state of the economy. 
In particular, longer
-term in
flation expectations can 
tell us about confidence in meeting 
the inflation objective
. Probability distributions provide a quantitative assessment of risk and 
uncertainty.
 A distinguishing feature of the SPF is that for inflation, core inflation, 
unemployme
nt and real GDP growth, expectations at all horizons, including the longer 
term, are collected not just in the form of point forecasts, but also probability 
distributions. This allows a quantification of forecast uncertainty and of whether 
forecasters cons
ider the uncertainty to be broadly balanced around their point forecast 
or skewed towards the upside or the downside.
 The respondents to the survey are expert economists working in either 
financial or non
-financial institutions, using different forecasting
 methodologies.
 Approximately
 55 responses are received each quarter, which is 
relatively high compared with other
 expert macroeconomic surveys for the euro area 
as a whole. 
The majority of respondents are from financial institutions
, although a 
significan
t number of economic research institutions 
also 
contribute. 
Since 2008 a 
special survey conducted every five years 
has provided 
additional insight on how the 
expectations reported in the 
SPF are formed
 (see Box 1).
 High data transparency and economic relev
ance have led to considerable 
research based on the SPF.
 All the quantitative data, including microdata, are

 36 published on the ECB™s website each quarter, along with the summary report. This has 
helped stimulate substantial academic research into the SPF and what we can learn 

from its results. For a selective summary of such research, see Box 2.
 This article looks at twenty years of results from the SPF and what we have 

learned from them.
 Section 2 explores the extent to which co
-movement of 
expectations for
 pairs of variables is informative of the underlying economic 
relationships. Sections 3 and 4 examine, respectively, the point forecast results and 

the risk parameters implied by the probability distribution functions (PDFs), while 

Section 5 considers what
 we can learn from the longer
-term expectations. Section 6 
concludes.

The 2018 special survey: 
forecasting
 processes
 and
 methodologies
 and how they have 
changed over time
 Prepared by Rupert de Vincent
-Humphreys
 and Ivelina Dimitrova
 The five
-yearly 
special survey is an important tool for understanding how SPF 
participants 
make their forecasts and form their expectations
. In particular, it can track whether and how 

forecasters are adapting to the challenges posed to underlying economic relationships by episodes 

such as the financial crisis or the more recent period of protracted low inflation. This box summarises 

selected results on 
forecast
ing
 processes and methodologies
 in the 2018 survey and discusses how 
they have changed over time
.22 Reduced
-form models remained the predominant tool for short and medium
-term forecasts, 
while for longer
-term forecasts models with economic structure were more widely used
. On 
average across variables, 80% of respondents in the 2018 survey indicated that they use 
reduce
d-
form models for their short
-term forecasts, compared with 60% for longer
-term forecasts 
(see Chart
 A
, upper panel)
. Models with economic structure are used by 40% of respondents for 
longer
-term forecasts, compared with 20% for short
-term forecasts. These
 numbers are broadly 
similar to those found in the 2013 survey, reconfirming the shift in relative usage compared with the 
2008 survey.
 Expert judgement also continued to play an important role, especially for longer
-term 
forecasts, for which it has become
 more important over time
. Across all variables and horizons, 
on average little more than 10% of respondents in the 2018 survey said that they rely solely on model 
outcomes
. For most variables and horizons, the share is lower than in the 2008 and 2013 surv
eys. 
For longer
-term horizons, approximately 50% of point forecasts were essentially judgement
-based. 
Following the 2008 crisis, the shift towards
 increased judgement was reflected more in an increase in 
essentially judgement
-based forecasts
, while since t
he period of protracted low inflation there has 
been a greater shift towards models with judgement
-based adjustment 
(see Chart A
, lower panel). 
The degree of judgement underlying the probability distributions is generally higher than for the point 

forecast
s. In the 2018 special survey, 75% of respondents indicated that their probability distributions 
were essentially judgement
-based.
 The shifts in relative importance are consistent with the answers to questions on the impact 
of specific economic episodes.
 In the 2013 special survey
, 70% of respondents reported that in

  37 response to the 2008 crisis they
 used more judgement
. The 2018 special survey asked the same 
question in respect of the period of prolonged low inflation, and 75% of respondents indicated that 
they supplemented 
their models with a higher degree of judgement
. In this respect, the higher degree 
of judgement after the 2008 crisis may have coincided with a greater use of reduced
-form models for 
two possible reasons. On the one hand, the crisis may h
ave undermined forecasters™ confidence in 
the ability of structural models to capture the structure of the economy at a time of potentially large 
structural changes. On the other hand, forecasters may have opted for reduced
-form models 
because of the relat
ive ease of applying more judgement to them.

 Twenty
 years of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters
  38 point and density forecasts of individual SPF forecasters in an anonymised form. Researchers have 
used these various data dimensions for a v
ariety of analytical purposes as follows:
 Forecast performance: One strand of the literature compares SPF forecasts to benchmark 
forecasting models and finds that the survey responses provide useful information about 
future economic developments
. Bowles et
 al. (2010) and Grothe and Meyler (2018) analyse 
aggregate forecast errors for unemployment, GDP growth and inflation at business cycle frequency. 
They conclude that average expectations in the SPF perform better than naïve or purely 
backward
-looking bench
mark models. Exploiting the panel dimension of the SPF data, Genre et al. 
(2013) apply several combination schemes of the individual forecasts, such as principal component 
analysis, performance
-based weighting, and Bayesian shrinkage, and find that a simpl
e average of 
SPF forecasts is hard to beat using the more sophisticated methods.
23 Forecast uncertainty: Since the financial crisis there has been increased interest in the 
uncertainty surrounding SPF point forecasts.
 Abel et al. (2016) find a countercyclic
al behaviour of 
forecast uncertainty and, in line with other papers (for example 
yziak 
and Paloviita
, 2017), document 
a rise in uncertainty in the post
-crisis period. While the cross
-sectional forecast disagreement has 
also increased since the c
risis, it has proven to be a poor proxy of forecast uncertainty (see Glas and 
Hartmann, 2016). 
Rich and Tracy (2018) exploit the SPF microdata to calculate a measure of how 
much an individual respondent™s distributional forecast differs from all others rep
orted in a particular 
survey round. They find considerable heterogeneity across forecasters and document little relation 
between this measure of distributional difference and individual forecast uncertainty.
 While individual 
uncertainty is very persistent 
over time, the 
measure of distributional difference
 shows pronounced 
time
-variation.
24 Anchoring of inflation expectations: Another strand of the literature highlights that the 
long
-run inflation forecasts reflect trust in the central bank inflation objecti
ve. Beechey et al. 
(2011) show that average long
-run inflation expectations in the SPF are very stable and show little 
variation across forecasters. They conclude that expectations are firmly anchored, which is in line 
with the findings of Grishchenko et a
l. (2017), who estimate a dynamic factor model of aggregate US 
SPF and ECB SPF data.
 For a short and limited period after the crisis, Grishchenko et al. (2017) and 
yziak 
and Paloviita
 (2017) document mild signs of de
-anchoring. In a panel analysis of the individual 
SPF inflation forecasts, Dovern and Kenny (2017) confirm the anchoring of SPF inflation 
                                                                    23  See

25 Expectations formation: Recent studies investigate whether forecasts are made according to 
specific economic relationships or rules.
 Frenkel et al. (2011) find that the expectations 
of SPF 
participants are consistent with standard macroeconomic relationships, such as the Phillips curve or 
Okun™s law. Reitz et al. (2012) study the individual oil price forecasts from the SPF and document a 

complex and non
-linear formation process for oil price expectations.
26 The 
wide range of research areas 
for which 
SPF data 
are used highlights the usefulness of 
the dataset for academic and applied research.
 In particular, analyses related to the anchoring of 
long
-term inflation expectations, changes in
 the expectation formation in the post
-crisis period and 
the pronounced increase in forecast uncertainty are of high policy relevance.

What do SPF results reveal about underlying economic Forecasters typically form their expectations on the basis of economic concepts and relationships. Differences in perceived underlying relationships can thus be an important source of differences between forecasts and need to be 
considered in the assessment and communication of expectations. For instance, relationships such as the Phillips curve or Okun™s law are building blocks of many 
macroeconomic models and often shape the common economic thinking of the 
professional forecasting community. The ECB reviews and uses such relationships in its economic analysis,27 and it is important to understand whether SPF expectations are also generated in line with corresponding economic relationships. So what are the conventional ways of specifying these relationships and to what extent can they be tested using SPF data? The Phillips curve connects price or wage movements with measures of economic slack, such as the output or unemployment gap. A widely used version is the New Keynesian Phillips curve that can be expressed in the following equation: =+  ( )+(

 40 where current inflation (
) is a function of the unemployment gap, defined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate 
 and its structural rate 

 (often 
represented by the non
-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, NAIRU), and a 
term for expected future inflation 
(
). As well as the unemployment gap, 
economic slack can also be measured using the output gap, i.e. the difference 
between actual output and a measure of potential output. Some versions of the 
Phillips curve (especially earlier versions)
 do not include expected inflation. A similar 
concept exists for wages, where price inflation is replaced by a measure of wage 

inflation.
 Okun™s law describes the 
relationship 
between the unempl
oyment rate and GDP 
growth.
 A widely used version
 relates changes in the unemployment rate to real 
GDP 
growth
, as in the following equation:
 u=+ 

 where Okun™s coefficient 
 is negative and 
describes the strength of the relationship. 
If real 
GDP 
growth is
 one percentage point higher, the unemployment rate falls by 
 percentage points.
 Another widely used formulation relates the unemployment gap to 
the output gap.
 The 
results of the 2018 special survey indicate that point forecasts 
for the key 
variables 
tend to be jointly determined.
 Participants had the opportunity to specify 
whether any joint determination of their forecasts was done in a formal manner, e.g. 
within one model, or more informally, e.g. through expert consideration of, and 
judgement applied to
, 
model outputs. Across the different pairs of economic variables, 
on average over 80% of respondents indicated that their point forecasts were 
determined
 jointly
, and predominantly in 
a more informal manner (see Chart 
1). By 
contrast, only about 40% of respondents indicated that they prepare their PDFs jointly.
 Phil
lips curve and Okun™s law relationships were primarily used t
o inform 
revisions to forecasts at medium
-term horizons (from one to three years 
ahead).
 This is consistent with there being a greater role for idiosyncratic shocks in the 
short term
 (the next twelve months), whereas longer
-term expectations would be more 
influenced by views on the structural parameters of the economy. Similarly, the 
proportion of forecasters indicating that they revised the HICP inflation PDFs jointly 
with either their GDP growth or unemployment rate PDFs was greatest at the 
medium
-term horizon, although the overall shares of positive responses were lower 
than for the point forecasts.

. Indeed, these macr
oeconomic relationships can also be seen in the aggregate 
data
. A scatter plot of aggregate point forecasts from the SPF shows a negative 
relationship for two
-year
-ahead forecasts of inflation and the unemployment rate, 
which is consistent with a Phillips 
curve relationship (see Chart 2). However, the 
correlation between the two variables significantly weakened in the post
-crisis period, 
which is consistent with the evidence presented in Box 3.
28 Moreover, aggregate 
two
-year

h and changes in the two
-year
-ahead forecasts for unemployment exhibit a negative correlation, which is in line with Okun™s 
law. However, the negative correlation was not statistically significant before 2008 and 
has strengthened considerably in the post
-crisis period. This observation is also 
present in realised data, which show a strong increase in the correlation between GDP 
growth and unemployment in the post
-crisis period. The effect has been especially 
strong since the start of the recovery and points
 towards a possible structural change 
in the unemployment
-GDP relationship.

  43 (,) denotes the forecast revision of expected inflation for the subsequent calendar year. 
Forecast revisions are defined as the change in t
he point forecast between two consecutive survey 
rounds. The sample period is from the first quarter of 1999 to the last quarter of 2018. Using the full 
sample and pooling over all forecasters, the Phillips curve slope has a statistically significant negat
ive 
value of 
-0.09.
 Five
-year rolling window regressions suggest that
 the slope of the implied Phillips curve has 
substantially flattened
. While the slope of the Phillips curve was relatively stable (but imprecisely 
estimated) before the financial crisis, 
the slope consistently converged to zero in the post
-crisis period 
and has remained there in recent years.
 Using long
-term expectations,
30 the regression uncovers no 
relationship between unemployment and inflation forecast revisions, reflecting rather small
 variations 
at that horizon, but also supporting the view of monetary neutrality in the long run (yellow line in 
Chart
 A).

coefficient of a regression of revisions to long
-term inflation expectations on revisions to long

 This analysis points to changes in the link between the formation of unemployment and 
inflation forecasts.
 While the SPF unemployment and inflation forecasts are
 generally in line with a 
price Phillips curve, the analysis also reveals that the macroeconomic relationship has considerably 
weakened in the post
-crisis period. The results suggest that other factors, such as judgement

forecasts (see Box 1), have g
ained in importance for the expectations formation process.

  44 3 How have SPF point forecasts 
evolved
 over time?
 HICP inflation and real GDP growth outturns have been affected by strong and 
persistent shocks over the last ten years
. In the first ten years of
 the SPF, HICP 
inflation was mostly a little over 2%, and was modestly, although persistently 
under-predicted by the aggregate forecast of the SPF, while aggregate real GDP 
growth forecasts either over
-predicted or under
-predicted the actual outturns
. The 
last 
ten years have seen much greater swings in these variables and have been more 
characterised by overestimation of both HICP inflation and real GDP growth (see 
Charts 3 and 4).

  45 SPF forecasts have typically exhibited str
ong reversion to trend
. Despite the 
magnitudes of the gyrations in both HICP inflation and real GDP growth, SPF 
forecasts have tended immediately to revert back towards a long
-run trend 
(exceptions being real GDP growth expectations in 2008 and 2011, when 
the sharp fall 
in the growth rate was expected to continue before recovering). In general, the further 
the data were from their perceived trend, as proxied by the longer
-term expectation, 
the stronger was the movement expected back towards that trend. In o
ther words, 
there is a strong negative relationship between deviation from trend, and the change 
expected over the next two years (see Chart
 5). This relationship holds more tightly for 
inflation, which could be interpreted positively as an indication of t
he strength of the 
inflation anchor.

 Box 4  Assessing individual forecaster performance
 Prepared by 
Aidan Meyler
 Determining whether the heterogeneity in individual forecast
er™s forecasting performance is 
due to chance or differences in forecasting ability is challenging for a number of reasons.
 First, all we can observe is the (ex post) forecast error once the outcome is realised. However, a 
large/small forecast error does n
ot necessarily imply a bad/good forecast at the time the forecast was 
made (i.e.
 ex ante) because the error might just reflect an unanticipated shock related, for example, to 
oil prices, weather or exchange rates. Second, there is also the difficulty of ma
king comparisons 
across different variables and forecasting horizons. For instance, a forecaster might perform relatively 
well when forecasting HICP inflation one year ahead but relatively poorly when forecasting real GDP 
growth two years ahead. Third, not
 all forecasters respond in every round and not all provide 
forecasts for all variables/horizons (in technical terms, it is an unbalanced panel). Thus it could be that 
                                                                    31  See the b

  47 a particular forecaster did not respond when it was relatively easy/hard to make a forec
ast and this 
could affect the forecaster™s average error.
 We address the question of chance versus ability using techniques known as 
ﬁbootstrappingﬂ and ﬁMonte Carlo simulationﬂ.
33 The 
basic 
idea is to take the forecast errors for 
a given variable/horizon i
n each period and randomly reallocate them across the forecasters who 
provided a forecast in that period for the specific variable/horizon (
also 
known as bootstrapping).
34 This process is then repeated a large number of times, for example one thousand (
also
 known as 
Monte Carlo simulation), to simulate the distribution of forecast errors under the assumption (null 
hypothesis) of equal forecasting ability.
35 If the actual distribution of forecast performance lies within 
given confidence bands (for example
, 1% 
and 99%) of the simulated distribution, then we cannot 
reject the null hypothesis that forecasters have equal ability and that differences in performance 
are 
largely 
due to chance.
 At first glance, the results suggest that some forecasters perform better/w
orse than would be 
expected if the null hypothesis of equal ability were true.
 For example, panel a of Chart A shows 
that, for HICP one
-year
-ahead forecasts, there are a number of forecasters who perform better than 
would be expected under the null hypothe
sis of equal forecasting ability and some that perform 
worse. This is shown by the fact that the actual distribution lies below/above the simulated distribution 
for the better/worse ranked forecasters. This pattern is generally repeated for the other 
varia
bles/horizons.
                                                                     33  See

) have relied 
on balanced panels and, in some cases, utilised rank, which does not take into account the size of 
forecast errors.
 34  To avoid forecasters with only a few forecasts having a disproporti
onate impact on the results, we only 
consider forecasters who have provided at least 20 forecasts (i.e.
 the equivalent of five
-years) for a given 
variable/horizon. This leaves us with between 63 and 77 forecasters, depending on the variable/horizon.
 35  We 
assess relative forecast performance using a statistic (the squared error statistic scaled by the mean 
squared error) that (a)
 penalises larger errors, (b)
 controls for difficult to forecast 
variables/horizons/periods
, and (c)
 allows us to aggregate

 First, if 
individual forecasters indeed had above/below average forecasting ability, we might expect to see 
some correlation in performance rankings across sample periods. In this regard
, it is tell
ing that the 
correlation of the rankings of forecast performance across the pre

zero (see Table

. To sum up, there is no strong evidence of statistically significant differences in forecasting 
ability.
 In fact, the aggregate SPF forecast (which averages all individual responses) i
s always in the 
upper quartile across the 12 permutations
36 of variable, horizon and period and is ranked first overall 
when aggregating across variables, horizons and periods. This suggests that it is hard to consistently 
beat 
the simple average.
37  4 How h
ave SPF 
probability distributions 
performed over time?
 PDFs allow survey respondents to express their views on the complete range of 
outcomes and are thus a valuable complement to point forecasts
. Forecasters 
assign probabilities to outcomes of each variab
le at each horizon in an interval half a 
percentage point wide.
38 Each quarter the SPF reports the aggregate probability 
distribution, i.e. the average of all probabilities reported for each interval. These 
distributions, at both the individual and the aggr
egate level, allow a quantitative 
assessment of perceived risk and uncertainty, adding the extra dimension of 
information to the point forecasts. 
 The aggregate probability distributions for the individual variables have seen 
dynamic and often large moveme
nts over the years (see Chart 7)
. In particular, 
there are some notable differences in the PDFs reported in the first ten years and the 
latest ten years of the SPF, which broadly correspond to the pre
- and post
-crisis 
periods. These reflect not only differ
ences in the location of the PDFs, echoing 
differences in the point forecasts, but also differences in the shape of the PDFs. For 
example, even though at the two
-year horizon the perceived deflation risk has 
vanished, the probability assigned to relatively
 low inflation outturns (<1.5%) is still 
quite elevated, as the PDFs have a more negative skew.
                                                                     36  The twelve permutations are the result of having three

  51 Foreca
sters™ assessments of uncertainty seem to have increased permanently 
in 2009, across all variables and horizons
. Aggregate uncertainty is typically 
measured by the width of the aggregate PDF
. This, in turn, is determined by two 
factors: how uncertain each 
forecaster is, i.e. the width of the individual PDFs being 
aggregated, and how much forecasters disagree about the most likely outturn, i.e. the 
extent to which the individual distributions are centred
 differently. One striking feature 
of the SPF data is t
hat, across all variables and horizons, there was a step increase in 
forecasters™ individual uncertainty at the time of the financial crisis (see Chart 8) which 
has persisted ever since. The effect of disagreement
 on aggregate uncertainty, on the 
other han
d, has been much more varied across economic variables, forecast horizons 
and time.

Solid lines depict two

-term expectations.
 Even after the 2009 step increase in forecasters™ uncertainty, the 
two
-year
-ahead PDFs underestimated subsequent data volatility.
 Over the last 
twenty years, the changes over two years in rates of inflation, real GDP growth and 
unemployment have tended to be much larger than the widths of the two
-year
-ahead PDFs. This can be seen from the concentration of the proportion of outturns in the first 
and last deciles (see Chart 9, right panel). For instance, over 30% of unemployment 
rate outturns came from the upper decile of the distribution expected two years 
previously. If the PDFs were good descriptors of the true, underlying distributions, then 
the 
same share of outturns (10%) would come from each of the
 deciles of the 
respective PDFs. Moreover, many of those tail outturns occurred after forecasters had 
widened their PDFs in 2009. This suggests that, while they believe economic 
developments to be int
rinsically a little more uncertain than during the Great 
Moderation period before 2008, much of the volatility over the last ten years was 
driven by shocks which have been surprising in their magnitude, frequency or 
persistence.

 Forecasters have actively adjusted their view on the balance of risks, as well as 
revising their point forecasts
. The asymmetry of a forecast probability distribution is 
indicative of the balance of 
risks that the forecast embodies
 (see Box
 5). Forecasters 
have adjusted their risk balances dynamically in response to the evolving economic 
outlook, especially for their expected inflation PDFs (see Chart
 10). In 2006, as 
inflationary pressures appeared t
o be building, forecasters moved the balance of risks 
around their expectations for inflation in two years™ time strongly to the upside, but 
without much change in their point forecasts. In the survey in the first quarter of 2009, 
the aggregate point estim
ate fell by 0.3 percentage point (the largest 
quarter
-on-quarter revision) and the balance of risk measure moved from +0.1 to 
-0.9. 
In the survey in the second quarter of 2009 the point forecast was revised down by 
only 0.1 percentage point, whereas the ba
lance of risk measure moved 
further 
downwards 
very strongly to 
-2.7, before recovering over subsequent survey rounds, 
while the point forecast remained stable. In contrast, in the period 2013
-2014, when 
HICP inflation was falling, point forecasts were prog
ressively revised downwards, with 
little change in the balance of risks metric.

 5  Using probability distributions to measure the balance of risks
 Prepared by 
Rupert de Vincent
-Humphreys
 A probability distribution for a future outcome forms a complete representation of the 
forecast
. The probability distribution function (PDF) pr
ovides the information needed to summarise 
all aspects of the forecast: the central point forecast, how uncertain that is, whether the balance of 
risks is seen as more to the upside or downside, and the probabilities of outcomes in given ranges
. In 
practic
e, the accuracy of such metrics depends on how precisely the PDF is specified.
 In theory, how a forecaster summarises the underlying probability distribution as a single 
point forecast depends on that forecaster™s view on forecast errors
. More formally, fo
recasting 
theory shows that the optimal point forecast 
| corresponding to a given PDF is the one which 
minimises the forecaster™s loss function associated with possible forecast errors:
  |arg
min
[(,)] The loss function, 
L, is a mathematical expression which d
escribes how much the forecaster would 
care about different
-sized forecast errors. Thus, even if different forecasters had the same view on 
the underlying distribution of possible future outturns, if they had different loss functions they would 
give differ
ent point forecasts. Three types of loss function are typically considered in economics. The 
first is the uniform loss function: all forecast errors are equally bad, regardless of their size. In this 
case, the optimal point forecast is the distribution™s m
ode, which corresponds to the most likely 
outcome. The second loss function increases linearly with the size of the forecast error, i.e. if the 
forecast error is twice as large, then that is twice as bad. In this case, the optimal point forecast is the 
med
ian, where the probability of an upside error is the same as the probability of a downside error. 
The third is the quadratic loss function, which penalises larger forecast errors even more severely: if 
the forecast error is twice as large, then that is fou
r times as bad. In this case, the corresponding point 
forecast is the distribution™s mean.

  54 Similarly, the statistical measure of asymmetry that best represents the balance of risks 
around a point forecast also depends
 on the 
forecaster™s view on forecast e
rrors.
 The extent to 
which risks around the point forecast are in one direction or another depends on the asymmetry of the 
forecast PDF: for a symmetric PDF the risks are balanced. Just as forecast theory defines the optimal 
forecast, it defines the balanc
e of risk as the balance of conditional expected loss:
 |,|>| ,|<| In cases where the loss function itself is symmetric (such as the
 three described above), i.e. an upside 
error and a downside error of the same magnitude would be equally undesirable, the 
balance of risks 
measures, in the event that a forecast turn
s out to be wrong, 
in which direction 
the forecaster 
considers it more li
kely to be wrong. For instance, a positive balance of risks indicates that the 
forecaster believes that, were 
the 
forecast to be wrong, it would more likely be because the outturn 
was ab
ove the forecast than below it. The equation above can be combined wit
h the different loss 
functions to show that the appropriate measure of asymmetry is the balance of total probability either 
side of the mode in the case of uniform loss, the quartile skewness in the case of linear loss, and 
skewness in the case of mean squ
ared loss.
 In the context of the SPF, where probabilities are reported for a discrete set of fairly wide 
intervals, there are a number of alternative ways of evaluating the different statistical 
asymmetry measures
. For example, the interval probabilities s
upplied in the SPF represent a set of 
points along the cumulative distribution function, and different interpolation schemes can be used to 
convert these into a continuous function. In addition, an assumption needs to be made about where to 
place the point
s corresponding to the two open probability intervals and the upper and lower ends of 
the range of plausible outcomes.
 All combinations of statistical measures and alternative calculation practices can be brought 
together in a balance of risk indicator sui
te. These measures all tend to co
-move strongly and can 
be distilled into a simple summary statistic by taking their unweighted average.
39  5 What can we learn from longer
-term expectations
? Longer
-term expectations in the SPF may provide information on pro
fessional 
forecasters views on the steady state of the economy.
 The steady state is 
important because this is what the economy reverts to once the effects of past and 
current shocks have died out and can evolve in line with structural trends in the 
economy
. In the SPF, the longer
-term horizon
 correspond
s to a
 horizon about five 
years ahead.
 It might be reasonable to assume that most shocks hitting the economy 
are not that persistent, and so, by that horizon, the impact of any shock should have 
faded. If thi
s were the case, then longer
-term expectations should reflect only a view 
on the structural characteristics of the economy, such as the potential growth rate or 
the NAIRU.
                                                                     39  For more information, see the box entitled ﬁ

  55 However, the answers to the 2018 special survey suggest that the picture is 
more nua
nced, i.e. that some shocks might be very persistent
. SPF participants 
were asked to clarify how their long
-term forecasts should be interpreted. While many 
respondents said that their long
-term expectations did have a structural interpretation, 
even more 
said that this was only sometimes the case, and some suggested in their 
qualitative comments that the impact of some shocks may be more persistent, in 
which case five years would not be enough to return to the steady state (see Table 1). 
Indeed, the averag
e longer
-term unemployment rate expectations of those responding 
ﬁnoﬂ to a 
NAIRU interpretation
 do appear to be more cyclical than for those responding 
ﬁalwaysﬂ.

 special survey, 
2018.
 The impact of perceived persistence of shocks is
 most visible in the evolution 
of long
-term unemployment expectations
. The sharp increases in actual 
unemployment and short
-term unemployment expectations in the aftermaths of the 
financial and sovereign debt crises 
were also accompanied by 
significant upw
ard 
revisions 
of 
long
-term expectations (see Chart 
11). Such a link 
between 
expectation
s across horizons can be 
explained
 using 
the 
concept of 
hysteresis, whereby temporary 
demand or supply
-driven increases in unemployment
 can
, for instance via duration 
effects, have persistent effects in terms of a higher equilibrium unemployment rate. In 
this respect, the survey results for the last few years suggest that forecasters also 
allow hysteresis to work symmetrically: the decline in short
-term expectations since
 2013 was accompanied by a decline in long
-term expectations in roughly the same 
proportion as 
the previous upward movements. 
As a result, the long
-term 
unemployment expectations display more cyclicality than would normally be expected 
from structural unem
ployment.

target.
 The degree of inflation anchoring can be measured in different ways
. These 
are often based on the sensitivity of longer

-term 
developments, such as the element of surprise in data outturns, or shorter
-term 
expectations. This was comprehensively assessed in the report of the Low Inflation 
Task Force.
40 Data from the quarterly survey suggest that euro area inflation expectations are 
well anchored
. Over the last twenty years the longer
-term inflation expectations 
in the 
SPF have been in the range of 1.8 to 2.0%, a range which could be interpreted as 
broadly consistent with the ECB™s objective of keeping inflation below, but close to, 
2%. Moreover, longer

notable increases in the shares of respondents indicating the ECB™s inflation objective, 
trends in financial market based measures of inflation
 expectations and trends in 
wages, whereas there were notable declines in the shares of respondents indicating 
trends in monetary aggregates and other variables (see Chart 13). Given that trends in 
actual inflation, wages and longer
-term market expectation
s have clearly weakened in 
recent years, the role of the inflation objective as an anchor of expectations has been 
brought to the fore.

 6 Conclusions
 The ECB
™s
 SPF 
is 
the most long
-standing, comprehensive and transparent 
survey of 
the aggregate euro area economy
. In particular, relative to oth
er surveys, 
the PDFs in the SPF allow a complete, quantitative evaluation of perceived risks to 
and uncertainty surrounding the outlook.
 This provides an additional valuable 
dimension to complement the point forecasts and form a more complete economic 
asse
ssment of the information received in the quarterly survey, for example when 
considering the pace and nature of the economic normalisation following the financial 
crisis.
 It is helpful as a cross
-check not only of the ECB™s/Eurosystem™s own 
macroeconomic p
rojection profiles but also of the fundamental economic 
relationships underpinning them
. The twenty years of the SPF have generated a 
rich dataset which can be used to address topical economic questions and help inform 
monetary policy debate
. For example, 
considering the SPF data for different variables 
together, we can deduce how the professional forecasting community assesses the 
relationships between key variables, such as growth and inflation or unemployment 
and wage growth, to be evolving. Thus, the SP
F remains as useful for economic 
analysis 
and as relevant to monetary policy debate today as it 
was 
when it was first 
launched
 twenty years ago

 Fiscal
 spillovers in a monetary union
  59 2 Fiscal spillovers in a monetary union
 Prepared by Mario Alloza, Bogdan Cozmanca, Marien Ferdinandusse 
and Pas
cal Jacquinot
 The article describes the main transmission channels of the spillovers of national fiscal 
policies to other countries within a monetary union and investigates their magnitude 
using different models. In the context of 
Economic and
 Monetary Uni
on (EMU)
, fiscal 
spillovers are relevant 
for the 
accurate assessment of the cyclical outlook in euro area 
countries
, as well as in
 the debates on a coordinated change in the euro area fiscal 
stance and on euro area fiscal capacity. The article 
focuses
 on s
pillovers from 
expenditure
-based expansions in the larger euro area countries by presenting two 
complementary exercises. The first is an empirical investigation of spillovers based on 
a new, long dataset for the largest euro area countries, while the secon
d uses a 
multi
-country general equilibrium model with a rich fiscal specification and the capacity 
to analyse trade spillovers. Fiscal spillovers are found to be heterogen
eous but 
generally positive among the larger euro area countries. The reaction of 
int
erest rates
 to fiscal expansion is an important determinant for the magnitude of spillovers.
 1 Introduction
 Fiscal spillovers 
across countries 
have received increasing attention in recent 
years.
 Understanding the impact of one country™s fiscal policies on 
output in other 
Member 
States of the monetary union is naturally of 
considerable 
interest 
to
 a central 
bank setting a single monetary policy
, as it allows 
the bank to
 better gauge the euro 
area™s economic developments
, and this 
feeds into the assessment of
 the risks to 
price stability. Moreover, fiscal spillovers should be taken into account when a
ssessing 
the aggregate euro area fiscal stance.
41 Finally, the size of the fiscal spillovers is 
important when assessing the stabilisation effects of national fisc
al policies. If the 
fiscal spillovers are small, then the existence of
 a central fiscal stabilisation function 
that
 can support national economic stabilisers in the prese
nce of large economic 
shocks would
 make 
the Economic and Monetary Union (
EMU
) more res
ilient
.42 National fiscal policies spill
 over to other countries through different channels.
 Trade is an important transmission channel between countries, 
whereby
 fiscal 
expansion in one country increases its imports from other countries. 
Fiscal expansion 
could also increase domestic prices and the real effective exchange rate, 
reinforcing 
spillovers, as the stimulating country loses 
competitiveness 
vis
-à-vis the other 
countries
. Given the implications for prices, it is important to take into account the 
mon
etary policy response. Interest rates may occasionally not react to price changes 
                                                                    41  For more information

  60 stemming from fiscal action, for instance, if the economy is constrained by the effective 
lower bound.
43  The empirical literature on fiscal spillovers is relatively underdeve
loped.
 While 
the number of empirical studies of the magnitude of fiscal 
spillovers has grown in 
recent years, it is limited and results are not easily comparable. The different 
identification of fiscal shocks and presentation of the results according to di
fferent 
metrics add to the complication of generalising the findings from the literature. One 
purpose of this article is to provide a review of the most relevant empirical literature on 
spillovers. For simplicity we assume an expenditure
-based fiscal expan
sion in our 
analysis.
44 Spillover e
stimates 
of public spending tend to be positive but generally small
. A number of studies have estimated fiscal spillovers from an increase in public 
spending 
through the trade channel for a panel of countries. For example,
 based on annual data 
from 1965 to 2004, 
Beetsma, Giuliodori
 and Klaassen 
estimate that 
a spending
-based 
fiscal 
expansion
 of 1% of GDP 
in Germany would lead to an 
average
 increase 
in the 
output of
 other 
European 
economies 
by 0.15% 
after two years; for an e
xpansion 
originating in France, the impact is 0.08%.
45 Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2016 
for 55 countries, t
he International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) reports 
that an 
increase
 in government spending by 1% of GDP in an average major advanced economy has a 
spi
llover effect of 0.15
% of GDP
 on an average recipient country within the first year.
46 Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 
find 
fiscal spillovers 
from large
 OECD economies
 that 
are broadly comparable with the IMF findings.
47 Spillover estimates are heterogen
eous.
 The
 estimated magnitude of spillovers 
varies, with the heterogeneity related to the trade
 links, the state of the economy and 
the reaction of monetary policy. 
Beetsma
 et al. find 
spillovers 
from Germany
 to be 
around
 0.4% of GDP
 after two years in small 
open e
conomies sharing a land border 
with 
the country
, such as Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands
. 
Auerbach and 
Gorodnichenko 
find spillovers 
particularly high in recessions and quite modest in 
expansions
. The IMF study finds that spillovers are up to four tim
es as large when 
                                                                    43  Non
-standard monetary policy measures that can lessen the constraints of the effective lower bound are 
not considered in this analysis.
 44  Spillovers from changes in fiscal revenues, which are not the focus of the article, are 
usual
ly 
estimated to 
be considerably lower than government expenditure spillovers. The reason is that a tax cut impacts 
aggregate demand through the spending and saving decisions of households and firms, which induce 
more delays and uncertainty than the direct 
effect of an increase in government spending.

 Fiscal
 spillovers in a monetary union
  61 monetary policy is at the effective lower bound (0.3% after one year), compared with 
normal times (0.08%).
48 Additional insight into fiscal spillovers is provided by a number of studies 
using theoretical dynamic stochastic general equilibri
um (DSGE) models.
 Rich 
DSGE multi
-country models 
can provide more insight into the determinants of the
 fiscal spillovers than empirical methods such as vector auto
-regressions (VARs), 
which encompass a variety of contributing effects that are difficult to 
disentangle. 
However, 
DSGE
 models 
may 
come at the price of imposing restricti
ve assumptions
, 
which may not always have strong empirical foundations
. Studies based on DSGE 
models often find spillovers in normal times to be lower than the VAR
-based estimates
, but higher when interest rates do not react.
49 This is partly explained by the fact that 
structural models only include spillovers through trade, whereas VARs also include 
other effects, such as financial spillovers.
 2 Empirical Estimates
 This section pre
sents new estimates of fiscal spillover effects from the larger euro area 
countries. To this end, country
-specific exogenous government spending shocks are 
identified and their 
dynamic effect on the economic activity of other countries 
considered.
50 2.1
 Dat
a and m
ethodology
 Estimates are based on a new dataset for euro area countries.
 An analysis of the 
effects of fiscal spillovers based on time series methods requires the use of 
comparable, long and detailed data. However,
 for euro area countries, data on 
many 
of the 
necessary
 fiscal variables are only available at 
a quarterly frequency from the 
mid
- to
 late 1990s.
 This issue 
is addressed by
 assembl
ing
 a new dataset for Germany, 
France, Italy, Spain and the euro area
 as a whole,
 from 
the first quarter of 
1980 to 
the 
fourth quarter of 
2015 at 
a quarterly frequency
, which 
is consistent with Eurostat
 data 
(in the current 
ESA 2010 accounting framework). In particular, 
using
 an unobserved 
component model that combines both annual and quarterly national accounts
, a
s well 
as 
monthly indicators
, it is possible to
 estimat
e fiscal variables at a quarterly frequency 
                                                                    48  The effective lower bound is identified as interest rates being in the lowest quartile of the distribution.

  62 while maintaining coherence with official annual aggregates. 
This
 framework 
takes
 into account important features of the data, such as different seasonal pat
terns.
51 The resulting dataset contains disaggregated measures of fiscal spending 
(and 
revenues) 
for each of the four countries and the euro area aggregate.
 This 
disaggregation allows the separation of components of government spending 
depending on their se
nsitivity to economic conditions. In the further analysis the 
government spending aggregate comprises cyclically insensitive items, in particular 
government consumption and investment
, while cyclically sensitive items such as 
transfers are excluded
.52 The e
mpirical strategy follows three steps.
 First, country
-specific VARs are 
estimated based on (
the logs of
) real net tax revenues, government spending, output, 
the GDP deflator and the level of the 
ten
-year interest rate.
 The 
identifying assumption 
is that
 it takes longer than 
one 
quarter to implement fiscal policies in response to a 
change in the economic environment, which allows the identification of structural 
shocks to government spending (i.e. fiscal actions are contemporaneously unrelated 
to the economi
c conditions).
53 Second, the dynamic response of economic activity in 
a country to a government spending shock originating in another country
 is traced
 using local projections.
54 This framework allows the estimation of the bilateral effect of 
the fiscal acti
on for each combination of two countries. Third, these pair
-wise 
estimates are combined into two statistics that summarise the results.
 Spillovers are summarised by destination and by 
origin
. Destination spillovers
 measure the spillover from a simultaneous
 spending shock in all but one euro area 
country on the recipient country. They are constructed as the ratio of the (cumulative) 
sum of the total impact on the output of a given country originated by fiscal actions in 
the rest of the countries to the sum o
f the respective domestic effects in the originating 
countries.
55 Spillover by origin is defined as
 the
 ratio of the (output
-weighted average) 
impact 
on the output 
in the re
ceiving 
countries
 and the
 impact of a government 
spending shock
 on output in the
 ori
ginat
ing
 country. This 
statistic
 indicates the 
magnitude of the spillovers that each individual country is able to generate.
                                                                     51  For Germany and Italy we combine official information from the quarterly non
-financial accounts for 
general government statistics (ESA
 2010 and ESA
 95) and extend it backwards using intra
-annual 
monthly fiscal in
formation and annual official statistics.

 55  The destination spillover i
s the response to a simultaneous increase of 
•1 in the rest of the countries
 considered
, which results from adding the effect of different fiscal shocks at the same moment 
in time. 
Hence, the results for this specification are likely to represent an upper 
bound.

 Results
 The results 
provide evidence
 of positive
 fiscal spillovers in the euro area
. Chart
 1 plots the GDP response in each of 
the four economies to increases in 
government spending in the rest of countries (i.e. the destination spillover).
 The blue 
line shows 
the output response 
in the receiving country 
to the government spending 
shocks in the source countries. Cumulating these o
utput effects and dividing them by 
the cumulated response of government spending in the stimulating countries (not 
shown) converts them into a measure that is directly comparable with the multiplier of 
a domestic fiscal expansion. 
For example, France has a
 cumulative destination 
spillover of 0.72 after two years
. This means a 
simultaneous 
•1 increase in 
government spending in Germany, Italy and Spain would increase French output by 
•0.72 after two years.

 Fiscal
 spillovers in a monetary union
  64 The results 
are c
omparable with
 previous empirical 
studies
. Taking the 
output-weighted results in Chart 1, the average destination spillovers to large euro 
area countries are
 around 0.09, 0.46 and 0.60 in the first, second and third year
s respectively.
 These last results a
re somewhat lower but broadly comparable with 
those of 
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
, with which they are methodologically 
comparable.
 There are differences in dynamics, magnitude and significance of destination 
spillovers across countries
. Fran
ce and Spain s
how a similar pattern, with the 
spillover becoming positive and significant
 at the 68% level
 by the end of the first year
. In both cases the dynamics are similar: around 0.2
-0.3 in the first year and 
cumulatively around 0.6
-0.7 in the second year. 
Germany 
also shows an increasing 
positive spillover, but with significant values at 
the 
68% level, 
only in the third year. 
While only marginally significant, t
he magnitude of the effect in Germany seems to be 
larger
 than in the rest of the countries considered,
 with a cumulative destination 
spillover of 0.6 at the end of the first year
. 
The spillover in Italy is estimated to be the 
lowest and not significantly different from zero. If the 95% confidence level were 
applied, then fiscal spillovers would only be signif
icant in the case of Spain.
 Positive spillovers are also found for spending increases in one country.
 When 
looking at the spillover effect from the point of view of the country conducting the fiscal 
expansion, i.e. 
spillovers by origin
, the results are het
erogeneous but also provide 
evidence of positive fiscal spillovers among large euro area countries (results not 
shown here).
56 3 Spillover
 analysis
 based on a multi
-country DSGE model
 This section provides simulations with
 a multi
-country DSGE model:
 the Eu
ro 
Area and Global Economy (EAGLE) model.
 The model is
 calibrated for 
the four 
largest euro area countries individually (
Germany,
 France, Italy and Spain),
 the rest of 
the euro area
 and the rest of the world.
57 Like
 the E
uropean 
Central 
Bank™s New 
Area
-Wide
 Model, EAGLE is micro
-founded and features nominal price and wage 
rigidities, capital accumulation, 
and international trade in goods and bonds. 
Given its 
global dimension, the model is particularly well suited to assess cross
-border 
spillovers. All region
s trade with each other 
in 
intermediate goods, with 
estimates
 of 
bilateral trade flows based on recent historical averages. International asset trade is 
limited to nominally non
-contingent bonds denominated in US dollars.
                                                                     56  See Alloza, M
. et al 
(2018
), for results. Government spending spillovers by origin are estimated to be 
stronger in Italy and Spain than in Germany, but not significant for France. Spillovers by origin are found 
to be stronger for public investmen
t than consumption.
 57  The Euro Area and Global Economy (EAGLE) 
model 
is a multi
-country dynamic general equilibrium 
model of the euro area developed by an ESCB team composed of staff from the

 Fiscal
 spillovers in a monetary union
  65 The version used here embeds an ex
tended fiscal bloc.
58 Households are 
assumed to derive utility from the consumption of a composite good consisting of 
public 
and private 
consumption goods. It is 
also 
assumed that 
the 
government capital 
stock affects the production process. Moreover, in eac
h country, public debt is 
stabili
sed through a fiscal rule that induces the endogenous adjustment of fiscal 
instruments
 when the public debt ratio deviates from its target
. 
 Members of the euro area share a common nominal exchange rate and a 
common nominal
 interest rate.
 The centra
l bank sets the domestic short
-term 
nominal interest rate according to a standard Taylor
-type rule, by reacting to 
area
-wide 
consumer price inflation and real activity. The remaining 
region 
Œ the rest of the world
 Œ has its own no
minal interest rate and nominal exchange rate.
 The simulations focus on 
government consumption and public investment 
separately.
 The following two sections show the spillovers of a two
-year 
spending
-based fiscal stimulus
, which is debt
-financed, for two al
ternative 
specifications: first, with interest rates set according to the Taylor rule; second, with 
unchanged interest rates.
 The results are shown for government consumption and 
public investment separately.
 3.1
 Spillovers 
by origin and destination
 When i
nterest rates follow Taylor rule prescriptions, s
pillovers by origin are 
positive but small.
 The left
-hand panel 
in Chart 2 shows the spillovers from a fiscal 
stimulus of 1% 
of nominal GDP 
over two years in one large euro area country to the 
rest of the eu
ro area, both for government investment and for consumption.
59 While 
there is some 
cross
-country heterogeneity, both in the domestic effect (shown on the 
x-axis) and the effect on the other countries (y
-axis), the spillovers (computed as the 
ratio of GDP re
action of destination 
to
 source) are below 0.1 on average in the two 
years after the shock.
                                                                     58  See

 by 1% of 
GDP for two years in all but one country on the countries™ output (x

 Spillovers by destination are also small.
 The right
-hand panel 
in Chart 2 shows the 
spillovers in one large country from a
 simultaneous fiscal stimulus of 1%
 of GDP
 over 
two years in the other countries
. For public investment the spillovers come out at just 
above 0.1
. For public 
consumption the destination spillovers are
, on average, slightly 
negative
 during the first two yea
rs, mainly because the demand effect of the fiscal 
stimulus is offset by the contractionary impact of higher interest rates that applies to all 
countries in the monetary union. Relative country size also matters: t
he destination 
spillover in Spain 
is somew
hat larger than the destination spillover in Germany, as the 
former 
results from a 1% of GDP stimulus in all countries but Spain
 and the latter 
from 
a 1% of GDP fiscal expansion in all countries but Germany.
 Destination spillovers are not identical to an a
ggregation of the spillovers by 
origin.
 Both the
 domestic effect on output in the countries 
conducting
 the stimulus
 and 
the spillovers are
 more 
clustered. 
An explanation is that the impact of a simultaneous 
stimulus on price
s and economic activity is large
r and triggers a relatively stronger 
monetary reaction than a stimulus in one 
large euro area country.
 When interest rates in the euro area do not respond to the fiscal shock, 
spillovers by origin and by destination are positive, and much larger than in th
e case of reactive monetary policy.
 Without a reaction by interest rates for two years, 
spillovers by origin vary between 0.07 for an increase in government consumption in 
Spain by 1% of GDP and 0.25 for a similar increase in German public investment (see 
the left
-hand panel in Chart 3). These spillovers are around six times as large as those 
with responsive interest rates. A similarly strong increase can be seen for 
investment

. Whe
n interest rates react, spillovers are generally positive but small, and 
higher for investment than for consumption. When comparing the model simulations 
with the empirical estimates of the destination spillovers, it
 should be taken into 
account that the empirical estimates are based on data covering different monetary 
policy regimes and without coordinated fiscal policies (except in the 2009
-10 period of 
the crisis). The relatively high empirical destination spillove
rs for Germany might 
partially reflect the fact that fiscal stimulus episodes in the other large euro area 
countries resulted less often in an increase in interest rates, on account of exchange 
rate pegs to the 
Deutsche Mark
 prior to EMU or their smaller w
eight in the euro area 
economy since the introduction of a common monetary policy.

 Sensitivity analysis
 Structural models are sensitive to the assumptions regarding the future 
evolution of monetary pol
icy.
 The simulations above are conducted under th
e assumptions of perfect foresight and complete financial markets. The implication of 
                                                                    60  The exercise i
s restricted to fiscal shocks and does not take into account other
 shocks
 that would have 
led to forward guidance, such as depressed private demand and credit
-constrained households and firms 
following an economic crisis. 
From a longer
-term perspective, a
n increase in public investment could 
generally 
be expected to contribute more to the productive capacity of the economy than government 
consumption

 Fiscal

lovers in a monetary union
  68 these assumptions is that the monetary authority, firms and households all know and 
are able to completely adjust to futu
re changes in the monetary and fiscal policy 
stances. Through these features, structural models are known to be very sensitive to 
the announcement of future interest rates, which is known in the theoretical literature 
as the ﬁforward guidance puzzleﬂ.
61 Spi
llovers are also affected by the forward guidance puzzle.
 The sensitivity to 
future interest rates does not only apply to the domestic effect of a fiscal stimulus but 
also to the spillover ratio 
Œ the ratio of the average
 percent
age change in GDP in
 the 
recipient country
 to the 
percent
age change in GDP 
in the stimulating country. An 
illustration for a public investment
-based stimulus in Germany shows that the spillover 
ratio increases more than proportionally when the announced path of future interest 
rates
 is extended by one year (see Chart 4). The effect becomes much smaller when 
the interest rate path is modelled as a series of one
-year announcements (bars 
labelled ﬁmyopicﬂ) or when households and firms in the model discount the future 
impact of the expec
ted real interest rate on current consumption and investment 
decisions (bars labelled ﬁdisc.ﬂ).
62 This sensitivity analysis suggests that the size of 
spillovers under an expected path of unchanged interest rates, as shown in Section 
3.2 and found in the lit
erature, should be taken as an upper bound.

 Fiscal
 spillovers in a monetary union
  69 4 Conclusions
 The article 
analyses
 the 
main transmission channels of the spillovers of 
national fiscal policies to other countries within a monetary union.
 Estimat
es 
based on a new dataset confirm the findings of earlier studies th
at fiscal action can 
have positive spillovers among the largest euro area countries. Expenditure measures 
in one of the four largest euro area countries have
 generally 
a positive but low
 spillover
 effect on output in the other countries. This effect can be
come larger if more countries 
simultaneously undertake fiscal action.
 The 
small size of fiscal spillovers supports the case for a central fiscal capacity.
 The re
action of 
interest rates
 is an important determinant for the magnitude of 
spillovers. 
An illust
ration using a Taylor rule shows that spillovers are small if interest 
rates react to the changes in inflation and output induced by fiscal policy, but the 
effects are amplified if interest rates are not expected to react to a fiscal shock. This 
reinforces
 the case for countries in a monetary union to pursue countercyclical fiscal 
policies in good times, building up fiscal buffers and a sound fiscal position that can be 
used to stabilise the economy in downturns. In addition, the fact that fiscal spillovers
 are generally small also suggests that a 
central fiscal capacity may 
be an important 
mechanism to enhance domestic fiscal policy effects
