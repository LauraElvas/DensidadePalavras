 ** Please 
note that
 these remarks relate to the ECB™s activities in 2019 and were 
finalised before the global coronavirus 
(COVID
-19) 
pandemic. The economic situation 
and the ECB™s policy actions have 
evolved substantially since that point. The ECB will 
do everything necessary within 
its
 mandate to help the euro area through this crisis. **
 2019 marked the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the euro, and support for the 
single currency 
among euro a
rea citizens 
reached an all
-time high of 76% in the 
November Eurobarometer poll.
 Euro area economic growth moderated further in 2019, to 1.
2% from 1.9% in the 
previous year. The continued expansion was supported by favourable financing 
conditions, further 
employment gains and the mildly expansionary fiscal stance, 
although global trade
-related uncertainty weighed most notably on manufacturing and 
investment.
 Euro area labour markets continued to improve in 2019. The unemployment rate 
declined further to 7.6
%, and wage growth re
mained robust, around
 its long
-run 
average.
 Headline inflation in the euro area stood at 1.2% on average in 2019, down from 1.8% 
in 2018. This decline reflected lower contributions from the two more volatile 
components, energy and food
. Excluding these two components, inflation averaged 
1.0% in 2019, the same as in the two previous years.
 Against that background, the 
ECB™s 
Governing Council undertook further monetary 
accommodation in 2019 over three successive rounds. This included a ne
w series of 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations, an extension of our forward guidance, a 
reduction in our deposit facility rate and 
the 
res
umption of 
our asset purchase 
programme. By the end of 2019 there were some initial signs of a stabilisation 
of 
growth dynamics and a mild increase in underlying inflation.
 As part of our policy assessment process, the Governing Council takes into 
consideration the impact of any potential side effects of our policy. In that vein, a 
two
-tier system for reserve rem
uneration was introduced, which exempts a fraction of 
banks™ excess cash reserves from the negative deposit facility rate, in order to 
safeguard the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy.
 Structurally low profitability remains a challenge for euro are
a banks, although the 
sector is adequately capitalised, with a 14.2% C
ommon 
Equity 
Tier 
1 ratio. During 
2019 strong risk
-taking in financial and real estate markets continued to fuel the 
build
-up of asset price vulnerabilities, while risks continued to inc
rease in the growing 
non-bank financial sector. Euro area countries, in consultation with the ECB, 
implemented a number of macroprudential measures to mitigate and build up 
resilience to systemic risks.
       
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  5 The Eurosystem continued its efforts to ensure the sm
ooth operation of payment 
systems. This included preparations 
for
 the 
replac
ement of 
TARGET2 with a new, 
state
-of-the
-art real
-time gross settlement system and the adoption of a new retail 
payments strategy. The strategy supports the development of a marke
t-led 
pan-European solution for point
-of-interaction payments, to complement the 
successful Single European Payments Area.
 Publication of a
 new overnight reference rate, 
the 
•STR
 (euro short
-term rate)
, began 
on 2 October, with the aim of replacing the current reference rate, EONIA, by January 
2022. The daily production of the •STR has worked well and the methodology has 
proved reliable.
 The ECB continues to study carefully the impact of climate change on the outlo
ok for 
price stability and the financial system. This includes understanding the carbon 
intensity of bank lending portfolios and developing an analytical framework for carrying 
out a pilot climate risk stress
-test analysis for the euro area banking sector.
 The ECB 
contributes to the efforts against climate change through its own investment decisions 
and environmental activities. We reduced carbon emissions and energy consumption 
per workplace by 74% and 54% respectively 
between 2008 and 
2018. 2019 brought a
 renewed focus on engaging with a broader audience than financial 
markets and experts, and on listening more attentively to people™s concerns. Initiatives 
included the #EUROat20 competition, a new ﬁECB explainsﬂ video series and a 
monthly podcast.

  8 1 Euro area e
conomic activity 
moderated 
amid muted 
inflation
ary pressures
 After peaking in mid
-2018, the global economy slo
wed down considerably in 2019 
amid a sharp rise in
 trade
-related uncertainty. The slowdown was broad
-based and 
synchronised across countries.
 In this context, e
uro area economic growth moderated 
further, to 1.
2% from 1.9% in the previous year. 
The growth moderation in 2019 was 
primarily driven by weaker i
nternational trade, in an environment of prolonged global 
uncertainty. At the same time, the 
slowdown was cushioned
 by favourable financing 
conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro 
area fiscal stance and the conti
nued Œ albeit slower 
Œ growth in global activity. Euro 
area labour markets improve
d further
, while productivity growth decelerated 
substantially. Inflationary pressures remained muted
 overall
. Headline inflation 
declined to 1.2%, driven by lower energy and
 food inflation, wh
ile underlying inflation 
remained subdued
. Favourable financing conditions continued to support credit and 
money growth. Euro area government bond yields declined significantly, whereas euro 
area equity prices increased 
mainly 
on account
 of lower discount rates. Household 
wealth was supported by increased valuations of real and financial assets.
 1.1
 The global economy slowed down considerably
 Over the course of 2019 
global economic growth
 declined
 sharply
. 
After 
peaking
 in 
mid
-2018, 
the 
global 
economy
 slowed down considerably and grew at a rate that was 
well below the historical average and the weakest since the global financi
al crisis (see
 Chart
 1).
 This global slowdown was broad
-based and
 synchro
nised across countries. 
In
 large advanced economies such as
 the United States
, the United Kingdom and 
Japan,
 this 
reflected
 a decrease from above average rates of growth
. In China,
 growth 
declined to the lowest rate since 1990 
and was around its currently estimated potential 
rate. Across other large emerging market economies, growth was generally lacklustre, 
partly reflecting a slow recovery from recent recessions.
 The global economy slowed 
down

e slowdown was broad

 The global economic s
lowdown was driven by a decline in manufacturing sector 
output and considerably weaker trade and investment growth. By contrast, services 
sector output growth moderated to a lesser extent, supported by relatively robust 
consumption growth and a continued i
mprovement in labour markets.
 Trade
-related uncertainty
 rose sharply and remained elevated, weakening the global 
economy
. Trade tensions between
 the United States and China escalated, as 
suggested by a range of different indicators.

bilateral trade. By the end of 2019 most US

 been subject to

 At the end of 2019 t
he outlook for
 global growth entailed a moderation of growth as the 
economic cycle 
mature
d in advanced economies
 and as 
China gradual
ly transition
ed to a lower growth path,
 while the recovery in 
other
 emerging market economies
 remained fragile. This outlook was uncertain and, on balance, the 
risks to global 
activity 
were on the downside.
2 To the extent that the 
weakness 
in the manufacturing 
sector 
spread 
to the services sector
, global activity 
could decelerate more quickly
. 
In
 China
, a sharper slowdown
 could have a larger effect on the global economy
, while 
an escalation of the trade dispute 
would exacerbate the negative 
impact on
 global trade
 flows
. In Europe,
 in particular, there was a risk 
that the United States 
might
 impo
se 
trade tariffs on some goods 
in several countries.
 In general, heightened geopolitical 
tensions could adversely affect global growth and trade. 
In a
ddition, despite 
the United 
Kingdom™s orderly withdrawal from the European Union
, there was uncertainty about 
the future EU
-UK relationship and the outcome of the negotiations 
remain
ed a downside risk. Moreover, a sharp repricing in global financial market
s could dent risk 
appetite globally and
 affect real economic activity.
                                                                     2  The outlook at the end of 2019 did not anticipate any impact or downside risk from the coronavirus

 In 2019 domestic demand continued to contribute positively to euro area growth
, 
amid
 favourable financing conditions
 and improving labour markets
. Private consumption
, alongside consumer sentiment, remained resilient in 2019 (see Box
 1). Household 
spending was supported by rising employment and wages, which resulted in growing 
aggregate labour income. 
Following the gradual slowdown starting in 2018, business 
investment remained moderate in 2019. 
A much 
less dynamic external environment
 and heightened
 global uncertainty
 weighed on firm
s™ investment decisions. In spite of 
this and the modest
 developments in 
corporate
 profitability and declining capacity 
utilisation, 
business 
investment continued to contribute positively to 
economic 
growth
, supported by
 favourable financing conditions
. Growth 
in investment 
in 
intellectual 
property products
, which tends to be volatile, was particularly strong
.4 At the same 
time, there was a slowdown in h
ousing investment
 after its strong and 
prolonged 
recovery
 of previous 
years
, alongside 
a moderati

momentum in euro area 
housing markets. This deceleration mainly reflected increasingly binding constraints 
on housing supply

  Consumption and household sentiment remained resilient
 In 2019 the services and retail sectors remained resilient overall as the euro area economy slowed,

  14 consumer confidence in the euro area, considering the reasons for the r
elative resilience of consumer 
spending. 
 Sentiment among consumers stabilised and held up better than in other sectors
 The economic slowdown in 2019 predominantly reflected weaker international trade alongside elevated 
levels of global uncertainty, which 
in turn mostly weighed on the euro area industrial sector. Meanwhile, 
the services and retail sectors remained resilient, despite some moderation. This is evident in Chart A, 
which displays sentiment in various sectors of the euro area economy. The Europea
n Commission™s 
Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) is a weighted average of confidence in industry excluding 
construction (with a weight of 40%), services (30%), construction (5%), the retail sector (5%) and 
households (20%). As can be seen, the slowdown in
 the more domestically oriented sectors (i.e. 
construction, services, retail and households) has been much less pronounced than in industry.

 Private consumption remained resilient overall in 2019
 Private consumption growth in 2019 was held up by continued growth in real disposable income, 
which in turn was supported by a resilient labour market. Labour income benefited bo
th from 
continued increases in wages and further
, although slowing
, 
employment gains. In addition, direct 
taxes, social contributions and transfers are overall likely to have had a small positive impact on 
income growth, in contrast with 2018 when they sti
ll dampened income growth (see Chart
 B).
 However, 
the contribution from the 
operating surplus and property income, which tend to be 
closely
 linked to economic activity, turned slightly negative in 2019, having been positive since 2015.

 Drivers of consumer confidence
 The Commission™s Consumer Confidence Index is the result of averaging four sub
-indices r
elating to 
perceptions of past financial and economic developments as well as expectations regarding future 
developments 12 months ahead (see Chart
 C).
5 While one sub
-index relates to the assessment of 
the overall economic situation in the country, the oth
ers deal with 
households™
 financial situation. 
Looking at the developments in these sub
-indices, it can be seen that households had a 
relatively 
more benign
 view of their personal situation
, 
mainly reflecting
 the ongoing resilience of the labour 
market, 
which has largely shielded household income from the economic slowdown.

largely explain why euro area 
consumer confidence remained elevated in 2019, supporting private consumption. In the context of

 The digital econo

 According to the literature, 
digitalisation is 
having an 
impact on a number of key 
economic variables which are relevant for monetary policy.
 The empirical evidence on 
the effects of digitalisation suggests that they may be pushing up activity and 
productivity, while its overall effect on inflation is not clear yet.
9 In 201
9 the degree of 
digitalisation of the EU economies ranged from around 40
 for the least digital to 
around 70 for the most digital economies, according to the European Commission
™s                                                                     6  For details on how these indicators are constructed, see ﬁ

 Structural policies should help to address key challenges
 The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be 
substantially stepped up to
 boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce 
structural unemployment and increase 
the 
resilience
 of the economy
. This includes 
structural policies to improve the functioning of labour market
s, increase competition 
in product 
and factor 
market
s and enhance
 the 
business environment.
10 Furthermore
, structural policies are needed to help address the current and future challenges 
posed, for example, by population ageing, digitalisation and climate change.
 The 
country
-specific recommendations (CSRs) provide policy recommendations 
tailored 
to an individual country 
on how to enhance economic growth and resilience
. The 
CSRs are 
endorsed by Member States in the European Council. In February 2019 the 
European Com
mission concluded that 
95% of 
the 
policy recommendations had either 
not been implemented or, at best, had been implemented to ﬁsomeﬂ extent

  19 A mildly expansionary fiscal stance 
provided
 some support to 
economic activity
 After having been 
broadly 
neutral 
for five years
, the
 euro area 
fiscal stance
12 turned 
expansionary, 
albeit 
mildly, in 2019 (see Chart 9). The loosening of the stance 
provided
 support to economic activity in the euro area. It reflected expansionary policy 
measures which were implemented in some large member countries,
 mostly 
cuts to 
direct taxes as well
 as public expenditure increases
. 
Based on the 
December 2019 
Eurosystem
 staf
f macroeconomic projections
, t
he euro area general government 
deficit ratio 
increased slightly 
in 201
9 to 
0.7% of GDP
. The decline in the budget 
balance reflected the more expansionary fiscal stance, which was partly offset by
 savings i
n interest payments,
 while 
the contribution from the cyclical position remained 
broadly unchanged
. Chart 
9 General government balance and fiscal stance
 (percentage of GDP)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 The 
aggregate general government debt
-to
-GDP ratio in the euro area 
continued to 
decline in 2019 and reached 
84.5
% of GDP 
at the end of the year. 
However, 
debt-to
-GDP ratios remained high in a number of countries. 
The reduction in the 
aggregate debt ratio was 
supported by 
favourable interest
 rate
-growth differentials 
and positive, but declining 
primary 
balances. While there were no euro area countries 
under the corrective arm of the 
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP
) at the end of 2019, the 
European Commission ass
essed 
that the 20

area countries
, many of which
 had debt ratios 
of close to or above 100% of GDP
,

al stance reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies to the economy,
 beyond the automatic reaction of public finances to the business cycle. It is measured as the change in
 the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net of gove
rnment support to the financial sector. For more

 Inflationary pressures remained muted
 Headline i
nflation in the euro area stood at 1.2% on average in 2019, down from 1.8% 
in 2018.
14 This decline essentially reflected lower contributions from the two more 
volatile inflation components, energy and food. HICP inflation excluding energy and 
food, one meas
ure of underlying inflation, remained at subdued rates, averaging 1.0% 
in 2019 as in 2018 and 2017, despite an increase
 towards the end of the year
 (see 
Chart
 10).
 Chart 
10 HICP inflation and contributions by components
 (annual percentage changes; 
percentage point contributions)
  Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Developments in energy inflation were largely responsible for the decline in average 
headline inflation in 2019 compared with 2018. The contribution of total food inflation 
to headline HICP inflation declined to 0.3 percentage points in 2019, from 0.4 
perc
entage points in 2018. Developments in total food inflation within the year were 
largely determined by those in the volatile unprocessed food component. Processed 
food inflation hovered around 1.9% in 2019, which was slightly below the 2018 
average. Increa
ses in producer prices for consumer food and in food commodity 
prices (as captured by 
EU farm
-gate price
s), two drivers of processed food prices, 
suggest that such cost increases were not fully passed through to food prices at the 
consumer level in a conte
xt of high competition.
                                                                     14  Average headline inflation in 2018 was revised up to 1.8% from 1.7% by Eurostat 
after the cut
-off date for 
data 
in the 
2018 
Annual Report
. The revision followed the implementation of m
ethodological changes
 to 
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)
 by Eurostat. These changes also implied an upward 
revision to the average services inflation rate in 2018, to 1.5% from 1.3%, and a downward revision to the 
average non
-energy industrial goods inflation ra
te in 2018, to 0.3% from 0.4%. These changes, however, 
had only a mild impact on average HICP inflation excluding energy and food in 2018, which remained 
unchanged at 1.0%
. In contrast to these rather muted effects
, the impact on monthly and annual inflati
on 
rates of the year 2015 was particularly strong. Average headline inflation for 2015 was revised upwards

inflation excluding energy and food. Non
-energy industrial goods inflation averaged 
0.3% in 2019, unchanged from 2018 and the average since 2015. Indicators of price 
pressures at different stages of the pricing chain show that the annual rate of cha
nge of producer prices for non
-food consumer goods remained broadly stable through the 
year, but was substantially higher than its average since 2015. This suggests that 
some of the cost increases have been absorbed at the retailer stage. In addition, 
unli
ke in 2018, the average annual rate of change of import prices for non
-food 
consumer goods was positive in 2019, reflecting, among other factors, the 
depreciation of the euro. Services inflation displayed some volatility linked to price 
developments in tra
vel
-related services 
that resulted from a statistical effect
.15 Looking through this monthly volatility, services inflation moved sideways and, on 
average, stood at 1.5% in 2019, unchanged from 2018 and only marginally higher than 
the average since 2015. Ov
erall, the increases in services prices, which mostly 
include a large labour cost content, continued to lag behind wage growth.

 and its interpretation of recent inflation developments
 Since 2013 HICP 
inflation 
excluding 
energy and food has consistently remained below its historical 
average. While this could initially be explained by large amounts of economic slack and other factors 
dampening inflationary pressures, the more recent weakness is difficult to account for with
in a 
standard Phillips curve framework, as visible from the unexplained component of the decomposition 
of inflation developments in Chart A. This has prompted renewed scrutiny of this fundamental 
economic relationship.

 Inflation determinants within the Phillips curve framework
 In essence, the Phillips curve captures the notion that economic activity and the associated degree of 
tightness in goods and 
labour markets should influence inflation. High levels of economic slack 
weighed on inflation in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
 The euro area also experienced a 
second recession between 2011 and 2013, and the weakness in underlying inflation
 starting in early 
2013 is well explained by this factor. However, even if by 2018 many measures of economic activity 
and slack had returned to average levels, and some measures even started to show signs of excess 
demand, underlying inflation has remained
 below its average since 1999 (1.3%).
 Besides economic activity, other factors, such as inflation expectations and external prices, are also 
crucial to understand inflation developments. 
Many factors can influence economic agents™ inflation 
expectations
: recent inflation developments (and in particular energy price movements) 
typically 
influence expectations at short horizons, while
 genuine concerns about the credibility 
and attainability 
of a ce
ntral bank™s inflation objective can weigh on longer
-term 
expectations
, although the
se factors
 are difficult to disentangle empirically
.17 Both market and survey
-based measures of inflation 
expectations weakened over the period 2014
-17, which is reflected in their negative contributions to 
underlying inflation ove
r the same period.
18 More recently, survey measures of longer
-term inflation 
expectations for the euro area, notably those from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters, have 
shown signs of a softening. However, the drag on inflation attributable to these
 recent developments 
is smaller.
 Finally, measures of external prices, such as oil and broader import price indices, can be an important 
factor explaining firms™ pricing decisions, and thus developments in inflation, over and above what 
                                                                    17  See

  23 might already be ca
ptured by slack and inflation expectations. While external prices, and especially 
energy prices, are typically quickly reflected in headline inflation, their indirect effects on underlying 
inflation appear to have been limited in recent years.
19 Overall, de
velopments in underlying inflation 
appear to be explained reasonably well by standard factors up to 2017, but the more recent 
weakness is difficult to account for within this framework.
 One possible explanation could be that standard measures of economic s
lack do not capture all 
developments in economic activity relevant for inflation. In that spirit, Jaroci
ski and Lenza (2018)
20 derive a measure of economic slack designed explicitly to forecast inflation. Such a measure would 
imply a much larger amount of 
economic slack than a more standard measure of the output gap. 
 Overall, the Phillips curve remains a central element for the interpretation and communication of 
inflation developments, but it needs to be complemented with information from other tools and 
approaches, especially in the light of recent developments in underlying inflation.
  Domestic cost pressures, as measured by the growth in the GDP deflator, increased 
on average in 2019, at a rate above the average level of 2018 and the average since 
2015 (see Chart 11). The annual growth in compensation per employee maintained its 
robust pace in 2019, standing at 2.0% on average, slightly below the 2018 average, 
but above its average since 2015. Compensation per employee growth was tempered 
by developments
 in social security contributions,
21 while growth in wages and salaries 
increased in 2019 compared with 2018, in line with the further reduction in the 
unemployment rate and despite the moderation in economic growth in the euro area 
(see Section 1.2 above).
 The robust average growth in compensation per employee 
implied, however, an increase in unit labour cost growth as productivity stagnated in 
2019. In addition to the higher unit labour cost growth, the increase in the GDP deflator 
growth also reflected a 
rebound in profit developments (measured in terms of the 
gross operating surplus), which had weakened noticeably in the course of 2018. Given 
that productivity moved sideways in 2019, the profit rebound in 2019 most likely 
reflected improvements in the ter
ms of trade and developments in economic sectors 
that were less affected by the global activity and trade slowdown.
22 These were for 
instance the construction and real estate sectors, which also displayed a high rate of 
growth in their value added deflators
, going up to 4.6% on average in 2019
 in the case 
of construction.
                                                                     19  External influences might, of course, not be limited to what is captured by import and energy prices. For a

 Longer-term inflation expectations declined in t
he course of 2019. Expectations for 
inflation five years ahead from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters eased to 
1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Market
-based measures of longer
-term inflation expectations,
 such as the five
-year 
inflation
-linked swap rate five years ahead, also declined. However, they stabilised 
Œ albeit at still low levels 
Œ towards the end of the year.
 1.4
 Favourable financing conditions continued to support 
credit and money growth
 In 2019 euro area financial markets were 
driven primarily
 by 
the effects of slowing 
economic activity 
amid 
persistently low inflation
, uncertainty related to political factors 
induc
ing 
risk
-off sentiment
 in some periods
 of the year, and further monetary policy 
easing.
 Both money market rates and longer
-term bond yields declined significantly
, while equity prices increased overall, supported by lower discount rates. The 
external 
financing 
flows of non
-financial corporatio
ns (NFCs) broadly stabilised in 2019 at a 
level significantly below their latest peak in 2017, but borrowing from banks and the 
issuance of debt securities remained solid, supported by f
avourable financing 
conditions
, and 
net issuance of unlisted shares
 was robust, underpinned by an 
increased number of mergers and acquisitions. The ongoing expansion of 
bank credit 
to
 the private sector
, coupled with the 
low opportunity costs of holding M3
, helped to 
sustain the growth rates of 
broad money.
 Favourable financ
ing conditions reflected the 
ECB™s accommodative monetary policy stance and the capacity of the banking system 
to pass this accommodation on to the lending rates faced by firms and households. 
Increasing valuations of 
financial
 asset
 and real estate holdin
gs supported household 
wealth, which in turn underpinned private consumption growth.

  ECB Annual Report 2019
  25 Euro area government bond yields declined significantly in 2019
, 
with l
ong-term yields 
reac
hing negative levels during the 
summer
. This decline reflected
 grow
ing concerns 
about the extent and duration of the slowdown in euro area economic activity 
and its 
impact on 
inflation developments. 
Monetary policy 
accommodation 
in the 
United 
States
, heightened global risk sentiment connected to
 the US
-China 
trade 
tensions 
and Brexit
, and growing expectations in financial markets about a further easing of 
monetary policy
 by the ECB also 
contributed to 
lower risk
-free rates 
in the euro ar
ea. 
After 
the ECB
™s monetary 
policy 
easing 
package 
was announced in September, 
somewhat more positive euro area macroeconomic data releases 
and some 
stabilisation in global risk sentiment 
contributed
 to a gradual recovery of euro a
rea 
government bond yields. 
This notwithstanding, th
e euro area GDP
-weighted average 
of ten
-year sovereign bond yields stood at
 0.28% on 
31 December
 2019, which 
was
 74 basis points lower than 
its level on 1
 January 2019
. The spread of euro area 
countries™ 
ten
-year sovereign bond yields against the German ten
-year Bund yield 
declined, significantly 
so 
for some 
countries
, 
owing
 to lower fiscal policy uncertainty
.

This said, the growth of borrowing from banks 
and the issuance of debt securities remained solid, supported by f
avourab
le financing 
conditions
, and net issuance of unlisted shares
 was robust, underpinned
 by 
an increase in the number of
 mergers and acquisitions
. By contrast,
 there was
 moderation in the other sources of financing (including inter
-company loans and trade 
cred
it)
 and a decline in
 the net issuance of listed shares
 (w
hich reflect
ed the elevated 
cost of equity compared with other 
sources of funding)
. 
Bank lending rates
 declined 
further 
Œ broadly in line with the evolution of market rates 
Œ to new historical lows 
during 2019. 
 Further monetary 
policy 
easing
 by the ECB during 2019
 was transmitted to financing 
conditions, which became more favourable. This was partly due to the fact that some 
of the measures introduced in 2019 
Œ such as the third series of targeted lo
nger-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO
 III) and the two
-tier system for reserve remuneration 
Œ were geared towards supporting bank intermediation capacity (see Section
 2.1). At 
the same time, the banking system made further progress in balance sheet repai
r, in 
terms of boosting capital positions and improving asset quality

 Households
™ net wealth increased strongly in the first three quarters of 2019, 
thereby
 underpinning private consumption. 
Despite a moderating momentum in housing 
markets, net wealth benefited from
 further
 house price increases
, which 
result
ed in 
significant valuation
 gains on households™ real estate holdings. In addition, households 
also registered notable
 valuation gains on their financial asset holdings. 
Furthermore, 
rising house prices and favourable financing conditions contributed to the continued 
gradual upward 
trend in 
the 
annual growth rate of
 bank loans to households for house
 purchase
. 
Household gross indebtedness 
Œ measured as a percentage of household 
nominal gross disposable income 
Œ remained at levels

 Overall, bank lending to the private sector was solid, with its 
annual growth rate 
(adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling) increas
ing
 to 
3.7% in 
December 2019, from 
3.4% in December 2018
. C
redit growth
 remained 
the
 largest
 driver of broad money growth (see the blue parts of the bars in Chart

time, 
external monetary flows made a
n increasing 
contribution to 
M3 dynamics
 (see 
the yellow parts of the bars in Chart
 16). Annual M3 growth
 thus
 recovered in 
2019 (see Chart
 15). 
While t
he termination of 
net purchases under the 
asset purchase 
programme at the end of 2018 had a dampening impact on M3 growth
 (see the red 
parts of the bars in Chart

 only had a limited 
influence on

  29 2 Monetary policy: 
determination to act as 
appropriate
 Against the background of 
a weakening of 
the euro area economy, 
more 
persistent 
downside risks and an inflation outlook that continued to fall short o
f 
the
 medium
-term 
inflation aim
 of the Governing Council of the ECB, the Governing Council provided 
three successive rounds of additional monetary accommodation over the course of 
2019. 
These successive interventions underlined the Governing Council™s 
determination to act as appropriate
 to support the return of inflation to a sustained 
convergence path towards 
its 
medium
-term aim.
 In view of the
 time 
needed for all of 
the measures to exert their full impact
 on the euro area economy, t
he Governing 
Counci
l continued to closely monitor
 inflation developments and the pass
-through of 
the unfolding monetary policy measure
s, while it remained 
ready to adjust all of its 
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moved towards its aim in a 
sustained ma
nner, in line with its commitment to symmetry
. At the end of 201
9 monetar
y policy
-related assets accounted for 70
% of the 
total assets on the 
Eurosystem™s balance sheet. The size of the balance sheet 
stabilised at 
•4.7 trillion
 in 
2019, in line with the le
vel reached at the end of the previous year
. Risks related to the 
large balance sheet continued to be mitigated by the ECB
™s risk management 
framework.
 2.1
 A first round 
of monetary policy measures 
to 
keep
 policy 
accommodation ample
 amid rising external headwi
nds
 Following the deterioration in the economic outlook 
at the end of 2018, incoming 
information in early 2019 continued to be weaker than expected owing to softer 
external demand and some country and sector
-specific factors
, pointing to less 
buoyant near
-term growth momentum than previously anticipated
. 
At the same time, 
there was considerable uncertainty as to whether the factors slowing down euro area 
growth would be transitory or longer lasting, and hence 
to what extent slower growth in 
the short
 term w
ould affect the medium
-term growth outlook.
 Against this background, 
the Governing Council recognised that the risks surrounding 
the euro area growth 
outlook 
had moved to the downside
 on account of the persistence of uncertainties 
related to geopolitical f
actors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in 
emerging markets and financial market volatility. 
The Governing Council highlighted 
that monetary policy needed to remain 
patient
, prudent and persistent. While
 supportive financing conditions, fav
ourable labour market dynamics and rising wage 
growth 
would 
continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising 
inflation
ary
 pressures
, the Governing Council
 reiterated the need for significant 
monetary policy stimulus to ensure a continued s
ustained convergence of inflation to 
levels below, but clo
se to, 2% over the medium term.
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  30 Incoming economic data during the spring continued to be weak, 
point
ing
 to a sizeable 
moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into 
2019. In 
particular, a
ctivity in the manufacturing sector had decelerated markedly, mainly on 
acco
unt of external headwinds, as global growth and trade dynamics remained weak.
 The more sluggish
 economic momentum was slowing the adjustment of inflation 
towards the Gover
ning Council™s medium
-term aim.
 In response to a material downgrade of the growth and
 inflation outlook, t
he Governing 
Council therefore decided 
at its March meeting on a package of policy measures to 
provide 
additional monetary accommodation
. This would 
support the further build
-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation develo
pments over the medium 
term
 and increase the resilience of the euro area economy in an environment of global 
uncertainties. In particular, the Governing Council decided on the following measures. 
First, it decided to
 shift out the calendar
-based leg of its
 forward guidance on policy 
rates. 
More s
pecifically, the Governing Council expected to keep the key ECB interest 
rates at 
their 
present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as 
long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained con
vergence of inflation to levels 
in line with its medium
-term aim. 
Second, it 
reiterate
d the 
intention to continue 
reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under 
the asset purchase programme 
(APP) 
for an extended perio
d of time past the date 
when 
it start
ed raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as 
necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation.
 Given the link between the forward guidance on p
olicy 
rates and reinvestments, the 
expected 
reinvestment horizon 
was 
automatically shifted 
out, reinforcing the guidance on policy rates while underlining the Governing Council™s 
determination to act as appropriate.
 Third, i
n addition to the change in poli
cy rate 
guidance, a 
new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term refinancing operations 
(TLTRO
 III) was announced
. These operations would 
start in September 2019 and 
end in March 2021, 
and each 
operation would have 
a maturity of two years
. The new 
series o
f TLTROs aimed to preserve favourable bank lending conditions to keep bank 
credit flowing to customers on affordable terms. In turn, a healthy credit flow to the 
private sector underpin
ned the 
consumption and investment plans of households and 
businesses, 
helping the economy to grow and supporting the adjustment of inflation 
towards the Governing Council™s medium
-term aim.
 Fourth, the Governing Council 
decided to continue to conduct the Eurosystem™s lending operations

 Following the announcement of the new series of TLTROs, at its next monetary policy 
meeting, the Governing Council communicated that
 the precise terms 
of the TLTRO
 III 
series
 would
 be announced 
at one of 
the
 forthcoming meetings. In particular, the 
pricing of the TLTRO
 III operations 
would
 take into account a thorough assessment of 
the bank
-based transmission channel of monetary policy
, as well as further 
developments in the economic outlook. 
In addition, t
he Governing Council, bearing in 
mind that the negative interest rate environment would prevail for longer than 
previously anticipated, noted that in the context of its regular assess
ment, it would 
consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest

the 
mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, 
on bank intermediation.
 A second round of additional monetary 
policy accommodation
 and 
deteriorating conf
idence in the inflation outlook
 By mid
-year, the incoming 
information indicated that global headwin
ds, relating in 
particular to the 
ongoing weakness in global trade and more pervasive and prolonged 
uncertainties in the external environment
, 
continued to weigh on the euro area 
outlook
. These factors were
 weighing in particular on the euro area manufactu
ring 
sector.
 Furthermore, 
HICP inflation decreased
 further
, mainly on account of temporary 
factors
, and m
easures of underlying inflation continued to move sideways
. In the light of the prolongation of uncertainties and their implications for the inflation 
outlook, the Governing Council recognised the need to adjust the monetary policy 
stance for the second time in 2019 and provide 
additional monetary accommodation 
for inflation to remain on a sustained path toward
s its medium
-term aim
. Therefore, 
the 
Govern
ing Council 
decided at its June meeting to 
strengthen its forward guidance on 
policy rates by shifting out 
further 
the calendar
-based 
element of the forward 
guidance
. More specifically, the 
Governing 
Council stated that it expected the key ECB 
interest rat
es to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and 
in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to its medium
-term aim.
 In addition, it reiterated
 its
 forward guidance on 
rei
nvestment
s. Finally, the Governing Council also decided on 
the pricing of the 
TLTRO
 III series. 
The interest rate in each operation 
would be
 set at a level that 
was 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem™s main refinancing 
operati
ons. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeded a benchmark, the rate 
applied in TLTRO
 III would be lower, and could be as low as the average interest rate 
on the deposit facility plus 10
 basis points.
 It was noted that this pricing struck
 a reasonable 
balance between acknowledging the sound developments in bank 
lending
, on the one hand, 
and the importance of preserving the accommodative 
stance
, on the other hand
. Over the course of the summer, softening global growth dynamics and weak 
international trad
e continued to weigh on the euro area outlook. In addition, the 
prolonged presence of uncertainties continued to dampen business sentiment, 
especially in the manufacturing sector. Price developments, in turn,
 remained muted
, while measures of underlying in
flation 
continued to 
move sideways. Market
-based 
measures of longer
-term inflation expectations had stagnated at the historic
al lows 
reached after the June meeting, while surveys signalled a marked fa
ll in longer
-term 
expectations.
 Against this background, the Governing Council, a
t its July meeting, noted that 
inflation rates 
(both realised and projected
) had been pers
istently below levels that 
were
 in line with its aim.
 Moreover, the Governing Council viewed the 
symmetry of 
its
 medium
-term inflation aim
 as an important element to bolster the achievement of a 
sustained adjustment in inflation to its aim.
 It was hence 
seen as important for the

 The Governing Council

inflation rates

were

  ECB Annual Report 2019
  32 Governing Council to demonstrate its determination and capacity to act and to be 
prepared to ease the policy stance further by adjusting all of its instruments, as 
appropriate, to achieve its inflation aim.
 At the same time
, the Gov
erning Council 
stated that if the medium
-term inflation outlook continue
d to fall short of its aim, it was 
determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim.
 Hence, 
in this context, the Governing Council 
decided to
 reintroduce
 a so-called easing bias in 
its forward guidance on policy rates by stating that it expected to keep the key ECB 
interest rates at present or lower levels. In addition,
 it tasked
 the relevant Eurosystem 
Committees with examining options, including ways to 
reinforce 
the 
forward guidance 
on policy rates, mitigating measures 
(e.g. 
the design of a tiered system for reserve 
remuneration
) and possibilities
 for the size and composition of potential new net asset 
purchases.
 These announcements paved the way for the
 potential implementation of 
a comprehensive policy package at the Governing Council™s next monetary policy 
meeting if the inflation outlook failed to improve in line with its aim.
 A third round of policy accommodation with a comprehensive 
package of 
measures in response to persistently low inflation rates
 The September 
2019 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections showed a further 
downgrade of the inflation outlook. Overall, the Governing Council was confronted 
with a protracted slowdown in the euro area e
conomy, persistent downside risks and 
an inflation outlook that continued to fall short of its medium
-term inflation aim. In 
particular, successive and significant downward revisions to the inflation outlook had 
brought projected inflation in 2021 down fro
m 1.8% in the December 2018 projections 
to 1.5% in the September 2019 projections. The further downgrade of the inflation 
outlook 
Œ despite the fact that the financial conditions embedded in the 
projections
 already reflected substantial expectations 
of additional policy easing 
Œ meant that 
inflation was 
projected to 
mov
e further away from levels that the Governing Council 
considered
 to be
 consistent with its inflation aim.
 Measures of underlying inflation 
remained muted
 and indicators of inflation 
expectati
ons remained at low levels
. 
Against this background, 
the Governing Council agreed that a
 third round of
 easing of 
the monetary policy stance was warranted to support the return 
of inflation 
to
 a sustained convergence 
path towards 
its inflation aim. 
The Gov
erning Council 
therefore 
took the following decisions in September:
 First, it 
decided to 
reduce the deposit 
facility rate, by 10 basis points, to 
-0.50% (
see 
Chart
 17). The reduction in the deposit facility rate was accompanied by a 
reformulation of the Governing Council™s forward guidance on the expected path of 
policy rates. It now expected that the key ECB in
terest rates 
would 
remain at their 
present or lower levels until 
the
 inflation 
outlook was
 seen to 
robustly
 converge to a 
level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within the projection horizon, and such 
convergence 
has been
 consistently reflected in
 underlying inflation dynamics.
 A comprehensive policy response 
was deemed necessary to support 
the return of inflation to a sustained 
convergence path towards the 
medium
-term aim

 (see Chart 18
) with the expectation to terminate net

would
 continue to reinvest

 the princ
ipal payments from maturing securities
 purchased under the APP
 for an 
extended period of time past the date when it start

 Furthermore, ad

sequence, 
monthly net purchases are not exactly equal to the monthly target for net asset 
purchases.
 The latest observations are for 
31 December

interest rate for participating banks (banks outperforming a minimum lending 
benchmark 
could 
now borrow at 
a rat
e that 
could
 be as low as the average intere
st 
rate on the deposit facility 
prevailing over the life of the operation
) and a longer 
maturity (
three
 years instead of 
two
 years). 
The more favourable TLTRO conditions 
sought 
to preserve favourable bank lending
 conditions, ensure the smooth 
transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of 
monetary policy
. Finally, 
to safeguard the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy
, a two
-tier 
system for reserve remuneration was introduced 
which
 exempt
s a fraction of banks™ 
excess cash reserves from the 
negative deposit facility rate.
 All elements of t
he package of measures decided 
upon at the Governing Council™s 
September monetary policy meeting
 were designed to complement each other in 
pro
viding monetary stimulus and support the convergence of inflation towards the 
Governing Council™s aim. 
The reduction in the deposit facility rate and the 
strengthened state
-contingent forward guidance 
served to 
anchor short to 
medium
-term interest rates
, which are important for pricing loans to firms in the euro 
area. The renewed net asset purchases and the 
expected 
reinvestment horizon 
anchored medium to longer
-term interest rates
, which are important for pricing 
mortgage loans to households. TLTRO
 III 
was
 recalibrat
ed to 
preserve favourable 
bank lending conditions
, ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy and 
incentivise banks to keep credit flowing to their customers. 
Finally, t
he two
-tier system 
for reserve remuneration 
was designed to 
alleviate the direct cost of negative 
interest 
rates for banks 
in order 
to support the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy.

 Monitoring inflation developments
 in the light of a tentative 
stabilisation in the growth outlook,
 while standing
 ready to act
 By year
-end, following three rounds of monetary policy easing over the course of 
2019, measures of underlying inflation
 remained generally subdued and euro area 
growth dynamics continued to be weak
, although there 
were
 some initial signs of 
stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in 
line with previous 
projections
. In 
the 
light of
 these developments and 
given
 that it 
took
 time for all 
of the 
measures
 to exert their full impact, the Governing Council announced 
at its December meeting that it 
was
 closely monitoring inflation developments and the
 pass
-through of 
the unfolding monetary
 policy measures 
taken in September to 
the 
economy. In any case, it underlined that it continue
d to stand ready to adjust all of its 
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation move
d towards its aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with its commitm
ent to symmetry.
 In the light of the persistent uncertainties and downside risks, substantial additional 
monetary policy accommodation was implemented over the course of 2019. 
All 
elements of the measures 
taken 
continued to work together and contributed to
 a further decline in bank funding costs (see Chart
 19). Banks™ very favourable financing 
conditions were passed on to the wider economy, with borrowing conditions for firms 
and households standing at 
Œ or close to 
Œ their historical lows (see Chart
 20).
 All decisions taken over the course of 2019 contributed to t
he ample degree of monetary 
policy accommodation introduced since 2014
 and continued to support
 the 
improvement in the economi
c performance of the euro area.

over time. The
 non-standard 
measures have included 
refinancing 
operations to 
provide funding to counterparties with an initial maturity of up to four years, as well as 
purchases
 of 
asset
s issued by private and public entities (under the APP)
. 
In 
December 2018 the Eurosystem
 ended net asset purchases under the APP and, in 
2019, it fully 
reinvest
ed the principal payments from maturing securities
. As of 
1 November 2019 the Eurosystem restarted net asset purchases at an average 
monthly pace of 
•20 billion. At the end of 2019 t
he size of the 
Eurosystem
™s balance 
sheet 
stood at 
•4.7 trillion
, unchanged from the level at 
the end of 201
8. At the end of 201
9 monetary policy
-related assets 
amounted
 to 
•3.3 
trillion
, accounting for 
70% of the total assets on the Eurosystem™s balance she
et 
(down
 from 
72% at the end of 201
8). These 
monetary policy
-related assets 
include loans to euro 
area credit institutions, which accounted for 1
3% of total assets (
down
 from 1
6% at the 
end of 201
8), and 
assets
 purchased for monetary policy purposes, which
 represented 
around 5
6% of total assets (
unchanged from 
the end of 201
8) (see Chart 21)
. Other 
financial assets
 on the balance sheet
 mainly 
consisted
 of foreign currency and gold 
held by the Eurosystem
 and euro
-denominated non
-monetary policy portfolios
. On the liabilities side, 
the overall amount of 
counterparties™ reserve holdings
 and recourse to the deposit facility
 remained broadly unchanged at
 •2 trillion and 
represented 
39% of the liabilities side at the end of 201
9, 
unchanged 
from the end of 
2018. After the announcement of the two
-tier system for reserve remuneration, 
effective from 30 October 2019, counterparties™ cash holdings with the Eurosystem 
significantly shifted towards reserve holdings at the expense of recourse to the deposit 
facility. At th
e end of 2019 the latter represented 15% of counterparties™ overall cash 
holdings with the Eurosystem, down from 34% at the end of 2018.
 Banknotes in 
circulation grew in line with the historical growth trend
 and accounted for 28
% of 
liabilities at the end of 2019, up from 26% at 
the end of 201

capital and revaluation accounts, accounted for 3
4%, unchanged from the end of 2018

 The APP
 comprises
 four active asset purchase programmes
: the

purchase prog
ramme 
(CBPP3
), the asset
-backed securities purchase programme
 (ABSPP), 
the public sector purchase programme (
PSPP) and the corporate sector 
purchase programme (
CSPP). Following the Governing Council decisions, the 
monthly net purchase targets for the APP h
ave changed over time
. At the end of 2019 APP holdings amounted to •2.6 trillion (a
t amortised cost
). T
he ABSPP 
accounted for
 1% (•28 billion
), the CBPP3 for 1
0% (•264 billion
) and the
 CSPP 
for 
7% (•185 billion
) of total APP
 holdings at the year
-end. Out of the private 
sector purchase programmes, the CSPP contributed the most to the
 growth
 in 
APP holdings
 in 
the last two months of 2019
, with •
7.7 
billion of net purchases. CSPP 
purchases are made base
d on a benchmark which reflects 
the market capitalisation of
 all eligible outstanding 
bonds. The PSPP account
ed for the 
bulk 
of the APP
 holdings
, amounting to •
2.1 
trillion or 
82% of total APP holdings
 at th
e end of 2019
, 
the same proportion as 
at the end of

was
 guided by the

 Financial risks associated with the APP are mitigated 
through appropriate 
frameworks
 The main objective of the renewed net asset purchases under the APP is 
to support 
the 
robust convergence of inflation 
towards the Governing Council™s medium
-term 
aim
. At the same time, 
asset purchases should be
 both necessary
 and proportionate 
to 
fulfil 
the ECB™s
 mandate and achieve 
its price stability 
objective
. 
When there are 
several options to fulfil the policy objectives, the option selected should be efficient 
both from an operational as well as from a risk perspective. In that context, the 
Eurosystem™s risk management function endeavours to attain risk efficiency: achieving 
the policy objectives with the lowest amount of risk for the Eurosystem

 aims for a market

 The
 APP risk control 
frameworks apply to the purchase of additional assets, the 
reinvestment of principal payments from maturing APP holdings, and APP holdings for 
as long as they remain on the Eurosystem™s balance sheet.
 The risk control frameworks not only serve the purpose of mitigating financial risks, 
but 
also contribute to a successful achievement of the policy objectives by steering asset 
purchases towards a diversified market
-neutral asset allocation. 
In 
addition, the 
design of the risk control frameworks also takes into consideration non
-financial risks 
such as legal, operational and reputational risks.
 In the following, the 
current financial 
risk 
control
 frameworks governing the 
implementation of the APP
 are described

 frameworks
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  41 Eligibility requirements for outright asset purchases
 Only marketable assets which are accepted as collateral for Eurosystem credit 
operations are potentially eligible for outright asset purchases
. The collateral eligibility 
criteria for Eurosystem credit operations are stated in the 
general framework
 for 
monetary policy instruments. 
Among other things, eligible a
ssets are required to meet
 high credit quality standards by 
having at least one credit rating
29 provided by an 
external credit assessment
 institution (ECAI) accepted within the 
Eurosystem credit 
assessment framework
 (ECAF)
 qualifying as
 credit quality step
 3 (CQS
 3) of the 
Eurosystem™s harmonised rating scale
 or higher (CQS 1 and CQS 2)
. Furthermore, 
assets must be euro
-denominated and issued and settled in the
 euro area. In the
 case 
of asset
-backed securities (ABSs), the debtors underlying the
 respective claims must 
be predominantly located in the euro area.
 In addition to the eligibility criteria above, specific eligibility criteria apply depending on
 the 
purchase 
programme. Fo
r instance, for the PSPP and the CSPP, there are 
minimum 
and maximum maturity restrictions in place. For the CSPP, assets issued by 
credit
 institutions, or by issuers for which the parent undertaking is a credit institution, 
are 
not eligible for purchase. 
Moreover, for the CSPP and the CBPP3, assets issued 
by wind
-down entities and asset management 
vehicles
 are excluded from purchases.
 In the CBPP3, the assets must fulfil the necessary conditions for their acceptance as
 own
-use collateral
 for Eurosystem cre
dit operations
, i.e.
 they can be used as collateral 
by the issuing credit 
institution.
30 Furthermore, conditional pass
-through covered 
bonds 
ceased to be 
eligible for purchase
 from
 1 January 2019. 
In addition
, asset 
purchases must not circumvent the rules
 prohibiting the monetary financing of public 
authorities as set out in Article
 123(1) of
 the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union.
 Credit risk assessments and due diligence procedures
 For the private sector purchase programmes, the Eurosystem conducts appropriate
 credit risk assessments and due diligence procedures on the purchasable universe on
 an ongoing basis. Monitoring frameworks are maintained using 
certain risk indicators.
 These assessments and procedures follow the principle of proportionality, where
 riskier assets are subject to more in
-depth analysis. If warranted, additional risk
 management measures may apply, also subject to the principle of pro
portionality
. 
These include in particular limitations on or the suspension of purchases and, in 
extraordinary cases, even sales of assets, which require a case
-by-case assessment 
by the Governing Council.
                                                                     29  ABSs are required to have at least
 two credit ratings by an ECAI.
 30  See Article 138, paragraph 3(b), of Guideline (EU) 2015/510 of the European Central Bank of
 19
 December 2014 on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (
ECB/2014/60
) (OJ L 91, 2.4.2015, p.
 3).
 Eligibility criteria apply to all asset 
classes

  ECB Annual Report 2019
  42 Pricing frameworks
 The pricing frameworks for the APP ensure that purchases are made at market prices
 in order to minimise market distortions and facilitate the achievement of risk efficiency.
 These frameworks take into account availabl
e market prices, the quality of such prices
 and fair values. Ex post price checks are also conducted in order to assess 
whether
 the
 transaction prices reflected market prices at the time
 of the transactions.
 Purchases of eligible debt instruments with a ne
gative yield to maturity are permissible
 in all asset purchase programmes including, 
to the extent necessary
, those with a yield 
below the deposit facility rate.
31 Benchmarks
 Benchmarks are used to ensure the bu
ild-up of a diversified portfolio and contribute to
 mitigating risks. The benchmarks for the private sector purchase programmes are
 guided by
 the market capitalisation of the purchasable universe, i.e.
 the nominal
 outstanding amounts of the eligible assets
 satisfying risk considerations. In the case of
 the PSPP, the ECB™s capital key guides 
the allocation of purchases per jurisdiction 
on a stock basis
. Limits
 Limit frameworks are in p
lace for the APP. The calibration of issue and issuer limits
32 takes into account policy, operational, legal and risk management considerations. The
 limits are fine
-tuned according to the asset class, with a distinction being made
 between public sector asse
ts and private sector assets.
 PSPP issue and issuer limits are applied to safeguard market functioning and price
 formation, to limit risk concentration and to ensure that the Eurosystem does not
 become a dominant creditor of euro area governments. The issu
e limit for 
PSPP-eligible supranational bonds is 50% 
of the outstanding amount of the 
asset 
issue
d. For all other PSPP
-eligible bonds, the issue limit 
is set at 33%
 of the 
outstanding amount of the issue, 
subject to a case
-by-case
 verification
 that it would 
not lead to the Eurosystem having a blocking minority for the purpose of collective 
action clauses
. 
Otherwise, the issue limit is 25%. The 
issuer limit 
for supranational 
issuers 
is set at 
50% of the outstanding amount of eligible assets issue
d by the
 respective institution
; for other eligible issuers, it is 33%
. For the private sector purchase programmes, the issue limit is 70%. In the CSPP, 
lower issue limits apply in specific cases, for example for assets
 issued by public 
                                                                    31  On 12 September 2019 the Governing Council decided 
to extend the possibility of buying assets with 
yields below the interest rate on t
he deposit facility, to the extent necessary, under all parts of its
 APP. For 
further details, see

 are dealt with in a manner consistent with the
 treatment under the 
PSPP. In addition to these issue limits, issuer limits are applied for
 the CBPP3 and the 
CSPP. 
For the CSPP, the issuer limits are defined
 based on a benchmark allocation 
related to an iss
uer group™s market capitalisation in
 order to ensure a diversified 
allocation of purchases. Moreover, lower limits may apply
 if warranted based on the 
outcome of the credit risk assessment and due diligence
 procedures, as explained 
above.

 area
 financi
al sector: increasing 
bank resilience amid risks
 The risk environment confronting the 
euro area
 financial 
sector remained challenging 
during
 2019. On the one hand, several factors support
ed financial stability
, includ
ing
 a growing economy and 
the sound cap
italisation of euro area 
banks. On the other hand, 
increasing downside risks to
 future
 growth weigh
ed on the financial stability 
environment. 
Strong risk
-taking in financial 
and real estate 
markets continue
d to fuel 
the build
-up of asset price vulnerabilit
ies
, while risks continued to increase in the 
growing non
-bank financial sector
. In this environment, euro area countries, in 
consultation with the ECB
, implemented a number of macroprudential measures to 
mitigate and build up resilience to systemic risks.
 In addition, ECB Banking 
Supervision took microprudential actions and contributed to a stable European 
banking sector. In 2019 the ECB also continued to contribute to the discussions on 
completing the banking union and advancing the capital markets union,
 and highlighted the importance of developing tools to mitigate risks in the non
-bank 
financial sector.
 3.1
 The financial stability environment in 2019
 The financial stability environment remained challenging 
during 2019
. The global 
economic outlook 
deteriorate
d during the year 
and elevated political and policy 
uncertainty pos
ed large downside risks. In this 
setting
, markets 
were
 increasingly 
driven by expectations of further monetary policy easing and 
by 
a flight to safety. This 
led to significantly 
lower yields on higher
-rated sovereign and corporate bonds. The 
environment characterised by 
low
 (or negative)
 interest rate
s and low yields on 
safe
 assets challenge
d financial institutions™ profitability. In response, investment funds and 
insurers 
took 
on greater risks. The deteriorating growth outlook and the associated 
expected ﬁlower
-for
-longerﬂ interest rate environment weakened bank profitability 
prospects further
. Banks were however supported by abating f
unding challenges amid 
lower funding costs and
 improved bond market access
 and they remained adequately 
capitalised, with a 14.2% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.
 Four key financial stability
 vulnerabilities 
for 
the 
euro area 
over a two
-year horizon 
were identified by the ECB during 2019 and discussed in the ECB™s semi
-annual 
Financial Stability Review
 (see Figure 1):

 Note: Financial stability assessment as at 20 November 2019. 
  First, 
asset price vulnerabilities remained prominent during 2019, with the ECB 
highlighting the 
risk of a disruptive repricing in global financial 
markets
. The 
search for yield intensified 
during 2019
, with 
stock prices in the euro area 
increasing some 20% despite lower corporate profits and the deteriorating 
macroeconomic environment, and 
less than 10% of the bonds outstanding 
globally offering 
yields of 3% or more
. A
brupt corrections in equity and 
lower
-rated fixed income markets 
therefore 
remain
ed a risk, especially in the face 
of high economic and political uncertainty.
 Buttressed by the low interest rate 
environment, euro area 
property prices
 continued 
to rise in 2019
. The warnings 
and recommendations 
issued by the European Systemic Risk Board 
with regard 
to residential real estate vulnerabilities 
indeed 
suggest
ed that continued strong 
price dynamics, coupled with relatively buoyant mortgage l
ending growth and 
high household indebtedness, represent
ed key vulnerabilities in a number of 
countries
 (see Section 3.2).

  46  Second, public and private debt sustainability concerns continue
d to linger in 
several countries
, with debt in the public and/or non
-financial private sectors 
often at levels that 
were
 high by historical and international standards. 
Although 
low financing costs alleviated near
-term debt sustainability pressures, p
ublic and 
private finances remain
ed exposed to the risk of a sudden change
 in market 
sentiment or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. A sudden
 upward 
correction 
in interest rates from their very low levels
 could
 be particularly harmful 
for households and non
-financial corporations in 
countries
 where loans with 
floating inter
est rates predominate.
  Third, 
vulnerabilities increased in the euro area banking sector. 
Euro area banks™ 
profitability remained low in 2019
 and p
rofitability 
prospects weakened
 against 
the backdrop of the deteriorating growth outlook and the
 lasting
 low i
nterest rate 
environment
. 
Although the stock of non
-performing loans continue
d to decline at 
a moderate pace, further improvements 
were
 needed in parts of the banking 
sector. Overcapacity and cost inefficiencies also continue
d to weigh on banks™ 
long
-term 
profitability prospects in 
many cases
.  Fourth, vulnerabilities 
continued to build up 
in the non
-bank financial sector 
as a 
result of
 increased risk
-taking. Investment funds and insurers continued to take 
on risk
s in response to declining yields on higher
-rated assets. At the same time, 
the decline in highly liquid assets
 and pockets of high leverage in the investment 
fund sector raise
d concerns about the potential for sudden and large 
redemptions and investment behaviour that could amplify any market volati
lity.
 Other vulnerabilities beyond the short to medium
-term horizon with a potential 
negative impact on the financial sector were also highlighted by the ECB during 2019. 
Notably, efforts to assess the financial stability implications of climate change 
were 
stepped up, with enhanced communication on the topic. The ECB is aiming to 
contribute, within its mandate, to the general efforts to mitigate the potential negative 
effects of climate change, focusing on several key areas (see Box 3). Closer to home, 
as regards the 
ECB™s efforts to reduce its 
own 
environmental impact
, carbon 
emissions per workplace 
were reduced 
by 74% 
between 2008 and
 2018 (see also 
Box
 3). In addition, during 2019 the ECB 
looked at the implications of developments in 
financial technol
ogy at both the micro
- and macroprudential levels (see Box 4).
 Box 
3  The ECB and climate change
 Climate
-related risks (also known as risks related to global warming) have become increasingly 
important for the financial system and the economy at large thro
ugh two main channels: physical risks 
and transition risks. Physical risks are related
, inter alia, 
to the increased severity and frequency of 
adverse weather events. The materialisation of these risks has adverse impacts on asset values, 
prices of goods a
nd collateral in affected areas, and hence causes losses for 
many actors, including 
insurance companies as well as banks and other financial institutions. Physical risks are already 
 Reduction in ECB carbon 
emissions per workplace
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  47 materialising and are on the rise globally.
33 Transition risks relate to th
e possible side effects 
and costs
 of 
policies
 aimed at climate risk miti
gation
. 
The resulting
 adjustment towards a low
-carbon 
economy
 can take place in an orderly or disorderly manner
. 
For example
, an abrupt introduction of 
policies or the impact of new te
chnologies could trigger market risks for banks and other investors 
owing to unexpected asset price decreases and potential fire sales of carbon
-intensive assets. 
Furthermore, 
the
 transition 
or related policies
 may lower the profitability of carbon
-intensi
ve firms, 
leading to higher credit risks for banks exposed to these sectors. This may also lead to output losses 
and relative price changes.
 Policymakers face a decision when considering tackling climate change: they can either embark 
now 
on possibly 
costly climate risk mitigation policies to ensure a timely and orderly transition to a 
low
-carbon economy, or they can instead not take action and risk facing ﬁthe tragedy of the horizonﬂ 
scenario, in which climate
-related risks will be addressed too late,
 and sizeable transition and 
physical risks could materialise simultaneously.
34 It has already been recognised that
 while 
environmental externalities should be primarily corrected by first
-best policies, such as taxes, all 
authorities need to reflect 
on the
 appropriate response to climate change
 and related risks
 in their 
own area of competence
.35 The ECB, i
n its
 monetary policy 
strateg
y review
, will 
assess the possible 
involvement of the Eurosystem in tackling climate change risks
, and see whe
ther 
and how
 Œ acting 
within its mandate 
Œ it can 
contribute
. Against this background, the ECB may contribute within its mandate to the general efforts to mitigate 
the potential negative effects of climate change in areas where it can be most effective and where it is 
operationally feasible. More specifically, the ECB™s
 efforts are focused on the following key areas: 
(1)
 enhancing 
economic analysis, forecasting 
models and risk assessment; (2)
 developing the 
monitoring and assessment of 
financial stability 
risks, including
 climate
 risk 
stress
 testing
; (3)
 banking 
supervision; (4)
 integrating climate risk considerations into its own 
investment 
and business 
operations
; (5)
 assessing the impact of climate change on its monetary policy 
stance
; (6)
 supporting 
EU and internationa
l fora, 
legislators and standard
-setters 
in their
 work 
addressing the risks of 
climate 
change
 and incorporating sustainability considerations into financial decision
-making; and 
(7)
 protecting the environment through its environmental management system
. 1. Economic analysis, forecasting models and risk assessment
 It is important 
and increasingly relevant for the ECB to take into account the effects of climate change 
and of climate change policies when assessing the outlook for price stability in the conduct of 
monetary policy. In this context, climate change will be part of the fo
rthcoming monetary policy 
strategy review. The ECB has already been able to take into consideration the impact of climate 
change shocks and related policies in its core economic analysis. Technological policies and fiscal 
mitigation and adaptation policies
, such as carbon taxation, typically have a direct impact on prices. 
The impact on inflation may also be indirect, via supply and demand conditions in the economy, which 
in turn affect investment and productivity growth. The needed climate
-friendly policie
s therefore also 
have an effect on countries™ fiscal balances and the operational costs of corporations in exposed 
                                                                    33  See the special feature entitled ﬁ

  48 sectors, ultimately with implications for price
-setting. Climate change itself 
may also 
lead to a gradual 
transformation of households™ behav
iour and consumption patterns, with implications for growth 
dynamics, both in terms of the mean and the volatility of output growth. Such effects translate 
ultimately into impacts on wealth and potential output. The ECB is increasingly analysing the macro 
implications of climate change and related public policies. The findings of this work aim to better 
account for such aspects in the ECB™s regular economic analysis, forecasting models and risk 
assessment. The implications of climate change for the transmis
sion channels of monetary policy and 
monetary analysis, and especially for credit provision, are also being considered.
 2. Monitoring and assessment of financial stability risks
 As a part of climate change adaptation, t
he ECB actively monitors physical and
 transition risks for 
banks and also non
-bank financial institutions. This has required the development of a sufficiently 
granular understanding and monitoring of the carbon intensity of banks™ portfolios at the firm level, 
based on exposures to non
-financ
ial corporations and carbon emissions.
36 There is also a parallel 
focus on developing an analytical framework for carrying out a pilot climate risk stress
-test analysis 
for the euro area banking sector which will be macroprudential in nature.
37 Importantly, 
this work has 
spanned all countries in the European Economic Area under the auspices of a joint project team on 
climate risk monitoring. The team, reporting to the European Systemic Risk Board™s Advisory 
Technical Committee and the European System of Centr
al Banks™ Financial Stability Committee, has 
two aims: (i)
 to implement a monitoring framework for climate
-related systemic risks; and (ii)
 to 
identify forward
-looking scenarios to assess climate risks and transmission channels in a stress
-test 
exercise. I
n the light of the global nature of the climate challenge, it is critical to develop a common 
understanding of the financial risks posed by climate change. In this respect, the ECB 
and several 
Eurosystem national central banks are
 member
s of the 
Network for Greening the Financial System
 (NGFS) and 
are
 playing an important role in shaping nascent work on gauging financial stability risks 
from climate change along with both the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Co
mmittee on 
Banking Supervision (BCBS).
 3. Banking supervision
 Climate
-related risks 
are
 a significant 
risk driver for the euro area banking system.
38 Surveys of 
banks conducted in 2019 by the ECB 
(covering
 around 44% of total euro area banking assets)
 found
 that euro area ba
nks are getting increasingly involved in joint industry initiatives to enhance 
their own 
methodologies to measure 
climate
-related 
risks and contribute to broader and more comparable 
disclosures.
 The ECB is of the view that 
banks 
should ad
opt a timely and strategic approach to 
consider
ing
 these risks, 
consistent
 with the policy messages and expectations contained in the 
EBA 
Action Plan on Sustainable Finance
 published in December
 2019. The ECB is actively 
cooperating 
with 
national competent authorities
, financial regulators (e.g.
 the 
European 
Banking 
Authority
 and the 
BCBS) as well as other central banks and supervisors (notably 
through 
the NGFS) to further develop 
its supervisory approach 
to
 climate
-related risks.
39                                                                     36  See the May 2019 and November 2019 issues of the ECB™s

  49 4. Investment operations
 The ECB contributes to 
the efforts against climate change through its own invest
ment decisions. The 
ECB™s staff pension fund pursues a sustainable investment policy, which seeks to reduce the ECB™s 
carbon footprint. For the ECB™s staff pension fund portfolio, the broad investment universe and the 
longer
-term investment horizon allow a
 sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) policy, based 
on selective exclusion and proxy voting guidelines, to be pursued. The ECB delegated proxy voting 
for equity holdings to its external investment managers, who have signed up to the United 
Nations
-supported 
Principles for Responsible Investment
, requiring them to incorporate 
environmental, social and governance (ESG)
 standards into their voting policies. The ECB has also 
decided to replace the current broad benchmarks for the equity portfolios of its pension fund with the 
low
-carbon versions of these benchmarks. The ECB is also working on the practical implementation 
of SRI principles in its own funds portfolio, which consists of its paid
-up capital and its general reserve 
fund, as part of its participation in the NGFS and in line with the latter™s recently published 
SRI guide
 for central banks™ portfolio management.
 5. Monetary policy operations
 Following the principle of market neutrality, the 
Eurosystem
 has also purchased green bonds under
 its four asset purchase programmes (
i.e.
 the asset
-backed securities purchase programme, the 
corporate sector purchase programme, the public sector purchase programme and the third covered 
bond purchase programme
) and is thereby supporting the ongoing eff
orts 
against climate change
. The ECB support
s initiatives aimed at 
improving
 the pricing of climate change 
risks 
and 
the 
assessment of 
related transition risks
 by private actors
. This includes the development and 
enhancement by 
external credit assessment i
nstitutions recognised under the 
Eurosystem credit 
assessment framework 
of methodologies
 and standards 
for
 the integration of ESG criteria into their 
ratings
, or the development of
 other more specific 
ESG
-related 
scores. 
 The ECB critically 
monitors the 
extent to which climate change
-related risks are priced and hence 
integrated into lending conditions
, and considers whether additional measures are necessary to 
reflect climate change
-related risks in the universe of collateral eligible for Eurosystem cred
it 
operations under the framework for
 marketable assets.
 More generally, the ways in which climate 
change can affect the ECB™s monetary policy operations are expected to be considered in the ECB™s 
monetary policy strategy review.
 6. EU and international in
itiatives on sustainable finance
 The ECB contribute
d to
 various European and international initiatives
 aimed at improving the 
collective response to climate change through the promotion of sustainable and green finance
. At the 
EU level, the ECB
 welcome
d th
e European Commission™s 
Action Plan
 on financing sustainable 
growth 
as an important step towards integrating sustainability
 into financial decision
-making and
 actively su
pport
ed the
 proposed development of a common EU taxonomy of sustainable assets
 as a key step for
 scaling up green financing.
 As a member of the Technical Expert Group
 on 
Sustainable 
Finance
, 
which
 was set
 up to assist 
with 
the European Commission™s initiat
ives following
 up on its 
Action Plan
, the ECB contributed to the preparation of a 
technical
 report
 published in June 2019, 
notably providing analytical input and technical support to the assessment of the e
conomic impact of 
the 
taxonomy
. The ECB has been cooperating more broadly with a larger set of central banks and 
financial regulators across 
the world to mainstream green finance and scale up the contribution of the 
financial sector to funding the transition to a green economy, notably within the framework of the 
NGFS and in international fora such as the G7.
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  50 7. Green ECB
 As regards the 
ECB™s e
fforts to reduce its environmental impact
, in 2019 the ECB was successfully 
recertified in accordance with the European Eco
-Management and Audit Scheme (
EMAS
) and set 
new environmental objectives and took measures to strengthen its commitment to environmental 
protection and to the continuous improvement of its environmental performance. Several new 
measures were implemented during the year to mitigate
 the environmental impact of daily operations, 
such as electronic submissions for public tender procedures. The ECB has also entered into 
interinstitutional collaboration with the European Parliament to jointly offset residual CO2 emissions, 
whilst maintai
ning the avoidance and reduction of emissions as strategic priorities of its 
environmental management system. Raising awareness about the pressing challenges posed by 
climate change and the need to take meaningful action remained a central pillar of the EC
B™s 
environmental management efforts. The ECB took part in the EU Mobility Week and the EU Week for 
Waste Reduction and offered training courses on climate change to staff. Compared with 2008, the 
ECB™s environmental activities have led to a reduction of c
arbon emissions and energy consumption 
per workplace by 74% and 54% respectively in 2018. More information on the ECB™s environmental 
performance is available in its 
enviro
nmental statement
.  3.2
 Macroprudential policy to build sector
-wide 
resilience
 The emergence of systemic risks in the financial system 
can be
 addressed through
 macroprudential policies and the 
SSM Regulation
 assigns a
n important role and
 specific powers 
to the ECB 
in this field. In particular, the ECB has the task of assessing 
macroprudential measures 
for banks
 provided for 
in EU legislation
 and adopted by 
national authorities in countries 
participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism 
(SSM), and also has 
the power to top up such national measures. In
 response to the 
main 
risk
s prevailing
 in 201
9, national
 authorities
 in the euro area
, in consultation with 
the ECB, implemented 
notably more
 macroprudential
 measures 
than in the previous 
year, with a view 
to mitigat
ing
 and strengthening 
resilience to systemic risks
. Continued 
macroprudential efforts to preserve financial stability
 The ECB continued its extensive efforts in the field of macroprudential policy,
 thereby 
making an important contribution to preserving 
financial stability. In addition to 
a body 
of related
 analytical 
work
, the ECB provided a platform for regular joint risk
 assessments and policy coordination between the ECB and the national authorities in
 the euro area. The ECB and the national authoritie
s also continued to engage in broad
 and open discussions on the use of macroprudential instruments, and on the
 enhancement of the analytical toolkit in the field of macroprudential policy
. These 
efforts
 further improved the methods 
and processes 
for assess
ing systemic risks and 
the
 adequacy of macroprudential policy measures in the euro area.
 Macroprudential discussions in 2019 focused on the importance of 
banks remain
ing 
resilien
t and 
able to withstand adverse shocks to the macro
-financial environment. 
Only with releasable buffers in place can macroprudential policy play 
a countercyclical

 Releasable macroprudential buffers 
can play an important 
countercyclical role
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  51 role. 
In this context
, t
he countercyclical capital buffer 
(CCyB
) is the
 key
 instrument 
that 
can be 
released
 if cyclical risks materialise. 
A greater availability of releasable buffers 
in the form of CCyB
s would thus help 
avoid a 
simultaneous deleveraging across the 
banking system
, which 
could result in a credit crunch 
and aggravat
e the downturn
. This underscores the relevance 
of 
not only the level of capital buffers, but also the 
ability to release them in times of stress. 
At this point in the euro area, t
he implemented 
CCyBs
 amount to 
0.1% of risk
-weighted assets and 
remain overall small 
relative
 to other buffer requirements (see Chart 22)
. Chart 
22 Decomposition of bank capital buffers
 (percentages
)  Source: ECB.
 Notes:
 Minimum requirements include Pillar 1 CET1, the Pillar 2 requirement and CET1 capital to meet shortfalls for Tier 1 and Tier 2
. Structural buffers
 include capital conservation buffer
s, systemic risk buffers
, as well as 
G-SII and O
-SII buffers.
 Management buffers are 
those buffers that banks hold in excess of these regulatory requirements. The right bar shows announced CCyB rates a
s at March 2020.
 In 2019 
the ECB 
also 
concluded its first review of the buffer floor framework
 for 
other 
systemically 
important 
institutions (O
-SIIs) in the SSM area. The O
-SII buffer is aimed 
at limiting the negative externalities that a failure of systemically important institutions 
can pose to the domestic financial system and the wider economy. 
The revised O
-SII 
floor methodolog
y is more granular and increases the minimum buffer rates for the 
most systemically relevant banks
 (see the March 2020 Macroprudential Bulletin for 
more details). 
The 
new framework will help to ensure that 
more systemic banks can be 
subject to 
higher 
buffe
r requirements in certain jurisdictions
, thus reducing risks to 
financial stability
. It 
will be phased in starting from 1 January 2022.
 Furthermore, the ECB continued to enhance its communication on macroprudential
 policy issues, raising awareness by makin
g the ECB™s ongoing work and thinking in
 this field more transparent. 
The November 2019 
Financial Stability Review
 contained 
a section on how macroprudential policies 
can address vulnerabilities in the financial 
system. 
Besides speeches, press releases and other publications
 such as occasional 
papers, the ECB continued publishing its biannual
 Macroprudential Bulletin
, which is 
an important communication tool for explaining the
 ECB™s macroprudential policy 
framework and decision
-making procedures, as well as
 analytical advances and 
assessments in the field. The EC

 Macroprudential policy decisions during 201
9 In line with its legal mandate, the ECB in 201
9 assessed notifications by the national
 authorities in the euro area of 
106 macroprudential policy decisions regarding
 instruments targeting cyclical and structural systemic risks, as well as other
 instruments
 under Article
 458 of the 
Capital Requirements Regulation
 (CRR). Most
 notifications related to the setting of countercyclical capital buffers or the
 identification 
of gl
obal and other systemically important institutions (G
-SIIs and O
-SIIs)
 and the 
calibration of the
 respective
 capital buffers. The Governing Council of the ECB did not
 object to any of the macroprudential policy decisions that national authorities notified
 during 201
9. The national competent authorities of 
seven 
euro area countries 
had announced the 
activation of a
 CCyB rate 
above 
0% by the end of 2019, compared with four countries 
in the previous year. In 12 countries the buffer had not been activated by the end of 
2019. The calibration of the CCyB rates 
was based on ﬁguided discretionﬂ, which 
combines guidance from key risk indicato
rs and more discretionary elements 
reflecting specific economic and financial conditions.
 Looking at the countries that announced CCyB increases in 2019, 
the 
Haut Conseil de 
Stabilité Financière in France decided to raise the CCyB rate from 0.25% to 0.5% i
n March 2019 as a preventive measure and considering an upward trend in private 
sector indebtedness in France. The 
Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de 
Belgique
 decided to raise the CCyB rate from 0% to 0.5%
 in June 2019
, its main 
objective being 
to increase banks
™ resilience 
to
 cyclical risks. While cyclical systemic 
risks 
we
re not 
seen as 
acute, 
it 
consider
ed that 
it was 
prudent to introduce a 
preventive measure to ensure the continuity of credit provision through the cycle.
 The 
Bundesanstalt für
 Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht 
in Germany 
decided 
in June 2019
 to 
introduce a positive CCyB rate of 0.25%. 
It 
assessed that the build
-up of 
cyclical 
systemic risks 
(in particular vulnerabilities related to the u
nderestimation of credit risk
, the o
vervaluat
ion of collateral
 and i
nterest rate risk
) had created a 
potential 
threat to 
financial stability.
 In July 2019 Národná banka Slovenska decided to 
further 
increase 
the CCyB rate from 1.5% to 2%
 in Slovakia
. The banking sector and its profit
ability
 had become
 more exposed to cyclical risks and 
the authority saw signs of exuberance in 
financial markets. Finally,
 in Luxembourg the 
Commission de Surveillance du Secteur 
Financier
 decided to increase the CCyB rate from 0.25% to 0.5% in December 2019, 
in the light o
f strong increases in lending and real estate prices.
 The low interest rate environment could induce higher risk
-taking and a loosening of 
lending standards
, particularly if bank profitabili
ty is under pressure
. Further increases 
in residential real estate prices, coupled with 
trends in mortgage lending
 and fragilities 
in the household sector
, led to an increase in real estate v
ulnerabilities 
in 2019 in a 
number of euro area countries. 
In such a situation, guidance on sound lending 
standards or the pre
-emptive tightening of borrower
-based measures with appropriate

  ECB Annual Report 2019
  53 exemptions could help contain a potential build
-up of risks. 
By the end of 2019, 13 
countries in the euro area had introduced
 such measures, which fall under the sole 
competence of the national authorities.
 Regarding macroprudential instruments targeting 
other
 risks, the ECB
 assessed 
national authorities™ decisions on O
-SII
 buffer
s, systemic risk buffers
, as well as 
macroprudential measures under Article 458 of the CRR
. As for measures 
adopted in 
2019 in this latter category
, 
Eesti Pank introduce
d a new 
measure 
to 
ensure the 
resilience of banks to systemic risks associated with housing loans
. Credit institutions 
that 
use 
the 
internal 
ratings
-based (IRB) approach must 
apply an
 exposure
-weighted 
average risk weight of at least 15% 
to
 retail exposures secured by mortgages on 
immovable property 
granted 
to 
residents of Estonia.
 The measure c
ame
 into force on 
30 September 20
19. The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority 
also 
decided in June 
2019 to extend the period of application for the credit institution
-specific minimum level 
of 15% for the average risk weight on housing loans applicable to credit institutions 
that have 
adopted the IRB approach. The extension of the minimum level 
came
 into 
force on 1
 January 2020 and 
will 
apply for one year. 
 Cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board
 The ECB continue
d to provide analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative 
support to the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) Secretariat, which is in charge 
of the day
-to
-day business of the ESRB. The ESRB is responsible for the 
macroprudential oversight of the 
EU financial system and the prevention and 
mitigation of systemic risk.
 The ECB regularly contributed to the ESRB™s ongoing identification and monitoring of 
potential systemic risks and provided general support to work undertaken by the 
ESRB. For example, 
the ECB was involved in the work on closing 
real estate 
data 
gaps, which led to the approval of a
n ESRB
 Recommendation
, as well as 
in the 
development of an enhanced monitoring framework for material third countries. In 
addition
, the ECB supported the ESRB™s analysis of medium
-term vulnerabilities in the 
residential real estate sector, which led to five warnings and six recommendations 
being issued by the ESRB
 to selected EU countries
. The ECB also greatly contributed to the ESRB™s initial considerations on developing a 
common 
framework for the macroprudential 
stance
. A
 dedicated 
report
 was published 
in April 2019
 as 
a first step towards such a common framework
. It
 establishe
d the link 
between macroprudential policies and the objective of fin
ancial stability. In addition
, the ECB continued to contribute to the second phase of this work, by co
-chairing the 
ESRB™s expert group 
mandated to
 develop operational methods to facilitate the 
assessment, discussion and communication of 
the macroprudentia
l stance.
 Furthermore, the ECB is co
-chairing an analytical expert group tasked with assessing 
the materiality of the potential overlap between macroprudential capital buffers, the 
minimum leverage ratio and the minimum requirement for own funds and eligib
le 
liabilities (MREL). This work aims to describe 
how 
the requirements interact and the 
implications for the effectiveness of macroprudential buffers.
 The ECB continued to closely 
cooperate with and support the 
ESRB
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  54 Throughout the year the ECB also chaired the drafting team 
preparing
 the ESRB 
Recommendation
 on exchange and collection of information for macroprudential 
purposes on branches of credit institutions having their head office in another Memb
er 
State or in a third country.
 The ECB continuously supported the ESRB™s work on macroprudential instruments 
to 
be used 
beyond 
the 
banking
 sector
. The ECB contributed to the analysis of data and 
risks, in particu
lar the implications of margining practices for insurers, and to the 
design of new macroprudential instruments for the insurance sector, focusing on some 
of the options which were shortlisted in the 2018 
report
 on 
macroprudential provisions, 
measures and instruments for insurance
. The outcome of this work will directly feed 
into the ongoing discussions on the 
review of Solvency
 II
, with the aim to strengthen 
the regulatory framework for insurers and reinsurers from a macroprudential 
perspective.
 The
 ECB 
also 
contributed to the continued develop
ment
 of risk metrics
 for non
-banks,
 and to the 
drafting of the 
fourth issue of the
 EU Non
-bank Financial Intermediation 
Risk Monitor
, which presents an overview of developments in the sector, wit
h a focus 
on assessing potential risks to financial stability. In addition to this, the ECB provided 
valuable contributions to the interim paper on mitigating 
the 
procyclicality of margins 
and haircuts in derivatives markets and securities financing transa
ctions, both in terms 
of drafting and developing the underlying analytical thinking.
 Furthermore, the ECB worked together with the ESRB on developing and 
imple
menting methodologies for conducting an impact study of how different climate 
change scenarios could be affecting the EU financial sector. It also provided a 
mapping of different methodologies, an assessment of data availability and an 
overview of the type
 of financial institution exposures to be analysed when conducting
 climate
-related risk analysis.
 The ECB chaired the 
ESRB 
Task Force on Stress Testing, which prepared the adverse 
scenarios for the pension fund stress test
 of the 
European Insurance and 
Occ
upational Pensions Authority
, 
as well as the 
money market fund 
and central 
counterpart
y stress test
s of the 
European S
ecurities and Markets Authority
. To this 
end, several D
irectorates 
General
 of the ECB provided critical technical and modelling 
support to
 the ESRB task force.
 Finally, 
the 
ECB actively participated in the ESRB™s European Systemic Cyber Group, 
which developed an analytical frame
work for assessing cyber risks.

 a stable European banking sector and a level playing field for all banks in 
the euro area. Thanks to the progress made since 20
14, European banking 
supervision 
is evolving
 into a mature 
institution
. Although the post
-crisis repair of banks™ balance sheets has greatly advanced, it 
nonetheless continued to rank highly among the supervisory priorities in 2019. Other 
priorities 
focused on the
 drivers of low profitability for European banks
 and governance 
issues
, including 
banks™
 conventional 
risk management capabilities, and 
emerging risks, particularly regarding the ongoing digitalisation of financial services 
and their vulnerability to IT and cyber risks.
 Throughout 2019 ECB Banking Supervision continued to improve its tools and 
methods. Following up on its previous commitment, the ECB revised, in August 2019, 
the 
supervisory expectations
 for the prudential provisioning of new non
-performing 
exposures (NPEs), specified in the 
Addendum
 to the ECB 
Guidance
 to banks on 
non-performing loans, in order to take into account new Pillar 1 requirements.
40 Following a public
 consultation and the publication of the general topics guide in 
November 2018, the ECB published, in July 2019, final risk type
-specific chapters of 
the 
ECB guide to internal models
, covering credit risk, market risk and counterparty 
credit risk. In February 2019 the ECB also published aggregate stress
-test 
results
 for 
all participating banks under its supervision, as a complement to the 2018 EU
-wide 
stress test. And, in October 2019, it published the 
results
 of its 2019 sensitivity 
analysis of liquidity risk conducted as the annual stress test. The results of both 
exercises feed respectively into the 
2018 (published in April 2019) and the 2019 
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.
 While the number of banks directly sup
ervised by the ECB remained broadly stable in 
2019, a number of banks have undergone significant changes to their group 
structures and activities as banking groups consolidate or relocate activities from the 
United Kingdom to the euro area. 
For the banks t
hat became significant as a result, 
the ECB assumed the direct 
supervision and, for some of those
, the obligatory 
comprehensive assessment was launched in the second half of 2019.
 In the uncertain 
period preceding 
the United Kingdom
™s withdrawal from the 
EU, 
ECB Bank
ing 
Supervision focused on monitoring 
the preparedness of banks and supervisors 
for 
all 
possible contingencies
 and, in particular, 
the implementation of banks™ Brexit plans, as 
agreed between banks and supervisors.
 While banks made some progress 
towards 
the
ir target operating models 
in 2019
, t
he ECB repeatedly warned against further 
delay
s and continued to communicate its supervisory expectations through updates to 
the 
FAQs
 on the ECB 
Banking 
Supervision website, several articles in the Supervision 
Newsletter and bilateral discussions with the supervised entities.
  The year 2019 also witnessed 
progress 
towards enlarging the SSM beyond the euro 
area, 
after

4  Fintec
h Financial technology brings significant benefits for banks, their customers, the financial system and 
the broader economy, but it also entails challenges and risks. Financial institutions are free to 
innovate in a responsible manner, but 
the associated ris
ks 
must be 
mitigated through effective 
risk 
management frameworks 
and oversight.
 The emergence of fintech and specialised fintech firms has led to changes in existing banking 
business models. In the European Union, fintech firms have so far mostly entered 
into partnerships 
with banks, enabling the latter to improve the customer experience by providing a wider range of 
financial services and products in a more affordable and efficient manner. Moreover, with the 
increasing availability of data and the use of 
artificial intelligence as well as enhanced computing 
power to harness the data, banks are also increasingly using fintech to enhance their own internal 
operations.
 As a result, interlinkages between fintech firms and banks are growing, most notably in the
 provision 
of outsourcing services, and 
operational risks 
have increased 
at both the institutional 
and the 
system
-wide 
level
s. S
ome fintech firms 
are also 
offering new financial services, especially in the area 
of payments, putting pressure on banks. 
Impor
tantly, ﬁbig techﬂ firms with their large customer bases 
and established technology platforms are gradually making inroads into financial services and have 
already become dominant providers of cloud computing.
 The ECB has responded to the evolving challeng
es and risks arising from financial innovation on 
multiple fronts. At the macroprudential level, the ECB is monitoring and assessing the financial 
stability implications of fintech. Profitability pressures stemming from competition with fintech firms 
are b
eing amplified by 
banks™ 
needs for 
investment
 in digitalisation
, which 
require
s time to yield net 
benefits
. Growing interlinkages with fintech firms could mean that disruptions in these firms might 
have systemic implications for the financial system unless
 adequate safeguards are put in place.
 The ECB also contributes to fintech
-related policy and financial stability work through various 
European and international fora, including the European Banking Authority, the Financial Stability 
Board, the Basel Commi
ttee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on Payments and Market 
Infrastructures. In addition, it 
act
s as a driver of change
, as can be seen from 
the launch of TARGET 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  57 Instant Payment Settlement and the 
ongoing 
exploration of the application of new tech
nologies to 
market infrastructures.
41 At the microprudential level, ECB Banking Supervision is 
carr
ying
 out further work 
to develop a 
common understanding of fintech
-related risks and to ensure a consistent supervisory approach 
to 
these risks 
across the SSM
. This involves assessing the impact of fintech on banks™ business models 
and the main associated risks.
 In order to enhance its supervisory approach to fintech, ECB Banking 
Supervision 
is engaging 
with 
SSM 
banks to learn how they are using innovative 
technologies and 
solutions and what the implications are for their business models
, and more importantly how the main 
risks could be addressed by risk management frameworks.
 On 21
-22 May the first 
ECB Fintech Industry Dialogue
 took place
, bringing together euro area 
bankers and supervisors, third
-country supervisors, as well as representatives from regulatory 
authorities such as the European Commission, the Euro
pean Banking Authority and the European 
Securities and Markets Authority.
 The dialogue focused 
on: (i) 
credit scoring using artificial 
intelligence and big data
; (ii) automated online investment advice (ﬁ
robo
-advice
ﬂ); and (iii) 
cloud 
computing. The event 
was intended to be the first of several such dialogues where banks have the 
opportunity to provide supervisors 
with 
their views on the 
recommended 
areas of supervisory focus. 
This input 
contributes
 to further develop
ing
 the approach to 
the 
supervision 
of b
anks using 
innovative 
technologies.
 ECB Banking Supervision
 also continued to develop its international cooperation on fintech
-related 
matters both within and outside the SSM.

 The ECB™s contribution to European policy initiatives
 Five years a
go the first pillar of the banking union, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, 
began operations following the ambitious set of institutional and regulatory initiatives 
taken in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. 
With this
 concrete step
, EU 
Member States and institutions foster
ed financial integration and stability and 
strengthen
ed economic resilience.
 Today, however, there is still scope to further integrate the single banking market. This 
would contribute to the uniform transmission of 
monetary policy and further remove 
the destabilising relationship between banks and sovereigns, which was at the heart of 
the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Further progress on developing and integrating 
capital markets is also needed to enhance the abil
ity of the financial system to 
diversify risks and to complement the banking union. In addition, risks in the non
-bank 
financial sector should be mitigated through appropriate macroprudential tools.
                                                                     41  See Chapter

  58 Completing the banking union
 In 2019 the ECB was fully involved in the work in EU fora to strengthen the banking 
union. In June 2019 the Euro Summit acknowledged in its 
declaration
 the progress 
made on deepening Economic and Monetary Union and supported the continuation of 
technical work on strengthening the banking union. 
In the second half of 2019 the 
High
-Level Working Group
 on a European Deposit Ins
urance Scheme (EDIS) carried 
out further work on
 the s
hort and long
-term perspectives 
regarding the establishment 
of a
n EDIS, 
the options for the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures
, 
as well as 
how to strengthen financial stability, 
enhance crisis 
management and foster 
integration.
 Furthermore, the Eurogroup decided to continue its efforts to finalise the 
package on the revision of the European Stability Mechanism Treaty, also in view of 
the need to provide a common backstop to the Single Resolution
 Fund.
42 The ECB contributed extensively to the technical discussions in EU fora by providing 
input to the different work streams. Regarding the crisis management framework, the 
ECB insisted on addressing the existing overlaps in regulation on early interve
ntion 
measures.
43 The ECB also supported further analysis of the impediments to 
cross
-border integration, notably the barriers to the free flow of capital and liquidity 
within the banking union
. 
More generally, the ECB advocated a compromise package 
that wo
uld include a first stage of EDIS in the form of liquidity support, while providing 
an end
-stage perspective in the form of full loss coverage. 
Such
 an encompassing 
agreement 
would
 allow Europeans to reap the full benefits of the banking union, 
including m
arket integration and an equal protection of depositors.
 The pooling of 
resources for deposit insurance at the European level would better preserve 
the 
confidence of depositors than national schemes
; the latter could be more exposed in 
the event
 of an idio
syncratic shock, which could potentially weaken their credibility and 
hence depositor trust.
 In line with the concept that risk sharing and risk reduction are two mutually reinforcing 
processes, the ECB contributed to the further reduction of risks in the 
banking sector. 
In particular, ECB Banking Supervision continued its work on banks™ balance sheet 
repair with the follow
-up to its non
-performing loans guidance and assessed the 
quality of banks™ underwriting criteria with a focus on new lending. In 2019 t
he ECB 
continued to contribute to the joint monitoring reports on risk reduction (see the 
May 
edition
 and the 
November edition
), prepared together with the European Commission 
and the Single Resolution Board, which showed further progress in risk reduction.
 The 
second pillar of the banking union was also a major focus of the year. In 
December 2018 it was agreed that the European Stability Mechanism would provide 
the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. However, the resolution 
framework continues to have
 a major gap because a euro area framework for the 
provision of liquidity to viable banks coming out of resolution is yet to be created. While 
                                                                    42  The common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, which will be provided by the European Stability 
Mechanism, is a safety net aimed at ensuring that the Single Resolution Fund has additional resources to 
support any necessary resolu
tion measures.

management framework (

 In-depth work to complete th
e banking union was carried out in 
2019

  59 other major jurisdictions have such a framework in place, largely based on 
government guarantees to the central b
ank as liquidity provider, it has so far not been 
possible to agree on an equivalent solution in the euro area.
 Advancing the capital markets union
 In 2019 the ECB continued to advocate the completion 
of the capital markets union 
(CMU). A genuine capital markets union, if effectively realised, would significantly 
deepen financial integration and strengthen Economic and Monetary Union, as well as 
foster 
the international role of the euro. This would supp
ort a smoother and more 
homogeneous transmission of monetary policy.
 Deeply integrated capital markets would further increase the resilience of the financial 
system by reducing the reliance on banks and encouraging alternative market
-based 
sources of finan
ce. As underlined in the ECB™s 
Financial Stability Review
 in 2019, 
completing the capital markets union is a fundamental prerequisite to enhance risk 
sharing and impro
ve the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks. Geopolitical 
and economic developments since 2015, such as Brexit as well as digitalisation and 
climate change, have strengthened the need for integrated European capital markets.
 With the conclusion o
f the European Commission™s 2015 
CMU Action Plan
, a 
significant number of legislative and non
-legislative proposals in the CMU agenda 
were finalised by the
 Commission in the 2014
-19 legislative term. While much has 
been achieved on the legislative front, renewed ambition on some of the key priorities 
is indispensable to push this project forward.
 In 
2019 the ECB underlined the key priorities to advance the capital markets union in 
EU fora. This included stressing the importance of further harmonisation of national 
tax and insolvency regimes, which is essential for well
-functioning cross
-border capital
 market transactions, as well as further supervisory convergence towards a single 
rulebook, in particular for non
-banks
.44 In the long term, providing additional 
supervisory 
powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority
 would foster 
a genuine 
capital markets union with a consistent implementation of the single rulebook 
across the European Union.
 Macroprudential policy for the non
-bank financial sector
 While being fully supportive of more market
-based financing of the euro area 
economy, the ECB remains concerned about the rapid growth of the non
-bank 
financial sector and its potential implications for financial stability. 
While a greater role 
for
 non-bank financial intermediation in financing the economy is part of the CMU 
agenda, it continues to be crucial to effectively monitor this sector.
                                                                     44  Further harmonisation and standardisation, building on the 
single 
rulebook as a harmonised regulatory 
framework, 
are
 key 
to achieving a genuine capital markets union
. CMU can facilitate the transmission 
of monetary policy
 Further harmonisation efforts are 
needed to advance CMU
 Continued growth in the non
-bank 
financial sector raises potential 
financial stability concern
s      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  60 Given these developments, ensuring a sound prudential framework for non
-bank 
financial institutions is indispens
able to adequately address the systemic risks that 
could materialise in this sector. 
Thus, in 2019, the ECB continued to advocate an 
extension of the macroprudential framework beyond the banking system and 
contributed extensively to the related technical d
iscussions in EU and international 
fora.
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  61 4 Smooth functioning of market 
infrastructure and payments
 One of the basic tasks of the Eurosystem is to ensure the smooth operation of 
payment systems. This task is closely interlinked with the Eurosystem™s 
responsi
bilities in the fields of monetary policy and financial stability. The Eurosystem 
plays a central role in developing, operating and overseeing market infrastructures 
and arrangements that facilitate the safe and efficient flow of payments, securities and 
collateral across the euro area.
 4.1
 TARGET Services
 Currently, the Eurosystem™s TARGET Services consist of three components: 
TARGET2, a real
-time gross settlement system for euro payment transactions related 
to the Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations, as w
ell as bank
-to
-bank and 
commercial transactions; TARGET2
-Securities (T2S), a single platform for 
Europe
-wide securities settlement; and TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), 
which allows payment service providers to offer their customers the instant tr
ansfer of 
funds, around the clock, every day of the year.
 More than 
1,000
 banks use TARGET2 to initiate transactions in euro, either on their 
own behalf or on behalf of their customers. Taking into account branches and 
subsidiaries, more than 
45,000
 banks 
worldwide can be reached via TARGET2. In 
2019 TARGET2 processed on average 
344,120
 payments per day with an average 
daily value of •
1.7
 trillion.
 As a systemically important payment system (SIPS), TARGET2 is crucial not only for 
the stability and efficienc
y of the financial sector and the euro area economy, but also 
for the smooth conduct of the single monetary policy of the euro area and for the 
stability of the single currency. Like other SIPSs, TARGET2 is subject to continuous 
oversight by the Eurosystem
, which follows a risk
-based approach including the 
monitoring of end
-point security and cyber resilience.
 In 2019 the Eurosystem implemented a new TARGET2 contingency tool. In the event 
of an outage of TARGET2 (
even if 
this
 lasts
 more than one day), it al
lows the 
Eurosystem to continue processing transactions categorised as ﬁ
criticalﬂ and ﬁ
very
 criticalﬂ. The new contingency tool is part of a broader strategy for strengthening the 
operational and cyber resilience of the Eurosystem™s market infrastructure.
 TARGET2 has been running smoothly for over a decade. However, as the payments 
ecosystem has changed significantly during that time owing to technological 
developments, new regulato
ry requirements and changing user demands, the 
Eurosystem is planning to replace TARGET2 with a new real
-time gross settlement 
(RTGS) system in 
November 
2021, and at the same time to optimise liquidity 
management across all TARGET Services. The new RTGS sy
stem will use the 
TARGET2 to be replaced with a new 
real
-time gross settlement system in 
2021
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  62 messaging standard ISO 20022 and will be able to facilitate payments in multiple 
currencies. At the end of 2019, based on feedback received in a public consultation, 
an enhanced version of the User Detailed Functional Specifications for t
he future 
RTGS service was published. Furthermore, two network service providers signed 
contracts with the Eurosystem to offer users network
-agnostic connectivity to all 
Eurosystem market infrastructure services via the new Eurosystem Single Market 
Infrast
ructure Gateway (ESMIG).
 With regard to T2S, it is now over two years since the migration waves of central 
securities depositories (CSDs) to the common platform 
were
 completed. T2S is 
currently used by 21 CSDs, serving 20 markets across Europe. In 2019, T2
S processed an average of 
606,938
 transactions per day with an average daily value of 
•1,106.13
 billion.
 In 2019 for the first time, an independent external examiner appointed by the ECB 
Governing Council performed technical and operational examinations of
 T2S services. 
The observations made by the examiner were shared with the Eurosystem 
and the 
CSDs 
and non-euro area central 
banks
 that use T2S. These examinations will now be 
performed every year.
 Furthermore, following a pre
-assessment in 2015, the first 
comprehensive oversight 
assessment of T2S in operation, initiated in 2018, was finalised in 2019. It concluded 
that T2S is largely compliant with the 
CPMI
-IOSCO Principles for financial market 
infrast
ructures
, indicating that T2S is safe and efficient. While shortcomings in certain 
areas were identified during the assessment, none were deemed to pose a serious 
risk if not promptly addressed.
 Following the launch of TIPS in November 2018, in its first y
ear seven
 euro area
 markets connected to the service, meaning that more than 1,000 payment service 
providers are now reachable via TIPS. More euro area 
markets
 are preparing to join 
TIPS in 2020. Since TIPS can support different currencies, Sveriges Riksba
nk 
expressed 
its intention to
 incorporat
e the Swedish krona into TIPS 
in 2022. Furthermore, the Eurosystem is developing a new TARGET Services component, 
namely the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS). This single system 
will be capable of manag
ing the assets used as collateral in all Eurosystem credit 
operations. In 2019 and on schedule, the project reached the end of its specification 
phase. Its go
-live date is planned for November 2022.
 4.2
 Innovation and integration in market infrastructure and 
payments
 The financial industry is undergoing considerable transformation driven by innovation 
and digitalisation. In the retail payments market, for example, new EU legislation 
allowing third
-party access to payment accounts, the launch of instant payments
 and technical innovations in general have led to the emergence of new market players, 
new channels for accessing payment services and new ways of initiating payments. 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  63 (See Box 5 for information on c
rypto
-assets, stablecoins and central bank digital 
curren
cy.) 
The challenge for the Eurosystem with respect to these developments is 
twofold: it must 
foster integration and innovation in 
its role as a catalyst
 and promote 
the safety and efficiency of market infrastructure and payments in its role as overseer.
 Box 
5  Crypto
-assets
, stablecoins and central bank digital currency
 Over the 
last few years, there has been a lot of hype surroundin
g bitcoin and other 
crypto
-assets and 
their potential to 
be a substitute 
for 
money. 
Crypto
-assets allow individuals and businesses to 
conduct 
transact
ions
 directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party
. However,
 the fact that 
these ass
ets
 have been
 referred to as
 ﬁcrypto
-currenciesﬂ, ﬁdigital currenciesﬂ 
and ﬁvirtual currenciesﬂ 
might have given rise to some false expectations 
regarding
 their features and functionalities. In broad 
terms, 
crypto
-assets
 are assets recorded in digital form that are considered valuable by their users as 
an investment and/or means of exchange but that are neither a financial claim on, nor a financial 
liability of
, any natural
 or legal person.
 The major disadvantage of crypto
-assets is their price volatility
. 
The volatility of crypto
-assets 
has in 
recent years been higher than
 the volatility o
bserved, for example, in various commodities markets
. 
This shows 
the extent to which 
crypto
-asset investors are subject
 to market risk
. 
Furthermore,
 this 
high volatility means that crypto
-assets cannot 
properly 
perform the three functions of money: a store 
of value, a means of payment 
and a unit of account.
 In an attempt to 
circumvent the 
problem of
 high 
price 
volatility, financial service providers and 
technology companies have 
launched
 a new 
class of crypto
-assets
, known as stablecoins, 
that use 
stabilisation mechanisms 
to
 minimise price fluctuations. 
Depending on the 
stabilisation mechan
ism used, 
the value of 
the stablecoin
 may be
 backed by: (i) holdings of money (in one currency or a basket 
of different currencies)
; (ii) securities and commodities such as gold
; (iii) crypto
-assets
; or (iv) a 
mechanism attempting to match demand and suppl
y (i.e. algorithmic stablecoins). In 2019 particular 
attention was paid to 
stablecoin initiatives
, such as Libra,
 that 
claim to enable faster transactions at 
potentially lower costs 
on a global scale 
by providing a new separate payment 
arrangement
. However
, stablecoins 
have not yet been tested
 on a large scale and 
pose
 a number of legal, 
regulatory and oversight risks. 
Before stablecoin initiatives go live t
hese issues must be addressed 
through appropriate
 system 
design
 and governance, 
and risk
-proportionat
e oversight requirements 
and regulation.
 Crypto
-assets and stablecoins have sparked a broader debate on payments innovation and on the 
roles of the private and public sectors in devising new ways to make payments
 more 
affordable, 
efficient and inclusive.
 The issuance of a 
central bank digital currency
 (CBDC) could potentially 
address the social 
demand
 for 
new 
innovative, efficient and resilient
 tools for making 
payments. But 
various
 design
 features
 of CBDC could have far
-reaching implications 
for
 the financial system that 
need to be carefully assessed. 
With regard to the retail payments ecosystem,
 the
 CBDC 
design 
should neither 
exclude possible collaboration with
 the private sector
 nor crowd out private market
-led 
solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area.
  In 2019 the ECB published a report entitled 
SEPA Migration Impact Assessment
, 
which showed that the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  64 the migration to pan
-European payment schemes for credit transfers and direct debits 
have brought significant progress towards a safe, ef
ficient and integrated European 
payments market. However, a SEPA for 
cards
 has not been achieved. Furthermore, 
end-user 
solutions for payment initiation remain fragmented across Europe. Similarly, 
for point
-of-interaction payments (i.e. point
-of-sale and e
-commerce payments), a 
pan-European solution addressing the needs of European users has not yet emerged.
 To address this issue, in 2019 the Eurosystem 
adopted
 a new retail payments strategy. 
The strategy supports the development of a market
-led pan
-European solution for
 point
-of-interaction payments and sets out the key objectives for such a solution.
 In the area of oversight, and based on the approach 
whereby
 entities performing the 
same functions should be subject to the same oversight expectations (ﬁsame risk, 
same re
quirementsﬂ), the Eurosystem has taken steps to review its oversight policy 
and to start developing a new framework for the oversight of payment instruments, 
schemes and arrangements (PISA oversight framework). This new holistic, agile and 
future
-oriented 
framework is designed to apply to both established and new payment 
products, providers and technologies, and to contribute to the safety and efficiency of 
the overall payment system.
 The Eurosystem is fostering market
-wide harmonisation in the post
-trade a
rea to 
support the further integration of financial markets in Europe. In the area of collateral 
management harmonisation, the key objective is to work towards the establishment of 
a single collateral management rulebook for Europe, comprising standards fo
r collateral management. In 2019, a first set of such standards was adopted by the 
ECB
™s Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral, 
covering 
triparty collateral management
, 
corporate actions for debt instruments
, and 
billing processes
; these should be implemented by November 2022. National 
Stakeholder Groups have been asked to prepare their respective adaptation plans 
with a view to complying with the standards.
 The E
urosystem has also continued to foster post
-trade harmonisation in the field of 
securities settlement, in particular by closely 
monitoring
 progress in implementing 
standards and following up on any gaps in progress
. At the end of 2019, 90% of the 
markets that participate in T2S complied with the core harmonisation standards 
(compared with 85% in 2018).
 In the area of securities infrastructures, 
the Eurosystem
, as the central bank of issue 
for the euro
, participates in the authorisation and regular review and monitoring of 
CSDs under the 
CSD Regulation
. In fact, the Eurosystem is the only authority 
currently involved in the authorisation and review of all euro area CSDs and as such is 
helping to facilitate
 a consistent approach to these
 tasks
, thereby playing a key role in 
guarding the safety and efficiency of securities settlement.
 With regard to central counterparties (CCPs), the Eurosystem as the central bank of 
issue for the euro has continued to contri
bute to the activities of supervisory colleges 
established under the 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation
 (EMIR), including to 
the assessment of CCPs™ requests to e
xtend their services or to introduce changes to 
their risk models. Furthermore, the Eurosystem is represented in crisis management

  66 5 Efforts to support market functioning, 
and financial services provided to other 
institutions
 In October 2019 the ECB began publishing the euro short
-term rate (•STR), a new 
reference interest rate that is based entirely on money market statistical reporting 
data. The •STR will progressively replace the euro overnight index average (EONIA) 
and is e
xpected to become one of the main reference rates in euro area markets. The 
launch of the new reference rate was well anticipated by the financial industry and did 
not result in any serious disruptions.
 The daily production of the •STR has worked well 
and the methodology has proved reliable. In 2019 the ECB continued to be 
responsible for the administration of various financial operations on behalf of the EU, 
and continued its overall coordinating role in relation to the Eurosystem Reserve 
Management Servic
es framework. Furthermore, the ECB decided to start publishing 
additional data on its foreign exchange interventions as of April 2020, with the aim of 
enhancing communication and transparency in this field and in line with its 
accountability practices in o
ther policy areas
 (see Box 6)
. 5.1
 The •STR, the new overnight reference rate for euro area 
money markets
 On 2 October 2019 the ECB began publishing a new overnight reference interest rate 
for the euro area markets. The euro short
-term rate, or the •STR, ref
lects the 
wholesale euro unsecured borrowing costs of euro area banks.
 This robust and 
reliable rate, 
computed daily 
based 
currently 
on more than 
•30 billio
n worth of eligible 
transactions reported by 50 different reporting agents, should progressively rep
lace 
EONIA
. The methodology of the •STR is designed to comprehensively reflect the underlying 
money market dynamics. The rate is informed by a broad set of eligible transactions 
reported by banks which were conducted with other banks as well as with non
-bank 
financial institutions; this makes it resilient to structural changes in the unsecured 
market. 
In 2019 t
he average daily volume 
of transactions underlying the 
•STR
 calculation stood at
 •31.1 billio
n. The 
•STR™s data sufficiency policy ensures that the 
rate is representative by requiring that
: (a) at least 20 of the institutions currently 
reporting under the 
Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) Regulation
 submit 
contributions; and (b) the five 
banks reporting the largest share of the volume
 do not 
account for 
more than 75% of a given day™s turnover. 
If one of these 
requirements is 
not met, a short
-term contingency procedure 
is triggered, thus ensuring the availabil
ity
 of the rate.
 Finally, the rate is computed as a 
volume
-weighted
 trimmed average, 
whereby the top and bottom 25% of the volume, corresponding to the transactions 
with the lowest and highest rates, 
are
 filtered out to compute the rate, which helps to

details on how the •STR is determined see 
Box 7 in 
Chapter
 7).
 The •STR 
is progressively replac
ing
 EONIA
, whic
h will be discontinued
 on 3 January 
2022. 
Following the recommendations of the private sector 
work
ing group on euro 
risk
-free rates
 and a public consultation, on 2
 October 2019 the administrator of 
EONIA 
Œ the European Money Markets Institute 
Œ changed the EONIA methodology 
so that, until its discontinuation on 3 January 2022, the rate is determined as
 the •STR 
plus a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points.
 The working group on euro risk
-free rates, 
which was established in 2017 to identify and recommend risk
-free rates that could 
serve as a basis for an alternative to existing benchmarks, produced 
guidance f
or the 
transition from EONIA to the •STR
. This includes 
recommendations on how to 
approach EONIA
-linked contracts
, 
as well as
 analys
es of the implications of the 
change for 
products, processes and models
, for 
financial accounting
 and for 
risk 
management
. The ECB™s efforts to communicate with benchmark users in preparation for the •STR 
launch together with the guidance and recommendations of the working group on
 euro 
risk
-free rates contributed to the smooth 
start
 of the •STR. The launch of the new 
reference rate and the change to the EONIA methodology were well anticipated by the 
financial industry and did not result in any serious disruptions. For example, inte
rnal 
systems were adjusted to take into account the different timing for publishing the 
reference rate, i.e. in the morning of the day following the trade date. Moreover, the 
first market transactions indexed to the •STR, including the first issuances of 
securities, were successfully completed. In the derivatives market, the first 
over
-the
-counter swap transactions were executed with the launch of the 
rate
, while 
some of the central clearing counterparties started offering clearing of •STR
-based 
products sh
ortly afterwards in October and November.
 The daily production of the •STR has worked well and the methodology has proved 
reliable. The reliability of the methodology 
can be illustrated by two examples. First, 
the ECB™s deposit facility rate cut on 18 September 
2019 was fully and immediately 
reflected in pre
-•STR data and, since the start of the •STR publication, the rate and 
distribution of the underlying transactions 
in the middle range have remained fairly 
stable. Second, the bank holiday in Germany on 3 October 2019 had a negligible 
impact on the rate and its various metrics. While the value of the reported transactions 
declined by •4.3 billion on that day compared w
ith the day before, the number of 
participating banks as well as the concentration of the turnover reported by the five
 banks
 with the largest share of the volume
 remained at a comfortable distance from 
the thresholds that define the data sufficiency polic
y as explained above. Furthermore, 
the volatility of the •STR remained contained, illustrating the robustness of the 
methodology in the face of such events.
 The •STR
, a robust and reliable rate 
based on a broad set of eligible 
transactions, will replace EONIA

the long

provide a temporary backstop in the form of mandatory contributions to the benchmark

 Administration of EU borrowing and lending operations
 The ECB is responsible for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations 
of the EU under the 
medium
-term financial assistance (MTFA) facility
46 and the 
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism
 (EFSM)
47. In 2019 the ECB processed 
interest payments in relation to the loans under the MTFA. As at 31 December 2019 
the total outstanding 
amount under this facility was •200 million. In 2019 the ECB also 
processed various payments and interest payments in relation to the loans under the 
EFSM. As at 31 December 2019 the total outstanding amount under this mechanism 
was •46.8 billion.
 Similarly, the ECB is responsible for the administration of payments arising in 
connection with operations under the 
European Financial Stability Faci
lity
 (EFSF)
48 and the 
European Stability Mechanism
 (ESM)
49. In 2019 the ECB processed various 
interest and fee payments in relation to two loans under the EFSF. The ECB also 
processed payments in relation to subscrip
tions by ESM members to the ESM™s 
authorised capital stock.

 Eurosystem Reserve Management Services
 In 2019 a comprehensive set of financial services continued to be offered within the 
Eurosystem Reserve Management Services (E
RMS) framework established in 2005 
for the management of customers™ euro
-denominated reserve assets. A number of 
Eurosystem national central banks (the Eurosystem service providers) offer the 
complete set of investment services, under harmonised terms and 
conditions and in 
line with market standards, to central banks, monetary authorities and government 
agencies located outside the euro area, and to international organisations. The ECB 
performs an overall coordinating role, monitors the smooth functioning o
f the services, 
promotes changes to improve the framework and prepares related reports for the ECB 
Governing Council.
 In 2019 one additional central bank started offering ERMS services, bringing the total 
number of Eurosystem service providers to ten. The 
number of customer accounts in 
the ERMS was 
273 at the end of 2019, compared with 277 at the end of 2018. The 
total aggregated holdings (including cash assets and securities holdings) managed 
within the ERMS framework decreased by approximately 
7.5
% in 201
9 compared 
with
 2018. Box 6
  ECB enhances reporting on foreign exchange interventions
 On 26 September 2019 the Governing Council of the ECB decided to publish additional data on the 
ECB™s foreign exchange interventions (FXIs) as of April 2020. The aim of t
his new publication is to 
enhance communication and transparency in this domain in line with the accountability practices in 
other policy areas while safeguarding the ECB™s ability to carry out interventions in the foreign 
exchange market in an effective m
anner. In the case of the 
asset 
purchase 
programme, as an 
example of accountability practices, the Eurosystem provides regular data on the volume and the 
distribution of purchases across programmes and jurisdictions.
 The exchange rate is not a policy targe
t for the ECB. Since the inception of the euro, the ECB has 
intervened in the foreign exchange market twice 
Œ in 2000 and 2011 (see Table A). The ECB 
intervened first in 2000 owing to concerns about the global and domestic repercussions of the 
exchange rat
e of the euro, including its impact on price stability. Initially the ECB 
and the US and 
Japanese authorities intervened in a coordinated manner on 22 September, and then the ECB 
intervened unilaterally in November. Second, at the request of the Japanese a
uthorities, the ECB and 
                                                                    50  In the context of the loan facility agreement between the Member States whose currency is the euro

to date

 With the change in the publication policy, the ECB will provide data on FXIs using a structured and 
systematic approach in terms of frequency and data coverage. The ECB has previously used several 
channels to disclose FXI 
information, including its weekly financial statements, Annual Accounts and 
Annual Report. Going forward, the ECB will publish FXI data in a table on its website and in the ECB
™s Annual Report. The table on the website will be updated quarterly, with a del
ay of one quarter. With 
the first publication, the table will disclose all FXI historical data since 1999. The ECB™s Annual Report 
will from now on also provide additional background information and summarise any new 
developments in FXIs, as appropriate. I
n addition, the ECB Annual Accounts will state whether or not 
any FXIs were carried out during the year under review. The commentary on the weekly financial 
statement will also contain a general reference to any intervention occurring the week before, as i
n previous occurrences in 2000 and 2011.
 The new reporting framework will cover FXIs carried out by the ECB unilaterally and in coordination 
with other authorities, as well as 
exchange 
rate 
mechanism (ERM II) FX
 intervention
s ﬁat the 
marginsﬂ
51. It will enc
ompass the total amount (net and gross), the direction (sale or purchase), the 
breakdown per currency and the date(s) of intervention. In the interests of full transparency, the 
absence of any FXIs will also be explicitly stated in the quarterly table.
 Thi
s step brings the ECB™s communication policy on FXIs into line with the accountability practices it 
has developed in other areas over the years. These practices go beyond what is strictly required by 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In 
this way the ECB is providing relevant 
information on its strategy, assessments and policy decisions to the broader public and the financial 
markets. This helps the ECB foster credibility by being transparent about how it performs its tasks. 
Each ERM II me
mber central bank remains responsible for disclosing FXI data according to its own 
practice.
                                                                      51  Exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) interventions at the margins are interventions that take place when a 
currency™s exchange rate against the euro reaches the margins of its pre
-agreed fluctuation band (i.e. the 
band within which ERM II member currencies are
 allowed to fluctuate against the euro). These 
interventions are, in principle, automatic and unlimited

  72 6 More banknotes and low level of 
counterfeiting
 The ECB and the euro area national central banks (NCBs) are responsible for issuing 
euro banknotes within the euro 
area
, for guaranteeing the availability of cash
 and for 
maintaining confidence in the currency. The number and value of euro banknotes in 
circulation have been rising since their introduction in 2002, and generally at a faster 
pace than economic growth. In
 2019 the number of counterfeits remained at a low 
level, owing to a combination of factors, including enhanced security features in the 
new Europa series, continuous cooperation with law enforcement, regular 
communication with the public and training offe
red to professional cash handlers. In 
May 2019 the new •100 and •200 banknotes were introduced with new, innovative 
security features, completing the Europa series of banknotes.
 6.1
 Banknote circulation continued to increase
 In 2019 the number and value of 
euro banknotes in circulation
 grew by around 6.4% 
and 5.0% respectively. At the end of the year there were 24.1 billion euro banknotes in 
circulation, with a total value of •1
,293 billion (see Charts 25 and 26). The •50 
banknote accounted for nearly half of both the number and value of banknotes in 
circulation. The •200 banknote had by far the highest annual growth rate, reaching 
61.4% in 2019, as it fulfilled part of the deman
d for the •500 banknote, the issuance of 
which was stopped. The total value of •100 banknotes in circulation at the end of 2019 
stood at •305 billion, which is equal to the combined value of all euro banknote 
denominations in circulation in July 2002. Grow
th in the •100 and •50 banknotes 
remained high, at 8.8% and 7.4% respectively.

 (EUR billions)

 It is estimated that, in terms of value, around one
-third of the euro banknotes in 
circulation are held outside the euro
 area. These notes are predominantly held in 
neighbouring countries and are mainly the higher denominations. They are used as a 
store of value and for settling transactions in international markets.
 The production of euro banknotes is shared among euro are
a NCBs, which were 
altogether allocated the production of around 3.7 billion banknotes in 2019.
 The total number of euro coins in circulation increased by 3.3% in 2019, to 135.1 
billion at the end of the year. The value of coins in circulation rose to •30 
billion, 3.4% 
higher than at the end of 2018.
 In 2019 euro area NCBs checked the authenticity and condition of some 30 billion 
banknotes, withdrawing around 5 billion from circulation as unfit. The Eurosystem also 
continued its efforts to help banknote equ
ipment manufacturers to ensure that their 
machines meet the ECB™s standards for checking euro banknotes for authenticity and 
condition prior to recirculation. In 2019 credit institutions and other professional cash 
handlers checked some 38 billion euro ban
knotes for authenticity and condition.
 Introduction of the new •100 and •200 banknotes and stopping 
issuance of the •500
 On 28 May 2019 the new •100 and •200 banknotes entered into circulation. The 
introduction of the new notes completed the Europa serie
s, which was launched in 
2013 with the •5 banknote.
 The issuance of the •500 banknote was stopped between January and April 2019 by 
all euro area NCBs. As is the case for the other denominations of the first series of 
euro banknotes, the •500 banknotes wil
l remain legal tender and can therefore

an unlimited period of time at the euro ar
ea NCBs.
 6.2
 Euro banknote counterfeiting remained low in 2019
 The number of counterfeit euro banknotes remained low in 2019, with around 559,000 
counterfeits being withdrawn from circulation. This low number is the result of a 
combination of factors, includin
g enhanced security features in the new Europa series, 
cooperation with law enforcement, and communication and training efforts at 
European and national level. Compared with the number of genuine euro banknotes in 
circulation, the proportion of counterfeit
s further decreased and is very low. Long
-term 
developments in the number of counterfeits removed from circulation are shown in 
Chart 27.
 Chart 27

 Counterfeiters mainly produce counterfeit •20 and •50 banknotes, which together 
accounted for more than 70% of the total number of counterfeits withdrawn from 
circulation in 2019. The share of counterfeit •50 banknotes declined in 2019.
 In spite of a decline in the deceptiveness of counterfeits withdrawn from circulation, 
the ECB continues to advise the public to remain vigilant when receivi
ng banknotes, to 
remember the ﬁ
feel

addition, training is offered to professional cash handlers on a conti
nuous basis, both 
in Europe and beyond, and up

public to support the Eurosystem™s fight against counterfeiting. The ECB also 
cooperates with Europol, Interpol and the European Commission in pursuit of t
his 
goal.

 Pursuing greener banknotes
 In 2004 the Eurosystem conducted a life cycle assessment of euro banknotes based 
on the ISO 14040 series of standards, pioneering 
in assessing
 the environmental 
impact of banknotes over their whole life cycle. This complex assessment has been 
the main source of information for implementing measures to
 reduce the 
environmental impact of euro banknotes
. For instance, the Eurosystem has put in 
plac
e an accreditation system for manufacturers of euro banknotes and their 
components which includes an environmental management system and has focused, 
among other things, on moving gradually towards 
the target of 100% 
use of 
sustainable cotton fibres in eur
o banknote paper.
 The Eurosystem has also been monitoring on an annual basis key consumption and 
emissions data from all accredited manufacturers, seeking to improve the 
environmental performance of
 the production process.

  76 7 Statistics
 The ECB 
Œ assisted by 
the national central banks (NCBs) 
Œ develops, collects, 
compiles and disseminates a wide range of statistics and data which are needed to 
support the monetary policy of the euro area, financial stability and various other tasks 
of the European System of Ce
ntral Banks (ESCB) and the tasks of the European 
Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). These statistics are also used by public authorities, 
financial market participants, the media and the general public, contributing to the 
fulfilment of the ECB™s transparency obj
ective.
 This chapter focuses on how to contain the reporting burden for banks and on 
statistics relating to fintech, including crypto
-assets. Two boxes focus respectively on 
the independent determination process for the euro short
-term rate (•STR)
 based on
 the relevant Guideline 
(Box 7) 
and on the medium
-term strategy for financial accounts 
statistics, setting out objectives for the coming years
 (Box 8)
. 7.1
 Containing the reporting burden
 The financial cri
sis revealed the limitations of aggregated statistics in providing the 
necessary information to serve policymakers in a situation of increased fragmentation 
across countries, sectors and markets. The ECB responded to these limitations by 
enacting new legal
 acts allowing it to obtain additional granular data which meet 
monetary policy, microprudential and macroprudential data needs, for example 
statistical datasets like the AnaCredit dataset, securities holdings statistics and money 
market statistics. This r
esulted in an increase in the reporting burden for banks.
 Another issue that the banking industry is facing is the lack of cross
-country 
harmonisation in reporting scheme
s, which originates from the ESCB
™s traditional 
approach 
whereby 
NCBs 
can
 fulfil Europ
ean statistical requirements through their 
national reporting frameworks.
 While there is a high degree of conceptual harmonisation in statistical reporting across 
the euro area, in practice, a large number of separate statistical reports are to be 
submitte
d to NCBs, with different transmission frequencies and timelines, and different 
levels of aggregation.
 Moreover, the statistical reports partly overlap with a wide range of reports required by 
banking supervisors. This leads to redundancies and overlaps as
 well as complex 
reporting schedules and processes.
 Understandably, the banking industry has highlighted this situation and called for a 
much more cost
-efficient design and implementation of reporting requirements
52 while 
                                                                    52  For instance, see ﬁ
Boosting Europe
ﬂ, European Banking Federation, 2019.
 The financial crisis led to a heavier 
reporting burden
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  77 maintaining the effectiveness of re
gulation and at the same time even further 
increasing data quality.
 Against this background, in 2016 the ESCB began working on consolidating the 
existing s
tatistical requirements for banks through the development of an Integrated 
Reporting Framework (IReF),
 designed 
to establish an integrate
d solution for ESCB 
statistical 
reporting
 across countries and statistical domains. Under the new 
framework, which is expected to be implemented between 2024 and 2027, more 
granular data will be collected than in the existing datasets
53, allowing the coverage of 
the existing requirements in a uniq
ue framework and avoiding duplications of the 
requirements wherever possible. This means that, while the data volume will 
significantly increase, banks will have fewer statistical classifications and 
aggregations to perform, which are frequently resource
-intensive activities; such tasks 
will instead be carried out by the ESCB, with an expected overall increase in data 
quality. The IReF will use a unique data model and dictionary, which are expected to 
fully standardise definitions and ensure methodological 
soundness. Granular data are 
inherently flexible in that they can be combined in different ways to provide new 
products and services, and it is expected that this may reduce the frequency of 
changes in the legal reporting framework and, at the same time, d
ecrease the need for 
ad hoc data requests by the authorities.
 As shown in Figure 2, the ESCB™s overall strategy for collecting data from banks also 
foresees supportin
g reporting agents in optimising the organisation of the information 
stored in their internal operational systems (e.g. for accounting, risk management, 
securities or deposits) in an ﬁinput layerﬂ, which could then provide the basis for 
fulfilling all appl
icable reporting requirements based on standardised transformation 
rules. With this aim, a group composed of representatives of the ECB, some euro area 
NCBs and the banking industry is developing a Banks™ Integrated Reporting Dictionary 
(BIRD). The scope o
f the BIRD goes beyond ESCB statistical datasets to cover 
supervisory and resolution reporting.
                                                                     53  Here we refer primarily to the datasets related to the reporting obligations of deposit
-taking corporations 
set out in: the ECB statistical regulations on balance sheet items an
d interest rates of monetary financial 
institutions; the sectoral module of the Regulation concerning statistics on holdings of securities; and the 
AnaCredit Regulation on granular credit and credit risk data.
 The Integrated Reporting 
Framework consolidates the 
existing ESCB statistical 
requirements for banks

Dictionary complements the

  Notes: EBA: European Banking Authority; SSM: Single Supervisory Mechanism; SRM: Single Resolution Mechan
ism. 
 In 2018 the ESCB decided to launch a cost
-benefit analysis of the IReF in close 
cooperation with the banking industry and other relevant stakeholders, with a view to
 assessing the impact of the initiative on the supply and demand sides. The first step 
consisted of a qualitative stock
-taking questionnaire on the state of play of statistical 
reporting across domains and countries in order to identify the main cost facto
rs and 
potential benefits of the IReF. In 2019 the ESCB Statistics Committee 
assessed the 
results
 of the qualitative stock
-taking question
naire and designed concrete scenarios 
for the IReF as regards various data collection and statistical production aspects. The 
next step in 2020 will be to assess, by means of a questionnaire, the costs and 
benefits of these scenarios. The scenarios were de
veloped by focus groups that 
involved field experts from the ESCB and, on selected topics, representatives from the 
banking industry. The new questionnaire will be based on a draft IReF reporting 
scheme, which will allow respondents to rate scenarios based
 on concrete proposals 
for reporting requirements. The ESCB will then assess the results and, if they show 
support for the IReF, identify the optimal features that would best suit the industry and 
the ESCB users and compilers.
 If the outcome of the overall
 cost
-benefit analysis is satisfactory, the Governing 
Council of the ECB may decide to proceed with the IReF. A draft ECB regulation would 
be developed for a public consultation before its adoption and implementation. IReF 
requirements would be mandatory f
or all euro area banks.

 New and enhanced euro area statistics
 Fintech and crypto
-assets
 Statistics on technological innovation that is used to support or provide financial 
services (fintech) are 
being developed and enhanced, in order to continue meeting 
statistics users™ needs in a digitally transformed world. In particular, in early 2019 the 
Directorate General Statistics of the ECB set up an internal crypto
-asset dataset and 
established a set of
 indicators based in the first instance on publicly available 
aggregated data. This dataset and set of indicators, after undergoing quality checks 
and being complemented with other data from commercial sources
54, provided input 
into the ECB™s monitoring of 
the crypto
-asset phenomenon
55. Using big data 
technologies, it was possible for the ECB to create an automated set of procedures for 
collecting, handling and integrating several crypto
-asset data collections. An important 
component of this work is the inves
tigation of the statistical classification of 
crypto
-assets. With respect to fintech, while the discussion on fintech statistical 
definitions as well as related data needs is also taking place in international fora
56, the 
ECB has been building an experiment
al internal dataset on fintech entities in the euro 
area
57, in line with similar initiatives implemented at some euro area NCBs. The aim is 
to gain insights into linkages between the financial sector and fintech, the 
opportunities the latter unlocks and the
 risks it poses.

  Independent determination process
 for the euro short
-term rate (•STR)
 Following two years of intensive preparations by the Eurosystem and reporting banks, the ECB 
published the euro short
-term rate (•STR) for the first time 
on 2 Oct
ober 2019 (see 
Section
 5.1). The 
•STR
, which 
reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of euro area banks
, is 
calculated and published by the ECB™s statistical function, ensuring that the determination of the rate 
is separate from the
 ECB policy functions. In line with the 
•STR Guideline
 a control framework has 
been created to protect the integrity and independence of the determination proces
s and to deal with 
any existing or potential conflicts of interest.
 The •STR Guideline establishes the ECB
™s responsibility for the administration of the rate, as well as 
the tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the NCBs with respect to their contribu
tion to the •STR 
determination process and other business procedures. Pursuant to the •STR Guideline an internal 
Oversight Committee was created to review, challenge and report on all aspects of the •STR 
                                                                    54  See ﬁ

  80 determination process. Furthermore, the •STR determi
nation process is subject to regular internal 
and external audits. In order to ensure 
that 
the •STR procedures are in line with international best 
practice, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial 
Benchmark
s are transposed into the •STR Guideline 
Œ where relevant and appropriate.
 The ECB published the •STR for the first time on 2
 October 2019, reflecting trading activity on 
1 October 2019. The •STR is published on the ECB™s website
58 at 08:00 CET on every TARGET2 
business day based on transactions conducted and settled on the previous TARGET2 business day. 
If errors are detected following the publication of the •STR that affect it by more than 2
 basis points, 
the 
•STR is revised and r
e-published on the same day at 09:00 CET. The •STR is not revised after 
that time. Immediately after publication by the ECB, the •STR is made available by commercial data 
providers via real
-time market data feeds. To support the transparency of the benchma
rk 
determination process, the ECB periodically publishes summary information on errors larger than 
0.1
 basis point that are detected after the standard publication and do not meet the re
-publication 
criteria.
 The •STR is based entirely on actual transactio
ns in euro that are reported by banks in accordance 
with the 
Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) Regulation
, as recently amended to enhance 
the availabil
ity of high
-quality statistics on the euro money market.
59 The MMSR reporting agents 
Œ numbering 50 at the cut

NCB (
the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, 
the 
Banco de España, 
the 
Banque 
de France or 
the 
Banca d™Italia) 
or directly to the ECB before 07:00 CET (see Figure
 A). The data then go through a quality assurance 
process, which includes a set of technical checks, a large number of consistency checks, and a set of 
targeted data qualit
y checks to identify which transactions, if any, should be excluded from the 
calculation of the •STR. The process of confirming the transactions takes place between 07:15 and 
07:45 CET. During this process the ECB, in cooperation with the NCBs, asks the re
porting institutions 
to verify that the identified transactions are correct.
                                                                     58  The •STR is publis

  Medium
-term strategy for financial accounts statistics
 In 2019 the ESCB™s Statistics Committee finalised the development of a
 new medium
-term strategy 
for quarterly financial accounts statistics. The aim of this initiative was to plan how to further develop 
financial accounts statistics taking into account new analytical needs and ongoing improvements in 
statistical capacity (e.
g. the increased granularity of data), and 
how 
to meet the challenges posed by 
globalisation and increased international interdependencies. The design of the medium
-term strategy 
involved thorough examinations of analytical needs, data sources and compilat
ion options
, in close 
cooperation with data users and experts from the different statistical domains, e.g. compilers of 
balance of payments statistics or MFI balance sheet data.
 The strategy sets out five objectives to be addressed in the coming years. Fir
st, the challenges 
globalisation poses for financial accounts statistics, linked to the deepening of international 
interdependencies and economic integration, will be addressed by an increased alignment of these 
statistics with balance of payments and inte
rnational investment position statistics, an increase in the 
granularity of data on cross
-border activities, and a specific statistical focus on multinational 
enterprises. Second, the need to shed further light on non
-bank financial intermediation will be 
met 
through a more detailed 
sectoral 
breakdown and increased granularity of data on financial 
instruments. Third, increasing analytical needs related to understanding interconnectedness at the 
macro level with a focus on investment and financing interdepen
dencies, policy spillover channels 
and contagion chains will be served by enhancing the ﬁfrom
-who
-to
-whomﬂ framework, which shows 
creditor
-debtor links, through a more detailed sectoral and/or geographic
al breakdown. Fourth, the 
statistical analysis of the
 household sector will be enhanced by introducing distributional measures 
for household wealth and indebtedness as well as developing an analysis to identify the indirect 
exposure of households to the underlying investment of funds in securities, equity an
d other assets

  82 (known as investment funds ﬁlook

financial accounts data, for instance in terms of timeliness and back
-data availability.
 The workstreams aiming to achieve these objective
s take into account the requirements in the 
context of the 
second 
phase of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative
60 and will exploit ongoing initiatives in 
supporting statistical fields. The development phase, which began in 2019, is generally scheduled for 
the next 
three to five years
, and will also involve a review of existing ECB statistical regulations and 
guidelines where this is relevant for implementing the new financial accounts statistical outputs
. In a 
fast
-changing environment, the strategy should be seen 
from the outset as dynamic and adjustable.
 The implementation of the medium
-term strategy for financial accounts statistics will be a collective 
effort to face the various challenges in a coordinated manner and with a clear set of objectives, taking 
advant
age of the opportunities emerging from changes in data availability and statistical capacity, and 
aiming 
to
 keep financial accounts statistics relevant and fit for purpose.

  83 8 Research at the ECB
 Economic research makes an important contribution to the analy
sis of economic 
developments and 
of 
the transmission of policy interventions and thereby underpins 
the achievement of policy objectives. In the light of the economic environment in 2019, 
inflation dynamics, household finance, and the interplay between mone
tary policy, 
financial stability and the real sectors of the economy remained at the core of the 2019 
research priorities.
 8.1
 Research 
networks
 Three research clusters and various research networks play an important role in 
coordinating the research efforts within the European System of Central Banks 
(ESCB) and in maintaining relations with academic researchers. In 2019 the three 
ESCB research clu
sters on monetary policy, financial stability and the competitiveness 
of euro area economies continued to organise workshops on related issues. In 
addition, a 
Research and Policy 
Network on Central Bank Communication
, co
-led by 
the ECB, was established within the framework of the Centre for Economic Policy 
Research (see also Section 11.2).
 One particular focus of 
research at the ECB is macroprudential policies and their 
interaction with monetary policies. In 2019 a taskforce studied the various spillovers 
between the two kinds of policy, including the effects of monetary policy on financial 
stability and the impact
 of macroprudential policy on the real economy. In 2020 the 
focus will be on the optimal coordination between the two 
kinds of policy
.61 The PRISMA (price
-setting microdata analysis) Researc
h Network studies the 
price
-setting behaviour of individual firms and in the retail sector using micro price 
datasets. Research addresses the relationship between 
the 
price setting 
of individual 
firms 
and aggregate inflation dynamics, in particular whether
 price
-setting behaviour is 
affected by low inflation, the monetary policy stance and the state of the business 
cycle.
 The 
Household Finance and Consumption Network
 (HFCN) has finished its work on 
the third wave of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), the results 
of which will be released in 2020. Research has,
 among other things, studied the 
implications of household heterogeneity for the transmission of monetary policy, for 
example its role in policy transmission across the income distribution. The HFCS has 
also been used as an essential input into micro
-simul
ation models which quantify the 
effects of stress
-testing scenarios on households.
                                                                     61  See Cozzi, G. et al., ﬁ

In 2019, the CompNet dataset 
was
, for 
instance,
 used in 
studies on the role of trade and fiscal and labour market policies in 
the reallocation of capital and labour.
 In 2019 the ECB launched a project to collect data on consumer expectations in the 
euro area via a regular online surve
y. The survey will be conducted in cooperation with 
national central banks and will cover expectations on inflation, the labour market, 
consumption and savings behaviour, and consumer finances. It will enable the ECB to 
study the role of consumers™ expecta
tions in their economic and financial decisions.
 8.2
 Conferences and publications
 The ECB again organised several high
-level research events in 2019. The 
2019 ECB 
Forum on Central Banking in Sintra
 discussed the lessons of 20 years of European 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with a focus on the diverse prog
ress of 
economic convergence and the role of fiscal and monetary policies in macroeconomic 
stabilisation (see also Box 12 in 
Chapter
 12). The ECB™s 
fourth Annual Research 
Conference
 featured innovative research related to secular stagnation, financial 
market structures and the role of big data in economics. Other important conferences 
were related to structural reforms in the euro area, inflati
on developments, global 
trade, labour markets, fiscal policy and EMU governance, consumer expectation 
surveys, gender and career progression, and monetary and macroprudential policies.
 In 2019, 12
9 papers prepared by ECB staff were published in 
the ECB™s 
Working 
Paper Series
. In addition, a number of more policy
-oriented or methodological studies 
were published
 via the 
ECB™s 
Occasional Paper Series
, 
Statistics Paper Series
 and Discussion Paper Series
. Many of the ECB™s research activities also resulted in the 
publication of papers in scientific journals. Furthermore, research findings were 
reported to a wider audience, for instance via 12 articles published in the ECB™s 
Research Bulletin
. Boxes
 9 and 10 summarise two sets of research findings from 
2019. Box

 There is an 
extensive
 public debate on whether the market power of firms ha
s become excessive 
over the last decades. For the U
nited 
States
, studies have documented that firm
 concentration ratios 
have increased
, with a larger market share 
accounted for
 by a few firms. 
In relation to this, the level of 
competition has declined
, allowing firms to increase the mark

while employment dynamis
m has weakened.

  85 A recent
 ECB study
62 examined related developments in the four largest euro area economies 
(Germany, France, Italy and Spain). It 
did
 not find evidence 
of an increase in the market power of 
firms since the 1990s in these countries. In fact, 
while 
the mark
-up of prices over costs has 
increased 
to a level of above 20% from close to 15% in the United States since the 1990s, it has 
declined 
marginally in the euro area (see Chart A)
. This 
is largely the result of developments in manufacturing, 
possibly driven by the impact of deeper trade and monetary integration in the euro area. Moreover, in 
apparent contrast to developments in the U
nited 
States
, concentration ratios have remained broadly 
stable in the euro area in recent years, both at the aggre
gate and the national level.

 Note: A mark
-up of 15% corresponds to a gross mark
-up value of 1.15 as shown i
n the chart.
 While market power is generally regarded as welfare
-reducing (as it results in firms raising prices and 
producing less), it may also have beneficial effects in innovative sectors, as the prospect of enjoying 
market power is 
a major
 incentive f
or firms to innovate. Indeed
, the study 
found
 that 
in high
-tech 
industries high concentration is associated with higher growth rates 
of total factor productivity.
 Finally, job market dynamism, measured by the rates of job creation and destruction, has 
weak
ened substantially over the past two decades in the U
nited 
States
, but has remained stable in the euro 
area. Still, 
the 
labour market in the U
nited 
States
 remain
s substantially more dynamic than 
the one 
in 
the euro area.
 Overall, there are no signs of major shifts in market power and 
employment 
dynamism 
in the large euro area economies.

10  Gender 
balance in career progression at the ECB
 The gender gap in labour markets has 
attracted
 increasing attention
 in recent years
. A recent ECB 
working paper
63 explores this gap in 
central banking, 
a stereotypical male
-domin
ated occupation. 
The paper analyses the career progression of men and women at the ECB using confidential 
anonymised personnel data on professiona
l staff between 2003 and 2017. The analysis focuses on 
expert staff across four different salary bands in 
comparable business areas related to economic 
analysis
, thereby achieving a homogeneous pool of staff in terms of human capital and experience.
64 The s
tudy finds that
, before 2011,
 women were less likely to be promoted to a higher salary band
 than 
men
. The difference largely disappeared after 2011, when the ECB took several measures to support 
gender balance and issued a public statement supporting diver
sity. 
Chart A
 shows the evolution of the 
gender gap in 
the probability of 
promotion 
to a higher salary band in the ten
 years 
after entry to the 
F/G
 salary band 
(the entry
-level salary band for expert staff at the ECB
). The gap ten years after entry 
stood a
t 36% before 2011, but decreased to 8% thereafter.
 Chart

promotion gap

 Notes: The chart
 shows the evolution of the gender gap in 
the average annual probability of 
promotion 
from the F/G salary band in the ten
 years 
after entry before 
and after 2011. The gender promotion gap is defined as the difference in the 
average annual 
promotion rates of men and women
 relative to the promotion 
probability of men
. Data after 201
1 allow for a more detailed exploration of the promotion process. This reveals that
, after 
having applied
 for promotion
, women were actually more likely than men to 
be promoted
. They also 
performed better in terms of subse
quent salary progression, suggesting that the higher probability of 
being 
promoted
 was based on merit, not 
on positive discrimination.
 However, women were less likely to apply for a promotion in the first place. Some evidence indicates 
that such 
a gender 
gap in 
applications reflects 
the
 reluctance of women to apply when they expect the 
                                                                    63  Hospido, L., Laeven, L. and Lamo, A., ﬁ

external candidates or when 
competing
 with 
a large number of immediate co

high salary levels. Taken together, these results suggest that institutional efforts to foster gender

  88 9 Legal activities and duties
 This chapter deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union 
concerning the ECB; reports on ECB opinions and c
ases of non
-compliance with the 
obligation to consult the ECB on draft legislation falling within its fields of competence; 
and reports on the ECB™s monitoring of compliance with the prohibition of monetary 
financing and privileged access.
 9.1
 Jurisdiction of 
the Court of Justice of the European Union 
concerning the ECB
 On 26 Febru
ary 2019 the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulled the 

-Corruption 

performing his duti
es as the Governor of Latvijas Banka. The separate actions brought 

-202/18) and the ECB (C
-238/18) against that decision were the 
first cases which the CJEU had heard on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred on it by 
the second subparag
raph of Article 14.2 of the Statute of the European System of 
Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (Statute of the ESCB). First, the 
CJEU found that a prohibition, even a temporary one as in this case, of a governor of a 
national central bank fro
m performing his duties constitutes a relieving from office and 
that it is therefore for the CJEU to review the lawfulness of that prohibition. Second, 
the CJEU held that the action referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 14.2 of 
the Statute of t
he ESCB had as its purpose the annulment of an act of national law 
because of the ﬁparticular institutional contextﬂ in which the ESCB operates. Third, the 

from office was ba
sed on the existence of sufficient indications that he had engaged in 
serious misconduct for the purposes of the second subparagraph of Article 14.2 of the 
Statute of the ESCB.
 On 23 May 2019 the General Court dismissed the action for damages against the ECB 
brought by several bondholders (Case T
-107/17). The damages claimed related to the 
haircut affecti
ng certain Greek government bonds in the context of a partial 
restructuring of Greece™s sovereign debt in 2012. The applicants had argued that the 
ECB, in its Opinion of 17 February 2012 (CON/2012/12), failed to point to the illegality 
of the Hellenic Repu
blic™s intended debt restructuring. The ECB Opinion was on the 
draft Greek law retrofitting collective action clauses into sovereign bonds governed by 
Greek law. The General Court found that the restructuring did not violate the 
applicants™ fundamental rig
ht to property protected by Article 17 of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights. It also rejected all other illegality claims made by the applicants. 
Accordingly, the General Court concluded that the ECB was not liable for damages for 
not pointing to the alleg
ed illegality of the Greek law in its Opinion. The judgement has 
been appealed before the Court of Justice.
 The Court of Justice annulled a 
decision of the Latvian 
Anti
-Corruption Office in so far as it 

performing his duties as Governor of

  89 On 6
 May 2019 the General Court in two different cases (T
-283/18 Bernis and Other
s v ECB and T
-281/18 ABLV Bank v ECB) ruled that a
 ﬁfailing or likely to failﬂ
 assessment adopted in the context of the resolution of
 a credit institution is a 
preparatory measure that is not open to 
independent 
judicial review. In these cases, 
actions were brought by a credit institution and its direct and indirect shareholders 
against an assessment 
by the ECB concerning whether ABLV L
uxembourg was failing 
or likely to fail within the meaning of Article
 18(1) of Regulation (EU) No
 806/2014 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 15
 July 2014 establishing uniform rules 
and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institu
tions and certain investment 
firms
 in the f
ramework of a Single Resolution 
Mechanism and a Single Resolution 
Fund
. The General Court upheld the position of the ECB that such assessment should 
be considered as a mere factual assessment that has 
in itself 
no legal effect and is 
therefore not challengeable before 
the 
EU 
Courts.
 On 8
 May 2019 the CJEU 
in case C
-450/17 P (
Landeskreditbank
 Baden
-Württemberg 
v ECB
) upheld the judg
ement of the General Court by which the General Court 
dismissed 
an action seeking 
the 
annulment of a decision of the ECB
. In 
that decision, 
the ECB 
had informed the Landeskreditbank that on account of its size it wa
s subject 
solely to the ECB™s supervision rather than shared supervision under the 
Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (
SSM
), pursuant to Article
 6(4) of 
Council 
Regulation 
(EU) 
No 1024/2013
 of 15
 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central 
Ban
k concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions
. The Landeskreditbank™s challenge to this decision was dismissed by t
he General 
Court. The 
CJEU
 confirmed that the ECB is exclusively competent for the supervision 
of all c
redit institutions on the basis of Article
 4 of Regulation No
 1024/2013. The 
national competent authorities assist the ECB in carrying out the tasks conferred on it 
by Regulation No
 1024/2013, 
through
 a decentralised implementation of some of 
those tasks i
n relation to less significant credit institutions, within the meaning of the 
first subparagraph of Article
 6(4) of that 
Regulation.
 On 5
 November 2019 the 
CJEU
 partially reversed the ruling from the General Court 
whereby shareholders of 
a credit institution were granted stand
ing before 
the 
EU 
Courts to challenge an ECB decision to withdraw the 
banking 
licen
ce of 
that credit 
institution 
(joined cases C
-663/17 P, C
-665/17 P
 and C-669/17 P
, Trasta Komercbank
a and Others v ECB
). Following an appeal from the ECB, the 
CJEU 
had to rule for the 
first time on the admissibility of an action for annulment brought by shareholders of a 
credit institution against an ECB supervisory decision addressed to the 
credit 
institution i
n which they hold shares. 
The CJEU 
ruled that the decisi
on did
 not directly 
concern the shareholders for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article
 263 of the 
Treaty on the 
Functioning of the 
European 
Union
 and, consequently
, the action 
brought on their behalf 
was
 declared inadmissible.
 The 
CJEU 
also ruled
 that the action 
brought on behalf of Trasta 
Komercbanka 
by the legal representative of the former 
management should be considered admissible to comply with the right to an effective 
judicial protection as provide
d by 
Article
 47 of the Charter of 
Fundament
al 
Rights.
 The General Court ruled that an 
assessment 
by the ECB regarding 
whether a credit institution is failing 
or likely to fail is a preparatory act 
that 
cannot be challenged before 
the 
EU Courts
 The Court of Justice confirmed the 
ECB™s exclusive competence 
for the 
supervision of all credit institutions 
within the SSM
 The Court 
of Justice

 ECB opinions and cases of non
-compliance
 Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 
require that the ECB be consulted on any proposed EU or draft national legislation 
falling within its fields of competence
. All ECB opinions are published on the 
ECB™s 
website
. ECB opinions on proposed EU legislation are also published in the Official 
Journal of the European Union.
 In 201
9 the ECB adopted six opinions on proposed Union acts and 40 opinions on 
draft national legislation falling within its fields of competence.
 Eight
 cases of non
-compliance with the obligation to consult the ECB 
on draft national 
legislation were recorded, with 
seven
 cases being considered clear and important
65. 
The ECB was not consulted by: (i) the Bulgarian authorities on a law amending the 



the Italian authorities on a decree law on urgent fiscal matters and other urgent needs; 
(iii) the Lithuanian authorities on a law on corporate income tax 
for financial market 
participants; (iv) the Portuguese authorities on a law amending the bank secrecy rules 
in the context of parliamentary enquiry committees and determining the disclosure of 
operations involving the use of public funds in credit institut
ions
, 
and on a law 
reforming and extending the State™s Organisation and Information System (SOIS)
; (v) 



României; 
and (vi) the Swedish authorities on a law on the obligations of certain credit 
institutions and branches to provide cash services. 
No case of non
-compliance with 
the consultation obligation in respect of proposed U
nion legal acts was identi
fied.
 The ECB adopted opinions on EU proposals concerning a governance framework for 
the budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness for the euro area, the 
conclusion of the Agre
ement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the 
European Union, and the appointment of a new ECB President and new members of 
the ECB Executive Board.
 The ECB adopted opinions on draft national legislation concerning national central 
banks (NCBs), i
ncluding: reforms of the governance structures of the Nationale Bank 
van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique, the Central Bank of Cyprus, the Banca 


National Bank) in the Single Resolution Mechanism; the 
financial independence of the Central Bank of Cyprus; lobbying requirements 

the Banque centrale du Luxembourg in t
he protection of the euro against 
counterfeiting and the authentication of euro coins; the Central Bank of Malta™s 
oversight of payment services; freedom of information requirements applicable to De 
                                                                    65  Cases 
of non
-compliance
 include: (i) cases where a national authority failed to submit draft legislative 
provisions within the ECB™
s fields of competence for consultation to the ECB; and (ii) cases where a 
national authority formally consulted the ECB, but did not afford it sufficient time to examine the draft 
legislative provisions and to adopt its opinion prior to adoption of these 
provisions.
 Clear and important cases of 
non-consultation
 The ECB adopted opinions on 
proposed EU 
and national 
legislation
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  91 Nederlandsche Bank; the remuneration of executives and se
nior management of 
Narodowy Bank Polski; audit requirements applicable to the Banco de Portugal; the 
liability of Banka Slovenije for extraordinary measures regarding bank write
-downs; 
and the conferral of new tasks on NCBs regarding the supervision of mic
ro-credit 
lenders (the Bank of Greece), credit reference agencies (the Central Bank of Malta) 
and credit institutions™ compliance with requirements relating to the restructuring of 
Swiss franc
-denominated loans (Banka Slovenije).
 The ECB adopted opinions o
n draft national legislation concerning prudential and 
financial supervisory matters, including: the establishment of close cooperation 
arrangements between the ECB and Hrvatska narodna banka within the framework of 
the Single Supervisory Mechanism; reform
s of the institutional framework for banking 
and financial supervision in Austria, Latvia and Portugal; reforms of the institutional 
framework for macroprudential supervision in Portugal and Spain; reforms of the 
supervision of entities acquiring and selli
ng credit facilities (including non
-performing 
loans) in Cyprus, of micro
-credit providers in Greece and of credit reference agencies 
in Malta; and the exchange of information between the ECB and the Danish authorities 
in relation to anti
-money laundering.
 The ECB adopted opinions on draft national legislation concerning means of payment, 
including cash limitations in Greece
, Spain
 and the Netherlands
, the ban of the •500 
banknote in Denmark, and the expanded provision of cash services in Sweden.
 The ECB adopted opinions on draft national legislation concerning banking and 
financial regulation, including: the legal framework for covered bonds in Estonia; a 
guarantee scheme for securitisations of non
-performing loans originated by credit 
institution
s in Greece; the protection of primary residences in Greece and Ireland; 
restrictions on transfers of residential mortgage loans in Ireland and Poland; special 
taxes or levies applicable to banks and/or financial institutions in Lithuania, Romania 
and Slov
akia; macroprudential tools for residential mortgages in Luxembourg; 
requirements applicable to financial undertakings™ remuneration policies in the 
Netherlands; the interest rate benchmark for consumer credit agreements in Romania; 
and the restructuring o
f Swiss franc consumer loans in Slovenia. The ECB also issued 
opinions on the impact of draft national legislation in the cybersecurity field on market 
infrastructures and credit institutions in Cyprus and Spain.
 9.3
 Compliance with the prohibition of monetary
 financing and 
privileged access
 Pursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the 
ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the compliance of the EU national central 
banks (NCBs) with the prohibitions implied by Art
icles
 123 and 124 of the Treaty and 
Council Regulations (EC) Nos
 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article
 123 prohibits the ECB 
and the NCBs from providing overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility to 
governments and EU institutions or bodies, as well 
as from purchasing in the primary 
market debt instruments issued by these institutions. Article
 124 prohibits any 
measure, not based on prudential considerations, which establishes privileged access 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  92 by governments and EU institutions or bodies to financial
 institutions. In parallel with 
the Governing Council
 of the ECB
, the European Commission monitors Member 
States™ compliance with the above provisions.
 The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ secondary market purchases of debt 
instruments issued by the
 domestic public sector, the public sector of other Member 
States and EU institutions and bodies. According to the recitals of Council Regulation 
(EC) No
 3603/93, the acquisition of public sector debt instruments in the secondary 
market must not be used to
 circumvent the objective of Article
 123 of the Treaty. Such 
purchases should not become a form of indirect monetary financing of the public 
sector.
 The ECB™s monito
ring exercise conducted for 2019 confirmed that Articles
 123 and 
124 of the Treaty were in general respected.
 The monitoring exercise revealed that most NCBs in 2019 had remuneration policies 
for public sector deposits in place that fully complied with the
 remuneration ceilings. 
However, a few NCBs need to ensure that the remuneration rate for public sector 
deposits is not above the ceiling. 
 Following up on the concerns raised in the ECB™s Annual Reports as of 2014, the ECB 
has continued to monitor program
mes launched by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in 2014 
and 2015. In 2019 the Magyar Nemzeti Bank continued taking actions to alleviate the 
ECB™s concerns as regards the scope of its engagement in the Pallas Athéné Public 
Thinking Programme. The case should, howev
er, not serve as a precedent. The ECB 
will continue monitoring the involvement of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in the Budapest 
Stock Exchange as the purchase of the majority ownership of the Budapest Stock 
Exchange by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank in November 2015 ma
y still be seen as giving 
rise to monetary financing concerns.
 The Central Bank of Ireland™s reduction of assets related to the Irish Bank Resolution 
Corporation during 2019 through sales of long
-duration floating rate notes is a 
significant step in the di
rection of the necessary full disposal of these assets. 
Continued sales at an appropriate pace would further mitigate the persisting serious 
monetary financing concerns.
  The prohibitions laid down in Articles 
123 and 124 of the Treaty were in 
general respected
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  93 10 The ECB in
 an EU and
 international 
context
 In 2019 the ECB maintained its close dialo
gue with various European institutions, 
including the European Parliament which plays a key role in holding it accountable for 
its decisions. In international fora, the ECB engaged constructively in G20 discussions 
on the outlook for the global economy and
, at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
the ECB actively contributed to a European perspective on international monetary and 
financial system issues as well as on the IMF™s reviews of its policies under its 
surveillance and lending framework. The ECB c
ontinues to cooperate with and assist 
non-EU central banks across the world.
 10.1
 The ECB™s accountability to the public
 The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives a clear mandate to the 
ECB 
to maintain price stability in the euro area 
and s
tates that the ECB is independent 
in using 
the relevant instruments 
for this purpose
. 
The ECB™s mandate and 
independence
 were
 enshrined in the
 Treat
y through a democratic process. By being 
independent,
 the ECB is able to carry out its tasks free of political pressures and 
short
-term considerations
 that could divert it from fulfilling its mandate
. 
At the same 
time, 
accountability is the necessary counterpart to independence: to ensure the 
legitimacy of its decisions, the ECB has the obligation to explain them to the public and 
to their elected representatives. This is complemented by the
 judicial review
 of ECB 
decisi
ons by the Court of Justice of the European Union
. In other words, 
independence and accountability ensure respectively that the ECB 
can
 and does act 
in accordance with its mandate
. In an environment where central bank independence 
has received renewed atte
ntion, in 2019 s
everal speeches were delivered by 
ECB 
Executive Board 
members 
on the link between independence and accountability.
66 The European Parliament 
plays
 a central role in 
holding the ECB accountable. In 2019 
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament 
(ECON) 
held 
three of its 
regular hearings 
with
 the ECB President, including the first 
with
 Christine Lagarde
 (see Figure 3 below)
.67 In January 20
19 President 
Mario 
Draghi 
also attended the 
Parliament™s 
plenary debate on the ECB Annual Report 
2017, following which the European Parliament
 issued 
a resolution
. The ECB provided 
feedback
 on this resolution.
 In 2019, 28 
MEP 
letters containing 
written
 questions were 
sent
 to the ECB
, the replies to which were 
published on the 
ECB
™s website
, providing
 an opportunity to clarify the ECB
™s stance on a broad range of issues
. 
The ECB is held 
                                                                    66  In particular, Yves Mersch reflected on the 
principles of necessity, proportionality and probity with regard 
to central bank independence
 at the ECB and its Watchers XX
 conference in Frankfurt
 in March
. He also 
provided the 
ECB™s perspective on international trends 
in central bank independence
 during a roundtable 
discussion that took place in Frankfurt
 in November
. 67  For more information on the implications of Brexit, which was one of the issues discussed in the hearings, 
please refer to Box 11 below.
 Accountability is the necessary 
counterpart to independence
 The ECB is accountable to the 
European Parliament through 
multiple channels
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  94 accountable 
for its banking supervision activities by both the European Parliament and 
the EU Council
.68 Furthermore, the European Court of Auditors and the ECB have 
agreed a 
Memorandum of Understanding
 that establishes practical 
information
-sharing arrangements between the two institutions regarding audits on the 
ECB™s supervisory tasks.

, with more 
than 75%
 of respondents 
in favour of the single currency
. This trend is encouraging to 
the ECB, which will continue to strengthen its dialogue with the citizens and th
eir 
representatives.
 10.2
 International relations
 G20
 In 2019, G20 discussions under the Japanese Presidency focused on the outlook for 
the global economy and the policy measures that can be used to address a 
synchronised slowdown amid geopolitical uncertaintie
s, trade conflicts and 
diminishing room for manoeuvre for macroeconomic policies. Trade tensions were 
discussed in each G20 meeting, though with limited progress. While leaders shared
 concern
s about the risks to the global economy
, they were divided on a n
umber of 
topics, including the need for further action on climate change. The G20 continued its 
efforts to foster strong, sustainable, inclusive and balanced growth to improve the 
medium
-term economic outlook. The group acknowledged progress in the financi
al 
regulatory reform agenda but also identified challenges still to be addressed, including 
                                                                    68  More detailed information is provided i

fostered
 considerable progress

 The G20 also followed up on the report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global 
Financial Governance (EPG) entitled ﬁ
Making th
e Global Financial System Work 
for 
All
ﬂ, with a focus in 2019 on development issues. 
Work is continuing under the current 
G20 Presidency.
 Among the EPG proposals, those for improving global financial 
resilience are of particular interest to the ECB.
 Policy
 issues related to the IMF and the international financial 
architecture
 The ECB continued to play an active role in discussions about the international 
monetary and financial system at the IMF and in other fora, promoting the central bank 
perspective in co
mmon European positions. A key topic of debate in 2019 was the 
Fund™s resources. The ECB supports an adequately resourced IMF as a core 
component of the global financial safety net. In October 2019 the IMF membership 
endorsed a package of actions on IMF re
sources and governance reform, as part of 
which the membership expressed its support for maintaining the current level of 
resources through a doubling of the New Arrangements to Borrow and a further 
temporary round of bilateral borrowing beyond 2020. The p
ackage of actions needs to 
be implemented in the course of 2020 to avoid a decrease in IMF resources. The IMF™s 
Executive Board proposed to its Board of Governors a resolution concluding the 15th 
General Review of Quotas without a quota increase, which was
 adopted in February 
2020. The 16th General Review of Quotas, which will conclude by mid
-December 2023, 
will revisit the adequacy of quotas and continue the process of IMF governance reform.
 The IMF continued a number of important reviews of policies under
 its surveillance 
and lending framework. First, it concluded its latest review of conditionality and the 
design of Fund
-supported programmes, for which a 
report
 by the Int
ernational 
Relations Committee of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) helped shape 
the European position. 
The 
review 
recommended that 
programme 
conditionality 
should 
be more realis
tic
, gradual
 and parsimon
ious, with sharper debt sustainability 
analysis, while ensuring strong
 national ownership
 and recognising country
-specific 
circumstances
. 
Second, there was progress on the 
debt sustainability framework 
review 
for market access countrie
s, i.e. countries with 
significant access to 
international capit
al markets
. Third, the IMF also started the quinquennial 
comprehensive surveillance 
review
 and the
 review of
 the 
Financial Sector 
Assessment Program
. International central bank cooperation
 The ECB continued to cooperate with non
-EU central banks across the globe. This 
reflects the global interest in ECB views, analytical frameworks and working processes. 
Staff
-level discussions, also involving policymakers, covered core tasks of the ECB as 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  96 well as technical and governance issues. Relations with key African, Asian and Latin 
American central banks were further developed based on existing bilateral Memoranda 
of Understanding, while cooperation with regional organisations and the IMF continued 
under the existing arrangements. In addition, a Eurosystem high
-level policy dialogue 
with central banks from Latin America took place in Colombia in November.
 The ECB continue
d to 
contribute to
 the EU enlargement process as an EU institution 
through targete
d discussions with central banks in countries in the Western Balkan 
region that 
are working towards
 joining the EU. A regional workshop series serves as 
the main platform
 for this
, where discussions are organised in close collaboration with 
EU 
national cen
tral banks
 where possible. In addition, an EU
-funded programme was 
launched in March 
2019 to the benefit of these central banks. It aims to strengthen 
central bank capacities in the Western Balkans
, with a view 
to the integration of these 
central banks int
o the ESCB
. Box 11
  Implications of Brexit
 While not party to the negotiations, the ECB has been following Brexit developments closely and 
assessing the risks to the euro area economy and financial system posed by all possible scenarios.
 The 
ECB acted to e
nsure its operational preparedness ahead of the initially foreseen end date of the 
Article 50 process, i.e. 29 March 2019, as well as ahead of the end dates of multiple extensions to the 
Article 50 process (12 April 2019, 31 October 2019 and 31 January 202
0).
 Following the U
nited 
Kingdom
™s orderly withdrawal 
from the European Union 
on 31 January
 2020, the 
ECB has been 
focusing on monitoring 
the negotiations around the future 
EU-UK 
relationship
 and assessing the 
consequences of Brexit for the EU financial se
ctor, in particular as regards the need to complete the 
capital markets union.
 The analysis in the 
May
 and 
November
 2019 editions of the ECB Financial Stability Review
 discussed 
the risks stemming from a potential no
-deal Brexit scenario
, 
and the 
extent to which the
 private sector 
was 
prepar
ed for such an event
. In the area of banking supervision, the ECB and national supervisors have continued to communicate 
supervisory expectations on Brexit
-related issues, assessed banks™ operational readiness for a 
no-deal scenario, completed the majority of 
the Brexit
-related authorisation procedures and 
monitored the implementation of banks™ Brexit plans (see the 
2019 ECB Annual Report
 on supervisory activities
). In March 2019, the Bank of England decided to offer to lend euro to UK banks in weekly operations on 
the basis of the standing swap line with the ECB. In a related 
press release
 the Eurosystem stated its 
readiness to lend pound sterling to euro area banks, should the need arise. So far, these pound 
sterling lending operati
ons have not been activated by the ECB. At his September 2019 European 
Parliament hearing, ECB President Mario Draghi emphasised the continuous cooperation between 
the ECB and the Bank of England in addressing all contingencies, including a no
-deal Brexit.
 The situation at the cut
-off date for data in this report was that a withdrawal agreement had been 
ratified by both parties, leading to the initiation of a transition period
.

  97 11 Enhancing communication
 Communication is a core element of the ECB™s policy toolbox. Providing financial 
market experts with information about its current policy stance and the e
xpected path 
for future decisions has bolstered the effectiveness of ECB policies. There is broad 
evidence that the ECB™s communication with financial markets and experts is 
successful.
 The new frontier in central bank communication is engagement with the 
general public. Central banks, including the ECB, need to be better understood by the 
people whom they ultimately serve. This is key to rebuilding people™s trust in the ECB, 
especially against the backdrop of increased public scrutiny and controversial deb
ates 
over its policy decisions.
 With the change in the leadership of the ECB during 2019, the 
bank™s communication 
to audiences beyond the traditional group of experts and financial market specialists 
received renewed impetus. The ECB invested in further e
nhancing its 
communications, so as to make itself better understood and to explain why its actions 
matter to people and their lives. It also built further on its efforts to reach out to groups 
in society that had not traditionally been the focus of ECB com
munications, such as 
young people or civil society organisations, and started to listen more attentively to 
people™s concerns. Looking ahead, there is great potential in connecting the ECB to 
the topics that are of particular concern to people, such as ine
quality, digital currencies 
or climate change 
Œ and in providing clearer answers on how the ECB can contribute, 
within the limits of its mandate, in these areas.
 Communication will also be a key 
element of the ECB™s monetary policy strategy review.
 11.1
 Innovat
ion in ECB communications
 In order to reach out to broader and younger audiences, the ECB use
s innovative 
forms of communication.
 For instance, in early 2019, as part of the initiatives marking the 20th anniversary of 
the euro, the ECB launched a campaign 
in cooperation with the popular app 
QuizClash. The #EUROat20 competition aimed 
to
 rais
e awareness and 
understanding of the ECB™s mission, especially among young people. Over 1.6 million 
people across the European Union took part in the quiz, engaging with 
and learning 
about 
issues related to the euro and the ECB
 through
 playful interaction.
 ﬁThe ECB needs to listen and 
understand the people. Bec
ause a 
currency is after all a public good 
that belongs to the people.ﬂ
 Œ President 
Christine Lagarde
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  98 The #EUROat20 competition on the QuizClash app
   While the campaign was a great success in terms of its reach, it also revealed certain 
misconceptions and knowledge gaps in relation to the ECB™s institutional set
-up and 
mission. This showed that the ECB needs to
 fill these gaps by
 connect
ing
 its work to 
topics that people are interested in, using simple, relatable messages.
 In September 
2019 a new one
-minute ﬁECB explainsﬂ video series was launched 
in which
 ECB 
staffers explain, in simple and accessible language, particular topics, such as 
crypto
-assets
 or 
accountability
, and describe 
why
 their work matters to people. The 
series runs on the ECB™s Instagram account, itself an innovation 
aimed at
 increasing
 understanding of the ECB among broader audiences, which reached the one
-year 
mark in 2019.
 In September 2019 the ECB also launched 
the m
onthly 
ECB Podcast
. 
Given
 the 
rapidly increasing popularity of podcasts, this presents an opportunity for the ECB to 
connect with new audiences, engaging in in
-depth disc
ussions on key issues relevant 
to the ECB, while also allowing for a more
 informal tone
. During 2019 
an effort was made in 
ECB communication
s to address topics and trends 
beyond core monetary policy which are important for the ECB and matter to people in 
the euro area. In May, 
for example, 
the ECB 
published
 a webpage on climate change
. The webpage contains information on the ECB™s actions to mitigate climate change, 
listing intern
al initiatives as well as relevant publications
 (see also Box
 3). The ECB™s aim to communicate 
with
 non-expert audiences also 
foresees
 an increase 
in the use of national languages
 in order
 to 
foster a closer connection with

  ECB Annual Report 2019
  99 With Christi
ne Lagarde™s arrival as ECB President in November 2019 the 
bank™s digital 
footprint and outreach expanded markedly. 
For instance, o
n Twitter and LinkedIn, 
where the ECB already had an institutional presence, 
Christine Lagarde™s personal 
accounts more than 
doubled the ECB™s reach 
to over
 2.5
 million followers
. 
Furthermore,
 Ms Lagarde™s presence on the Chinese platform Weibo 
added yet 
another
 5.8
 million followers. These accounts serve as powerful amplifiers for the 
ECB™s efforts to make itself understood.

 Analytics to enhance the impact of ECB communications
 For ECB communication
s to be effective and achieve the desired impact, it is essential 
to better understand wh
o the target audiences are, what resonates with them, and 
what the most useful channels are to reach them. In addition, deeper analysis of the 
entire communications process is needed, i.e. 
analysis of 
what happens between the 
sending and the receiving of c
entral bank communication
s, 
of 
the related dynamics 
and feedback mechanisms, and 
of 
the role of intermediaries 
such as the
 media or 
financial markets. Finally, through advanced analytics, the ECB can 
gain
 robust 
insights 
into
 the performance of its own com
munications efforts, 
finding out 
whether its 
messages do in fact 
ﬁget through
ﬂ and lead to a change i
n attitudes and greater trust.
 In 2019
 the ECB intensified its internal research and analytics activities and expanded 
its 
external research collaboration.
 In order to gain insights into how its communication
s resonate with the general public, 
in particular
 with younger p
eople, the ECB launched a 
focus group study among 
participants aged
 18 to 35 years 
in six euro area countries. Besides assessing 
awareness, knowledge and perception of the ECB among young people, the research 
also aimed to identify topics of interest with 
regard to economic, financial and social 
issues, as well as preferred ways of engagement. The findings s
uggest
 that young 
people not only have 
a very superficial understanding of the ECB but also 
a limited
 interest in economic and financial matters
. They f
ind 
issues like climate change and 
social responsibility more relevant. 
The research also indicated that 
the majority of 
young people 
prefer to engage with the ECB via 
social media
, which 
Œ together with 
their 
own social networks (word
 of mouth)
 Œ are thei
r main source
s of inf
ormation.
 In evaluating its own communications efforts, the ECB 
also 
tested and analysed how 
best to present information 
across digita
l platforms.
 For 
example, it
 pursu
ed a ﬁlayered
ﬂ approach to its publications, whereby the publication of key 
ECB reports 
is complemented by landing page
s on the ECB™s website and social media campaigns, 
making 
findings more accessible, visual and eas
y to digest. The results
 provide
 empirical
 evidence that
 this approach
 is a success
, as it induces more people to 
access the actual publication and
, once they access it,
 to spend 50% more time 
reading
 it. Such insights are the basis for future, adapted comm
unication
s. On Twitter and LinkedIn, Christine 
Lagarde™s accounts more than 
doubled the ECB™s reach to over 2.5 
million followers

   In expanding and deepening 
its
 research efforts 
regarding 
central bank 
communicati
on, the
 ECB initiated, and is co
-chairing, a 
Research and Policy Network 
on Central 
Bank 
Communication
, established within the framework of 
the Centre for 
Economic Policy Research
 (see also Section
 8.1)
. In 
October 2019 
the ECB hosted 
a two
-day 
workshop
 of the network which 
brought together communications 
practitioners from
 the ECB and other central banks, financial market analyst
s, 
journalists, and academics from a variety of disciplines, such as economics, 
psychology
 and sociology. Discussions focused on the risks and opportunities 
involved in
 communicating with the wider 
public, the boundaries of central bank 
transparency, and the changing role of the media as intermediaries of central bank 
communication. In this context, 
in October 2019 
the ECB 
was 
the first
 Œ and is as yet
 the 
only 
Œ central bank
 to
 make available a precompiled, easy
-to
-use and regularly 
updated 
dataset
 comprising 
all speeches of 
its 
policymakers. By providing 
the
 dataset, 
the ECB intends to incentivise and facili
tate novel research on its communications, for 
instance through text analysis.

  101 12 Organisation and good governance
 The 
ECB is 
an EU institution at the heart of the Eurosystem and the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism. More than 3,500 staff from all over Europe wor
k for the ECB. 
The ECB is committed to inspiring and engaging its people and to their development, 
and in 2019 it 
continued its efforts to foster diversity and inclusion as key drivers of 
impr
oved organisational performance.
 Moreover, the ECB further stren
gthened its
 commitment to the highest level of 
integrity and governance standards. T
he entry into 
force of its 
Single
 Code of Conduct for high
-level EC
B officials on 1 January 2019
 was 
a milestone in this respect. Last but not least, in 2019 the ECB proudl
y celebrated t
he 20th anniversary of the euro
, the currency of 340 million Europeans
 (see Box 12).
 12.1
 Unlocking excellence through leadership, 
inclusion and 
people development
 Fostering diverse teams and inclusive behaviour is vital to ensur
ing
 the ECB can 
deliver the best possible outcomes for its staff and for the EU. That is why diversity, 
respect, an ethical culture and the well
-being of its staff are strategic objectives for the 
ECB.
 In 201
9 the ECB continued its efforts to foster diversity and inclusion as key drivers of 
improved organisational performance. The ECB has a number of
 long
-standing 
diversity networks
 that engage frequently with Human Resources and aim to serve the 
needs of all aspects of diversity.
 In 2019 a new network was fo
unded called 
DiversAbility, the ECB™s professional network for those with long
-term health
-related 
impairments and those who support them.
 At the level
 of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
, the ECB 
conti
nues to conduct
 exchanges with 
national central banks
 and national supervisory authorities
 regarding best practices in 
diversity and inclusion, an example of which was the 
fourth
 annual meeting of the 
ESCB/SSM Diversity Network
, hosted by the Bundesbank in
 Eltville am Rhein in 
September 2019
. The ECB also participated in a summit on gender diversity in May 
2019, joining the Human Resources heads of the G7 central banks 
along with 
colleagues from across the ESCB/SSM 
and from 
the 
International Monetary Fund.
 In 2019 the ECB™s comprehensive programme of 
inclusion 
activities included 
for the 
first time 
participating in Frankfurt™s Christopher Street Day (Pride) 
parade 
and holding 
events to mark the International Day of People with Disabilities, Coming Out Day an
d the 
International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust
. 
Regular highlights on the ECB calendar included events held to mark the International 
Women™s Day and the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia 
and Tr
ansphobia (IDAHOBIT).
 Diversity and inclusion are key 
drivers of improved organisational 
perfo
rmance
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  102 The ECB is continuing to work towards 
achieving a more gender
-balanced working 
environment and in 2019 was independently assessed in this area, receiving in 
February an ASSESS level (level 1) 
Economic Dividends for Gender Equality 
(ED
GE) 
Certification, which recognises the ECB™s commitment to fostering gender equality in 
the workplace.
 To improve
 gender balance, the ECB™s Executive Board 
had set targets for the end of 
2019. At the end of 
the year
, 30.3%
 of management positions were hel
d by women, 
compared with a target of 35%. For senior management roles, the share was
 30.8%,
 against a target of 28% 
(see Table 2).
 The overall share of female staff at the ECB at 
all levels 
was 45.3%.
 See Box 10 in Chapter 8 for information on gender bala
nce in 
career progression at the ECB.

 Notes: The share
 of female staff is measured based on 
staff holding permanent and fixed
-term positions. Data as at 1
 January
 2020. In order to attract diverse talent, in 2019 the ECB redesigned its vacancy notices to be 
more inclusive by explicitly encouraging candidates 
to apply 
irrespective of 
age, 
disability, ethnicity, 
gender, gender identity, 
religion, 
sexual orientation 
or other 
characteristics
. The ECB also continued to reach out to candidates via inclusive 
recruitment platforms, including participating in Sticks & 
Stones, Europe™s largest 
LGBT+ career fair, and the European Women in Tech Conference.
 The ECB is committed to the growth and development of its staff and has consistently 
offered a wide range of learning and development opportunities to support them in 
facing the challenges of a constantly changing world. Over the last year the ECB 
worked at the 
ESCB/SSM level
 to develop a cohesive system
-wide strategy for 
learning and development in order to support its talent across the system in delivering 
for Europe. 
This builds upon existing local learning initiatives
 which have been open to 
colleagues
 throughout the 
ESCB and SSM, and aims to foster a
 learning culture that 
links learning 
and development with productivity, capability and efficiency
. Leaders play a centr
al role in enhancing the performance of both individuals and 
teams for the benefit of the organisation. With this in mind, the ECB successfully ran a 
modular Leadership Growth Programme over the last few years, which came to an 
end in November 2019. The pr
ogramme engaged with more than 600 leaders at all 
levels, including non
-managerial team leads, with the aim of strengthening leadership 
behaviours
 and thereby
 improv
ing
 organisational performance
 and b
uild
ing
 strong 
teams around
 a shared vision, purpose an
d aspiration to create 
a stronger
 ECB
. In 2019 the ECB performed a fundamental review of how it supports the professional 
growth of its staff, the result of which was the implementation of a new comprehensive 
career framework. The framework comprises new methods for promoting staff and 
changes 
to the processes and policies that facilitate and incentivise mobility 
     
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  103 (i.e.
 changing roles within the bank or gaining experience outside the bank) as an 
opportunity for growth. These changes position the ECB as an employer of choice, 
whilst maintaining st
aff engagement and supporting the development of the 
individuals who make up the ECB.
 12.2
 Further strengthening integrity and governance standards
 With the entry into force of its 
Single Code of Conduct for high
-level ECB 
officials
 (the 
ﬁSingle Codeﬂ)
 on 1 January 2019, the ECB reconfirmed its commitment to the highest 
level of integrity and governance standards. Introducing specific rules fo
r post
-employment activities, private financial transactions and relations with interest 
groups, the Single Code also 
obliges 
all members of high
-level ECB bodies
 to
 publish 
their monthly calendars 
(as of January 2019) 
and on an 
annual basis to
 submit thei
r signed Declaration
s of Interests to the Ethics Committee for assessment and 
subsequent publication on the ECB™s website.
 The Ethics Committee
69, moreover
, advises members of high
-level ECB bodies on any 
other questions of professional ethics
, in particula
r with 
regard to 
post
-employment 
activities and gainful occupational activities of family members
70. 
Commensurate with 
the increasing relevance of matters relating to good conduct and good governance the 
ECB introduced, f
or all incoming and 
outgoing
 members
 of high
-level ECB bodies, 
dedicated 
on-boarding and end
-of-term meetings with the ECB™s Chief Compliance 
and Governance Officer
 to address 
obligations stemming from the Single Code
. The cooperation among euro area central banks and national supervisory au
thorities 
via the 
Ethics and Compliance Officers
™ Task Force (ECTF)
 gained further momentum 
in 2019. The ECTF developed into a hub for information exchange and a forum 
supporting coherent implementation of the Single Code across the Eurosystem and 
European
 banking supervision. With a view to generating additional reciprocal 
learning opportunities, the ECTF organised thematic sessions 
with external 
counterparts including the UN Ethics Office
, the Office of the European Ombudsman
 and the European Court of Aud
itors
, with the latter
 presenting its report 
on the ethical 
frameworks of select
ed audited EU institutions
. As regards members of staff, 
in 2019 
the annual compliance check of their private 
financial transactions covered a random sample consisting of 10% o
f all staff
, 
including 
the ECB members of ECB high
-level bodies. In addition, the ECB followed 
the advice of its external service provider 
and conduct
ed an ad
 hoc compliance check 
in 2019, which concentrated on a specific group of staff members.
 In accorda
nce with
 its 
mandate
, the ECB™s Audit Committee continued to assist the 
Governing Council in its tasks and responsibilities related to 
the integrity of financial 
information; the oversight of internal controls; the compliance with applicable laws, 
                                                                    69  In summer 2019 Mr Patrick Honohan succeeded Mr
 Jean
-Claude Trichet as C
hairman of the Ethics 
Committee.
 70  See 
Decision (EU) 2015/433 of the European Central Bank of 17 December 2014 concerning the 
establishment of an Ethics Committee and its Rules of Procedure (
ECB/2014/59
). The m
onthly calendars and 
Declarations of Interests of all 
high
-level officials are published on 
the ECB™s 
website
      
  ECB Annual Report 2019
  104 regulations and codes of conduct; and the performance of audit functions. 
In 2019 the 
Audit Committee
 focused in particular on cyber risks, 
on the 
adequacy
 of the 
Eurosystem™s financial risk management framework and on 
incentivising 
a proactive 
approach when monitoring 
the follow
-up to
 audit recommendations.
 Guided by the 
principles of
 transparen
cy and accountability, 
the members of 
the 
ECB™s 
hig
h-level bodies 
maintain regular contacts and interaction with
 the public as 
well as specialised audiences
 from 
the public
 and private sector
s, academia, interest 
groups
 and representative associations. 
These dialogues and debates 
take place 
under 
a well
-established and public 
framework
 that guarantees a robust level of 
transparency and 
good governance
. In 2019 the ECB responded to 113 public access requ
ests from EU citizens and gave 
access to over 200 documents (some of which were partially disclosed).
 Furthermore, as part of
 its continuous commitment to good governance and 
transparency, 
in 
2019 the ECB decided to 
introduce a new policy under which the 
documents from the Committee of Governors and the European Monetary Institute 
Œ predating the establishment of the ECB in June 1998
 Œ would be declared as historical
 records
, thus making it easier for the general public to access them.

0 On 1 January 2019 our common currency, the euro, celebrated its 20th anniversary. Twenty years 
before, on 1 January 1999, 11 countries of the European Union (EU) fixed their exchange rates and 
adopted a shared monetary policy, the conduct of which was en
trusted to the ECB. The euro started 
as an electronic currency, used 
for cashless payments 
and by financial markets. Euro banknotes and 
coins entered into circulation three years later, on 1 January 2002. 
Today, the euro is the currency of 
19 EU countries 
and over 340 million Europeans.

(Eurobarometer 
survey, November 2019
). 
 20 years of the common currency
 The EU countries that adopted the euro on 1 January 1999, and those that joined subsequently, have 
travelled a long way together. The last 20 years were exceptional for the euro area. 
The first 
decad
e could be seen as
 the culmination of a 30
-year upswing in the global financial cycle
. T
he second
 decade, by contrast,
 saw the wo

s since the 1930s
 Œ first a 
global 
financial crisis, 
then
 a sovereign debt crisis. 
 The Europea
n project including 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
 is a process that is evolving 
over time
. 
Taking a closer look at the 
economic structures 20 years into the euro
, it c
an be argued that 
the global financial and sovereign debt crises revealed the resilience of the euro area™s economic 
structures. Significant efforts were made by countries in the euro area to react to the crisis and to 
strengthen this resilience. Crisis mo
mentum was also used to strengthen EMU. In particular, the 
establishment of European banking supervision was a major achievement. However, EMU is still

benefit 
of all Europeans.

 1.1
 Purpose of the ECB™s management report
 The management report
1 is an integral part of the ECB™s Annual Accounts and is 
designed to provide readers with contextual information related to the 
financial 
statements.
2 Given that the ECB™s activities and operations are undertaken in support 
of its policy objectives, 
the 
ECB™s
 financial position and result should be viewed in 
conj
unction with its policy actions.
 To this end, the management report presents the ECB™s key activities and operations
, as well as
 their impact on its financial statements. Furthermore, it analyses the main 
developments in the Balance Sheet and 
the 
Profit and Loss Account
 during the year
 and includes information on the ECB™s financial resources. Finally
, it describes 
the risk 
environment 
in which the ECB operates, providing information on the financial
 and operational risks 
to 
which the ECB is exposed, 
and the risk management
 policies used 
to mitigate risks.
 1.2
 Activities 
The ECB is part of the Eurosystem, which has the primary objective 
of maintaining
 price stability. The ECB™s main tasks, as described in
 the Statute of the ESCB,
3 comprise the implementation of the monetary policy of the euro area, the conduct of 
foreign exchange operations, the management of the official foreign reserves of the 

euro area countries and the promotion of the smooth operation
 of payment systems.
 The ECB is 
also 
responsible for the effective and consistent functioning of the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), with a view to carrying out intrusive and effective 

banking supervision, contributing to the safety and soundness of th
e banking system 

and the stability of the financial system.
 The Eurosystem™s monetary policy operations are 
recorded
 in the financial statements 
of the ECB and of the euro area national central banks (
NCBs
), reflecting 
the principle 
of decentralised implementation of monetary policy in the Eurosystem. 
Table
 1 
below 
provides an overview of the main operations and functions of the ECB in pursuit of its 
mandate, and their impact on the ECB™s financial statements.

 The ECB™s key activities and their impact on its financial statements
 Implementation of monetary policy
 Standard monetary policy operations in euro
 Liquidity
-providing operations in foreign currency
 Monetary policy operations conducted with the standard set of 
instruments (i.e. open market operations, standing facilities and 
minimum reserve requirements for credit institutions) are 
implemented in a decentralised manner by the NCBs of the 
Eurosystem. A
ccordingly, these operations are not reflected in the 
ECB
™s financial statements.
 The ECB acts as an intermediary between non
-euro area central 
banks and the Eurosystem
 NCBs by means of swap transactions 
aimed at offering short
-term foreign currency funding to 
Eurosystem counterparties.
 These operations are recorded in the balance sheet items 
ﬁLiabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ and 
ﬁOther claims 
within the Eurosystemﬂ or ﬁOther liabilities within 
the Eurosystemﬂ and have no impact on the ECB™s Profit and 
Loss Account.
 Securities held for monetary policy purposes
 Securities lending
 Purchases of these securities are conducted by the ECB and 
the 
NCBs of the Eurosystem and are recorded under the balance 
sheet item ﬁSecurities held for monetary policy purposesﬂ. The 
securities currently held are accounted for at amortised cost, 
subject to impairment.
 Coupon accruals and amortised premiums and discou
nts are 
included in the Profit and Loss Account on a net basis under either 
ﬁOther interest incomeﬂ or ﬁOther interest expenseﬂ, depending on 
whether the net amount is positive or negative.
 Securities held for monetary policy purposes are available for 
len
ding by the Eurosystem.
1 For the ECB, these operations are 
conducted via specialised institution
s. These operations are 
recorded in the balance sheet items ﬁOther liabilities to euro area 
credit institutions denominated in euroﬂ and ﬁLiabilities to 
non-eur
o area residents denominated in euroﬂ if collateral is 
provided in the form of cash and this cash is still uninvested. 
Otherwise, the related securities lending operations are recorded 
in off
-balance
-sheet accounts.
 Conduct of foreign exchange operations 
and management of the official foreign reserves of the euro area countries
 Foreign exchange operations and management of foreign reserves
 The ECB™s foreign reserves are presented on
 the B
alance 
Sheet, mainly under ﬁGold and gold receivablesﬂ, ﬁClaims on 
non-euro area 
residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁClaims on euro area residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ, ﬁLiabilities to 
euro area 
residents denominated in foreign currencyﬂ and ﬁLiabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in forei
gn currencyﬂ. Foreign 
exchange transactions are reflected in off
-balance
-sheet accounts until the settlement date.
 Net interest income, including coupon accruals and amortised premiums and discounts, is included in the Profit and Loss Accou
nt 
under the ite
m ﬁInterest income on foreign reserve assetsﬂ.
 Unrealised price and exchange rate losses exceeding previously recorded unrealised gains on the same items, 
and realised gains and 
losses arising from the sale of foreign reserves, are also included in the Pro
fit and Loss Account under the items ﬁWrite
-downs on 
financial assets and positionsﬂ and ﬁRealised gains/losses arising from financial operationsﬂ respectively. Unrealised gains 
are 
recorded on
 the B
alance 
Sheet under the item ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ.
 Prom
otion of the smooth operation of payment systems
 Payment systems (TARGET2)
 Intra
-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis
-à-vis the ECB arising from TARGET2
2 are presented together on the Balance Sheet 
of the ECB as a single net asset or liability position. The
se 
balances
 are remunerated at the latest available rate on the main 
refinancing operations
 and the 
related
 interest
 is included in the Profit and Loss 
Account under the items ﬁOther interest incomeﬂ and 
ﬁOther interest expenseﬂ.
 Contributing to the safety and soundness of the banking system and the stability of the financial system
 Banking supervision 
Œ the Single Supervisory Mechanism
 The annual 
expenses of the ECB in relation to its supervisory tasks are recovered via annual supervisory fees levied on the supervised 
entities. The supervisory fees are included in the Profit and Loss Account under the heading ﬁNet income from fees and commis
sionsﬂ.
 Furthermore, the ECB is entitled to impose administrative penalties on supervised entities for failure to comply with obligat
ions under 
EU banking prudential regulation (including ECB supervisory decisions). The related income is recorded in the Profit an
d Loss Account 
under the heading ﬁNet income from fees and commissionsﬂ.

 Own funds portfolio
 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the total value of 
euro banknotes in circulation. This share is backed by claims on 
the NCBs, which bear interest at the rate on the main refinancing 
operations. This interest is included in the Profit and Loss A
ccount 
under the item ﬁInterest income arising from the allocation of euro 
banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ.
 Expenses arising from the cross
-border transportation of euro 
banknotes between banknote printing works and NCBs, for the 
delivery of new banknotes
, and between NCBs, for the 
compensation of shortages with surplus stocks, are borne 
centrally by the ECB. These expenses are presented in the Profit 
and Loss Account under the heading ﬁBanknote production 
servicesﬂ.
 The own funds portfolio of the ECB is p
resented on
 the
 Balance 
Sheet, mainly under the item ﬁOther financial assetsﬂ.
 Net interest income, including coupon accruals and amortised 
premiums and discounts, is included in the Profit and Loss Account 
under ﬁOther interest incomeﬂ and ﬁOther interest
 expenseﬂ.
 Unrealised price losses exceeding previously recorded 
unrealised price gains on the same items, 
and realised gains and 
losses arising from the sale of securities, are also included in the 
Profit and Loss Account under the items ﬁWrite
-downs on 
financial assets and positionsﬂ and ﬁRealised gains/losses arising 
from financial operationsﬂ respectively. Unrealised price gains are 
recorded on

 Balance 
Sheet
 The 
ECB™s Balance Sheet 
expanded significantly in the period 2015
-2018 due the 
acquisition
 of securities under the asset purchase programme (APP)
4. In 2019
 the
 ECB™s total assets
 increased by 
•10.0 billion
 to •
457.1 billion
. This 
increase was mainly 
due to 
(i) 
the rise 
in the market value of the ECB
™s foreign reserve 
assets
, owing
 to the increase in the price of gold
 and the appreciation of the US dollar 
and the Japanese yen vis
-à-vis the euro during
 the year
, and (ii) 
the rise 
in the 
value of 
euro banknotes in circulation.

 Financial resources
 The ECB™s financial 
resources consist of
 its
 capital, 
the 
general risk provision, 
the 
revaluation accounts and the 
profit
 for the year.
 These financial resources
 are 
(i)
 invested in assets that generate income and/or (ii)
 used to directly offset losses 
materialising from fina
ncial risks. 
As at 3
1 December
 2019, the 
ECB™s financial 
resources
 totalled 
•47.7 billion (see Chart
 9). 
This 
was 
•5.7 billion 
higher
 than in 
2018, mainly 
owing to 
an increase in 
the revaluation accounts
 following the 
depreciation of the euro

 The 
profit
 resulting from the ECB™s assets and liabilities in a given financial year 
can
 be 
used to absorb potential losse
s incurred in the same year. In 
2019 the 
ECB™s 
profit 
was 
•2.4 billion, 
•0.8 billion
 higher 
than in 
2018. In view of 
its
 exposure to financial risks 
(see
 Section
 1.4.1
 ﬁFinancial risks
ﬂ), the ECB 
maintains a 
provision for 
financial
 risks.
 The size of this provision is reviewed 
annually, taking a range of factors into account, including the level of holdings of 
risk
-bearing assets, 
the 
projected results for the coming year and a risk assessment. 
The risk provision, together with any amount 
held in the ECB™s general reserve fund, 
may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs. 
Following the 
five
-yearly adjustment of the key for subscription to the ECB™s capital as at 1 January 
2019 and the resulting reduction in the wei
ghtings of the euro area NCBs in the 
subscribed capital of the ECB, and taking into account the results of the assessment of 
the ECB™s exposures to financial risks, the Governing Council decided to release 
•84 million from the ECB™s provision for financial
 risks in order to comply with 
its
 maximum 
permitted level of 
•7.5 billion
, which 
is equal to 
the 
value of the capital paid up by the 
euro area NCBs
. The 
ECB™s capital
 paid
 up by euro area and non
-euro area NCBs stood at 
•7.7 billion 
on 3
1 December
 2019, 
•81 million 
lower 
than 
at the end of 2018
. This reduction 
was 
a result of 
the five
-yearly adjustment of the
 ECB™s
 capital key that entered 
into 
force on 1 
January 2019
 and resulted in a decrease 
in the weighting of the euro area NCBs (with 
fully paid
-up su
bscriptions)
. In 2020 
the
 shares of the NCBs in the capital of the ECB 
will 
change 
owing
 to 
the 
departure of the 
United Kingdom from the European Union 
and the 
consequent 
withdrawal of the Bank of England from the 
European System of Central Banks 
(ESCB
). The ECB™s subscribed capital 
will 
remain unchanged
, as the share of 
the 
Bank of England in the ECB™s subscribed capital
 will be

and non

Account
 Over 
th
e period 
2015-19 the 
annual 
profit of the ECB 
has gradually increased 
from
 around
 •1.1 billion to 
around 
•2.4 billion
 (see Chart 11),
 mainly 
due to higher interest 
income generated 
on foreign reserve assets
 and on securities held for 
monetary policy 
purposes, which 
more than offset 
a decline in interest income on banknotes in 
circulation
11 and on the own funds portfolio.
 In 201
9 the 
ECB™s profit
 was 
•2,366 million (201
8: •
1,575 million). 
The increase of 
•790 million compared with 
2018 was due to
 both 
an increase in
 net interest income
 and better
 results from financial operations

 Œ Management report
  14 Net interest income generated on securities held for monetary policy purposes
 in 2019 was •1,
447 million, which 
was
 •212 million higher 
than in 
2018 (see 
Chart
 14). Net interest income arising from APP securities increased by •
316 million 
to •
1,13
6 million
. This increase 
stemmed 
mainly from the PSPP portfolio 
owing 
to 
the 
higher average holdings and average yield of the portfolio during the year compared to 
2018. 
In particular, t
he average yield of the portfolio 
has 
increased 
in 
the last two years 
as a result of (i) the higher
-yield securities acquired throughout 2018 compa
red to the 
historical average yield of the portfolio and (ii) 
the reinvestment of 
the 
principal 
payments 
in 2019 
at a higher yield
 than 
that of 
the 
redeemed 
securities
. 
At the same 
time
, yields on 
euro area sovereign bond
s remained low on average in 
2019 (see 
Chart
 15). 
The increased net interest income from APP securities more than
 offset 
the
 reduction in net interest income on the SMP, CBPP1 and CBPP2 portfolios, which fell 
by •
104 million to •
311
 million, owing to the decline in the size of these portfo
lios as a 
result of the maturing of securities. In 
2019 securities 
held

purposes generated around 
54% of t

total operating expenses
 of the ECB, including depreciation and b
anknote 
producti
on services, increased by •
42 million to •1,
156 million (see Chart

The 
increase compared to 
2018 is mainly due to 
higher 
staff 
costs
 as a result of
 (i) 
the 
higher 
average number of staff in 2019
, predominately 
in banking supervision
, and (ii) 
the 
higher expense in relation to other long
-term benefits
, mainly 
owing to the
 lower 
discount rate used for the actuarial valuation at 
the end of 
2019. Owing 
to the 
implementation of the new policy for leases in 2019
, rental expenses 
related to l
eases, 
which were previously recognised under administrative expenses, are now recorded 
as depreciation. 
As a result
, the administrative expenses were lower
, while the 
depreciation cost 
was 
higher 
than 
the previous

. Administrative expenses also

   The ECB is 
exposed
 to both financial and operational risks. The 
following 
sections 
focus 
on these risks, their sources and the applicable risk control framework
s. 1.4.1
 Financial risks
 The Executive Board proposes policies and procedures that ensure an 
appropriate level of protection against the financial risks to which the ECB is 
exposed.
 The Risk Management Committee (RMC), which comprises experts from 
Eurosystem central banks, contributes
, inter alia, 
to the monitoring 
and measuring 
of 
and reporting o
n financial risks 
related to 
the balance sheet
 of the Eurosystem, 
and it 
defines
 and revie
ws the associated methodologies and frameworks
. In this way, the 
RMC helps 
the decision
-making bodies 
to ensure 
an appropriate level of protection for 
the Eurosystem
. Financial risks arise from the ECB™s core activities and associated exposures.
 The risk c
ontrol frameworks and limits that the ECB uses to manage its risk profile 
differ across types of operation, reflecting the policy or investment objectives of the 
different portfolios and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
 To monitor and ass
ess the risks, the ECB relies on a number of risk estimation 
techniques developed in
-house
. These techniques are based on a joint market and 
credit risk simulation framework. The core modelling concepts, techniques and 
assumptions underlying the risk measu
res draw on industry standards and

  19 market data. The risks are 
typically
 quantified by
 the expected shortfall (ES),
13 estimated
 at the 99% confidence level
 over a one
-year horizon. Two approaches
 are 
used to calculate risks
: (i)
 the accounting appr
oach, 
under which 
the ECB™s 
revaluation accounts are considered 
as a buffer 
in the calculation of risk estimates
 in 
line with all applicable accounting rules
; and (ii)
 the financial approach, 
under which 
the revaluation accounts are 
not considered 
as a buf
fer 
in the risk 
calculation
. The 
ECB also 
calculates
 other risk measures at different confidence levels, performs 
sensitivity and stress scenario analyses, and 
assesses
 longer
-term projections of 
exposures and income to maintain a comprehensive picture of 
the risks.
14 The total risks of the ECB 
decreased
 during the year.
 At 
the 
end of 
2019 the 
total 
financial 
risks for all the ECB™s portfolios combined, as measured by the 
ES at the 99% 
conf
idence level over a one
-year horizon following the accounting approach, stood at 
•8.1 billion, which was •1.
1 billion 
lower 
than the risks estimated as at 
the 
end of 
2018. The decrease reflects 
lower currency and interest rate risk 
in 
the 
ECB™s 
investment 
portfolios,
 improvements in the credit quality of securities held in the ECB™s 
portfolios
 and redemptions 
of securities held unde
r the 
SMP, CBPP1 and CBPP2
. Credit risk arises from the ECB™s monetary policy portfolios, its 
euro
-denominated own funds 
portfolio and its foreign reserve holdings.
 While 
securities held for 
monetary policy
 purposes 
are valued at amortised cost subject to 
impairment
 and are therefore
, in 
the 
absence of sales,
 not subject to 
price changes 
associated 
with 
credit migrations
, th
ey are still subject to credit default risk. 
Euro
-denominated own funds and foreign reserves are valued at market prices and, 
as such, are subject to credit migration and default ri
sk. 
Credit risk decreased 
compared with the previous 
year 
owing 
to improvem
ents in 
the 
credit quality of several 
European sovereigns
 and redemptions in the SMP 
holdings
. Credit risk is mitigated mainly through 
the application of 
eligibility criteria
, due 
diligence procedures
 and limits that differ across portfolios.
 Currency an
d commodity risks arise from the ECB™s foreign currency and gold 
holdings.
 The currency 
risk decreased
 compared to 
the previous 
year
 owing
 to higher 
revaluation accounts, which act as buffer
s against adverse exchange rate
 and gold 
price
 movements
. In view 
of the policy role of
 these assets
, the ECB does not 
hedge the
 related currency 
and commodity
 risks
. Instead, these risks are mitigated through the existence of 
revaluation accounts and the 
diversification of the holdings across different currencies 
and go
ld. The ECB™s foreign reserves and euro
-denominated own funds are mainly 
invested in fixed income securities and are subject to mark
-to-market interest 
rate risk,
 given
 that they 
are valued at market prices. The ECB™s foreign reserves 
holdings are mainly
 invested in assets with relatively short maturities (see 
Chart
 6 in 
Section
 1.3.1
 ﬁBalance Sheet
ﬂ), while the assets in the own funds portfolio generally 
                                                                    13  The ES is defined as a probability
-weighted average loss that occurs in the worst (1
-p)% of scenarios, 
where p
 denotes
 the confidence level.

 1.3.1
 ﬁBalance Sheet
ﬂ). 
This risk
 component
, as measur
ed under
 the accounting approach
, decreased compared to 
2018, reflecting developments in market conditions
. The mark
-to
-market interest rate risk of the ECB 
is mitigated
 through asset allocation 
policies and 
the revaluation accounts.
 The ECB is also 
subject to interest rate risk arising from mismatches between 
the interest rate earned on its assets and the interest rate paid on its liabilities
, which has an impact on its net interest income. This 
risk 
is not directly linked to any 
particular portfolio
 but rather to the structure of the ECB™s 
Balance 
Sheet as a whole
 and, in particular, the existence of 
maturity and yield mismatches between assets and 
liabilities
. 
It is monitored by means of projections
 of the ECB™s profitability
, which 
indicate that th
e ECB 
is expected to continue to earn net interest income in the coming 
years.
 This type of risk
 is managed
 through
 asset allocation policies and 
is further mitigated 
by 
the existence of unremunerated liabilities on the ECB™s 
Balance 
Sheet. 1.4.2
 Operational 
risk
 The 
ECB™s 
operational risk
15 management (ORM) covers all 
non-financial risks
. The Executive Board 
is responsible for and 
approves the ECB™s ORM policy and 
framework. The Operational Risk Committee (ORC) supports the Executive Board in 
the performance of its role in overseeing the management of operational risks. 
ORM is 
an integral part of the ECB™s governance structure
16 and 
management 
processes.
 The main objective of the ECB™s ORM framework is to 
contribute to ensuring that 
the ECB achieves its mission and objectives, while protecting its reputation and 
assets against loss, misuse and damage.
 Under the ORM framework, each 
business area is responsible for identifying, assessing, responding to, reporting on 
and monitoring its operational risks, incidents and controls. In this context, the ECB™s 
risk tolerance policy provides guidance with regard to risk response strategies and r
isk 
acceptance procedures. It is linked to a five
-by-five risk matrix based on impact and 
likelihood grading scales 
using 
quantitative and qualitative criteria.
 The 
environment in which the 
ECB operates i
s exposed to 
increasingly 
complex threat
s and there 
are a wide range of operational risks associated with the 
ECB™s day
-to
-day activities. The main areas of concern for the ECB include
 a wide 
spectrum of non
-financial risks resulting from people,
 information
, systems, processes 
and external third
-party prov
iders
. Consequently, the ECB has put in place processes 
to facilitate ongoing and effective management of its operational risks and to integrate 
                                                                    15  Operational risk is defined as the risk of a negative fina
ncial, business or reputational impact resulting 
from people, the inadequate implementation or failure of internal governance and business processes, 
the failure of systems on which processes rely, or external events (e.g. natural disasters or external 
att
acks).

 Accounting policies
 Form and presentation of the financial statements
 The financial statements of the ECB have been drawn up in accordance with the 
following accounting policies,
17 which the Governing Council of the ECB conside
rs to 
achieve a fair presentation of the financial statements, reflecting at the same time the 
nature of central bank activities.
 Accounting principles
 The following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and 
transparency, prudence, reco
gnition of post
-balance
 sheet events, materiality, going 
concern, the accruals principle, consistency and comparability.
 Recognition of assets and liabilities
 An asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 
any associ
ated future economic benefit will flow to or from the ECB, substantially all of 
the associated risks and rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost or 
value of the asset or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
 Basis of account
ing
 The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis, modified to include the 
market valuation of marketable securities (other than securities currently held for 
monetary policy purposes), gold and all other on
-balance
-sheet and off
-balance
-sheet
 assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency.
 Transactions in financial assets and liabilities are reflected in the accounts on the 
basis of the date on which they were settled.
 With the exception of spot transactions in securities, transactions in financial 
instruments denominated in foreign currency are recorded in off
-balance
-sheet 
accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date the off
-balance
-sheet entries are 
reversed and
 transactions are booked on
-balance
-sheet. Purchases and sales of 
foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date, and realised 
                                                                    17  The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in 
Decision (EU) 2016/2247 of the ECB of 
3 November
 2016 on the annual accounts of the ECB (ECB/2016/35) (OJ L
 347, 20.12.2016, p.
 1)
, as 
amended
. In order to ensure the harmonised accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem 
operations
, the Decision is based on 
Guideline (EU) 2016/2249 of the ECB of 3
 November
 2016 on the 
legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the European System of Central Banks 
(ECB/2016/34) (OJ L
 347, 20.12.2016, p.
 37)
, as amended
. These policies
, which are reviewed and 
updated regularly as deemed appropriate,
 are consistent with the provisions of Article
 26.4 of the Statute 
of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach to the rules governin
g the accounting and financial 
reporting of Eurosystem operations.

  26 results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, premiums 
and discount
s related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency are 
calculated and recorded daily, and the foreign currency position is also affected daily 
by these accruals.
 Gold and foreign currency assets and liabilities
 Assets and liabilities denomi
nated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are 
converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of 
foreign exchange assets and liabilities
, including on
-balance
-sheet and 
off
-balance
-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency
-by-currency basis.
 Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluatio
n. Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the balance sheet date. No distinction 
is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a 
single gold valuation is accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine
 ounce of 
gold, which, for the year ending 31 December 2019, was derived from the exchange 
rate of the euro against the US dollar on 31 December 2019.
 The special drawing right (SDR) is defined in terms of a basket of currencies and its 
value is determined
 by the weighted sum of the exchange rates of five major 
currencies (the US dollar, euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and pound sterling). 
The ECB™s holdings of SDRs were converted into euro using the exchange rate of euro 
per SDR as at 31 December 2019
. Securities
 Securities held for monetary policy purposes
 Securities currently held for monetary policy purposes are accounted for at amortised 
cost subject to impairment.
 Other securities
 Marketable securities (other than securities currently held for mon
etary policy 
purposes) and similar assets are valued either at the mid
-market prices or on the basis 
of the relevant yield curve prevailing on the balance sheet date, on a 
security
-by-security basis. Options embedded in securities are not separated for 
val
uation purposes. For the year ending 31 December 2019, mid
-market prices on 
30 December
 2019 were used. Illiquid equity shares and any other equity instruments 
held as permanent investments are valued at cost subject to impairment.

  27 Income recognition
 Incom
e and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or 
incurred.
18 Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign currency, gold 
and securities are taken to the Profit and Loss Account. Such realised gains and 
losses are calcula
ted by reference to the average cost of the respective asset.
 Unrealised gains are not recognised as income and are transferred directly to a 
revaluation account.
 Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account if, at the year
-end, they 
exceed p
revious revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation 
account. Such unrealised losses on any one security or currency or on gold are not 
netted against unrealised gains on other securities or currencies or gold. In the event 
of such unreali
sed losses on any item taken to the Profit and Loss Account, the 
average cost of that item is reduced to the year
-end exchange rate or market price. 
Unrealised losses on interest rate swaps that are taken to the Profit and Loss Account 
at the year
-end are 
amortised in subsequent years.
 Impairment losses are taken to the Profit and Loss Account and are not reversed in 
subsequent years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related 
to an observable event that occurred after the impairment was
 first recorded.
 Premiums or discounts arising on securities are amortised over the securities™ 
remaining contractual life.
 Reverse transactions
 Reverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a 
repurchase agreement or conduc
ts credit operations against collateral.
 Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous 
agreement to repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set 
future date. Repurchase agreements are recorded as collat
eralised deposits on the 
liability side of the Balance Sheet. Securities sold under such an agreement remain on 
the Balance Sheet of the ECB.
 Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a 
simultaneous agreement to sell them ba
ck to the counterparty at an agreed price on a 
set future date. Reverse repurchase agreements are recorded as collateralised loans 
on the asset side of the Balance Sheet, but are not included in the ECB™s security 
holdings.
 Reverse transactions (including 
securities lending transactions) conducted under a 
programme offered by a specialised institution are recorded on the Balance Sheet only 
where collateral has been provided in the form of cash and this cash remains 
uninvested.
                                                                     18  A minimum threshold of •100,000
 applies for administrative accruals and provisions.

  28 Off
-balance
-sheet instruments
 Currency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of 
foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one 
currency for another at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency position 
for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses.
 Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item
-by-item basis. Daily changes in the 
variation margin of open interest rate futures contracts, as well as interest rate swaps 
that are cleare
d via a central counterparty, are recorded in the Profit and Loss 
Account. The valuation of forward transactions in securities and of interest rate swaps 
that are not cleared via a central counterparty is carried out by the ECB based on 
generally accepted 
valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, as 
well as discount factors from the settlement dates to the valuation date.
 Post
-balance
 sheet events
 The values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the 
annual ba
lance sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the 
submission of the ECB™s Annual Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if 
such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet 
date.

ortant post

 sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.
 Intra
-ESCB balances/intra
-Eurosystem balances
 Intra
-ESCB balances result primarily from cross
-border payments 
in the European 
Union (EU) that are settled in central bank money in euro. These transactions are for 
the most part initiated by private entities (i.e.
 credit institutions, corporations and 
individuals). They are settled in TARGET2
 Œ the Trans
-European Aut
omated 
Real
-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system
 Œ and give rise to bilateral 
balances in the TARGET2 accounts of EU central banks. These bilateral balances are 
netted and then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each national central 
bank (NCB) with a single net bilateral position vis
-à-vis the ECB only. Payments 
conducted by the ECB and settled in TARGET2 also affect the single net bilateral 
positions. These positions in the books of the ECB represent the net claim or liability of 
each 
NCB against the rest of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). 
Intra
-Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis
-à-vis the ECB arising from 
TARGET2, as well as other intra
-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro (e.g.
 the 
ECB™s interim profit distribut
ion to NCBs), are presented on the Balance Sheet of the 
ECB as a single net asset or liability position under either ﬁOther claims within the 
Eurosystem (net)ﬂ or ﬁOther liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ. Intra

 Intra
-Eurosystem balances arising from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the 
ECB by NCBs joining the Eurosyst
em are denominated in euro and reported under 
ﬁLiabilities equivalent to the transfer of foreign reservesﬂ.
 Fixed assets
 Fixed assets, including intangible assets, but with the exception of land and works of 
art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land 
and works of art are valued at cost. The 
ECB™s main building is valued at cost less depreciation subject to impairment. For the 
depreciation of the ECB™s main building, costs are assigned to the appropriate asset 
components, which are depreciated in accord
ance with their estimated useful lives. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight
-line basis over the expected useful life of the 
asset, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use. The useful lives 
applied for the main asset classes are a
s follows:
 Buildings
 20, 25 or 50
 years
 Plant in building
 10 or 15
 years
 Technical equipment
 4, 10 or 15
 years
 Computers, related hardware and software, and motor vehicles
 4 years
 Furniture
 10 years
 The depreciation period for capitalised 
refurbishment expenditure relating to the 
ECB™s existing rented premises is adjusted to take account of any events that have an 
impact on the expected useful life of the affected asset.
 The ECB performs an annual impairment test of its main building and ri
ght-of-use 
assets relating to office buildings (see ﬁLeasesﬂ below) based on International 
Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 ﬁImpairment of assetsﬂ. If an impairment indicator is 
identified, signalling that the asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. An impairment loss is recorded in the Profit and Loss Account if the 
recoverable amount is less than the net book value.
 Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
 Fixed assets that comply with the capitali
sation criteria, but are still under construction 
or development, are recorded under the heading ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ. The 
related costs are transferred to the relevant fixed asset headings once the assets are 
available for use.
                                                                     19  As

  30 Leases
 For all lease
s involving a tangible asset, the related right
-of-use asset and lease 
liability are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lease commencement date and 
included under ﬁTangible and intangible fixed assetsﬂ and ﬁSundryﬂ (liabilities), 
respectively.
 Right
-of-use assets are valued at cost less depreciation. In addition, right
-of-use 
assets relating to office buildings are subject to impairment (regarding annual 
impairment test, see ﬁFixed assetsﬂ above). Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight
-line basis from
 the commencement date to either the end of the useful life of 
the right
-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier.
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease 
payments (comprising only lease com
ponents), discounted using the ECB's 
incremental borrowing rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. The related interest expense is recorded in 
the Profit and Loss Account under ﬁOther inter
est expenseﬂ. When there is a change in 
future lease payments arising from a change in an index or other reassessment of the 
existing contract, the lease liability is remeasured. Any such remeasurement results in 
a corresponding adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the right
-of-use asset.
 Short
-term leases with duration of 12 months or less and leases of low
-value assets 
below •10,000 (consistent with the threshold used for the recognition of fixed assets) 
are recorded as an expense in the Profit and Loss A
ccount.
 The ECB™s post
-employment benefits, other long
-term benefits and 
termination benefits
 The ECB operates defined benefit plans for its staff and the members of the Executive 
Board, as well as for the members of the Supervisory Board employed by the E
CB.
 The staff pension plan is funded by assets held in a long
-term employee benefit fund. 
The compulsory contributions made by the ECB and the staff are reflected in the 
defined benefit pillar of the plan. Staff can make additional contributions on a volun
tary 
basis in a defined contribution pillar that can be used to provide additional benefits.
20 These additional benefits are determined by the amount of voluntary contributions 
together with the investment returns arising from those contributions.
 Unfunded 
arrangements are in place for the post
-employment and other long
-term 
benefits of members of the Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board 
employed by
 the ECB. For staff, unfunded arrangements are in place for 
post
-employment benefits other than
 pensions and for other long
-term benefits and 
termination benefits.
                                                                     20  The funds accumulated by a staff member through voluntary contributions can be used at retirement to 
purchase an additional 
pension. This pension is included in the defined benefit obligation from that point 
on.
      
 Annual Accounts of the ECB 2019
 Œ Financial statements of the ECB
  31 Net defined benefit liability
 The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet under ﬁSundryﬂ (liabilities) in respect of 
the defined benefit plans, including other long
-term benefits and te
rmination benefits, 
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the 
fair value of plan assets used to fund the related obligation.
 The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries usi
ng the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high
-quality 
euro
-denominated corporate bonds that have similar terms to maturity to the related 
obligation.
 Actuarial gains and losses can arise from experience adjustments (where actual 
outcomes are different from the actuarial assumptions previously made) and changes
 in actuarial assumptions.
 Net defined benefit cost
 The net defined benefit cost is split into components reported in the Profit and Loss 
Account and remeasurements in respect of post
-employment benefits shown in the 
Balance Sheet under ﬁRevaluation accoun
tsﬂ.
 The net amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account comprises:
 1. the current service cost of the defined benefits accruing for the year;
 2. the past service cost of the defined benefits resulting from a plan amendment;
 3. net interest at the discount rate o
n the net defined benefit liability;
 4. remeasurements in respect of other long
-term benefits and termination benefits 
of a long
-term nature, if any, in their entirety.
 The net amount shown under ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ comprises the following items:
 1. actuarial
 gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation;
 2. the actual return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the net interest 
on the net defined benefit liability;
 3. any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in the 
net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
 These amounts are valued annually by independent actuaries to establish the 
appropriate liability in the financial statements.

21 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the 
Eurosystem central banks on the last working day of each month in accordance with 
the bankno
te allocation key.
22 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of the total value of euro banknotes in 
circulation, which is disclosed in the Balance Sheet under the liability item ﬁBanknotes 
in circulationﬂ. The ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue 
is backed by claims 
on the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest,
23 are disclosed under the sub

ﬁIntra
-Eurosystem claims: claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the 
Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra

 Interim profit distribution
 An amount that is equal to the sum of the EC
B™s income on euro banknotes in 
circulation and income arising from the securities held for monetary policy purposes 
purchased under (a)

ﬁAdministrative e
xpensesﬂ in the Profit and Loss Account over the contract duration. 
Following the issue of the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 
ﬁLeasesﬂ, the ECB has modified its accounting policy as from 1 January 2019. On the 
initial application, the
 ECB reassessed all rental contracts involving fixed assets to

 Notes on the Balance Sheet
 Note 1 
- Gold and gold receivables
 As at 31 December 2019 the ECB held 16,229,522
 ounces
25 of fine gold, the market 
value of which amounted to •21,976
 million (2018: •18,193
 million). No gold 
operations took place in 2019 and the ECB™s holdings therefore remained unchanged 
compared with the
ir level as at 31
 December
 2018. The increase in the euro 
equivalent value of these holdings was due to the rise in the market price of gold in 
euro terms (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in Section 2.3 
ﬁAccounting policiesﬂ and note
 14 ﬁRevaluation accountsﬂ).
 Note 2 
- Claims on non
-euro area and euro area residents 
denominated in foreign currency
 Note 2.1 
- Receivables from the IMF
 This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of SDRs and amounted to •710
 million as at 
31 December 2019 (
2018: •692
 million). It arises as the result of a two
-way SDR 
buying and selling arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby 
the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of 
the ECB, within minimum 
and maximum holding levels. For accounting purposes, 
SDRs are treated as a foreign currency (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 
liabilitiesﬂ in Section 2.3 ﬁAccounting policiesﬂ). The increase in the value of the ECB™s 
holdings of SDRs was due to th
e appreciation of the SDR against the euro during 2019 
and the interest income received during the year.
 Note 2.2 
- Balances with banks and security investments, external 
loans and other external assets; and claims on euro area residents 
denominated in for
eign currency
 These two items consist of balances with banks and loans denominated in foreign 
currency, and investments in securities denominated in US dollars, Japanese yen and 
Chinese renminbi.
                                                                     25  This corresponds to

(ABSPP) and the public sector purchase programme (PSPP).
27 Purchases
 under the first CBPP were completed on 30
 June
 2010, while the second 
CBPP ended on 31
 October
 2012. The Governing Council decided to cease SMP 
purchases on 6
 September
 2012.
 On 1 November 2019 the Eurosystem restarted its net purchases of securities unde
r the asset purchase programme (APP)
28 at a monthly pace of •20 billion on average. 
This followed a period of ten months since the end of 2018 during which the 
Eurosystem only reinvested, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities 
purchased un
der the APP. The Governing Council expects net purchases to run for as 
long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to 
end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. The Governing Council 
also intends t
o continue the reinvestments for an extended period of time past the date 
when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case 
for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of mone
tary accommodation.
 The securities purchased under all of these programmes are valued on an amortised 
cost basis subject to impairment (see ﬁSecuritiesﬂ in Section 2.3 ﬁAccounting 
policiesﬂ).

 The Governing Council assesses on a regular basis the financial ri

the securities held under all these programmes.
 Impairment tests are conducted on an annual basis, using data as at the year

and are approved by the Governing Council. In these tests, impairment indicators are 
assessed separately f
or each programme. In cases where impairment indicators were 
observed, further analysis has been performed to confirm that the cash flows of the 
underlying securities have not been affected by an impairment event. Based on the 
results of this year™s impair
ment tests, no losses have been recorded by the ECB for 
the securities held in its monetary policy portfolios in 2019.

 As at 31 December 2019 this position
 amounted to •7,245
 million 
(2018:
 •10,361
 million). The largest component was an amount of •3,350
 million 
(2018: •3,682
 million) arising from the standing reciprocal currency arrangement with 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under this arrangement, U
S dollars are 
provided by the Federal Reserve System to the ECB by means of swap transactions, 
with the aim of offering short
-term US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties. 
The ECB simultaneously enters into back
-to
-back swap transactions with euro a
rea 
NCBs, which use the resulting funds to conduct US dollar liquidity
-providing 
operations with Eurosystem counterparties in the form of reverse transactions. The 
back
-to
-back swap transactions result in intra
-Eurosystem balances between the ECB 
and the N
CBs (see note
 11.2 ﬁOther liabilities within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ). 
Furthermore, the swap transactions conducted with the Federal Reserve System and 
the euro area NCBs result in forward claims and liabilities that are recorded in 
off

-sheet account
s (see note
 19 ﬁForeign exchange swap and forward 
transactionsﬂ).
 This item also includes an amount of •3,271
 million (2018:
 •4,619
 million) consisting 
of balances held with the ECB by non
-euro area central banks that arise from, or are 
the counterpart of,
 transactions processed via the TARGET2 system. The decrease in 
these balances in 2019 was due to payments from non
-euro area residents to euro 
area residents.
 The remainder of this item consists of an amount of •625
 million (2018: •2,059
 million) 
arising 
from outstanding PSPP securities lending transactions conducted with 
non-euro area residents in which cash was received as collateral and transferred to 
TARGET2 accounts (see note
 8 ﬁOther liabilities to euro area credit institutions 
denominated in euroﬂ).
                                                                     32  EURO1 and RT1 are payment systems operated by ABE CLEARING S.A.S à capital variable (EBA

 The decrease in the net TARGET2 liability resulted mainly from (a) the increase in the 
deposits accepted by the ECB in its role as fiscal agent (see note 9 ﬁLiabilities to other 
euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ); (b) the interest income received from 
securities held for monetary policy purposes; and (c) redemptions of securities 
purchased under the SMP and the first two covered bonds purchase programmes, 
which were settled via TARGE
T2 accounts. The impact of these factors was partially 
offset by (a) the APP net purchases, which were also settled via TARGET2 accounts; 
(b) the payment of the ECB™s profit distribution for 2018; (c) the decrease in cash 
received as collateral against the
 lending of PSPP securities (see note 8 ﬁOther 
liabilities to euro area credit institutions denominated in euroﬂ and note 10 ﬁLiabilities to 
non-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ); and (d) the settlement in TARGET2 of 
payments from euro area residen
ts to non
-euro area residents (see note 10 ﬁLiabilities 
to non
-euro area residents denominated in euroﬂ).
 The remuneration of TARGET2 positions, with the exception of balances arising from 
back
-to
-back swap transactions in connection with US dollar liquidi
ty
-providing 
operations, is calculated daily at the latest available marginal interest rate used by the 
Eurosystem in its tenders for main refinancing operations.

whilst those paid by the ECB are 20.7% of the basic salary.
 The total remeasurement
 losses of •763
 million on the defined benefit obligation in 
2019 arose primarily as a result of the decrease in the discount rate from 2.3% in 2018 
to 1.2% in 2019. Additional sources of remeasurement losses included the application 
of new mortality table
s and, to a much lesser extent, experience adjustments reflecting 
the difference between the actuarial assumptions made in the previous year™s report 
and actual experience.
 Benefits paid decreased to •24
 million in 2019 (2018: •46
 million), mainly owing to
 lower one
-off termination payments to staff members accepted for the temporary 
Career Transition Support (CTS) scheme. This scheme was introduced in 2017 for 
long

  47 The current service cost declined in 2019 to •92
 million (2018: •98

owing to an increase in the discount rate from 2.1% in 2017 to 2.3% in 2018.
33 Key assumptions
 In preparing the valuations referred to in this note, the independent a
ctuaries have 
used assumptions which the Executive Board has accepted for the purposes of 
accounting and disclosure. The principal assumptions used for the purposes of 
calculating the liability for post
-employment benefits and other long
-term benefits are 
as follows:
  2019  % 2018  % Discount rate
 1.20
 2.30
 Expected return on plan assets
1 2.20
 3.30
 General future salary increases
2 2.00
 2.00
 Future pension increases
3 1.00
 1.30
 1) These assumptions were used for calculating the part of the ECB™s defined 
benefit obligation which is funded by assets with an 
underlying capital guarantee.
 2) In addition, allowance is made for prospective individual salary increases of up to 1.8% per annum, depending on the age o
f the plan 
participants.
 3) In accordance with t
he ECB™s pension plan rules, pensions will be increased annually. If general salary adjustments for ECB 
employees are below price inflation, any increase in pensions will be in line with the general salary adjustments. If the gen
eral salary 
adjustments exc
eed price inflation, they will be applied to determine the increase in pensions, provided that the financial position of the 
ECB™s pension plans permits such an increase.
 Furthermore, voluntary contributions made by staff in a defined contribution pillar 
in 2019 amounted to •171
 million (2018: •140
 million). These contributions are 
invested in the plan assets and give rise to a corresponding obligation of equal value.
 Note 13 
- Provisions
 This item consists mainly of a provision for financial risks. In 2019
 its scope was 
extended to cover all financial risks (i.e. market, liquidity and credit risks). It previously 
covered foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks only.
 The provision for financial risks will be used to the extent deeme
d necessary by the 
Governing Council to offset future realised and unrealised losses. The size of and 
continuing requirement for this provision is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s 
assessment of its exposure to these risks and taking a range of factors
 into account. 
Its size, together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may not exceed 
the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.
 Taking into account (i) the reduction in the weighting of the euro area NCBs in the 
subscribed 
capital of the ECB as a result of the five
-yearly adjustment of the key for 
subscription to the ECB™s capital as at 1 January 2019 (see note 15 ﬁCapital and 
reservesﬂ) and (ii) 
the results of the assessment of the ECB™s exposures to financial 
risks, the Go
verning Council decided to release •84 million from the ECB™s provision 
for financial risks on 31 December 2019 in order to comply with the maximum allowed 
ceiling. Thus the provision for financial risks as at 31 December 2019 amounted to 
                                                                    33  The current service cost is estimated using the discount rate that applied in the previous y
ear.

 Change to 
the ECB™s capital key
 Pursuant to Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB, the weightings assigned to
 the 
NCBs in the key for subscription to the ECB™s capital are adjusted every five years

whenever there is a change in the 
composition
 of

- Securities lending programmes
 As part of the management of the ECB™s own funds, the ECB has a securities lending 
programme 
agreement in place under which a specialised institution enters into 
securities lending transactions on behalf of the ECB.
 In addition, in accordance with the Governing Council™s decisions, the ECB has made 
available for lending its holdings of securities 
purchased under the first, second and 
third CBPPs, as well as its holdings of securities purchased under the PSPP and those 
purchased under the SMP that are also eligible for purchase under the PSPP.
36 Unless these securities lending operations are conducte
d against cash collateral that 
remains uninvested at the end of the year, they are recorded in off
-balance
-sheet 
accounts.
37 Such securities lending operations with a value of •10,076
 million (2018: 
•9,646
 million) were outstanding as at 31 December 2019. O
f this amount, 
•5,502

 and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism
, for 
the loan facility agreement 
for Greece, 
and for
 the administration of payments relating to two EFSF l

the ECB processed payments related to these operations, as well as payments linked 
to member subscriptions to the ESM™s authorised capital stock.
 Note 21 
- Contingent liabilities from pending lawsuits
 Several
 lawsuits have been filed against 
the ECB and other EU institutions by a 
number of depositors, shareholders and bondholders of Cypriot credit institutions. The 
applicants allege that they have suffered financial losses as a result of acts that they 
deem to have led to the restructuring of 
these credit institutions in the context of the 
financial assistance programme for Cyprus. Two of these cases were dismissed on 
substance by the General Court of the EU in 2018, and an appeal against these 
judgments is currently pending before the Court of
 Justice of the EU. This follows 
orders of the General Court in 2014 which found twelve similar cases inadmissible in 
their entirety and, following appeals, judgments of the Court of Justice in 2016 which 
either confirmed the inadmissibility or ruled in fa
vour of the ECB. The ECB™s 
involvement in the process leading up to the conclusion of the financial assistance 
programme was limited to the provision of technical advice, pursuant to the ESM 
Treaty, acting in liaison with the European Commission, as well a
s the issuance of a 
non-binding opinion on the Cypriot draft resolution law. It is therefore considered that 
no losses will be incurred by the ECB as a result of these cases.

 20 In 2019 income under this heading consisted mainly of supervisory fees and 
administrative penalties 
imposed on supervised entities for non
-compliance with the 
EU banking regulations on prudential requirements (including ECB supervisory 
decisions). Expenses consisted mainly of custody fees.
 Income and expenses related to supervisory tasks
 The ECB levies a
nnual fees on supervised entities in order to recover expenditure 
incurred in the performance of its supervisory tasks. The ECB announced in 
April
 2019 that the annual supervisory fees in 2019 would amount to •576
 million. This 
figure was based on estimate
d annual expenses for supervisory tasks of •559
 million 
in 2019, adjusted for (i)
 the deficit of •15
 million carried forward from the 2018 fee 
period and (ii)
 amounts reimbursed to individual banks for previous fee periods
38 (•2
 million).
 Based on the actua
l expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its banking 
supervisory tasks, the supervisory fee income for 2019 stood at •537
 million. The 
resulting surplus of •22
 million arising from the difference between the estimated 
expenses (•559
 million) an
d the actual expenses (•537
 million) for 2019 is shown 
under the heading ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ (see note
 12.2 
ﬁAccruals and income collected in advanceﬂ). It will reduce the total amount to be 
levied for the fee period 2020, which, fol
lowing the implementation of ex post invoicing 
under the revised fee framework,
39 will take place in 2021.
 The ECB is also entitled to impose administrative penalties on supervised entities for 
failure to comply with the EU banking regulations on prudential
 requirements 
(including ECB supervisory decisions). The related income is not considered in the 
calculation of the annual supervisory fees. Instead, it is recorded as income in the 
ECB™s Profit and Loss Account and is distributed to euro area NCBs as part
 of the 
ECB™s profit distribution regime. In 2019 the income arising from penalties on 
supervised entities amounted to •7
 million.
                                                                       38  See

 537 518 19 The increase in the average number of staff working for ECB Banking Supervision led 
to a corresponding 
increase in salaries and benefits. The higher staff numbers also 
drove the increase in premises
-related costs, while the decrease in other operating 
expenditure was mainly due to lower consultancy expenses in relation to supervisory 
tasks, most notably the
 Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM), which will 
conclude in 2020.

40, 
amounted to 3,770 (2018: 3,546), of which 349
 were managerial staff (2
018: 337).
 Staff costs increased in 2019 
mainly 
owing to the higher average number of staff 
employed by the ECB and higher costs in relation to other long
-term benefits, mainly 
as a result of the use of a lower discount rate for the actuarial valuation at 
the end of 
2019 (see note
 12.3 ﬁSundryﬂ).
 Remuneration of the Executive and Supervisory Boards
 Members of the Executive Board and the members of the Supervisory Board 
employed by the ECB receive a basic salary and allowances for residence and 
representatio
n. In the case of the President, a residence is provided in lieu of a 
residence allowance. Subject to the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the 
European Central Bank, members of both boards may be entitled to household, child 
and education allowances, 
depending on their individual circumstances. Salaries are 
subject to a tax for the benefit of the EU, as well as to deductions in respect of 
contributions to the pension, medical, long
-term care and accident insurance 
schemes. Allowances are non
-taxable an
d non
-pensionable.
 In 2019 the basic salaries of the members of the Executive Board and members of the 
Supervisory Board employed by the ECB (i.e.
 excluding representatives of national 
supervisors) were as follows:
41                                                                     40  A full
-time equivalent (FTE) is a 
unit 
equivalent to one employee working full
-time for one year.
 Staf
f with 
permanent, fixed or short

included in proportion to their hours worked. Staff on maternity or on long
-term leave are also included,

the medical,
 long

  61 Impact on the ECB™s capital
 The ECB kept its subscribed capital unchanged at •10,825 million after the Bank of 
England™s withdrawal from the ESCB. The share of the Bank of England in the ECB™s 
subscribed capital, which stood at 14.3%, was reallocated among both euro area and 
remainin
g non
-euro area NCBs.
 The ECB™s paid
-up capital will remain unchanged at •7,659 million in 2020, as the 
remaining NCBs covered the Bank of England™s former paid
-up capital of •58
 million. 
Over the next two years euro area NCBs will pay up
, in two annual instalments
, the 
remainder of their increased subscriptions to the ECB™s capital following the Bank of 
England™s withdrawal from the ESCB. This will lead to an increase in the ECB™s 
paid
-up capital from •7,659 million in 2020 to •8,270
 milli
on in 2021 and •8,880 million 
in 2022.
 Impact on NCBs™ claims equivalent to the foreign reserve assets transferred to 
the ECB
 Pursuant to Article 30.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the contributions of the NCBs to 
the transfer of foreign reserve assets to th
e ECB are fixed in proportion to their share 
in the ECB™s subscribed capital. Following (a) the increase in the weighting of the euro 
area NCBs (which have transferred foreign reserve assets to the ECB) in the ECB™s 
subscribed capital resulting from Bank o
f England™s withdrawal from the ESCB and (b) 
the decision of the Governing Council to reduce the proportion of the euro area NCBs™ 
contributions, so that the total amount of foreign reserve assets transferred by the euro 
area NCBs remains at the same level
 as before the Bank of England™s withdrawal from 
the ESCB, the NCBs™ total claim equivalent to these transfers remains virtually 
unchanged.

Source: ECB.1) From 1 January 1999 to 9 March 2004, the date refers to the deposit and marginal lending facilities. For main refinancing operations, changes in the rate are effective from thefirst operation following the date indicated. The change on 18 September 2001 was effective on that same day. From 10 March 2004 the date refers both to the deposit andmarginal lending facilities, and to the main refinancing operations (with changes effective from the first main refinancing operation following the Governing Council decision),unless otherwise indicated.2) On 22 December 1998 the ECB announced that, as an exceptional measure between 4 and 21 January 1999, a narrow corridor of 50 basis points would be applied between theinterest rates for the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, aimed at facilitating the transition to the new monetary regime by market participants.3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be conducted asvariable rate tenders. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids.4) As of 9 October 2008 the ECB reduced the standing facilities corridor from 200 basis points to 100 basis points around the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. Thestanding facilities corridor was restored to 200 basis points as of 21 January 2009.5) On 8 October 2008 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through afixed rate tender procedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations. This change overrode the previous decision (made on the same day) to cutby 50 basis points the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations conducted as variable rate tenders.1 Financial and monetary developmentsS 3 ECB Annual Report 2019 - Statistical section1.2 Eurosystem monetary policy operations allotted through tender procedures(EUR millions; interest rates in percentages per annum)1.2.1 Main and longer-term refinancing operations 1), 2), 3)  Main refinancing operations    Date ofBidsNumber ofAllotmentFixed rate tender   Variable rate tenderRunning for

Source: ECB.1) Only the last ten operations of 2019 are displayed in each category.
2) With effect from April 2002, split tender operations (i.e. operations with a one-week maturity conducted as standard tender procedures in parallel with a main refinancingoperation) are classified as main refinancing operations.3) On 8 June 2000 the ECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would beconducted as variable rate tender procedures. The minimum bid rate refers to the minimum interest rate at which counterparties may place their bids. On 8 October 2008 theECB announced that, starting from the operation to be settled on 15 October 2008, the weekly main refinancing operations would be carried out through a fixed rate tenderprocedure with full allotment at the interest rate on the main refinancing operations.  On 4 March 2010 the ECB decided to return to variable rate tender procedures in theregular three-month longer-term refinancing operations, starting with the operation to be allotted on 28 April 2010 and settled on 29 April 2010.4) In liquidity-providing (absorbing) operations, the marginal rate refers to the lowest (highest) rate at which bids were accepted.5) For the operations settled on 22 December 2011 and 1 March 2012, after one year counterparties have the option to repay any part of the liquidity that they have been allottedin these operations, on any day that coincides with the settlement day of a main refinancing operation.6) Targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Further information can be found on the ECB's website (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/index.en.html).7) In this longer-term refinancing operation, the rate at which all bids are satisfied is indexed to the average minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations over the life of theoperation. The interest rates displayed for these indexed longer-term refinancing operations have been rounded to two decimal places.
