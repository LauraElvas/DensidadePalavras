  2 Update on economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting in early 
September
 confirm
s the
 previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth 
dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures.
 The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In 
particular, these risks per
tain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to 
geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.
 At 
the same time, ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to 
underpin the resilience of the euro
 area economy. 
Against this overall background, the 
Governing Council at its October meeting kept its monetary policy stance unchanged, 
confirming the decisions taken at the previous meeting in September. T
he comprehensive package of policy measures that w
as decided at 
the
 September
 meeting
 provides substantial monetary stimulus, 
and thus 
will contribute to a further 
easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households. This will support the euro 
area expansion, the ongoing build
-up of domestic price pre
ssures and, thus, the 
sustained convergence of inflation to 
the Governing Council™s 
medium
-term inflation 
aim.
 Survey indicators suggest subdued, but stabilising, global economic activity in the 
third quarter of 2019. Following a protracted period of weakn
ess, the global 
manufacturing P
urchasing 
Managers™ 
Index (PMI)
 has improved over recent months 
and ret
urned to expansionary territory. T
he global services PMI remained 
expansionary in the third quarter. Global trade (excluding the euro area) contracted in 
the first half of 2019 owing to weak intra
-Asia
n trade, but short
-term indicators of 
global trade signal low, but positive, growth in the third quarter. Global inflation 
declined to below 2% in August, driven in part by lower energy price inflation, while 
inflation excluding food and energy remained stable at 2.3%.
 Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2019, euro area long
-term 
risk
-free rates have increased
 and the EONIA forward curve has shifted upwards
, 
largely reflecting lower market expectations of another cut in the deposit facility rate 
before the end of the year. Sovereign spreads have remained broadly stable, with 
some countries seeing a slight increase during the review period. Equity prices have
 increased, despite higher discount rates, 
owing
 to a falling equity risk premium. In 
foreign exchange markets, the euro has broadly strengthened in trade
-weighted 
terms.
 Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second 
quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic 
data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the 
euro area in the 
second half of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the 
 Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2019

 on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
  3 ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global 
uncertainties, which continue to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and are 
dampening investment growth.
 At the same time, the services and construction 
sectors remain r
esilient, despite some moderation. The euro area expansion is 
supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction 
with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activity.
 Euro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 1.0% in August 2019 to 0.8% in 
September, reflecting lower food and energy price inflation. On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline 
slightly further before rising 
again at the end of the year. Measures of underlying inflation remained generally 
muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. While labour cost 
pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, 
the weaker growth 
momentum is delaying their pass
-through to inflation. Over the medium term inflation 
is expected to increase, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, the 
ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.
 Regarding monetary devel
opments, 
broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.7% in 
August 2019, after 5.1% in July.
 M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit 
creation, and the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to 
broad money growth. Furthermore,
 the annu
al growth of broad money and loans to the 
private sector remained robust 
as the mechanical contribution of net purchases under 
the asset purchase programme (APP) 
faded out 
and economic momentum
 weakened
. The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial cor
porations increased to 4.3% in 
August, from 4.0% in July, while the annual growth rate of loans to households 
remained unchanged at 3.4%. 
At the same time, favourable bank funding and lending 
conditions continued to support loan flows and thereby economic 
growth. 
The ECB™s 
accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending 
conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and 
medium
-sized enterprises.
 Combining
 the outcome of the economic a
nalysis with the signals coming from the 
monetary analysis
, the Governing Council
 confirmed that an ample degree of 
monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence 
of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% ov
er the medium term.
 On the basis of this assessment
, the Governing Council
 decided to keep the
 key ECB 
interest rates
 unchanged
 and expect
s them to remain at their present or lower levels 
until 
it has
 seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level
 sufficiently close to, 
but below, 2% within 
its
 projection horizon, and such convergence has been 
consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
 The Governing Council confirmed that it will
 restart net purchases under 
the ECB™s
 APP at a monthly 
pace of •20 billion as from 1 November
. It 
expects 
them to run 
for as 
long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of 
the ECB™s
 policy rates
, and to end shortly before 
the Governing Council
 start
s raising the key ECB interest 
rates.
  Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2019
 Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 Summary
  4 The Governin
g Council
 also intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period 
of time past the date when 
it start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case 
for as long as 
necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.
 The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflati
on pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. In particular, 
the Governing Council™s forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in 
accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Coun
cil continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that 
inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to 
symmetry.

a protracted period of weakness, the global manufacturing PMI has improved over 
recent months and returned to expansi

remained expansionary in the third quarter. Developments were mixed across and 
within regions. In the third quarter of 2019 t

 Notes: The latest observations are for September 201
9. ﬁLong
-term averageﬂ refers to the period
 from January 1999 to September 201
9. Risks to the global economy remain to the downside
 amid a further escalation 
of trade disputes, high uncertainty related to Brexit and a potentially slower 
recovery in a number of emerging market economies.
 A continual
 escalation of 
trade disputes would likely imply higher adjustment costs in the transition to a new 
trading regime and possible further disruptions to global supply chains over time. This 
could, in turn, amplify the impact on economic activity of already
-enacted tariffs. Risks 
related to Brexit remain high. The recovery in a number of emerging market 
economies that have experienced sharp recessions may be less vigorous than 
expected. The speed of recovery depends on the extent to which domestic policies 
address structural impediments to investment and potential growth. A slower recovery 
in these economies would ultimately translate into more sluggish global growth.

  6 Global financial conditions 
have remained broadly stable in both advanced and 
emerging market 
economies
. In September risk sentiment had improved somewhat 
against the backdrop of renewed expectations of a trade deal between the United 
States and China, subsiding risks of a disorderly Brexit and strong economic data in 
the United States. However, ri
sk appetite has since faded again and global equity 
prices have reversed some of their previous gains. While the Federal Open Market 
Committee cut interest rates further at its September meeting, weaker than expected 
economic data has led financial markets
 to price in further monetary accommodation.
 Global trade momentum 
is expected to remain muted, as higher tariffs are set to 
come fully into effect at the end of the year.
 Global
 trade (excluding the euro area) 
contracted in the first half of 2019 owing to
 weak intra
-Asia trade, reflecting a slowing 
down of the Chinese economy and of technology
-related trade. Developments in the 
first half of the year were also influenced by the high volatility in UK imports linked to 
Brexit
-related stockpiling efforts. Sho
rt-term indicators of global trade signal low, but 
positive, growth. Global merchandise imports continued to expand in August in 
monthly terms, pointing to positive world trade growth in the third quarter. 
The global 
PMI for new export orders
, while remain
ing below the neutral threshold, edged up 
slightly in September following five consecutive months of decline (Chart 2).

major advanced economies
. Annual consumer price inflation in the countries of the 
Organisation for Economic Co

declined to below 
2% 
in August,
 driven in part by lower energy price 
inflation,
 while inflation excluding 
food and energy 
remained stable at 
2.3%. 
Inflationary pressures across major 
advanced economies remain muted despite the tight labour market conditions, which 
have so far translated into only moderate wage increases. Ov
erall, underlying inflation 
pressures are expected to remain subdued over the short and medium term

  7 Oil 
prices have remained broadly unchanged amid short
-term volatility.
 On 14 
September 2019 a drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities reduced the glob
al oil 
supply by approximately 6%. The price of oil increased sharply in the aftermath of the 
attack, but had moved back to the levels seen before the attack by 30 September as 
Saudi Arabia used spare capacity and inventories to stabilise oil supply amid c
oncerns 
about global oil demand. N
on-oil commodity prices 
remained mixed, with metal prices 
having declined and food prices having increased
. In the United States, economic activity remains 
resilient on the whole
. Real GDP 
expanded at an annualised rate of
 2.0% in the second quarter of 201
9, following 3.1% 
in the previous quarter
. 
The deceleration mainly reflects the reversal of temporary 
factors 
Œ related to net exports and private inventories 
Œ that supported GDP growth in 
the first quarter. Overall, a st
rong labour market, sustained consumer spending and 
the fiscal impulse from the lifting of spending caps in the fiscal year 2020/21 are 
expected to support the economy in the near term, more than offsetting the signs of 
weakness in the manufacturing sector
. Financial conditions remain supportive owing 
to the Federal Open Market Committee™s monetary easing. At the same time, the 
ongoing trade tensions and a less favourable external environment increase 
uncertainty about the economic outlook.
 In Japan, econom
ic activity 
remains subdued as weak exports offset robust 
domestic consumption.
 Real GDP grew at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the second 
quarter, reflecting the rather weak underlying growth momentum. The global economic 
slowdown had a negative impact on Ja
pan™s export
-oriented economy, which 
dampened business sentiment among large manufacturers. Consumption supported 
growth, partly owing to frontloading ahead of the increase in the value added tax from 
8% to 10% in October 2019. However, the overall persona
l consumption momentum 
remains limited amid the adverse impact of bad weather conditions, eroding consumer 
confidence and muted wage increases. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy on 
hold in September and mentioned the need to ﬁre
-examineﬂ economic and 
price 
developments at the October meeting.
 Meanwhile, inflation remained subdued, 
despite a tight labour market. 
Annual headline CPI inflation
 eased further to 0.2% in 
September, while core inflation 
excluding food and energy 
slowed to 0.3%
. In the United 
Kingdom, 
Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on the economic 
outlook.
 Real G
DP 
declined by 0.2% in quarter
-on-quarter terms in the second 
quarter. This reflected, in large part, an offset to the stronger growth seen in the first 
quarter, which was mainly
 supported by stockbuilding in the run
-up to the initial Brexit 
deadline at the end of March. Looking ahead, survey indicators suggest further 
weakening of consumption, business investment and export growth in the final 
quarters of 2019, as Brexit
-related 
uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment. At the 
same time, further fiscal spending, announced by the Government in September, is 
expected to put GDP growth in positive territory for the remainder of the year.
 In China, GDP growth 
remains subdued as cyc
lical headwinds add to the 
structural slowdown
. Real GDP 
slowed
 to
 6.0% in year
-on-year terms in the third 
quarter of 20
19 owing to a decelerating net export contribution. Industrial production 
and investment softened further in August, highlighting the growing toll on Chinese 
manufacturers from the trade tensions with the United States. On the upside, the

  8 manufacturing PMI re
turned to above the neutral threshold in September, possibly 
signalling a bottoming
-out of the manufacturing sector. In addition, car sales recovered 
somewhat in August from the lows in early 2019, but their annual growth remains in 
negative territory. Ove
rall, China™s growth slowdown is due to both cyclical and 
structural factors. The structural slowdown is driven by a rebalancing of the economy 
away from investment, and implies a slowdown of potential growth that mainly reflects 
a slower pace of capital a
ccumulation and unfavourable demographics. At the same 
time, cyclical headwinds, reflecting weaker manufacturing activity amid uncertainty 
relating to the trade tensions, add downward pressure on growth. Fiscal and monetary 
policy measures remain supportiv
e, with the aim of stabilising growth.

0.35% and 1.47%, leaving the GDP
-weighted spread for the euro area unchanged at

 Broad indices of euro area equity prices 
rose on the back of a decrease in the 
equity risk premium.
 Over the review period eq
uity prices of euro area 
financials
 and non-financial corporations (NFCs) increased by 5.2% and 0.2% respectively. The 
negative effect on equity prices stemming from higher risk
-free rates and somewhat 
lower longer
-term earnings expectations was more than 
offset by a reduction in the 
equity risk premium,
 which may partly reflect
 some relaxation of global trade tensions 
and of imminent
 Brexit
-related risks
. Euro area corporate bond spreads

 over the review period.

 The EONIA forward curve shifted

 over the review period, indicating 
lower market expectations of another DFR cut
. The curve reaches a low of

 Notes: The 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) is expressed as a deviation from 50 divided by 10. The latest observations are for the 
second
 quarter of 2019 for employment, 
September
 2019 for the PMI and 
August
 2019 for the unemployment rate.
 Rising employment continues to support household income and consumer 
spending.
 Private consumption rose by 0.
2%, quarter on quarter, in the 
second
 quarter of 2019, 
following somewhat 
stronger 
growth
 in the previous quarter. 
Household real disposable income 
has been largely insulated from the recent 
economic
 slowdown. Annual growth of real gross disposable income rose from 
2.1
% in the 
first
 quarter to 2.
2% in the 
second
 quarter. 
Overall, e
mployment growth has 
remained resilient 
during
 the slowdown, supporting
 labour income. In addition, lower 
direct taxes and social 
security 
contributions, reflecting fiscal measures in a number of 
euro area countries
, have contributed positively to households™ purchasing power
. The 
saving ratio increased further in the second 
quarter of 2019, as income growth 
outpaced consumption growth.
 Looking ahead, p
rivate consumption 
should
 continue to 
grow
 steadily
. Recent 
data on the volume of retail sales and new passenger car registrations point to 
somewhat lower consumption growth 
in the 
third 
quarter of 2019
 compared with the 
second quarter
. 
However, o
ther indicators support the picture of steady consumption 
dynamics. 
Consumer confidence, which 
started to 
declin
e at 
the end of 2017, 
has 
stabilised 
in the 
course of 2019 and stood in
 October close to the level recorded at the 
beginning of the year
. The latest survey results 
also 
signal 
favourable
 labour market
 conditions
, which should continue to support househol
d income and consumer 
spending.
 Business investment is expected to 
remain
 subdued in a context of elevated 
uncertainty and low profit margins, while nevertheless supported by 
favourable 
financing conditions
. Non
-construction investment rose by 11%, quarter on quarter, 
in the second quarter of 2019. This was largely due to a str
ong increase in Ireland, 
reflecting the openness and 
volatil
e capital flows of the Irish economy
. Incoming data 
suggest ongoing but moderate business investment growth in the euro area in the 
near term. I

 Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be 
supported by 
favourable financing conditions.
 In addition, growth should be underpinned by 
further employment gains
, rising wages and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ expansion in global activity. The results of the latest round of the

(see the box entitled ﬁ
A new method for the package holiday price index in Germany and its impact on HICP inflation rates

stood at 1.1% in September, where it has remained sin
ce May. Signals from other 
measures of underlying inflation, including the Persistent and Common Component of 
Inflation (PCCI) indicator and the Supercore indicator,

market
-based probability of deflation remains contained, despite exhibiting a 
continued upward trend over the review period. At the same time, the forward profile of 
market
-based 
indicators
 of inflation expectations continues to point to a prolonged 
period of low inflation. The results of the 
ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters
 (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2019 show point forecasts for annual HICP inflation 
averaging 1.2%, 1.2% and 1.4% for 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. These results 
represent downward revisions of 0.1 percentage
 points for 2019 and 2021 and of 0.2 
percentage points for 2020 compared with the previous survey round. The revisions 
are mainly attributable to lower oil prices, a weaker growth outlook, downward 
surprises in recent inflation outcomes and heightened unce
rtainties regarding trade 
and Brexit. Average longer
-term inflation expectations remained at 1.7%.
                                                                     3  This was related to a permanent reduction in employers™ social security contributions in France, replacing

  20 The annual growth of loans to the private sector 
was broadly unchanged.
 The 
annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, 
securitisation and notional cash pooling) 
increased to 3.
8% in 
August 2019
, 
from
 3.7% in 
July
 (see 
Chart
 10). 
This development was mainly 
due to the increase in the annual
 growth rate of loans to 
NFCs
 to 
4.3% in 
August
, 
from 4
.0% in 
July, in part due to a 
one-off factor
. Loans to households grew at an annual rate of 3.
4% in 
August 2019,
 unchanged from 
July.
 In this respect, the turning point in September 2018 for loan 
growth to NFCs (
when it peaked at 
4.3%) is in line with its lagging cyclical pattern with 
respect to real economic activity and the 2018
 slowdown in aggregate demand. 
Based 
on the same patt
ern, past improvements in 
fixed investment, which accounts for a 
large share of 
the growth in 
lending to NFCs, stabilised
 loan developments. 
Overall, 
loan growth 
continue
d to benefit from historically low bank lending rates
 and the
 overall 
favourable 
suppl
y of bank loans
, as also evidenced by the recent results of the 
euro area bank lending survey
. In addition, banks have made progress in 
consolidating their ba
lance sheets
. Chart 10
 Loans to the private sector
 (annual growth rate)
  Source: ECB.
 Notes: Loans are adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash pooling. The latest observation is for 
August 
2019. According to the October 2019
 euro area bank lending survey
, credit standards 
for loans to enterprises and households for house purchases eased slightly.
 Risk perceptions related to the econ
omic outlook continued to make a tightening 
contribution
, whereas i
n the previous round
 banks had expected unchanged credit 
standards (banks™ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria)
. Despite
 ongoing 
pressure from competition
, and 
mainly driven by wi
der margins on riskier loans
, credit 
terms and conditions (the actual conditions laid down in the loan contract) for loans to 
NFCs and housing loans tightened
 in the third quarter of 2019
. 
Benefiting from the low 
interest rate environment
, demand for loans
 continued to increase for both housing 
loans and consumer credit
. Favourable housing market prospects also continued to 
support demand for housing loans. At the same time, 
demand remained broadly 
stable for loans to enterprises. 
This happened because, f
or the first time since 2013, 
inventories and recourse to working capital contributed negatively to loan demand

also reported
 that 
the negative deposit facility rate 
had contributed to an increase in lending volumes and 
a decrease in lending rates across all loan categories, 
but ha
d had a negative
 impact 
on their net interest income
. Lending rates have continued to moderate in line with market reference rates, 
thereby supporting euro area economic growth
. In 
August 
2019 the composite 
bank lending rate
s for 
both 
loans to NFCs 
and housing loans reached new historical 
lows,
 at 
1.52% and 1.56% respectively
 (see Chart
 11). 
Competitive pressures and 
more favourable bank funding costs dampened
 lending
 rates for loans to euro area 
NFCs and households. Overall, composite bank lending
 rates
 for loans to NFCs and 
households have fallen significantly since the ECB™s credit
 easing measures were 
announced in June 2014. Between May 2014 and 
August 
2019 composite lending 
rates on loans to NFCs and households fell by around 140 and 13
5 basis points
, respectively.
 The reduction in bank lending rates 
for
 loans to NFCs
, including those for 
loans to small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to •0.25
 million are 
primarily 
granted to small firms) was particularly significant in those euro area cou
ntries that 
were most exposed to the financial crisis. 
Overall, t
his indicates a more uniform 
transmission of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and 
across 
firm sizes.

 Notes: Composite bank lending rates are calculated by aggregating short and long

business volumes. The latest observation is for 
August

et issuance of 
debt securities
 by euro area NFCs 
was slightly 
negative, but this did not stop the upward trend in annual flows that started at 
the beginning of 2019.
 The latest ECB data indicate that, on a net basis, the total flow 
of debt securities issue
d by NFCs 
was slightly negative 
in 
August 2019. However, the 
negative reading in August is in line with the series™ seasonal pattern and is affected by 
the redemption of debt securities issued by a single NFC in one Member State.

 Notes: Monthly figures based on a 12

August 2019
. Financing costs for euro area NFCs 
are estimated to have declined since 
August 2019
. The
 overall nominal cost of external financing for NFCs, comprising 
bank lending, debt issuance in the marke
t and equity finance, 
stood at 
4.7% in August
 2019, but
 is projected
 to 
have declined more recently to levels close to those recorded 
in the spring and
 early summer of 2019. As a result, t
he cost of financing 
in October 
2019 is estimated to 
be 15 basis points above the historical low of 
April 2019,
 but far 
below the levels observed in 
the 
summer
 of 2014. 
The estimated decline 
in the cost of 
financing 
sin
ce August 2019 is entirely accounted for by the decline in
 the 
cost of 
equity
, which is only partially balanced by a slight increase in the c
ost of market
-based 
debt, which hit its historical low in August 2019. Since August 
the cost of equity 
has 
declined
 because of lower risk premia,
 reflecting
, among other things,
 some relaxation 
of global trade tensions and Brexit
-related risks
. The slight increase since August in 
the cost of market
-based debt reflects the increase in the long
-term risk free rate, 
which
 may be related to, among other factors, a reduction in market expectations of 
further interest rate cuts.

 Goodbye EONIA, welcome •STR!

  Goodbye EONIA, welcome •STR!
 1Prepared by Pascal Nicoloso and Vladimir Tsonchev
 On 2 October 2019, the ECB 
began
 publishing the new overnight 
unsecured 
benchmark rate for the euro area, the euro short
-term rate or •STR.
 The rate is 
computed entirely based on transactions 
in euro with financial counterparties as 
reported under 
the Money Market Statistical Reporting (
MMSR
) Regulation 
(Regulation (
EU) 
No 
1333/2014
) and reflects the wholesale euro unsecured borrowing 
costs of euro area banks
5, in contrast to EONIA that measured interbank lending
. The 
rate is published on each TARGET2 business day at 
08:00 
CET
 and is based on 
transactions conducted an
d settled on the previous TARGET2 business day. 
A data 
sufficiency policy 
ensures that t
he rate 
is representative by requiring that 
(a) 
at least
 20 
of 
the
 banks 
currently reporting under the MMSR Regulation 
should 
submit 
contributions
 and (b) the 
five 
largest reporting agents should not report more than 75% 
of a given day
™s turnover
. On 2 October
 2019, following the recommendations of a private sector working group
6 and a public consultation, the administrator of EONIA, the European Money Markets 
Instit
ute, changed the EONIA methodology so that
, until its discontinuation on 3 
January 2022
, 
it is determined as a fixed spread of 8.5 basis points over 
the 
•STR. 
This effectively puts an end to a 20
-year period 
in which
 EONIA was the reference for 
short
-term 
interest rates for the euro area.
 The 
launch
 of the •STR was successful from both a technical and a market 
perspective.
 The 
launch
 of the new reference rate and the change 
to
 the 
EONIA 
methodology had been well communicated 
to 
and anticipated by the 
financial industry
, resulting in
 no serious disruptions. For example, internal systems were adjusted to 
take into account the new timing 
for publishing
 the reference rate 
(in the morning of the 
day following the reference date
). Moreover, the first transac
tions indexed to 
the 
•STR 
in the 
over
-the
-counter 
swap market took place
, as did
 the
 first securities issuances.
 The 
process for producing
 the •STR
 on a daily basis
 has worked smoothly and 
reliably 
thanks to
 the commitment of the entire Eurosystem and the 
banks 
reporting under
 the MMSR
 Regulation
. Moreover, the •STR methodology has 
shown its r
eliability
, as illustrated by two examples. First, the pass
-through of the 
ECB™s deposit facility rate cut on 18 September
 was full and immediate, as shown by 
pre
-•STR
 data, 
and since 1 October the rate 
and distribution of the underlying 
transactions at the 25th and 75th percentiles
 have
 remained fairly stable
, with volumes 
ranging between 
•29 billion and 
•35 billion (
see Chart
 A). Second, the bank holiday in 
Germany on 3 October 2019 had a negligible impact on the rate and its various 
                                                                    5  For more information on the •STR and the statement of methodology, see the ECB™s

orking group on euro risk

with

a comfortable gap remained between the

 Developments in the services sector and its relationship with manufacturing
  25  Developments in the services sector and 
its 
relationship 
2with manufacturing
 Prepared by Magnus Forsells
, Neale Kennedy
 and 
Lisa Marie Timm
 This box looks at the euro area services sector and its relationship with 
manufacturing, focusing 
particul
arly 
on the extent to which the services sector 
could be affected by the recent slowdown in manufacturing.
 Economic
 growth 
in 
the euro area has been slower 
in 
recent
 quarters, mainly reflecting the impact on the 
euro area manufacturing sector of 
the 
ongoing weakness in international trade in an 
environment of prolonged global uncertainties. However, activity levels in the services 
sector ha
ve so far 
been relatively robust in the face of
 th
is downturn 
in manufacturing
. 
This is likely to stem from the r
esilient developments in domestic demand, supported 
by the very accommodative monetary policy stance, which continues to support labour 
markets and create favourable financing conditions. 
The services sector is 
an important
 driver of overall economic activ
ity in the euro area
, constitut
ing
 over 70% of 
total value added
. The services sector is very heterogeneous
. Considering
 services as a whole, it is 
useful to distinguish between market and non
-market services. The latter, comprising 
sectors such as educati
on and health services, 
constitutes
 around one
-third of total 
services
. Its growth
 tends to
 be relatively
 stable
 and non-cyclical (see Chart 
A), as it 
was
 in the economic expansion
 starting in 2013 (following the 
sovereign
 debt crisis) 
and has been during 
the economic slowdown starting in 2018
. Market services 
typically 
exhibit
 more cyclical 
growth patterns. This sub
-group of services 
include
s diverse sectors such as wholesale
/retail trade and real estate services (
constituting 
some 
15% and 11% of total val
ue added respectively)
, which are 
more oriented 
towards consumer
s, 
as well as finance and 
insurance activities (5% of value added) 
and other more business
-oriented services
. Unlike the manufacturing sector, these 
sectors have 
continued to expand at 
relativ
ely strong
 rates in recent quarters

 Developments in the services sector and its relationship with manufacturing
  26 The risk of spillovers from manufacturing to services 
is
 particularly 
relevant 
in 
the area of business services
. Developments i
n a number of sectors which together 
may be classified as business services are shown in Chart 
B. These sectors cover a 
part of transportation
; a part of information technology and service activities
; professional, scientific and technical 
services;
 and so
me administrative and support 
services. Together they comprise around 14% of total value added. Although these 
sectors generally shared 
the pattern of a 
downturn 
during 
the financial crisis in 
2008-09, they remained fairly resilient in 2011
-12. D
uring the 
latest slowdown in 
manufacturing
, they have 
mostly continued to increase at 
a robust pace. At the same 
time, growth rates have varied significantly across different sectors in recent years. 
Those which are more knowledge
-intensive appear to have been growi
ng very rapidly, 
but there is also some evidence that activity in 
other
 sectors flattened out 
at 
around the 
turn of the year

 Analysis of the correlation between the manufacturing sector and different 
parts of the services sector confirms different degrees of 
co-movement, 
particularly during cyclical downturns
. The main co
-movement between 
manufacturing and services 
is for
 parts of market services, including business 
services
. Five
-year rolling correlations of the annual growth rates of market
, non-market and business services with manufacturing are shown in Char
t 
C. The 
correlations vary over time, 
particularly the correlation between non
-market services 
and manufacturing, which declines during 
the recession periods. It has been higher in 
the last few years
, when
 there has been positive and stable growth in both 
sectors. In 
market and business services, on the other hand, the correlations are generally much 
higher 
and more stable 
over the whole sample period
. Recently
, though, they have
 fallen
, possibly because
 domestic demand 
has been more resilient

not changed much in recent quarters (Chart

However, more timely survey results have recently declined
, suggesting a slowdown 
in growth
. Thus, developments in business services, as well as other important 
services sectors, need to be monitored closely in coming months for signs of spillovers

 A stylised tracer for labour market cycles in the euro area
 based on assessments by corporate executives
  29  A stylised tracer for labour market cycles in the euro area
 3based on assessments by corporate executives
 Prepared by Vasco Botelho
 This box assesses the current cyclical position of the euro area labour market 
by means of a stylised tracer for employment a
nd output fluctuations using the 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) survey data.
 The 
PMI is a set of monthly 
indicators which, owing to their timeliness and monthly frequency, can be used to 
predict movements in the growth rate of key macroeconomic variables
, such as 
employment and real GDP. However, the monthly PMI data can also be very volatile 
over time, as they contain information not only on structural factors and the cyclical 
position of the economy, but also on assessments by corporate executives regar
ding 
the immediate reactions of their firms to idiosyncratic events over time. This latter 
component of the PMI data is likely to be affected by possible measurement errors or 
by information asymmetries. As such, a stylised labour market tracer
7 is constru
cted 
by applying a low
-pass filter to the underlying monthly PMI data on employment and 
output, with a view to smoothing the PMI data and isolating the relevant information in 
order to assess the current cyclical position of the labour market.
 The stylised
 tracer for labour market cycles in the euro area is created by 
juxtaposing the developments in the PMI tracer for employment with those of 
the PMI tracer for output.
 If the PMI tracer for employment shows a level above 
(below) 50, it implies that employme
nt is expected to grow (decline) that month. The 
same holds for the relationship between the level of the PMI tracer for output and 
expected developments in real GDP that month. Given the interpretability of PMI data 
to aggregate developments in employment
 and GDP, the stylised tracer for the labour 
market cycles in the euro area is created 
visually 
by plotting t
he levels of the PMI 
tracer
s for employment and output against their respective month
-on-month 
variations. This allows four positions in the labour market 
cycle to be identified
: 
(1) 
a level above 50 
and which shows a
 month
-on-month
 increase
 is interpreted as an 
expansion; 
(2) a leve
l above 50 but 
falling
 month on 
month 
indicates
 a slowdown
; (3) 
a level 
below 50 but decreasing is considered 
to
 indicat
e a downturn; 
(4) 
when the 
level 
is below 50 but shows monthly improvements
, this denotes a recovery
. 
In addition
, a 
local peak (or trou
gh) is achieved whenever the tracer 
shows no change over the 
month and is 
at a level above (or below) 50
.                                                                     7  The approach undertaken in this box is similar to the Economic Climate Tracer (ECT) developed by the 
European Commission and applied to its Business and Consumer Survey
s. For further details on how to 
produce the ECT, please see the related 
methodological documentation
. Information
 on the most recent 
ECT can be accessed in the European Commission™s publication ﬁ
European Business Cycle Indicators: 
3r
d Quarter 2019
ﬂ. The data visualisation techniques employed in this box are
 comparable to those used 
by the European Commission. The stylised tracer in this box differs from the ECT, as it uses the 
approximate bandpass filter developed in 
Christiano, L.
 J. and Fitzgerald, T.
 J., ﬁThe Band Pass Filterﬂ, 
International 
Economic
 Revi
ew
, Vol. 44, No 2, 2003, pp. 435
-465, which allows for a decomposition of 
each PMI indicator into a trend component, a cyclical component and a high frequency component able 
to capture the exuberance of changes in the PMI data and link them to very short f
luctuations in the 
economy (cycles shorter than six quarters). The stylised tracer in this box is then constructed as the sum 
of the trend and cyclical components for the PMI for employment. A similar approach is applied to the PMI 
for output to compare th
e current cyclical position of the labour market with that of economic activity.

 A stylised tracer for labour market cycles in the euro area
 based on assessments by corporate executives
  30 The stylised labour market tracer for the euro area points towards a slowdown 
in the labour market since February 2018, with the tracer for employment
 lagging that for output.
8 Chart A shows the cyclical position of the euro area labour 
market over the past seven years, from September 2012 to September 2019. The 
cyclical assessment by corporate executives of their firms™ employment and 
production develo
pments is a leading indicator for the aggregate developments in 
hard data, in particular at the start of the current recovery. According to the stylised 
tracers based on the PMI for employment and output, the euro area labour market has 
experienced a recov
ery since December 2012, while output has been on a recovery 
path since September 2012. This is a couple of months earlier than the official trough 
announced for the euro area economy by the Centre for Economic Policy Research™s 
Euro Area B
usiness 
Cycle 
Dating 
Committee
. In September 2019 the euro area labour 
market is still assessed as being in slowdown territory, with the tracer for employment 
in slowdown territory since February 2018 and the tracer for output since October 
2017. As such, current employme
nt and output fluctuations are seen to be consistent 
with a more mature phase in the cycle, which is usually characterised by movements 
within the expansion
-slowdown territory.

 Note: The latest observation is for September
 2019. The slowdown in the euro area
 labour market
 is 
characterised by a
 dichotomy 
between
 weakness in
 the 
manufacturing 
sector 
and 
resilience in the 
services
 sector (see Chart B).
9 The tracer for employment suggests that the labour market in 
                                                                    8  The lagging developments in employment compared with those for output 
are consistent with the 
existence 
of 
adjustment costs to the labour input 
or with 
labour market rigidi
ties at firm level
. As such, the 
stylised labour market tracer provides evidence that 
firms consider adjusting other factors of production 
(including changes in the i
ntensive margin of labour input
) in response to fluctuations in their production 
levels
 be
fore optimising their respective employment lev
els through adjustments to their
 hiring and firing 
processes
. The lagged response of employment to GDP is also apparent in the national accounts data,

 A stylised tracer for labour market

 based on assessments by corporate executives
  31 manufacturing entered a downturn in May 2019, three months later th
an output, after 
having been assessed as being in slowdown territory since December 2017. At the 
same time, employment in the services sector is perceived to be moving within the 
expansion
-slowdown territory, with the tracer for employment in this sector b
eing more 
resilient than the tracer for employment in manufacturing. The resilience of 
employment in the services sector seems broadly consistent with the developments in 
economic activity in the sector, despite the month
-on-month variations in the tracer 
for 
output becoming slightly more negative in recent months. Meanwhile the tracer for 
output in manufacturing entered downturn territory, which could signal potential risks

Heuristically, as employment developments lag behind changes in economic activity 
for both sectors, the transmission of the weakness in manufacturing to output 
developments in the services sector makes close monitoring of the euro area labour

 A stylised tracer for labour market cycles in the euro area
 based on a
ssessments by corporate executives
  32 Using a more granular approach to assess the current position in the labour 
market cycle suggests that the weakness in 
manufacturing
 is more prevalent in
 the 
capital goods and motor vehicles industries
, while the resilience of the 
services sector is broad
-based across industries.
 In
 September 
2019 the 
weakness in employment in the manufacturing sector is tracked as being most 
prevalent among capital goods and int
ermediates, in particular the manufacturing of 
rubber and plastic, the manufacturing of machinery and equipment, and the motor 
vehicles industries. The weakness in employment in the manufacturing sector is not 
observed in the cyclical position of the indus
tries producing consumer goods, a sector 
that is supported by robust domestic demand despite the current slowdown in 
economic activity.
10 On the other hand, the performance of the services sector labour 
market remains broad
-based within the expansion
-slowdown territories, with 
employment developments in services sector industries showing a degree of 
resilience to the current weakness in man
ufacturing.
 Overall
, these results suggest that the services sector continues to support 
employment growth in the euro area, while employment in manufacturing has 
been weaker since May 2019.
 The question is whether there will be any negative 
spillovers fro
m manufacturing to services
, 
particularly of
 weaknesses 
stemming 
from
 the transportation industry
.11 According to the
 tracer 
for
 output
, transportation 
has weakened
 in 2019, in parallel with the observed weakness in manufacturing. As such, 
there are downwar
d risks from a possible propagation of the weakness in 
transportation 
to 
other services sector industries
 owing
 to 
its
 centrality in the 
relationship between manufacturing and services. Looking ahead, and given that the 
tracer 
for
 employment seems to be la
gging changes in the tracer for output, the 
downward risk o
f transmission of the weakness in manufacturing to the services 
sector strengthen
s the need for 
close
 monitoring of the euro area labour market. As a 
caveat, the stylised tracer 
discussed 
in this b
ox should be 
treated
 with caution 
during
 periods characterised by high uncertainty and around cyclical turning points, as the 
methodological approach can be somewhat prone to large changes
 induced by new 
data releases.
                                                                       10  See the box entitled 
ﬁUnderstanding the slowdown in growth in 2018
ﬂ, Economic Bull

 11  These transmission channels can be either domestic or foreign in nature, as described in the box entitled 
ﬁDomestic versus foreign factors behind the fall in euro area industrial productionﬂ
, Economic Bulletin
, Issue
 6, ECB, 2019. In particular, the relevant external shocks for the transportation industry could 
encompass weaker foreign demand or changes in oil
 prices, while the relevant adverse domestic shock 
would come from a weakening in the demand for the transportation industry coming through the domestic 
weakness in manufacturing. See Burstein et al., ﬁDistribution costs and real exchange rate dynamics 
dur

-based stabilizationsﬂ,

, Vol. 50(6), 2003, pp.

-1214 for details on the interlinkages in production between transportation and other industries.
 This 
paper provides evidence on the centrality of the transp
ortation industry in the relationship between 
manufacturing and the remaining services sector, by showing that distribution costs are an important 
component of the selling price (and costs) of retail products for final consumers.

 This box

. Firms
™ price
-setting strategie

 crucial
 pointers for
 understand
ing
 how prices adjust to shocks 
and
, therefore
, implicitly 
the 
effect of monetary policy on inflation. Surveys 
are
 a useful
 tool 
for
 collating
 evidence 
in 
this regard,
 as illustrated, 
in particular
, in 
the seminal work of Blinder
12. Survey 
evidence 
of the pric
e-sett
ing behaviour of firms in the euro area was 
collated
 some 
time ago in the context of the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network (see Fabiani 
et al
., 2005
13). Our survey draws on elements of those earlier surveys, while also
 gathering more qualitative evidence concerning the various dimensions of 
price
-setting.
 The main objective of the survey was to obtain an overview of how firms set 
prices, including the following specific dimensions.
 Do firms discriminate across 
geographi
cal markets, by type of customer or sales platform? How often do they 
typically review and change their prices? What considerations do firms take into 
account when setting prices? Which aspects of price
-setting behaviour are likely to 
give rise to sluggish
 price adjustment? R
esponses were received from 58
 leading 
non-financial comp
anies
 that operate across the euro area. The global sales of these 
firms would be the equivalent of around 
2% of euro area economy
-wide output
. The 
firms are split roughly equally
 between industrial and services sector activities. The 
sample can also be split roughly equally between: (i) firms which mainly supply 
consumers; (ii) firms which supply businesses which mainly supply consumers; and 
(iii) firms which supply businesses whi
ch, in turn, mainly supply other businesses. In 
other words, responses were obtained from firms at various points in the supply chain.
 Most firms said that they vary their prices by geographical market and by type 
of customer (see Chart A).
 Varying prices 
by geographical market was seen to be 
necessary in order to adapt to local demand and supply conditions. Many firms said 
that they faced different local production costs, including labour, skills, tax, regulatory 
and logistical costs. Differences in locall
y-supplied inputs could also affect product 
quality. 
Customer preferences 
also varied across geographical regions, thus
 requir
ing
 different branding and/or service levels
. As to varying prices by 
type of customer
, in
 business
-to
-business sales, the volume 
of the contract 
was significant
, with 
the
 imperative to attract and retain strategic customers. 
Respondents also 
cited 
the 
importance of 
distinguishing between wholesale and retail and/or between 
professional and private 
customers
. Finally, discounts 
could
 be given to 
certain 
customers depending on 
how high 
the 
risk of losing them was assessed to be

tting behaviour: insights from a survey of large firms
  34 Most firms stated that their prices did not depend on the sales platform.
 Hence, 
for example, 
most firms charged the same price for online sales as for sales i
n the 
store or 
over
 the phone. 
However, the prices of 
some 
products differed from prices of 
equivalent products sold on other platforms, simply because they 
were only available 
online
. Compared to equivalent products 
available on 
other
 platforms
, costs for
 these 
online products were lower, warranted by the fact that that they involved fewer 
services. In business
-to
-business segments, prices for equivalent products would 
often differ in bulk contracts as compared to tenders or market
-based transactions.

ed prices "irregularly

 only those

ypical frequency of price

s. The frequency of price reviews and changes tends to be highest in the retail 
sector and lowest in consumer and business services, with the manufacturing 
sector somewhere in between
. Most retailers who repli
ed to the survey said that 
they reviewed their prices on a monthly, weekly or even daily basis, depending on their 
range of products. They also tended to change prices with considerable frequency. In 
the manufacturing sector, price reviews were typically c
arried out monthly, however, 
prices usually only changed on a quarterly, semi
-annual or annual basis. Meanwhile, if 
we exclude retail trade and transport (where prices are driven in part by the fuel 
element), the majority of respondents in other services s
ectors said that they typically 
reviewed and changed prices annually. Still, identifying a ﬁtypicalﬂ frequency of price 
review and/or change is clearly difficult for firms with a large range of products and 
different customer or contract types.
 When settin
g prices, firms pay most attention to their competitors™ prices, 
closely followed by supply costs and 
product 
demand
 (see Chart C)
. In the 
survey
, respondents were given a list of factors and asked to judge whether these 
were ﬁnot importantﬂ, ﬁimportantﬂ o
r ﬁvery importantﬂ when setting prices. 
When 
scoring 
their
 answers 
with 
ﬁ0ﬂ, ﬁ1ﬂ 
or ﬁ2ﬂ respectively, respondents overall considered 
their competitors™ prices 
to be 
the most important factor when setting prices. This was 
closely followed by 
the cost of 
raw
 materials and other supply costs and 
the 
demand 
for the 
given 
product or service. 
Labour costs were also deemed important.
15 The 
importance of competitors™ prices appears greater the closer the business is to the 
consumer, whereas further upstream, cost an
d demand cons
iderations play a more 
significant role.
                                                                     15  Whether or not ﬁlabour costsﬂ or ﬁraw material costs and other supply costsﬂ were deemed important 
depends, in large part, on the company™s cost base. If these two factors are considered together, then 
ﬁinput 
costsﬂ would be the single most important consideration for these firms when setting prices.

 Trends in central banks™ foreign currency reserves and the case of the
 ECB
  39 Article
  Trends in central banks™ foreign currency reserves and the 
1cas
e of the ECB
 Prepared by Livia
 
, Joaquim Gomes and Rolf Pauli
 This article begins with a review of the global trends in central banks™ foreign currency 
reserve holdings in terms of their size, adequacy and composition, and follows on to 
examine the 
ECB™s foreign currency reserves. Just as
 the 
reasons
 for holding 
reserves 
have changed
 over time and across countries, 
so too have 
the size 
and composition of those reserves. Views on appropriate adequacy metrics have also 
changed. Global foreign currency 
reserves grew markedly after the Asian financial 
crisis of the late 1990s, with emerging markets accumulating large reserves to 
self
-insure against potential shocks. In some cases, the growth in reserves was a 
by-product of export
-led growth strategies. Wh
ile global foreign currency reserves 
have traditionally been invested primarily in US dollar
-denominated financial assets, in 
recent years holdings have become more diversified in terms of both currency and 
asset
 classes.
 The second section of the article 
describes how the ECB™s foreign currency reserves 
are invested in the light of its main purpose, which is 
to ensure that the Eurosystem 
has a sufficient amount of liquid resources
 whenever they are needed
 for its foreign 
exchange policy operations involvin
g non
-EU currencies
. The investment framework 
includes three layers of governance, representing: i) the strategic investment policy; ii) 
medium
-term tactical positioning; and iii) day
-to
-day portfolio management. The way 
in which the framework involves the
 national central banks (NCBs) of the Eurosystem 
in the active management of the ECB™s foreign currency reserves is both unique and 
intricate. The article describes this active management approach, the internal 
competition between NCB portfolio managers an
d the diversification of portfolio 
management styles that the framework fosters.
 1 Trends in central banks™ foreign reserve holdings
 Foreign currency reserves generally refer to readily available holdings in 
monetary authorities
™ safe external assets
. These authorities are, typically, the 
central bank, the Treasury or the Ministry of Finance of the country concerned.
 Total
 official reserves are the broadest defini
tion of international reserves, including 
both 
foreign currency reserves and non

reserves
. 
Foreign currency reserves
, 
which

,

16 1.1
 Main objectives of holding foreign currency reserves
 Foreign currency reserves are an important element of the macro
-policy toolkit.
 A number of countries developed the practice of holding foreign currency reserves in 
the mid
-nineteenth century to back their liabilities and domestic currency with a view to 
supplementing their gold and silver reserves.
17 Since then, the 
reasons for
 hold
ing foreign currency
 reserves have evolved 
over time and across countries. 
One possible 
use of 
foreign currency 
reserves, common to both advanced and emerging market 
economies, is to 
enable them to carry out
 foreign exchange interventions, if deemed 
necessa
ry. In emerging markets, foreign currency reserves serve a broader range of 
purposes.
 Foreign currency reserves are generally held for traditional operational 
purposes as well as for precautionary and non
-precautionary policy
 objectives.
 Traditional
 operat
ional purposes include
 facilitating regular international debt and 
import
-related payments made on behalf of the government
; smoothing 
out 
payment 
schedules; 
serving as collateral to relax 
external borrowing constraints; or 
underpinning 
monetary polic
y wit
h respect to liquidity operations.
18 From a 
precautionary perspective, countries hold reserves 
as a buffer to 
absorb or self
-insure 
against 
balance
 of payment
 shocks, including sudden stops in international capital 
flows; to provide 
foreign currency
 liquidi
ty to banks in stressed situations; and to 
mitigate volatility in foreign exchange markets
.19 In countries with non
-floating 
exchange rates, 
reserves 
act as a 
buffer 
to cover monetary liabilities
. 
Countries with 
                                                                    16  Views 
regarding 
which
 assets should be 
considered
 as official reserves have evolved over time, with the 
IMF providing a harmonised framework for central banks™ 
reporting around the world. Since 2001 the IMF 
has published guidelines for reporting data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. 
According to the definition 
in the
 sixth edition of the
 IMF
™s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6), reserve 
as
sets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for 
meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the 
currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes, 
such as maintaining confidence in the currency 
and the economy, and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing
. 17  The
 National Bank of Belgium was the first central bank 
to begin
 accumulating foreign
 currency
- denominated assets
, which
 it used in foreign ex
change market intervention and
 other operations. 
Other 
central banks followed
 this practice, 
because safe and liquid assets 
denominated in a currency readily 
convertible into gold,
 such as 
the pound 
sterling, the French franc or the 
Deutsche
 Mark
, offered 
advantages over gold itself, as they made it 
possible to economise gold, their supply was not dependent 
on 
haphazard mining discoveries and they were remunerated (see

 Trends in central banks™ foreign currency reserves and the case of the ECB
  41 exchange rate flexibility need lower reserve 
holdings, as 
the exchange rate
 can act as 
a buffer and help absorb external shocks
. 
However, exchange rate adjustment can 
also have adverse consequences, for instance i
f there are 
large currency mismatches 
or 
foreign currency exposures on 
the country™s external 
balance sheet
. Foreign 
currency r
eserves can
, in that case, 
play a stabil
ising
 role
 as they 
may discourage
 one-way bets during 
episodes of financial 
stress.
20 Other studies point to 
non-precautionary or mercantilist motives, suggestin
g that economies accumulate
 foreign currency 
reserves to 
prevent their exchange rate from appreciating, the aim 
being to maintain external competitiveness and promote 
export
-led growth
.21 As 
for
 the ECB, the main purpose of holding foreign currency reserves
 is to 
ensure that the Eurosystem has a sufficient amount of liquid resources
, whenever needed
, for its foreign exchange policy operations involving non
-EU 
currencies.
 The euro™s external value is not a policy target for the ECB.
22 Against this 
background, 
the ECB™s rationale for holding foreign currency reserves is to be able to 
intervene in the foreign exchange market whenever needed, to prevent 
disorderly 
market conditions
 that could have an adverse impact on price stability in the euro area 
and at the gl
obal level. Such market conditions have been rare since the inception of 
the euro. The ECB™s foreign currency reserves were therefore only used to fund 
interventions in September/November 2000 and in March 2011.
23 1.2
 Size of global foreign currency reserve
s Total foreign currency reserves held globally increased to over USD 11 trillion at 
the end of 2018, a tenfold increase compared 
with
 30 years ago.
 Around 
two
-thirds of global foreign currency reserves are held by emerging and developing 
economies.
 After 
the Bretton Woods system
 was brought to an end
, global 
foreign 
currency 
reserve holdings
 grew sh
arply
, particularly among advanced economies, 
despite the fact that it was widely expected that the shift to floating exchange rates 
would reduce the appeal of holding foreign currency reserves.
24 Following

                                                                    20  Countries with less flexible exchange rates therefore tend to hold more reserves (as a share of GDP), 
although
 the holdings of countries with flexible regimes are also sizeable and have been rising since the 
global finan
cial crisis (see, for example, Cabezas, L and De Gregorio, J., ﬁAccumulation of reserves in 
emerging and developing countries: mercantilism versus insuranceﬂ,

 of the Bretton Woods

has

  42 crisis
, emerging market and commodity
-exportin
g economies also began 
accumulating sizeable foreign currency reserves, with China accounting for the largest 
share of that increase. Commodity
-exporting countries saw an even more rapid 
accumulation of reserves after 2005
, 
as surging
 commodity prices
 cont
ributed to their 
large balance of payment surpluses. T
he increase in foreign 
currency reserve 
holdings was
 widespread, with advanced economies™ holdings also increasing, albeit 
modestly. Global foreign currency reserve holdings continued to grow in the wak
e of 
the global financial crisis,
 as some countries were reluctant to
 use their 
reserves
, 
fearing that doing so might 
send a negative signal
 about potential exchange rate 
pressures.
25 More 
recent 
developments
 suggest
 that foreign currency 
reserves have 
leve
lled off 
since 2015 
(see 
Chart 1).
26 Research suggest
s that the significant accumulation of foreign currency 
reserves by emerging markets since the turn of the millennium 
has been
 driven 
by both precautionary and non
-precautionary motives.
 Most
 studies prov
ide t
wo 
main 
explanations
. One is that precautionary motives encourage 
countries 
to 
hold 
foreign 
currency reserves 
to manage 
situations of 
financial 
distress, mainly
 sudden 
stops in capital flows
, as discussed in Section 1.1. The lessons of the financial c
rises 
of the late 1990s led many emerging market countries to accumulate foreign currency 
reserves when opening up their economies to global trade and finance. Moreover, 
some of the Asian economies 
sought 
to self
-insure 
to avoid 
requesting external 
IMF
 financial
 assistance
. Other studies point to additional drivers of reserve accumulation 
related to potential vulnerabilities and market failures in the international monetary and 
financial system. These include 
uncertainty about international
 liquidity av
ailability in a 
financial crisis, capital flow volatility or 
global 
imbalances.
27 However, several studies 
have found that precautionary motives alone are not enough to explain the magnitude 
of the reserve accumulation of the 2000s. Non
-precautionary or m
ercantilis
t motives, 
whereby economies 
accumulate reserves 
to maintain external competiveness and 
boost exports
, have also played an important role.
28 There are, however, also costs 
associated with reserve accumulation, particularly when this accumulation is 
excessive.

 In the case of
 the ECB, its total official reserve assets, including both foreign 
currency and non
-foreign currency reserves, were equivalent to aro
und EUR 
68.6 billion at the end of 2018
.30 These reserves comprise around EUR 49 billion in 
foreign currencies (US dollar, Japanese yen and onshore Chinese renminbi) and 
around EUR 18.2 billion in gold, with the remaining assets held in IMF SDRs. Official 
reserves were initially transferred to the ECB by the NCBs of those EU Member States 
that had adopted the euro,
31 in proportion to their share in the ECB™s capital 
subscription
32. At the end of 2018
, t
he entire Eurosystem held EUR 719 billion 
in
 total officia
l 
reserve assets, including the ECB™s official reserve assets.
 As this figure 
indicates, the NCBs hold significant additional official reserves on top of those held by 
the ECB. The NCBs have full autonomy over the management of their official reserve 
asset
s in terms of asset allocation, risk/return profile and management style and have 
multiple investment purposes for the assets. While the ECB™s official reserve assets 
can be regarded as the Eurosystem™s most liquid tranche that would be used as the 
first r
eserve pool to fund any foreign exchange interventions, the official reserves held 
                                                                    30  According to the

 1.3
 Adequacy of foreign currency reserves
 Whether the level of foreign currency reserve holdings is 
deemed to be
 adequate hinges on several factors.
 These include both the rationale for and the 
cost of holding reserves; the level of domestic financial development; the credibility of 
monetary polic
y and 
the exchange rate reg
ime; whether the economy is
 (unofficially) 
dollar
ised or euroised; its trade and financial openness; and the
 range of instruments 
ava
ilable for domestic monetary operations. There is therefore little consensus in the 
academic lit
erature on a single measure of reserve adequacy that would capture all of 
these dimensions
. Several metrics of adequacy have been developed over time.
 They
 primarily
 focus on increasing a country™s resilience, particularly to sudden capital flow reversals,
 and therefore have tended to focus on 
emerging and developing economies. 
As a 
result, t
hey 
may be 
less relevan
t to advanced economies. 
One traditional 
rule
 of 
thumb relates to 
the number of months 
that 
imports can be sustained should all

  45 external financing, dry up. It is commonly argued that reserves should cover at least 
three months of imports
. As global financial integration has progressed, another metric that has beco
me 
widely 
used is the ﬁGreenspan
-Guidotti ruleﬂ, which suggests that reserves should cover 
100% of short
-term external debt to insure against roll
over
 risk in 
the event of a
 sudden
 stop in 
foreign financing
.34 More recently, it has been argued that 
reserve 
adequacy should 
be judged 
in relation
 to
 the
 risks of both external and internal drains 
(ﬁtwin drainsﬂ) 
Œ that is, the risk that capital outflows reflect not just non
-residents 
withdrawing capital but also residents seeking to move funds out of the country. As a 
result, countries with 
open financial markets 
should 
hold 
foreign currency 
reserv
es 
proportiona
te
 to the size of 
their 
banking system
s. One common metric used in this 
context is that foreign currency reserves should cover 
at least 20% of broad money to 
account for capital flight
s.35 Still n
ewer approaches 
use 
styl
ised modelling

 potent
ial losses of reserves as a result of a decline
 in 
external demand
, terms
-of-trade shocks, rollover risk or
 capital flight
 risk, thus 
encompassing dra
ins on reserves from various sources.
36 These metrics and models 
notwithstanding
, 
assessments 
of reserve adequacy 
often tend
, in practice,
 to rely 
mainly on comparisons with 
a country™s closest 
peers, leading to a competition in 
reserve accumulation 
Œ the ﬁ
Machlup problemﬂ
, or ﬁkeeping
 up with the Jonesesﬂ

 may
, in turn, 
amplify accumulation or 
discourage economies 
from drawing on their reserves when the need arises
.37 Advanced economies
, particularly
 major reserve curr
ency issuers
, have 
a less 
pressing need to hold reserves.
 Given the free
-floating currency regime, the 
traditional metrics mentioned above, developed essentially for emerging market 
economies, are less suited to assessing reserve adequacy in advanced econo
mies. 
Although it is difficult to assess the 
optimal level of foreign
 currency
 reserves to be held 
for conducting
 effective
 foreign exchange
 interventions
, recent research has found 
that 
the average daily intervention volume
 in the foreign exchange markets (of 33 
emerging and advanced economies) 
equals around 0.02
-0.05% of 
a country™s GDP

regimes

reserves to cover potential ﬁtwin drainsﬂ was suggested by 
Henry Thornton back in the 19th century 
(1802).
 36  As such
, the IMF risk
-weighted 
metric is a function of exports
, short and long
-term debt,
 and broad 
money. 
The relative weights assigned to 
these 
variables are based on observed outflows from emerging 
markets during periods of exchange market pressure
. The metric
 also takes into account 
the exchange 
rate regime and 
whether there
 are capital controls in place. For further details, see

  46 exchange interventions 
is around 60%
, considering the intended objective of the 
intervention as identified.
38 Policy signalling and the availability of funding arrangements are also relevant 
factors 
when
 considering the amount
 of reserves that advanced economies 
would need
 to enable them to
 conduct foreign exchange interventions
 effectively.
 For most advanced economies the exchange rate is not a target of 
monetary policy, but rather an endogenous variable affecting the main tar
get 
variable(s) of monetary policy (e.g. inflation expectations). Therefore, foreign 
exchange interventions and their communication should typically be consistent with 
the main objectives of monetary policy. When a central bank publicly announces its 
inter
ventions
, this 
strengthen
s the 
overall 
policy message
 it wants to convey, which 
likely lowers the need for actual market operations. Foreign exchange intervention is 
found to be more effective if it is accompanied by verbal intervention, particularly in 
tu
rbulent times
39. Moreover, advanced economies may also have easier access to 
alternative means for funding possible currency intervention. For example, they can 
use foreign 
exchange swaps 
without immediate depletion of foreign currency 
reserves. In the spec
ific case of the Eurosystem, the ECB has the ability, when 
needed, to make further calls on NCBs for additional foreign reserve assets.

 Global trends in the currency composition of global foreign 
reserves
 Global foreign currency reserves are mainly in
vested in US dollar
-denominated 
financial assets, while the euro is the second most
-used reserve currency.
 The 
US dollar continues to be the pre
-eminent currency of issuance of safe assets, most 
notably in the large and liquid US Treasury market.
 Based on 
IMF Currency 
Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) data
41, at constant 
exchange rates, the US dollar™s 
share 
of 
globally disclosed holdin
gs of foreign 
exchange reserves 
stood at around 62% at the end of 2018
, against 69% in 2007 (i.e. 
immediately before the global financial crisis) and 71% in 1999 at the start of 
                                                                    38  See, for example, Fratzscher, M., Gloede, O., Menkhoff, L., Sarno, L. and Stoehr, T., ﬁWhen is Foreign 
Exchange Intervention Effective? Eviden
ce from 33 Countriesﬂ,

-156. The authors used three criteria to assess the success of FX 
interventions in general: i) the ability of intervention to change the direction of the exchange rate (ﬁe
ventﬂ 
criterion); ii) the ability to smooth the path of the exchange rate (ﬁsmoothingﬂ criterion); and iii) the ability 
of intervention to stabilise the exchange rate to keep it in a narrow band (ﬁstabilisationﬂ criterion). For the 
floating exchange rate r
egimes, the baseline success rate is based mainly on the ﬁeventﬂ criterion.

  48 currencies and asset classes.
44 45 It
 is, however, 
difficult to assess 
the specific 
considerations underlying decisions by 
official reserve holders, 
in view, 
not least
, of the limited 
public 
information on the currency composition of central banks™ reserve 
portfolio
s.46 Anecdotal evidence aside, recent resear
ch on the role of economic and 
geopolitical considerations in the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves 
found support for both.
47 The ECB™s official reserves are currently invested in US dollars, Japanese yen, 
Chinese renminbi, gold and SDRs.
 The currency composition of the ECB™s 
official
 reserves reflects policy considerations, 
in other words,
 the ability to conduct and fund 
effective interventions in euro against other major currencies
. 
From this point of view
, the US dollar and the Japanese ye
n are
 the two most relevant
 intervention currencies
 (see Chart 4)
. The Chinese renminbi was added in 2017 
after
 its 
inclusion in the SDR 
basket in 2016 and 
given 
its increasing international role and 
the importance of China 
as one of 
the 
euro a
rea™s 
largest trading partners.
48 Where the ECB engages in 
foreign exchange transactions to adjust the composition of the foreign currency 
reserves, it is to ensure compliance with the Foreign Exchange Global Code 
(FXGC).
49 The FXGC is a set of global principles o
f good practice in the foreign 
exchange market that has been developed to provide a common code of conduct to 
promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange 
market.
50 The ECB™s current gold holdings represent about 26% of 
its total official reserves, 
compared with 15% in 1999. This increase is a result of the significant increase in the 
gold price over the past two decades. As a percentage of total reserves, the ECB™s 
gold holding is broadly similar to that of many other ce
ntral banks in advanced 
economies. Box 1 discusses the main developments of the gold market during the 20 
years

reserve managers covering USD 6.9 trillion of reserves shows that n
early 
three
-quarters of the respondents
 identified international trade tensions as the most or second most 
pressing issue for them in 2019
. 80% of the survey respondents saw geopolitical fo
rces as affecting the 
currency allocation of official foreign reserves.
 45  One example is Russia, one of the world™s largest reserve holders, which
, in the wake of new rounds of 
US sanctions
, sold 
around
 USD 100 billion worth of US dollar

ves and purchased 
almost USD 90 billion worth of euro
-denominated and 
Chinese 
renminbi
-denominated assets in the 
second quarter of 2018
. With a share of 32%, the euro is now the main currency of denomination of 
Russia™s foreign exchange reserve holdings, a
head of the US dollar and the 
Chinese 
renminbi, with 
shares of 22% and 15%
, respectively
. For further details, see also the

1  The go
ld market during the 20 years of Central Bank Gold Agreements
 Prepared by Ludovit Kutnik and Etienne Port
 The last Central Bank Gold Agreement (CBGA) expired in September 2019 after 20 years of 
such agreements.
 The
 CBGAs™ signatories included the 
Eurosystem and the central banks of 
Sweden, Switzerland and 
Œ initially 
Œ the United Kingdom. The first CBGA
51 was set up in 1999 for a 
five
-year period, when
 concerns about the
 negative market
 impact of uncoordinated 
gold 
sales by 
central banks were 
evident, and increasing,
 in the gold market.
 The goal of the 
CBGAs
 was to help 
stabilise the gold market by alleviating these concerns, reliev
ing
 downward pressure on gold prices
, 
and contributing towards more balanced supply and demand conditions
 by limit
ing and coordinating 
central banks™ gold sales
. The Agreement was renewed three times
, each time for a five
-year period. 
The terms of the last two CBGAs became less and less stringent, reflecting the improving conditions 
in the gold market. This change in 
the terms mainly took the form of an adjustment of the signatories™ 
sale quotas and a relaxation of the constraints on the use of derivatives (see Chart A). Over
 the full 
CBGA period
 since 1999, t
he price of gold has increased around five
-fold
. The market 
impact on gold 
prices in CBGA announcements, including the one on the expiry
 of the last CBGA, was 
negligible
. The exception to this was the initial CBGA announcement, which was a novelty and a surprise.

 Note: The vertical lines represent the expiry dates of the successive CBGAs.
 Since 1999 the gold 
market has grown and matured in terms of liquidity and investor base.
52 The s
tructure of 
the 
gold 
market 
differ
s from 
that of other financial
 assets
, as gold 
does not only serve 
investment purposes
, but also has practical uses.
 At the time of the first CBGA
, the diversity of 
demand for physical gold was low and concentrated in jewellery, while the contribution to demand 
from the official sector was negative. Over time, innovations in 
financial engineering facilitated 
the 
use 
of gold as a financial 
instrument
, thanks to the development of exchange
-traded products tracking 
gold prices and backed by physical gold. These flexible and liquid investment vehicles helped 
broaden the range of investors by easing the access of retail and pension funds to gold exposure.
53 Diversity in gold demand increased most visibly during and after the global financial crisis, driven 
initially by a surge in retail investment in gold bars and later also by demand from the 
official sector
. 
More recently, the sources of demand have remained diverse and broadly stable (see Chart B). 
The 
higher investor involvement in the gold market since the first CBGA 
is reflected in
 the
 trading of gold 
products and derivatives
, both on exchanges and in th
e over
-the
-counter (OTC) market
.54 Market
 liquidity and 
its
 ability to absorb 
large
-volume 
gold transactions have improved continuously
, thereby 
lowering the need for the CBGA.
                                                                     52  The comparison is between current conditions and those prevailing in 1999, when the CBGA was initially 
introduced.
 53  At the end of 2018, 
gold
-backed investments 
in exchange
-traded funds amounted to
 around 2
,300 
tonnes
, according to Thomson Reuters GFMS data.
 54  For example, the average trading volume of gold futures contracts trading at COMEX has increased 
multiple times over the past 20 years (according to Bloomberg), while the net volume of Loco L
ondon 
gold transfers (in USD terms) settled between the five clearing members of London Precious Metals 
Clearing Limited (LPMCL) has increased several times during the same period (according to the clearing 
statistics provided by the London Bullion Market 
Association (LBMA)).

opean Central Bank.
 Central banks and other official institutions have become net buyers of gold 
over
 the current 
decade, mainly as a result of demand from emerging markets.
 The turning point came at around 
the time of the global financial crisis, when, af
ter years of net selling, the contribution of the official 
sector to overall gold demand turned positive, with the stabilisation of CBGA signatories™ gold 
holdings and new buying activity by other central banks. Several factors may have supported this 
rene
wed interest in gold, mainly from developing countries
55 (see Chart C). First, gold has benefited 
from its status as a safe
-haven asset with the ability to preserve wealth over the long term with no risk 
of default. Second, gold offers diversification benef
its from a portfolio management perspective as, in 
general, it has a low correlation with other assets but a positive correlation with inflation and a 
negative one with real bond yields and US dollar developments. Other supporting factors are the low 
or ne
gative interest rate environment in major reserve currencies,
 the reshaping of the global 
geopolitical landscape and the authorities™ efforts, in some countries, to back the national currency 
with physical assets.
                                                                     55  Two countries, China and Russia, have accounted for more than two
-thirds of the overall net buying 
activity in gold by the official sector since 2009, according to the World Gold Council.

 With regard to market functioning and gold market governance, a number of initiatives 
were
 taken to promote ﬁa robust, fair, effective and appropriately transparent marketﬂ.
 First, the 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)
56 published a Global Precious Metals Code (Code) that 
was adopted by the main precious metals market participants.
57 The Code sets out the best practices 
expected from market participants in the global OTC
 wholesale precious metals market
. Its 
achievement in this respect is similar to that of the FXGC for the foreign exchange market. Second, to 
foster greater transparency, the LBMA began to publish new trade data
58 and other statistics for the 
precious metal
s market.

  53 return.
 The liquidity of the investments has priority in order to fulf
il the main purpose of 
the ECB™s foreign currency reserves, which is to ensure that t
he ECB 
can, at any time,
 conduct foreign exchange operations
, if needed
. This means that it must be possible 
to convert the portfolio into cash balances in a short time fr
ame and at minimal cost. To 
achieve this, a large share of the foreign reserves is invested in US and Japanese 
government bonds with a relatively short residual maturity. These are regarded as the 
most liquid instruments available in their respective curre
ncies. Moreover, the high 
creditworthiness of the issuers and the relatively short duration of the portfolios serve 
the second investment principle: the preservation of the capital of the ECB™s foreign 
currency reserves. Subject to the principles of liquid
ity and security, the investment 
framework is designed to maximise investment returns. To this end, the Eurosystem: i) 
applies active portfolio management with incentives to make use of an allocated risk 
budget; and ii) allows the use of investment instrum
ents that yield a spread over 
government bonds or facilitate the expression of investment views. These include 
supranational and agency bonds, money market and bond futures, commercial bank 
deposits, repos and reverse repos, foreign exchange hedged swaps a
nd interest rate 
swaps. Investments in each of these instruments are subject to risk management 
limits.
 2.2
 The organisational structure of foreign reserve management
 The management of the ECB™s foreign currency reserves is organised in three 
layers: 
i) a 
strategic benchmark; 
ii
) a tactical benchmark; and 
iii
) day
-to-day 
portfolio management by NCBs (Figure 1).
 The main rationale for this three
-layer 
structure is that it ensures that investments are made in accordance with the long
-term 
risk/return preferen
ces of the Governing Council, while providing the flexibility to 
actively benefit from investment opportunities over a shorter investment horizon.

  54 The 
strategic benchmark is designed to reflect the ECB™s long
-term risk/return 
preferences, given the principles of liquidity and security.
 The strategic 
benchmark allocation is based on a modelling framework developed in
-house which 
translates the ECB™s risk/
return preferences into a multi
-objective function
 incorporating the investment principles presented in Section 2.1
. The ECB™s portfolio 
optimisation process for the strategic benchmark consists of two components. A 
ﬁthrough
-the
-cycle
ﬂ component identifies
 efficient portfolio allocations based on 
long
-term expectations of risks and returns through the economic cycle. 
A ﬁpoint
-in-time
ﬂ component complements the long
-term perspective by reassessing the 
utility of the through
-the
-cycle efficient portfolios
, ta
king into account financial 
variables
 and the current and projected state of the economy.
 Once the Governing 
Council approves the key characteristics of the strategic benchmark portfolios (e.g. 
modified duration, allocation per maturity bucket and asset cl
ass) for each currency, 
the ECB™s risk management unit translates those characteristics into an investment 
portfolio, providing security
-level detail.
 The tactical benchmark is the first active layer aiming to outperform the 
strategic benchmark.
 It
 is desi
gned to 
allow for adjustments to the risk/return 
characteristics of the strategic benchmark on the basis of 
medium
-term (
three to six
 months) 
investment views, taking into account
 prevailing 
financial 
market
 and macroeconomic
 conditions
. The degree of free
dom to express such views is laid down 
in 
internal
 investment guidelines
, while t
he management responsibility for the tactical 
benchmark 
is assigned to an 
Investment Committee (ICO)
. This committee
 has 
members from t
he investment, 
risk management 
and compl
iance units of the ECB
. The 
ICO
 discusses and assesses proposals by the ECB™s portfolio managers 
and
, on a monthly basis,
 submits
 the final recommendations for approval 
by the 
Executive Board.
 To give a concrete example of how this is done, the analysis of
 the 
economic outlook, monetary policy developments, bond market valuation and other 
relevant variables might lead ECB portfolio managers to expect that yields in one of 
the relevant bond markets will increase in the coming three to six months. Rising 
yiel
ds would imply declining bond values. This expectation might lead portfolio 
managers to propose to the ICO that the benchmark should be adjusted in such a way 
that the tactical benchmark excludes some of the bonds included in the strategic 
benchmark. Inste
ad, the tactical benchmark could hold a larger share of the invested 
funds in short
-term money market investments, thereby reducing the interest rate 
sensitivity of the tactical benchmark by comparison with the strategic benchmark. If 
the ICO and the Execu
tive Board accept this proposal, the adjustment is made. The 
change to the tactical benchmark is then communicated to the NCBs™ portfolio 
managers with some lead time to allow them to prepare the implementation of this 
benchmark adjustment in the actual po
rtfolios.
 The management of the ECB portfolio by NCBs constitutes the second active 
layer, the investment returns of 
which
 are measured 
against
 the tactical 
benchmark.
 Unlike the internally maintained strategic and tactical benchmarks, the 
actual management of the investment portfolios is organised in a decentralised 
manner within the Eurosystem. Subject to the rules set by a guideline governing the 
NCBs™ management of 
the ECB™s foreign currency reserves, the NCBs act as agents

  55 of the ECB. When NCBs carry out transactions for the ECB™s foreign currency 
reserves they disclose their agency status to their counterparties before entering into 
transactions, with the ECB actin
g as the principal for all counterparties. 
The 
Eurosystem has a 
dedicated
 working group 
which regularly discusses
 all 
issues 
related to the
 foreign currency reserve management framework and the actual
 management of the ECB™s foreign 
currency 
reserve
s. All 
NCBs that manage a portfolio for the ECB have 
an identical mandate to 
manage the reserves prudently in
 such
 a way 
as to
 maximise 
their
 value within 
the internal investment framework decided by the Governing Council.
 The NCBs 
can make and implement investme
nt decisions on a daily basis
, applying the 
investment horizon 
that best suits 
their preferred investment style
 (covered in Section 
2.3)
. The ECB™s foreign currency reserves are 
currently distributed across
 11 portfolios in US dollar
s, four portfolios in J
apanese yen and one portfolio for 
the Chinese renminbi
. This distribution reflects a currency specialisation by NCBs.
 At 
the inception of the euro, all NCBs were still assumed to manage portfolios in both US 
dollars and Japanese yen in proportion to their 
share in the ECB capital key. However, 
in 2006 a currency specialisation scheme was implemented. This scheme envisaged 
that NCBs would typically choose one currency portfolio according to their 
preferences, subject to the ECB™s aim of keeping a reasonable 
number of portfolios 
per currency.
60 The aim was to maintain an efficient framework, including by limiting 
the number of (small) portfolios, as more countries were expected to join the euro 
area, while facilitating more focused investment activities and lev
eraging NCBs™ 
different expertise and management styles. Since then, most of the new euro area 
NCBs have decided to pool ﬁtheirﬂ share of the ECB reserves with that of another 
NCB. Every three years the Governing Council reviews the allocation of portfolio
s and 
may decide to change the currency allocation.
 2.3
 The active management of the ECB
™s foreign currency reserves 
Œ incentives and management styles
 Active management, competition between NCB portfolio managers and 
diversification of portfolio managemen
t styles are key characteristics of the
 ECB™s
 foreign 
currency 
reserve management framework, 
which is intended to 
generat
e a steady stream of additional investment return
s compared 
with
 the 
strategic benchmark.
 Over
 time, all active layers have made a positive contribution 
to the strategic benchmark returns for all reserve currencies. As illustrated in Chart 5, 
for the US dollar portfolios, all individual NCB portfolios have, on average, contributed 
positively. Chart
 5 also highlights that the average tracking errors
61 of the individual 
                                                                    60  Article 12.1 of the ESCB and ECB Statute states that ﬁ(–)
 the ECB shall have recourse to the national 
central banks to carry out operations which
 form part of the tasks of the ESCB
ﬂ. This initially implied that 
all NCB
s participated in the active management of the ECB™s foreign reserves. However, since 1 January 
2006 NCBs have been free to abstain from participating in operational activities related to the 
management of the ECB™s foreign reserves. This allows specialisa
tion and the pooling of portfolios.
 61  Tracking error refers to the annualised standard deviation of daily differences between portfolio return 
and tactical benchmark return.

typically exceeds that of the NCBs™ por
tfolios by a factor of 2. This illustrates that 
tactical management provides an opportunity to adjust the risk characteristics of the 
benchmark meaningfully if the ICO believes, for example, that an adjustment is 
required by developments in the economic cy
cle. The role of the NCB portfolio 
managers (anticipating day
-to-day developments in markets) can be expected to 
involve more moderate risk adjustments, but with greater flexibility.
 In addition
, the investment framework includes incentives for the active 
layers 
to actively use the risk budget.
 At the tactical benchmark level, the incentive 
consists of an internal target, set by the ICO, for outperforming the strategic 
benchmark. The ICO sets this relative return target every year for each currency 
portfoli
o. The target is a prominent element of the overall annual performance targets 
for ECB portfolio managers preparing ICO proposals. This is in line with best asset 
management practices, which allow portfolio managers to better calibrate their 
positions in o
rder to reach the target.
 With regard to actual portfolio management, a

ranking of Eurosystem
 NCBs provides for competition and has been an 
                                                                    62  VaR
 is the maximum loss not exceeded at a certain confidence level over a spec
ific time horizon. For 
example, if a portfolio has a one
-year 99% VaR of EUR 1 million, this means that there is a 1% probability 
that the portfolio will lose more than EUR 1 million over one year. Relative VaR is a measure of the risk of 
losses with respe
ct to the benchmark result and is defined as the VaR of the difference portfolio (i.e. the 
actual minus the market
-value
-scaled benchmark portfolio).

  57 important tool 
in
 foster
ing
 risk
-taking.
 On a monthly basis, the ECB compiles and 
distrib
utes an updated ranking to the NCB portfolio managers, allowing them to 
monitor and benchmark each other™s performance. At the end of the year, the ranking 
is shared with the Governing Council, which ensures that strong performers are duly 
recognised. Acco
rding to internal surveys, the ranking and its dissemination is seen to 
be an important motivation for risk
-taking among portfolio managers.
63 In this respect, 
Scalia and Sahel (2011)
64 analysed the behaviour of NCB portfolio managers involved 
in the ECB™s f
oreign currency reserve management and found some evidence of 
risk
-shifting behaviour by these managers, related to their year
-to
-date ranking. For 
example, some of the portfolio managers seemed to increase their relative risk
-taking 
in the second half of 
the year if they had achieved a lower ranking in the first half.
 Even though the performance ranking gives portfolio managers an incentive to 
keep up with 
their 
peers, the relative performance of NCBs seem
s to exhibit 
persistence
 over time.
 For example, Ch
art 6 (upper panel) shows the average 
ranking of all NCB portfolios over the 2006
-12 period on the x
-axis, and the average 
ranking over 2013
-18 on the y
-axis. The chart shows that, broadly speaking, two 
groups of NCBs can be identified
 that ranked either r
elatively high or relatively low in 
both periods. Chart 6 (lower panel) illustrates the trend in the annual performance 
ranking, showing that the cumulative ranking difference between the top and bottom 
performers increased steadily between 2006 and 2018. 
These indications of 
persistence may be related to a number of factors, such as portfolio managers™ skills 
and NCBs™ portfolio management styles and risk appetite (as seen in Chart 5). Indeed, 
some NCBs take on positions that are, on average, small (in ter
ms of outright duration 
and yield curve) and make relatively few positioning changes over time, while others 
take on relatively large positions and change them more frequently. These style 
differences point to the diversification effects of having several 
active portfolios.
                                                                     63  In addition to the ranking, portfolio managers are also committed to using a minimum percentage of the 
daily relative VaR limit, on average over the medium term. The risk usage is monitored and discussed 
periodically among portfolio managers to encourage self
-enforcement.

. Conclusion
 As the 
reasons
 for holding foreign currency reserves have evolved over time 
and across countries, so have the size and composition
 of those reserves
. Global foreign currency reserves have grown markedly, especially since the Asian 
crisis of the late 1990s, with emerging
 markets accumulating large amounts of foreign 
currency reserves to self
-insure against potential shocks but also, in some cases, as a 
by-product of export
-led growth strategies. While global foreign currency reserves 
were traditionally invested primarily 
in US dollar
-denominated financial assets, 
holdings have become more diversified in terms of both currency and asset
 classes.
 As 
for
 the ECB, the main purpose of its foreign currency reserves is to ensure 
that, whenever needed, the Eurosystem has a suffici
ent amount of liquid 
resources for foreign exchange policy operations.
 The composition of the ECB™s 
foreign currency reserves has remained broadly stable over time, with the exception of 
the recent addition of the Chinese renminbi.

 Trends in central banks™ foreign currency reserves and the case of the ECB
  59 The investment framework
 of the ECB™s foreign currency reserves has evolved 
over time with a view to encourag
ing
 efficiency and creat
ing
 incentives for the 
use of the available risk budget by active layers, while ensuring that the 
reserves are readily available for policy purpose
s. The
 decentralised 
management of the reserves by NCBs is a unique characteristic of the framework. It 
offers benefits, including information sharing and promoting best practice among 
portfolio managers. Active management, encouraged by the competition be
tween 
NCB portfolio managers, and the diversification of portfolio management styles have 
been key characteristics of the investment framework and have contributed to 
generating a steady stream of additional investment returns above the strategic 
benchmark
 return.
