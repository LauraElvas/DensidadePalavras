 Overview
 Based on a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook for the 
euro area, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections, 
the Governing Council took a number of decisions at its monetary policy 
meeting on 12 September in pursuit of its price stability objective.
 Incoming 
information since the last Governing Council meeting indicates a more protracted 
weakness of the euro area economy, the persistence of prominent downside risks and 
muted inflationary pressures. This is reflected in the September staff projections, 

which show a further downgrade of the inflation outlook. At the same time, robust 
employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the 
euro area economy. Against this overall backdrop, the Governing Council announced 

a comprehensive package of monetary policy measures in response to the continued 

shortfall of inflation with respect to its aim
 (see Box 1)
. Econo
mic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 12 September 2019
 Global growth softened in the first half of 2019, reflecting decelerating 

economic activity in both advanced and emerging economies.
 This is in line with 
survey
-b
ased indicators which point to subdued global activity. Global growth is 
projected to dec
line
 this year amid weak global manufacturing activity on the back of 
declining global investment and rising policy and political uncertainty on account of 
Brexit and the renewed intensification of trade tensions between the United States and 
China. Looking ahead, global growth is projected to gradually recover over the 

medium term but to remain below its long
-term average. Global trade is expected to 
further weaken significantly this year but 
to 
recover in the medium term, while 
remaining more subdued than economic activity. Global inflationary pressures are 

expected to remain contained, while downside risks to global economic activity have 

intensified.
 Global long
-term risk
-free rates have declined
 since the Governing Council 
meeting in June 2019
 amid market expectations of further accommodative 

monetary policy and a resurgence of global trade uncertainty.
 This decline in 
risk
-free rates has supported the prices of euro area equities and corporate bonds. 
Meanwhile, corporate earnings expectations have fallen somewhat in response to 

persistent doubts about the global macroeconomic outlook. 
The EONIA forward curve 
also 
shifted downwards
. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro remained broadly 
unchanged in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP
 increased by 0.2%, 
quarter on quarter, in the second quarter 
of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter.
 Incoming economic data 
and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the third

 Overview
  3 quarter of this year. This slowdown in growth 
mainly reflects the prevailing weakness 
of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are 
particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, the 
services and construction sectors 
are showing 
ongoing resilience and the euro area 
expansion is also supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment 
gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the 
ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activit
y. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area.
 These projections foresee annual 
real GDP increasing by 1.1% in 2019,
 1.2% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. 
Compared with 
the June 2019 
Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP 
growth has been revised down for 2019 and 2020. 
The risks surrounding the euro area 
growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. These risks mainly pertain to the 
prolonged presence of uncertainti
es related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of 
protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 
1.0% in August 2019, 
which is 
unchanged from July
. Lower energy infl
ation was 
offset by higher food inflation, while the rate of HICP inflation excluding food and 
energy was unchanged. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation 
is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year. Me
asures of 
underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations 
stand at low levels. While labour cost pressures strengthened and broadened amid 
high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass
-through to 
inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated.
 Over the medium term, 
underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy 
measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.
 This assessment i
s also broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021
. Compared with the June 
2019 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has 
been revised down over the whole projection horizon, reflecting lower energy prices 
and the weaker growth environment. Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food 
is expected to be 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2
020 and 1.5% in 2021.
 The annual growth of broad money 
increased markedly in July 2019, while 
loans to the private sector 
remained broadly unchanged
. Broad money (M3) 
growth 
increased to 5.2% in July 2019, after 4.5% in June.
 Sustained rates of broad 
money
 growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low 
opportunity costs of holding M3. 
Furthermore, 
M3 growth remained resilient in the face 
of the fading out of the mechanical contribution of the net purchases under the 
asset 
purchas
e programme (
APP) and weakening economic momentum
. At the same time, 
favourable bank funding and lending conditions continued to support loan flows and 
thereby economic growth. 
The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial 
corporations 
remained unchange
d at 
3.9% in 
July
 2019. 
The monetary policy 
measures
 decided by the Governing Council
, including
 the more accommodative 
terms of 
the new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term refinancing operations 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Economic

 Overview
  4 (TLTRO III
), will help to safeguard favourable bank len
ding conditions and will continue 
to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium
-sized enterprises
. The 
aggregate
 fiscal stance
 for the euro area
 is 
projected
 to be mildly 
expansionary, providing some support to economic activity.
 In the 
next 
two 
years, the stance will continue to be mildly expansionary, mainly on account of further 
cuts 
in 
direct taxes and social security contributions in most of the larger euro area 
countries
. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the cont
inued prominence 
of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely 
manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent 
policies that will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to
 operate freely.
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
made the following decisions
:  First, t
he interest rate on the deposit facility 
was
 decreased by 10 basis points to 
-0.50%. The interest ra
te on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the 
marginal lending facility 
were kept 
unchanged at their current levels of 0.00% and 
0.25% respectively. The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest 
rates to remain at their present or lowe
r levels until it has seen the inflation 
outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its 
projection horizon
, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in 
underlying inflation dynamics.
  Second, n
et purchases w
ill be restarted under the APP at a monthly pace of •20 
billion as from 1
 November. The Governing Council expects 
the APP
 to run for as 
long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of 
the ECB™s 
policy 
rates, and to end shortly before it starts r
aising the key ECB interest rates.
  Third
, reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities 
purchased under the APP will continue, in full, for an extended period of time past 
the date when the Governing Council starts raising the key ECB in
terest rates, 
and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity 
conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
  Fourth
, 
the Governing Council
 decided to change the modalities of TLTRO III to 
preserve favourable bank lendin
g conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of 
monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary 
policy. The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the 
average rate applied in the Eurosystem™s main refinanci
ng operations over the 
life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a 
benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as 
low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over th
e life of 
the operation. The maturity of the operations will be ex
tended from two to three 
years.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Economic

 Overview
  5  Fifth, in order to support the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy
, the 
Governing Council decided to introduce a two
-tier system for reserve 
remunerati
on in which part of banks™ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt 
from the negative deposit facility rate.
 The Governing Council took these decisions in response to the continued shortfall of 
inflation with respect to its aim. With this comprehensive 
package of monetary policy 
decisions, the ECB is providing substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that financial 
conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing 
build
-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustain
ed convergence of inflation 
to the Governing Council™s medium
-term inflation aim. The Governing Council 
reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a 
prolonged period of time. Looking ahead, it continues to stand ready to a
djust all of its 
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

 Global growth softened in the first half of 2019, reflecting decelerating economic 
activity in both advanced and emerging 
economies
. This is in line with survey
-based 
indicators which point to subdued global activity. 
Activity in se
rvices, although 
weakeni
ng, continued to support growth while growth momentum in global 
manufacturing remains subdued
. 
Global growth is
 projected to 
decrease
 this year 
amid weak global manufacturing activity on the back of declining global investment 
and rising policy and political uncertainty on account of Brexit and the renewed 
intensification of trade tensions between the United States and China. While thos
e headwinds are expected to weigh on global activity and trade this year and next, 
recent policy measures are expected to provide some support. As a result, global 
growth is projected to stabilise over the medium term, albeit
 at a level below the 
average growth rate observed before the crisis. Global trade is expected to weaken 
significantly this year 
but 
recover in the medium term
, while remaining more subdued 
than 
economic activity. Global inflationary pressures are expected to remain 
contained, while downside risks to global economic activity have intensified.
 Global economic activity and trade
 Global growth softened in the first half of 2019.
 In the first quarter, real GDP 
growth held up relatively well in most advanced economies owing to temporary facto
rs 
in some countries (e.g. positive contributions from net trade and a build
-up of 
inventories in the United States and stock
-building 
in advance of 
the first Brexit 
deadline in the United Kingdom
). 
In the second quarter, as the impact of such factors 
unwo
und, growth moderated. In the United States, 
as imports stabilised
, the negative 
contribution of net trade weighed on growth in spite of the fiscal stimulus and resilient 
private consumption. In the United Kingdom, growth turned negative in the second 
quarter on account of, among other things,
 a slowdown in investment. While activity 
in 
China 
remained stable in the first half of the year amid resilient private consumption, 
growth stumbled in several other emerging market economies (
EMEs
) 
in the first 
quarte
r, reflecting adverse idiosyncratic factors in some countries (a dam disaster in 

Brazil and contamination of an oil pipeline in Russia) and more persistent headwinds, 

such as elevated domestic political uncertainty (
in 
Mexico and Brazil). Growth 
ticked 
up in the second quarter as some of these headwinds dissipated and economic 

activity continued to grow in some other countries (e.g. in Turkey
, owing to strong 
private consumption and 
a positive net trade contribution).
 Survey
-based indicators continue to point to subdued global activity.
 The global 
composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) excluding the euro area 

decelerated further in the second quarter of 2019 and, after a small rebound in July, 

declined again in August. The deceleration in the first half of the year was broad
-based 
across advanced and emerging economies, though more recently 
a small uptick has 
been recorded in the composite PMI indicator 
for EMEs
. Global activity in the service
s 
sector, which had been more resilient overall at the turn of the year, 
also deteriorated 
in the second quarter and declined 
still 
further in August, but remains above the 50 
threshold.

 Global financial conditions have experienced some volatility in recent months.
 Since 
the 
finalisation of the June 2019 
Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections, 
risky asset prices
 have experienced some volatility amid conflicting signals.
 On the 
one hand, hopes of a bilateral trade deal between the 
United States 
and China and the 
expectation of a more accommodative monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic 
led to a rebound in a
sset prices in June and July. With investors 
anticipating 
rate cuts, 
US Treasury yields 
and other safe government bond yields moved significantly lower 
and, at the same time, financial conditions in EMEs eased significantly. On the other 
hand, the renewed 
escalation of the 
US-China 
trade dispute in early August and the 
indication from the Federal Open Market Committee (
FOMC
) that the July rate cut did 
not mark the start of an easing cycle sapped risk appetite
, causing large losses 
in 
global equity markets, 
while core sovereign bond yields continued to move lower on 
account of falling term premia. Despite the recent risk
-off episode, financial market 
conditions remain loose in both a
dvanced and emerging economies.
 Global growth is projected to decelerate this
 year.
 A number of headwinds 
continue to weigh on the global economy. Global manufacturing activity is expected to 
remain weak, 
mainly 
on the back of declining growth in global investment and 
consumption of durable goods, which form a large part of manufac
turing output. As 
uncertainty related to the future of international trading relations mounts, global 
investment growth is unlikely to regain traction. Recent analysis shows that 
deteriorating financing conditions, rising macroeconomic uncertainty and 
unfa
vourable demand shocks weighed negatively on global investment growth in the 
second half of 2018 and the beginning of 2019

  8 economy, a number of policymakers around the globe have adopted accommodative 
measures to cushion the n
egative impact of economic headwinds. In China, fiscal 
stimulus measures to cushion the slowdown in domestic demand are expected to 
have an effect mostly in the second half of this year. In the 
United States
, in addition to 
the sizeable pro
-cyclical fiscal
 stimulus and the recent agreement on new public 
spending caps, the Federal Reserve 
System 
decided to cut its benchmark interest rate 
with a view to support
ing
 the ongoing economic expansion. 
A number of other 
countries 
have 
also 
eased monetary policy (e.g
. Australia, Brazil, South Korea, 
Indonesia, India and Turkey).
 Looking ahead, global growth is projected to gradually recover over the 
medium
 term but to remain below its long
-term average.
 Developments in global 
growth are 
being 
shaped by three main forc
es. Across advanced economies, the 
cyclical momentum is projected to slow as capacity constraints become increasingly 
binding amid positive output gaps and low unemployment rates across key 
economies, while, towards the end of the projection horizon, polic
y support 
is expected to 
gradually diminish. 
In addition
, the progressive slowdown of the Chinese 
economy and its rebalancing from investment to consumption are projected to weigh 
negatively on global growth and 
on trade in particular. At the same time, the 
contribution 
of 
EMEs 
(excluding China) to global growth, while still positive, is 
expected to be weaker than envisaged in the June 2019 
Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic 
projections. This is on account of recent data
 suggesting that the 
projected recovery from past recessions is materialising at a slower pace than 
previously assumed. Moreover, 
although 
so far 
the recent financial market stress in 
Argentina has not spilled
 over to other emerging markets, 
it 
points to t
he underlying 
fragility of the recovery in some 
EMEs
. Overall, the pace of global expansion is 
expected to settle at rates below those seen prior to the 2007
-08 financial crisis.
 Turning to developments in individual countries, in the United States
, activi
ty is 
expected to remain resilient
 in the near term
, despite the headwinds related to 
the trade dispute with China and the less favourable external environment.
 The 
US economy™s performance has so far remained robust, reflecting a strong labour 
market and 
consumer spending. The lifting of spending caps for 
the 
2020/21 financial 
year 
and a two
-year suspension of the federal debt limit agreed by Congress at the 
end of July will further support economic growth. Financial conditions also remain 
supportive. Foll
owing 3.1% real GDP growth in annual terms in the first quarter of 
2019, growth moderated to 2.0% in the second quarter
, reflecting the unwinding of 
temporary factors (e.g. positive contributions from inventories and falling imports), 
while private consump
tion and government spending remained supportive of 
economic activity
 overall
. Annual headline consumer price inflation picked up 
marginally to 1.8% in July from 1.6% in the previous month, largely on account of core 
inflation, while energy prices declined
. Consumer price inflation excluding food and 
energy increased slightly, rising to 2.2% in July. Growth is projected to gradually return 
to the potential growth rate of just below 2%, while consumer price inflation is 
expected to remain above 2% over the m
edium term.
 The economy in China remains on a gradual
ly slowing
 trajectory.
 In the second 
quarter of 2019 annual GDP growth slowed to 6.2%
, from 6.4% in the first quarter, 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Economic
 and monetary developments
 External environment
  9 owing to weak final consumption that was only partially compensated for 
by 
an improv
ement in investment.
 Looking ahead, growth is projected to decelerate further 
in 2020 and 2021, while no additional fiscal support measures have been announced 
in response to the latest escalation in 
the 
trade dispute. Overall, the deceleration in 
economic
 activity reflects the past effects of the deleveraging campaign to contain 
financial risks, the government™s focus 
on rebalancing 
the economy away from 
investment and the impact of the ongoing trade tensions with the 
United States
. 
Progress with the imple
mentation of structural reforms is projected to result in an 
orderly transition to a more moderate growth path that is less dependent on 
investment and exports.
 In Japan, underlying growth momentum remains muted.
 Growth in the second 
quarter of 2019 was 0.
4% (quarter on quarter), which was better than expected
, largely 
owing 
to a number of transitory factors, including stronger consumer spending 
on account of the Golden Week holiday period and higher durable goods purchases. 
The latter 
is likely 
to have par
tly 
reflected frontloaded demand ahead of 
the 
consumption tax hike scheduled for October 2019. 
However
, exports remained 
subdued
 and industrial output and sentiment in the manufacturing sector deteriorated 
amid weakening external demand and lingering polic
y uncertainty. Net trade 
made 
a negative contribution
, with exports remaining flat, while imports rebounded from the 
weakness observed in the previous quarter. While the near
-term profile will be 
determined by the 
forthcoming 
consumption tax hike, implying
 frontloaded 
consumption in the third quarter and subsequent payback, economic activity is 
projected to remain on a moderate trajectory thereafter.
 In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth contracted in the second quarter of 
2019, largely on account of the u
ncertainty 
surrounding 
Brexit.
 Real GDP growth 
has displayed some volatility since the start of the year, largely 
reflecting 
changes in 
activity patterns related to the original 29 March Brexit deadline. After growing by 0.5% 
(quarter on quarter) in the first quarter, real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the second. 
This was the first quarter of negative growth since 2012 and reflecte
d lower 
investment and, following the last
-minute extension of the Brexit deadline, a reversal 
of the strong inventory build
-up seen in the first quarter. Despite a marked depreciation 
in the 
pound sterling since the start of 2019, export
s contracted by 3.
3% in the second 
quarter. The net trade contribution remained nonetheless positive
, as imports, 
particularly of goods from the EU, fell by 
even 
more 
than exports 
(-12.9% quarter on 
quarter). 
Growth in d
omestic consumption remained robust (0.5% quarter on q
uarter) 
in the second quarter, supported 
in part 
by stronger real wage growth. Survey
-based 
evidence 
points to 
some 
continued slowing of 
economic activity in the coming quarter. 
Annual 
CPI inflation increased modestly to 2.0% in the second quarter
, and fur
ther to 
2.1% in July, largely on account of the recent stronger adverse exchange rate 
movements. Ongoing uncertainties related to Brexit 
modalities 
have 
recently 
been reflected in further volatility in 
the pound 
sterling and
, on the real 
economy 
side
, are 
likely to result in further volatility 
in quarterly 
real GDP growth and muted growth over 
the medium term.
 In central and eastern European countries, growth is projected to remain robust 
over the projection horizon, but more moderate 
than in 
2018. Solid co

  10 spending backed by strong labour markets is expected to support economic activity 
going forward. Investment growth is forecast to remain strong, though it will moderate 
somewhat against the backdrop of a more advanced phase of the EU funds cycle. 
Furthermore, the slowdown in global trade is weighing on the growth outlook for this 
region. Over the medium term, the pace of economic expansion in these countries is 
expected to decelerate further towards potential.
 The outlook for economic activity in lar
ge commodity
-exporting countries 
points to subdued growth.
 In Russia, activity in the second quarter was adversely 
affected by the feed
-in of contaminated oil into a key export pipeline, triggering 
large
-scale disruptions along the supply chain. Although t
emporary, this will weigh on 
growth in 2019, 
which has already been affected by 
an unexpectedly sharp contraction 
in the first quarter due to weak investment
, weak
 net export
s and substantial 
downward revisions 
of 
historical data. Going forward, the outloo
k for growth in Russia 
is being 
shaped by developments in global oil markets, the implement
ation of fiscal 
and structural policies, and the international sanctions under which the economy is 
currently operating. As a result, growth is expected to decelerat
e somewhat in the 
medium term. Growth in Brazil is projected to remain subdued, 
owing 
to uncertainty 
surrounding the pension reforms and concerns about fiscal sustainability. 
Idiosyncratic 
shocks at the beginning of the year (due to a mining disaster) 
also
 weighed negatively 
on activity. Sluggish domestic demand and persistent uncertainty coupled with 
substantial spare capacity are holding back a more vigorous investment response and 
have affected confidence negatively.
 In Turkey, economic activity surprise
d significantly to the upside in the first half 
of 2019.
 Following a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter of 2018, the economy 
recovered in early 2019 on account of a sizeable fiscal stimulus ahead of the local 
elections in March. The economy 
continued 
to grow at 
a solid pace in the second 
quarter, despite some unwinding of the fiscal stimulus, owing to strong household 
consumption and a positive net trade contribution. Investment
, on the 
other hand, 
continued to contract sharply on account of elevated p
olitical uncertainty and tight 
financi
ng conditions. Looking ahead, growth is expected to weaken for the remainder 
of 2019 and to gradually accelerate towards the end of the projection horizon.
 Global trade weakened significantly in the first half of the y
ear.
 Global trade 
growth turned negative in the first quarter and 
remained weak
 in the second. The trade 
weakness is largely explained by slowing industrial activity, heightened trade tensions 
and, to some extent, a weaker Asian tech cycle
.2 The contraction in global trade was 
broad
-based across countries. In addition to one
-off factors (e.g. temporar
ily weak 
domestic demand in the 
United States in view of 
the partial federal government 
shutdown in the first quarter and a contraction in UK im
ports in the second quarter 
following the stockpiling efforts of the previous quarter), the weakness in trade 
also 
stemmed from weak intra
-Asian trade. The latter appears 
to be 
related to the 
slowdown in China™s domestic demand in the context of large regi
onal value chain 
linkages. 
According to CPB data, t
he volume of global merchandise imports, excluding 
the euro area, contracted by 0.6% in June in three
-month
-on-three

  11 confirming continued subdued trade momentum in the second quarter (see Char
t 2). 
As survey indicators on new export orders continue to signal a further deterioration, 
the current weakness in global trade is likely to continue in the near term.
 Since August the trade dispute between the United States and China has 
intensified sign
ificantly.
 In early August, following a bilateral meeting with the 
Chinese authorities, the 
United States 
announced the imposition of 10% tariffs on 
around USD
 300 billion 
worth of US imports from China. These tariffs are being 
implemented in 
two stages, 
on 1 September and 15 December. Initially, the Chinese 
authorities announced 
only 
in-kind retaliatory measures consisting of the decision to 
suspend imports of US crops. 
However, 
towards the end of August, further retaliatory 
measures were announced 
with 
th
e decision to impose additional tariffs of 5% or 10% 
on USD 75 
billion 
worth of Chinese imports from the 
United States 
and to reinstate 
previously suspended tariffs on 
cars 
and car 
parts. This latest move prompted a 
further escalation as the 
United States 
announced the imposition of additional 5% 
tariffs on 
all 
US imports from China (
worth 
around USD
 550
 billion
).3 This further 
intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries will weigh negatively on 
global activity and trade. 
Meanwhile, o
ther
 trade issues 
also 
remain unresolved. The 
US administration has delayed taking a decision on possible increases in car tariffs 
until 
mid
-November 2019, while talks with the EU on a new trade agreement, 
announced in July 2018, are still ongoing.

  12 projected to decelerate to 3.1% this year, from 3.8% in 2018. This reflects increasing 
headwinds to global growth in an environment of high and rising political and policy 
uncertainty. Over the period 20
20-21 growth in 
world economic activity is projected to 
stabilise at 3.5%, as the (cyclical) slowdown in key advanced economies and China™s 
transition to a more moderate growth path are expected to be only partly 
counterbalanced by a gradual recovery in se
veral key 
EMEs
. As the growth 
headwinds weigh more significantly on trade
-intensive demand components, such as 
investment, growth in euro area foreign demand is projected to slow more significantly 
than global activity this year, falling to 1.0%, from 3.7%
 in 2018. Global imports are 
projected to increase gradually over the medium term. Compared with the June 2019 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, both global GDP growth and growth in 
euro area foreign demand have been revised downwards over the fo
recast horizon. 
From a geographical perspective, the revisions 
of 
euro area foreign demand reflect 
weaker than expected trade prospects for 
EMEs
, including China to a 
lesser
 exten
t, as 
well as the outlook of slower import growth across some key trading par
tners, 
including the United Kingdom and other European countries outside the euro area.
 Downside risks to global activity have intensified lately.
 A further escalation of 
trade disputes would pose a risk to global trade and growth. Moreover, a ﬁno dealﬂ 
Brexit scenario could have more adverse spillover effects, especially in Europe. A 
sharper slowdown 
in 
China™s economy could be harder to counteract with efficient 
policy stimul
i and might prove a challenge to the ongoing rebalancing process in 
China. Repric
ing in financial markets might weigh significantly on vulnerable 
EMEs
. A 
further escalation of geopolitical tensions could also adversely affect global activity 
and trade.
 Global price developments
 Developments in oil prices since late July 
have 
mainly 
been 
shaped by 
concerns about the global outlook.
 Following the re
-escalation of US
-China trade 
tensions in early August, oil prices first declined by around 5%, before making up 
some ground in the second half of the month. Since April, the outlook for glo
bal oil 
consumption has been revised down
 repeatedly
. Accordingly, production cuts by the 
OPEC+ group of oil producers, which supported oil prices in the first quarter of the 
year
 in particular
, have not been sufficient to offset headwinds from concerns ab
out 
demand for oil. The impact 
on prices 
of recent geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle 
East has also been limited so far. Going forward, risks to oil prices appear broadly 
balanced. While further weakness in global activity would weigh on prices, rest
rictions 
to supply would bolster them. Indeed, Saudi Arabia and Russia have already indicated 
the possibility of further OPEC+ production cuts in the near future, which could put 
some renewed upward pressure on prices.
 In the September 2019 ECB staff macro
economic projections, oil prices are 
foreseen to decline over the projection horizon.
 Amid short
-term volatility, 
concerns about demand for oil and the re
-intensification of trade tensions have been a 
drag on oil prices, despite the agreement between OPEC 
and other major oil 
producers to curb production. Consequently, the oil price assumptions underpinning

  13 the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections were around 8.3% lower 
for 2019 (and 13.4% and 10.3% lower for 2020 and 2021 respectively) relativ
e to the 
assumptions underpinning the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections. Since the cut
-off date for the September projections, however, the price of 
oil has increased marginally, with Brent crude standing at USD
 61 per barrel on 
5 Septem
ber.
 Global inflationary pressures remain moderate.
 In countries belonging to the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD), annual headline 
consumer price inflation averaged 2.1% in July 2019, up from 2.0% in the previous 
month. The in
crease 
is due 
to a positive contribution 
from 
core inflation (excluding 
food and energy) (see Chart
 3), which picked up to 2.3% from 2.2% in the previous 
month, while energy inflation remained flat. Tight labour market conditions across the 
major advanced 
economies have so far translated into only moderate wage increases, 
suggesting that the underlying inflation pressures remain subdued. Nevertheless, they 
should recover gradually over the projection horizon, reflecting diminishing slack.

 Grow
th in the export prices of the euro area™s competitors is expected to weaken 
sharply this year and gradually decelerate over the medium term. This reflects the 
impact of a downward sloping oil price futures curve, which is expected to outweigh 
the upward p
ressure arising from gradually diminishing global spare capacity.

 Since the Governing Council™s meeting in 
June 2019,
 global long
-term risk
-free rates 
have declined amid market expectations of further accommodative monetary policy 
in 
an environment of heightened global trade uncertainty
. 
This decline in risk
-free rates 
has supported the prices of euro area equities and corporate bonds. Meanwhile, 

corporate earnings expectations have fallen somewhat in response to persistent 

doubts about the global macroeconomic outlook. In foreign exchange markets, the 

euro 
remained broadly unchanged in trade
-weighted terms.
 Long-term yields 
in both the euro area and the United States
 declined 
materially
. During the period under review (6 June 
to 
11 September 2019), the 
GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year sovereign bond yield
 fell by 55 basis points 
to 
-0.06
% 
(see Chart 4)
. 
Ten-year 
sovereign bond yields in the United States and the 
United Kingdom also dropped significantly, by 38 and 19 basis points respectively. The 

sizeable falls in government bond yields partly reflect a reappraisal of interest rate 
expectations in major jurisdictions in the context of heightened uncertainty with regard 
to global trade relations and the broader macroeconomic outlook
.

 Euro area economic growth softened in the second quarter of 2019,
 resuming 
the 
moderate
 performance 
observed in
 2018. In quarter
-on-quarter terms, euro area r
eal 
GDP growth 
slowed to 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019, 
supported 
primarily 
by 
an increase
 in 
domestic demand, while net exports weighed on growth
. 
Looking ahead, 
the latest economic indicators and survey results 
suggest subdued
 growth.
 The September 
2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
 foresee
 annual real GDP 
growth
 at 1.1%
 in 2019 and 1.2
% in 20
20, before gradually reaching 
1.4
% in 20
21. Compared with the 
June 
2019 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for 
euro area 
real GDP 
growth 
has been revised
 down 
for 
2019 and 2020 on account of the deterioration in the short
-term 
outlook
, characterised 
by 
weaker confidence indicators and 
continued global uncertainties.
 Euro area growth remained moderate in the first two quarters of 2019, with 
differences across countries 
becoming more noticeable in the second quarter 
of the year.
 Real GDP increased by 
0.3%, quarter 
on quarter, 
on average 
in the first 
two 
quarter
s of 
2019, continuing at the same average rate of 
growth 
as 
in the p
revious 
year 
(see Chart
 10). 
The moderate per
formance stems largely from a weakening in 
foreign demand. 
Domestic demand continued to be the main 
driver of economic 
activity and has been the main GDP component supporting growth
 since real GDP 
growth started to slow in early 2018
. 
Changes in inventorie
s made a 
negligible 
contribution to real GDP growth in the second quarter
 of 2019
, whereas net trade 
made a negative 
contribut
ion, reflecting subdued
 foreign demand against a 
background of global policy uncertainty
. On the production side, 
softened 
economi
c activity in the second quarter 
of 2019 was explained by
 negative growth in the 
manufacturing sector due to
 both international 
trade 
disputes
 and country
-specific
 developments
 (see Box 3). T
he services 
sector lost some momentum in the second 
quarter of 20
19 in terms of value added, possibly reflecting some spillover stemming 
from manufacturing sector weakness.

August 
2019 for th

 Developments in p
rivate consumption continue to be driven by the recovery in 
the labour market.
 Priv
ate consumption rose by 0.2
%, quarter on quarter, in the 
second
 quarter of 201
9, following somewhat 
stronger 
growth in the first quarter
. 
The 
latest 
developments in retail trade and 
passenger 
car registrations
 are broadly in line 
with steady consumption growth expected in the near term
. From a longer
-term 
perspective, 
increasin
g labour income
 is supporting 
consum
er spending
, which is also 
reflected in still robust 
consumer confidence
 (see Box 5)
. 
In addition, t
he strengthening of household balance sheets remains a
n important 
factor 
underpinning
 resilient
 consumption growth
, with household creditworthiness being a 
key 
determinant of consumers™ access to credit.
 Business investment 
growth 
is expected to 
continue to be supported by 
accommodative financing conditions
, although subdued 
earnings expectations
 suggest some moderation
. Euro area investment growth (excluding
 construction) 
rebounded in the second quarter of 2019, rising to 1.0% in quarter
-on-quarter terms 
from 
-0.9% in the first quarter of 2019. 
Business investment is expected 
to see 
moderate growth in the near term
, 
however, 
in line with 
relatively weak
 busin
ess 
margins and 
firm valuations.
 Earnings expectations for listed 
companies in
 the euro 
area suggest a certain degree of moderation regarding 
investment
 decisions
, although
 favourable financing conditions 
should be 
reflected in 
non-financial corporations™ 
access to credit and thus boost business investment growth.
 Developments in housing markets are expected to support growth, albeit with a 
moderating momentum.
 Quarterly growth in h
ousing investment slowed significantly 
to 0.3% in the second quarter of 2019
 from 1.4% in the previous quarter, posting the 
lowest outcome since the first quarter of 2017. Recent short
-term indicators and 
survey results suggest some decelerating momentum in the third quarter of 2019, 
although they remain above historical averages.

  22 decelerating, momentum in the third quarter. 
Similarly
, the Purchasing Managers™ 
Index (PMI) indicator for construction output and its residential c
omponent indicated 
broadly flat growth expectations in the construction sector
 in July and August,
 standing
 below the average level recorded 
in the previous quarter.
 Growth in e
uro area export
s weakened further in the second quarter of 2019 to 
0.0%, owing 
to a 0.1% decline in goods export volumes
. Exports of services 
continued to weaken but still expanded by 0.4%. The overall performance mainly 
reflected extra
-euro area exports, and specifically the abrupt fall in exports to the 
United Kingdom related to pe
rsistent uncertainty regarding Brexit. Conversely, some 
support was provided by overall exports to Asia (excluding China) and primarily 
chemical exports to the United States. 
Looking ahead, 
leading 
indicators 
suggest 
anaemic growth 
for euro area 
exports, although the indicator for 
new manufacturing 
export 
orders 
outside the euro area provided somewhat more positive signals, as did 
some shipping indices
 over the summer
. The latest economic indicators and survey results confirm ongoing
 downside 
risk
s to the
 euro area economic 
growth
 outlook.
 Euro area industrial production 
(excluding construction) saw a broad
-based month
-on-month decline of 1.6% in July, 
most notably driven by a decrease in capital goods production. As regards survey 
information, t
he European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) 
increased between July and August to stand above its long
-term average. Compared 
with the previous quarter, however, it has declined on average so far in the third 
quarter of 2019. The composite out
put PMI remained muted throughout the second 
quarter of 2019. Despite the slight improvement seen more recently, in August it 
remained below its long
-term average, suggesting a mild outlook for economic growth.
 The 
ECB
™s monetary policy 
will
 continue to un
derpin domestic demand
 against 
the deterioration in the short
-term outlook for euro area real GDP growth.
 Private consumption is supported by 
healthy household balance sheets, robust labour 
markets and 
ongoing employment gains. Business investment is foste
red by 
favourable financing conditions
 and solid demand, 
despite weaker
 corporate 
profitability. Housing investment remains robust
 overall
. 
The slowdown
 in global 
activity is
, however,
 expected to continue
 to weigh on euro area growth and have an
 impact on
 euro area exports
 against a background of ongoing global policy uncertainty 
and heightened geopolitical risks.
 The 
September 
2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual real GDP increasing by
 1.1%
 in 201
9, 1.2
% in 20
20 and 1.
4% in 
2021 (see Chart
 12). Compared with the 
June 
2019 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for 
euro area 
real GDP growth has been revised 
down 
for 
2019 and 2020 on account of the deterioration in the short
-term outlook
. 
The risks 
surrounding the euro area growth outlook
 remain tilted to the downside.
 Global policy 
uncertainty, rising protectionism and geopolitical factors have regained prominence 
recently and continue to be a drag on euro area growth.

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.0% in 
August 2019, unchanged from July. 
Measures of underlying inflation remained 
generally muted
, and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. While 
labour cost
 pressures strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity 
utilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass
-through to inflation is taking longer 
than previously anticipated. 
Looking ahead, 
underlying inflation is expected to 
increase
 over the
 medium term
, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth.
 This assessment is also 
broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the 
euro area, which foresee annua
l HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 
1.5% in 2021. Compared with the June 2019 
Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down over the whole 
projection horizon, reflecting lower energy prices 
and the weaker growth environment.
 Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 1.1% in 2019, 1.
2% in 2020 and 1.
5% in 2021.
 Headline inflation was unchanged in August.
 According to Eurostat™s flash 
estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.0% in August, unchanged from July
 and down from 1.3% in June (see Chart 13). Energy inflation continued to decline and 
turned negative
 in August
, but was offset by higher food i
nflation than in July.

4 Measures of underlying inflation that tend to be less volatile than HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food have also been fairly stable over recent quarters (data 
available up to July only; see Chart 14). HICP inflation excluding energy, food, 
travel
-related items and clothing was unchanged at 1.1% in June and July. The 
Persistent and Common Component of Inflation (PCCI)
 increased slightly from 1.2% 
in June to 1.3% in July. The Supercore measure
 decreased from 1.4% in June to 1.3% 
in July.

ures of underlying inflation continued to move sideways but are 
up from their lows in 2016.

 Notes: The latest observations are for August 2019 (
flash estimate) for HICP excluding energy and food and for July 2019 for all other 
measures. The range of measures of underlying inflation consists of the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding ener
gy and 
unprocessed food; HICP excluding energy a
nd food; HICP excluding energy, food, travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% trimmed 
mean of the HICP; the 30% trimmed mean of the HICP; and the weighted median of the HICP. Growth rates for HICP excluding ener
gy 
and food for 2015 are distorted upwards
 owing to a methodological change (see
 the box entitled ﬁ

price index in Germany and its impact on HIC
P inflation rates
ﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 2, ECB, 2019).
 The latest indicators of price pressures for non
-energy industrial goods 
consumer prices provided mixed signals.
 Producer price inflation for domestic 
sales of non
-food consumer goods decreased to
 0.8% in July from 0.9% in May and 
June, but remained well above its long
-term average. The corresponding rate of 
import price inflation increased to 0.8% in July, from 0.5% in June. Earlier in the pricing 
chain, however, 
domestic 
producer price inflation 
for intermediate goods continued to 
decline, likely reflecting 
in 
part the recent decrease in energy prices. Price pressures 
also declined at the very early stages of the pricing chain, with both oil and non
-oil 
commodity prices recording a decrease in the
 year
-on-year inflation rate in August 
compared with July.

  26 Wage growth has remained robust.
 Annual growth in compensation per employee 
was 2.1% in the second quarter of 2019, down slightly from the 2.2% recorded in the 
first quarter (see Chart 15). The fig
ures for the first and second quarters of 
2019 were 
affected by a significant drop in social security contributions.
6 Annual growth in wages 
and salaries per employee, which excludes social security contributions, was 2.4% in 
the second quarter, after 2.6%
 in the first quarter and 2.3% on average for the previous 
year. Annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area was 2.0% in the second 
quarter of 2019, down from 2.3% in the first quarter, with the reduction driven mainly 
by one
-off payments in Germany
. Looking through temporary factors, annual growth in 
compensation per employee has stabilised since mid
-2018 at a level slightly above its 
historical average of 2.1%.

 The

 2019 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections expect underlying 
inflation 
to incr
ease over the medium term
. These projections
, which are based on 
the information available at the end of August,
 expect headline HICP inflation to 
average 1.

3%, 1.
4% and 1.6% respectively in the 
June 2019 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections 
(see Chart
 17). The revisions are largely explained by the energy component, 
which 
was
 revised notably downwards for both 2019 and 2020, due to lower oil prices.
 HICP 
inflation excluding energy and food is
 projected to 
move sideways in 2020 and 
strengthen in 2021
, 
supported by the expected pick
-up in activity and the associated 
recovery in profit margins as past increases in labour costs feed into prices.
 HICP 
inflation excluding energy and food is expected
 to rise from 1.1% in 2019 to 1.
2% in 
2020 and 1.5% in 2021. This profile represents a downward revision, mainly reflecting 
weaker than expected data outturns so far this year.

 In July
 2019 the annual growth of broad m
oney 
increased markedly, while loans to the 
private sector remained broadly unchanged. M3 growth 
remained resilient 
in the face 
of the
 fading
-out of the mechanical contribution of 
net purchases under the 
asset 
purchase programme (
APP) and 
weakening economic momentum
. 
At the same time, 
favourable
 bank funding and lending conditions 
continued to support 
loan flows and 
thereby 
economic growth
. 
Net issuance of debt securities by 
non-financial 
corporations (
NFCs
) was robust in the second quarter of 2019, after recording the 
highest historical level of net issuance in the first quarter of 2019
, 
amid a continuous 
improvement in 
bond market conditions
. Broad money growth 
increased markedly
 in 
July.
 The annual growth rate of M3 
rose
 to 
5.2% in 
July
 2019 from 4.
5% in 
June
 2019 (see Chart 18),
 returning to the 
solid 
growth rate
s observed 
in the period from 
2015 to 2017

was suppo
rted by lower opportunity costs and
 remained resilient 
in the face of 
the 
fading
-out of the
 positive
 mechanical contribution of 
net purchases under 
the APP
 and 
weakening economic momentum
. The narrow monetary aggregate M1, which 
includes the most liquid co
mponents of M3, continued to be the main contributor to 
broad money growth. The annual growth rate of M1 increased 
in 
July
 to
 7.8%, from
 7.2% in 
June
, 
continuing its recovery
 observed since 
the start of the year.

, making a neutral contribution 
to M3 growth in July. At the same time, m
arketable instruments (i.e.
 M3 minus
 M2)
 continued to contribute negatively to broad money growth as a result of the relatively 
low remuneration of these instruments.
 External monetary inflows
 strengthened their contribution
 to M3 growth 
further 
in July.
 The decreasing mechanical 
impact
 of the APP 
on M3 growth has been largely 
offset by positive contributions from credit to the private sector
, which 
remain

main source of money creation
 (see the

he positive 
contribution
 to M3 growth from
 general
 government securities held by the 
Eurosystem
, which reflects the mechanical contribution of the APP to M3 growth, has 
become marginal 
(see the 
red

he smaller
 contribution 
made by
 the APP has
 been replaced
 by external monetary flows 
(see the yellow parts of the bars in Chart 19). T

As such, it also covers

. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector
 remain
ed broadly 
unchanged
 with weakness in some cyclical
ly sensitive segments
. The annual 
growth rate of 
MFI 
loans to the private
 sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation 
and notional cash pooling) stood at 3.6% in July, compared with 3.5% in June (see 
Chart 1
8). This development was mainly owing to the slight increase in the annual 
growth rate of loans to households to 3.4% 
in July, compared with 3.3% in June. 
Annual loan growth to households 
thus 
continued
 on its gradual upward trend, 
benefiting from further improvements in the labour market and still favourable
 housing

 Bank
s™ debt
 funding conditions 
have improved further
. Since the beginning of 
2019 the 
composite cost of debt financing
 for euro area banks
 has decreased further,
 broadly in line with developments in market reference rates
 (see Chart
 22). This 
development has been driven mainly by a consi
derable decline in bank bond yields, 
while
 euro area banks™ deposit rates have 
remained 
close to their historical lows. 
Compared with deposits, bank bonds have remained the more expensive source of 
funding, accounting for a limited share in banks™ overall 
debt funding. The 
improvement in banks™ debt funding costs was widespread
 across the largest euro 
area countries. Moreover, in their responses to the ECB™s bank lending survey, euro 
area banks reported improved access to funding in the first half of 2019, 
primarily on 
account of their access to debt securities funding. At the same time, the level of bank 
funding costs remained heterogeneous across the largest euro area countries. In the 
first half of 2019 euro area banks™ loan
-deposit margins for new busine
ss decreased 
somewhat. In this respect, 
the ability to charge negative rates on deposits
, which is 
heterogeneous across countries for NFC deposits,
 significantly affects the size of 
these margins.
 In this way, t
he compression of loan
-deposit margins exerts
 a dampening impact on bank profitability
. H
owever
, this is
 compensated 
for 
by the 
positive impact of the low or even negative interest rate environment on credit quality
 (which reduces provisioning cost
s) and lending volumes
. Overall, euro area banks™ 
fun
ding 
conditions
 continue to be favourable, reflecting t
he ECB™s accommodative 
monetary policy stance 
and the strengthening of bank
s™ balance sheets.
 Despite the

ng their balance sheets,

and households 
decreased further
. This was 
broadly in line with developments in market reference rates
. In July 2019 the 
composite bank lending rate for NFCs
 (see Chart 23)
 stood at 1.56%,
 only marginally 
above its historical low, while t
he composite bank lending rate for housing loans 
reached a new historical low in July, when it declined to
 1.61% (see Chart 24). 
Competitive pressures and more favourable bank funding costs dampened lending
 rates for loans to euro area NFCs and households. Overall, c
omposite bank lending 
rates for loans to NFCs and households have 
fallen
 significantly since the ECB™s credit 
easing measures were announced in June
 2014. 
Between May
 2014 and 
July 
2019 composite
 lending rates on loans to NFCs and households fell by 
around 
140 and 130 basis points respectively.
 The reduction in bank lending rates for loans to NFCs, as 
well as for loans to small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to •0.25 million 
are grant
ed primarily to small firms), was particularly significant in those euro area 
countries 
more affected by
 the financial crisis. This indicates a more uniform 
transmission of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and 
firm sizes.

  35 with earlier economic slowdowns, d
ebt financing flows to NFCs have

a greater
 contribution 
from
 services and real estate

investment growth and a 
slowdo

all of 
which have supported debt

. In the second quarter of 2019 
the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs 
remained quite robust, albeit decreasing, compared with the level recorded in 
the previous quarter, which was
 the highest level recorded since 1999.
 The 
moderation in the net issuance of debt securities in the second quarter of 2019 is in 
line with the typical seasonal pattern of the series and the pay
-back effect following 
their exceptional strength 
Œ at •42 bil
lion 
Œ in the previous quarter. Furthermore, from 
April to June 2019 the cost of market
-based debt financing declined by a further 25 
basis points and continued to provide support to net debt securities issuance. Taking a 
medium
-term perspective, the gradu
al slowdown in annual net issuance flows
 that 
started in 2017 seems to have stopped at least temporarily (see Chart 25), thus 
confirming signs of a gradual stabilisation observed since the beginning of 2019. 
Market data suggest that the net issuance of deb
t securities 
in July and August 2019 
has remained strong, although confined to investment
-grade issuers, while high
-yield 
issuance remains much more muted than it was in the second quarter of 2019. The n

issuance of listed shares
 continued to weaken and 
turned negative in the second

cost of equity financing.

expected to 
increase 
from

unchanged. The higher deficit is expected to persist in 2020 and to increase further to 
1.0% of GDP in 2021 (see Chart 26) owing to a continued decline in the c

to the

 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to 
be mildly 
expansionary
 over the entire projection horizon
.9 The loosening of the stance
 in 
2019 mainly results from 
cuts to dire
ct taxes in France

and increases in
 public expenditure in Germany
. In the following two years,
 the stance will continue to 
be mildly expansionary, mainly on account of 
further cuts to direct taxes and social

 The euro area aggregate public debt

to continue to

reduction in 
the

a negative interest rate

in the aggregate euro area debt

 1 The September policy package
 Prepared by 
Julian Schumacher and Ine Van Robays
 At its September meeting, the Governing Co
uncil faced a more protracted
 slowdown
 of the euro area economy than previously anticipated
, persistent 
and 
salient 
downside r
isks 
and a further delay in the convergence of inflation 
towards 
its
 medium
-term inflation aim
. The outlook for inflation has cont
inued to fall 
short of the Governing Council™s aim
 on the back of slower euro area growth 
dynamics.
 Inflation rates, both realised and projected,
 have
 failed to pick up 
in recent 
months, measures of 
underlying inflation 
have 
remain
ed generally 
muted
, and 
market 
and survey
-based indicators
 of long
-run inflation expectations stand at historically low 
levels.
 This picture is also reflected in the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections 
for the euro area, which show a further downgrade of the inflation and 
growth 
outlook.
 In the pursuit of its mandate to deliver price stability in the euro area, the 
Governing Council adopted a substantial package of monetary policy 
measures.
 The package consists of five elements: (i) a cut in the interest rate on the 
deposit
 facility, (ii) adjustments to the forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, 
(iii) the restart of net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), (iv) 
modifications to the modalities of the new series of targeted longer
-term refinancing 
opera
tions (TLTRO III), and (v) the introduction of a two
-tier system for reserve 
remuneration. These measures complement 
each other in providing 
substantial 
monetary stimulus
. 
They
 will lock in financial conditions across various segments of 
the market 
that ar
e sufficiently supportive to foster a reacceleration of growth and the 
anchoring of inflation expectations
. They preserve favourable bank lending conditions 
and also
 support 
the smooth transmission of 
the accommodative monetary policy 
stance to the real ec
onomy
. First, the Governing Council decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit 
facility to 
-0.50%.
 In 
an environment of
 excess liquidity, the deposit facility rate is the 
anchor for 
short
-term
 interest rate
s, 
which 
in turn underpin
 the monetary poli
cy 
transmission mechanism. 
The interbank market rate (EONIA)
 anchors the overnight 
index
 swap curve in the euro area
, which underlies 
the pricing of many financial 
instruments and, in particular, the reference rates that are i
mportant for loan rate 
fixatio
n. Reductions in the deposit facility rate
 thus
 provide monetary policy stimulus 
across the entire term structure of interest rates, which constitutes the basis for 
funding costs for businesses and households. Lowering the interest rate on the 
deposit faci
lity by 10 basis points therefore adds further accommodation and, in 
addition, encourages
 banks to lend to the economy instead of holding on
 to 
liquidity
, 
which should support 
the portfolio rebalancing channel of the APP
. Second, the Governing Council 
provided a clear signpost for the future path of 
short
-term interest rates by amending the state
-based element of its forward 
guidance.
 The adjustments complement the Governing Council™s emphasis on 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Boxes
 The September policy package
  41 symmetry in its inflation aim that it had stressed at its
 July meeting, underlining its 
determination to act in the face of inflation running below the definition of price stability 
with the same commitment as with inflation running above it. The September meeting 
provided further clarifications of
 the forward g
uidance.
 The Governing Council has now strengthened the state
-based element of its 
forward guidance by linking it to a more stringent set of conditions for the 
inflation outlook.
 These enhancements clarify the reaction function of the Governing 
Council wit
h respect to developments in the inflation outlook.
 In particular, the 
Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain ﬁ
at their present 
or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level 
sufficiently c
lose to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such 
convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
ﬂ The 
reference to levels ﬁ
sufficiently close to, but below, 2%
ﬂ signals that 
the 
inflation 
outlook has 
to increase 
significantly from 
its 
current realised and 
expected
 levels, and 
that
 the convergence of the inflation outlook will need to be observed within the 
projection horizon. Moreover, the inflation outlook will have to converge in a robust 
manner, meaning 
that th
e Governing Council wants to be sure that the process of 
convergence is sufficiently mature and realistic before starting to lift policy rates.
 The 
qualification that convergence must be reflected in u
nderlying inflation 
dynamics 
ensure
s that the trajector
y of realised inflation should underpin 
the
 inflation outlook.
 These elements provide a safeguard 
against reacting 
too strongly 
to transitory 
inflation 
shocks
, as well as to 
forecast and measurement errors
. The strengthened forward guidance underlines the Governing Council™s 
commitment to maintain a highly accommodative stance for as long as needed 
for inflation to sustainably reach levels around 
its
 medium
-term aim.
 In addition, 
the Governing Council indicat
ed that interest rates could be reduced further if 
warranted by the inflation outlook, thus retaining an ﬁeasing biasﬂ on policy rates.
 Third, 
the Governing Council decided to restart 
net purchases under 
its APP 
at 
a monthly pace of •
20 billion
, and will c
ontinue to reinvest for an extended 
period of time.
 Renewed net asset purchases will keep a lid on long
-term rates by 
compressing risk premia. At the same time, the Governing Council decided to 
continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from mat
uring securities 
purchased under the APP for an extended period 
after the date when interest rates are 
raised
, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity 
conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation
. 
The Governing
 Council 
also 
decided to extend the possibility 
of purchasing
 assets with yields below the 
deposit facility rate
, to the extent necessary,
 to the private sector parts of the APP, 
namely the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3), the asset
-backed 
securities purchase programme (ABSPP) and the corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP). This extension will facilitate the continued smooth 
implementation of the APP and reflects changes in market interest rates relative to the 
deposit facility rate.
 Resum
ing net asset purchases will complement the impact of the forward 
guidance on interest rates, as they are expected to run for as long as necessary 
to strengthen the accommodative impact of the policy rates and to end shortly

es The September policy package
  42 before interest rates are raise
d. This enhances the signalling role for 
policy rates
. 
Since the state
-based element of the forward guidance on the 
ECB™s key interest rates
 is based on developments in projected inflation and the trajectory of underlying 
inflation, it makes the horizon fo
r net purchases contingent on the inflation outlook
. 
Furthermore, linking the reinvestment policy to interest rates also ensures that the 
reinvestment horizon moves together with the expected path of interest rates, thereby 
strengthening the latter™s accom
modative impact.
 Fourth, the
 Governing Council decided to adapt the modalities of TLTRO 
III
. The 
pricing of the new operations has been made more attractive. In particular, 
the 
10-basis point 
spread
 over the entry and minimum borrowing rates announced
 in 
June
 has been removed. The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of 
the average rate applied in the main refinancing operations over the life of the 
respective TLTRO III operation. Banks that lend more than a specified benchmark will
 be offered a lower rate, which can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit 
facility. The new pricing will
 suppor
t bank funding conditions to ensure that banks 
continue to offer 
favourable lending conditions to firms and households
. Furthermo
re, 
the maturity of the TLTRO III operations has been prolonged from two to three years to 
better align their length 
with the typical maturity of bank
-based financing of investment 
projects
. This
 enhances the support that 
TLTRO 
III 
will 
provide to the fina
ncing of the 
real economy.
 Finally,
 counterparties 
will have the opportunity to make voluntary early 
repayments of the borrowed amounts 
at a quarterly frequency starting two years after 
the settlement of each operation
. Together, these modifications will p
reserve 
favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary 
policy and further
 support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.
 Finally,
 the Governing Council decided to introduce a two
-tier system for 
reserve remuneration, 
in which part of banks™ holdings of excess liquidity are 
exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.
 The Governing Council has been 
closely monitoring the possible side effects of negative interest rates on bank
-based 
intermediation, which can become m
ore prominent 
the longer negative rates are in 
place and the lower they are
. In this regard, a
 two
-tier system will help 
to preserve the 
positive impact
 of 
the 
negative 
interest 
rate policy 
on the economy by offsetting
 some 
of the direct 
impact
 on bank pro
fitability. 
The 
maximum 
volume of reserve holdings in 
excess of minimum reserve requirements that will be exempt from the deposit facility 
rate 
Œ the exempt tier 
Œ will be determined as a multiple of 
credit institutions™
 minimum 
reserve requirements.
 The m
ultiplier
, which
 will be applicable as of 
the seventh
 maintenance period 
of 2019, will be set at 6, and the exempt tier will be remunerated 
at an annual rate of 0%
.12 The remuneration rate of the exempt tier and the multiplier 
to determine its maximum size 
can be changed over time
, based on money market 
conditions
. 
With current liquidity conditions,
13 the exempt tier could amount to 43% of 
excess liquidity holdings if credit institutions make full use of their exempt allowances
.                                                                     12  The size of the exempt 
tier is determined on the basis of average end
-of-calendar
-day balances on the 
credit 
institutions™ reserve accounts over a maintenance period.
 Including minimum reserve 
requirements, which are remunerated at the interest rate on the main refinancing opera
tions (currently 
0%), the maximum total amount of reserves (i.e. required plus excess reserves) to which the deposit 
facility rate does not apply is thus limited at seven times minimum reserve requirements.

nts and excess liquidity holdings in the third and fourth 
maintenance periods of 2019

  43 This will support
 the bank
-based transmission of monetary policy
, thereby enhancing 
the effectiveness of the 
negative interest rates policy 
in the pass
-through of low 
policy 
rates to bank lending rates.
 This comprehensive policy package will support the convergence of inflation to 
the 
Governing Council™s medium
-term aim.
 Through each of the policy measures 
and their mutually reinforcing impact, the September policy decisions will provide 
substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that businesses and households can continue 
to borrow at ver
y attractive rates. The favourable financing conditions will underpin the 
economic expansion by supporting consumption and investment dynamics which, in 
turn, will support the convergence of inflation to the Governing Council™s aim.
 In any case, 
the Govern
ing Council reiterated that it continues to stand ready to 
adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to steer inflation towards its aim in 
a sustained manner.
 A highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be 
needed for a prolonged period of ti
me. The September policy package underscores 
the Governing Council™s determination and readiness to provide the necessary 
accommodation in the pursuit of its price stability objective. If the inflation outlook 
continues to linger at levels well below its i
nflation aim, the Governing Council 
continues to be prepared to use all of its 
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that 
inflation
 converges sustainably to its aim
 of close to, but below, 2% in the medium 
term, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operat

  44 2 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 17 April to 30 July 2019
 Prepared by 
Annette Kamps and Christian Lizarazo
 This box describes the 
Eurosystem liquidity conditions and the 
ECB™s 
monetary policy operations during the 
thir
d and 
fourth
 reserve maintenance 
periods of 201
9, which ran 
from 17 April to 11 June 2019 and from 12 June to 30 
July 2019
, respectively.
 Throughout this period the interest rates on the main 
refinancing operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility and
 the deposit facility 
remained unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and 
-0.40% respectively. In parallel, the 
Eurosystem 
continued the reinvestment phase of its asset purchase programme 
(APP), reinvesting principal payments from maturing 
public sector securities, 
covered 
bonds, asset
-backed securities and corporate sector securities
. Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average 
aggregate 
daily liquidity needs of the 
banking system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, st
ood at •
1,511.3 
billion, 
an increase of •14.9 
billion compared 
with t
he previous review period (i.e. 
the 
first
 and 
second reserve 
maintenance 
periods of 201
9) (Table A)
. This slight increase in liquidity needs was largely the 
result of an increase in net a
utonomous factors, which increased by 
•13.0 
billion to 
•1,381.3 
billion during the review period
. The 
increase
 in net autonomous factors was due to 
an increase i
n liquidity
-absorbing
 factors
, which more than offset
 the growth in 
liquidity
-providing factors
. Liquidity
-absorbing factors increased primarily due to 
ﬁOther autonomous factorsﬂ, which grew on average by 
•28.2 
billion
 to 
•788.7 billion, 
and banknotes in circulation, which grew on average by 
•21.8 billion to 
•1,234.1 
billion. Government deposits, wh
ich can exhibit seasonal volatility, remained broadly 
unchanged at 
•270.5 billion (up by •7.2 billion) on average over the period under 
review. Among liquidity
-providing factors, net assets denominated in euro increased 
on average by 
•16.3 billion to 
•213.0 billion compared to the previous review period, 
during which a seasonal pattern at year
-end led to a stronger increase. 
Liquidity
-providing factors also increased thanks to a higher value of net foreign 
assets, which grew on average by 
•27.9 billion, sim
ilar to the previous review period.

 Liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments
 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations
 Œ incl
uding both tender operations and 
monetary policy portfolios 
Œ decreased
 by •
27.9 
billion to •3,
341.2 billion (see Chart 
A).
 This decrease was driven by lower 
demand in tender operations as well as a smaller liquidity injection stemming from 
monetary policy
 portfolios, which was due to redemptions of securities purchased 
under the securities markets programme and a small decline in the book value of the 
assets acquired in the public sector purchase programme (PSPP). 
Limited temporary 
deviations in the overal
l size and composition of the 
APP
 may occur during the 
reinvestment phase 
for
 operational reasons.

  48 The average amount of liquidity 
provided through tender operations declined 
slightly over the review period, by •
12.6 
billion to •
715.1 
billion.
 This decrease 
was 
mainly attributable to lower 
liquidity provided through 
targeted 
longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTROs),
 which decreased
 on average by 
•11.2 billion
 as a 
result of voluntary early repayments. Lower demand by counterparties led to a decline 
in the provision of liquidity via MROs and via three
-month longer
-term refinancing 
operations (LTROs), falling by 
•0.8 
billion to •
5.1 
billion
 on average and by 
•0.7 
billion 
to •
3.3 
billion
 on average, respectively.
 Liquidity provided through the Eurosystem™s monetary policy portfolios 
decreased by •
15.4 
billion to •
2,625.9 
billion on average, 
owing to redemptions 
of bonds held under the s
ecurities market programme and a small decline in the 
PSPP.
 Redemptions of bonds held under the 
securities 
market
s programme and the 
first
 two covered bond purchase programmes totalled •
5.4 
billion.
 Regarding the APP 
portfolios, since 1 January 2019
 the 
programme
 has been in
 the reinvestment phase
. Limited temporary deviations in the over
all size and composition of the 
APP may occur 
during the reinvestment phase for operational reasons.
14 The PSPP declined slightly
 over the review period by 
•9.2 
billion
 to 
•2,092.4 
billion
 on 
average.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity 
declined
 compared with the previous review period, by •
42.9 
billion to 
•1,829.6 billion (see Chart 
A).
 This 
decline 
reflects 
higher n
et autonomous factors 
and lower liquidity provided through the Eurosystem™s tender operations and monetary 
policy portfolios. 
Regarding the allocation of excess liquidity holdings between current 
accounts and the deposit facility, average current account h
oldings 
increased 
marginally, 
by •
1.2 
billion to •
1,372.5 
billion, 
while
 average recourse to the deposit 
facility declined by •
42.0 
billion to •
587.4 
billion.
 Interest rate developments
 Overnight unsecured and secured money market rates 
for general collate
ral 
remained close to the ECB deposit facility rate.
 In the unsecured market, the euro 
overnight
 index average (EONIA) averaged 
-0.36
3%, unchanged from 
the previous 
review period. 
It
 fluctuated between a low of 
-0.37
9%, observed on 
19 June, 
and a 
high of 
-0.252%, observed on 7 June, ahead of the Whit Monday holiday on 10 June. 
The increase in the rate coincided with a noticeable drop in the volume by almost •800 
million to •611 million between Thursday, 6 June and Friday, 7 June
. 
Anecdotally, 
EONIA panel ba
nks have historically shown a tendency to move from overnight into 
two or three
-day maturities in order to bridge long weekends. As a result, the EONIA 
volume tends to decline abruptly on such days.

area
 industrial production
 
 After a sharp decline in 2018 amid weak global trade, year
-on-year growth in 
euro area industrial production (excl
uding
 construction) recovered marginally 
in 2019 but remain
ed in negative territory.
 In
 the 
period 
from 
January 2018 to June 
2019 the year
-on-year growth rate of euro area industrial production (excl
uding
 construction) fell by 6.3 
percentage points overall
, from 3.9% to 
-2.4% (see Chart A). 
This is by far the largest fall recorded 
among
 major eco
nomies in th
at period. In the 
United States, the decline in industrial production started later
, in September 2018. 
Among the largest euro area 
countries
, 
the biggest declines were recorded by 
Germany
 (10.9 percentage points)
, the Netherlands
 (5.7 percenta
ge points)
 and Italy
 (5.5 percentage points)
. 
In France and Spain, 
industrial production
 dropped in 2018 in 
line with developments in all other euro area countries
, but reversed its negative trend 
in 2019;
 the patterns remain highly volatile
, however
. 
The slowdown in manufacturing 
activity 
in the euro area 
seems to have had 
an adverse impact on growth rates in some 
sub
-components of services,
 although
 the service
s sector 
overall 
has 
so far remained 
relatively resilient.

area industrial production,

. Note:
 The latest observation is for June 2019
. A model covering industrial production in a number of large economies is used 
to assess the importance of foreign spillovers to euro area industrial 
production.
 The model uses seasonally adjusted 
monthly 
industrial production
 series
 (excl
uding
 construction
) for the euro area, China, the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and the U
nited 
States
 (see Chart A). It is estimated 
for
 a relatively short sample period (January 2007 
to June 2019)
, partly
 because
 the 
economic relationships between
 countries 
may 
have been different before
 the global economic and financial crisis
, but also to include 
data for China
. The
 model also controls for a global factor, which is proxied by the 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) for
 world 
new export orders (see Chart 
B). To give 
more prominence to this 
global trade factor, 
it 
is assumed to 
only react with a lag to
 industrial production shocks in
 individual countr
ies
, while industrial production in each 
country reacts to global shocks contemporaneously. All other variables are modelled 
assuming that 
a shock 
has an instantaneous effect on the variable 
in the home country 
that is 
larger 
in absolute value than its 
effect on foreign variables.
16 The results of the m
odel suggest that the 
fall in industrial production growth in 
the euro area in the past year
 has been driven by both 
weaker foreign demand 
for euro area goods 
and a
dverse 
domestic 
shocks.
 Whereas
 weakness in 
international trade was the main contributor to the fall in 
euro area 
industrial 
production 
growth 
in the first half of 2018
 (see

),17 from July 2018 
onwards euro area

also 
play
ed a major role (see

 How does the current employment expansion in the euro area compare with historical

  53 4 How does the current employment expansion in the euro 
area compare with historical patterns?
 Prepared by Vasco Botelho and António Dias da Silva
 This box looks at the current 
employment expansion in the euro area and 
compares it with past periods of employment growth.
 Employment in the euro 
area has grown for almost six consecutive years, from its trough in the second quarter 
of 2013. Since the start of the current employment e
xpansion, employment has 
increased by more than 11 million people and the unemployment rate has declined by 
more than 4 percentage points, with the latter approaching the levels reached before 
the crisis. Meanwhile, labour productivity growth and real wage
 growth have been 
relatively weak. Against this background, this box
 aims to identify 
similarities and 
differences between
 the current employment expansion 
and previous episodes
 of 
expansion
. In particular, it takes a long
-term perspective to analyse the r
elationship 
between employment growth and GDP growth, the behaviour of unemployment, and 
the relationship between productivity growth and real wage growth. The analysis 
relies 
on annual data from the European Commission AMECO database for the 
first 
12 coun
tries
 to join the euro area
18, 
for the period 
between 1960 and 201
8. Th
ese
 data 
are 
then partitioned in
to
 ten 
separate
 periods of consecutive 
positive
 or negative 
employment growth
.19 These periods, 
which 
identify employment expansions and 
contractions, 
are
 a useful benchmark to assess the strength and maturity of the 
current employment expansion
. From a historical perspective, the current employment expansion has not been 
particularly lengthy
 so far, with average employment growth being marginally 
lower than
 that observed during the previous expansion
. Chart A shows the 
average yearly employment and GDP growth for the 12 countries during the identified 
periods of employment expansion or contraction. 
The median employment expansion 
lasted around six years, wit
h the 1995
-2008 expansion being the longest period of 
consecutive employment growth over the time period analysed in this box. The 
median employment contraction lasted around two years. Against this backdrop, the 
current period of employment expansion is n
ot particularly long.
 Looking at the rate of 
expansion, d
uring the last three employment expansions, employment increased on 
average by 1.4% per year. 
In the current expansion, b
y contrast, employment 
rose at a 
rate of
 around 1.2% 
for 
each year
 between 201
4 and 2018
, with 
a lower rate being 
forecast for
 2019.20                                                                     18  The 12 countrie
s considered in the analysis are: Belgium,
 Germany, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. They are referred to as the EA12.
 19  Using this definition, the historical data from 1960 to 2018 
were
 pa
rtitioned into 
ten
 distinct time periods. 
An exception is made for 2011, which has been included in a period of contraction despite recording a 
slight increase in 
employment 
growth.
 Data for 2019 are shown separately and are 
based on
 the 
spring 
2019 foreca
st of the European Commission, to 
ensure
 consisten
cy with the 
analysis of
 historical AMECO 
data.
 20  As the purpose of the analysis is to compare employment growth with GDP growth, it does not explicitly 
account for population change over time. If the emplo
yment
-to-population ratio is considered instead, 
employment developments look more pronounced for the current expansion period than for previous 
expansions. In particular, the employment
-to-population ratio (for the 15
-64 age group) reached pre
-crisis 
leve
ls in 2015 and its current level is the highest observed over the time period analysed in this box.

Taking a longer
-term 
perspective, the last three employment expansions (2014
-18, 1995
-2008 and 
1985-91) were characterised by a significantly higher employment growth rate than 
the earlier expansion periods. This implies that the elasticity of employment growth (to 
GDP growth) strengthened during the last three employment expansio
ns and has 
increased steadily over time between the expansion period 1985
-91 and the current 
expansion
 (see 
Chart B).

spring forecast for the EA12 available in the AMECO database.
 The elasticity is 
calculated as the ratio of cumulative employment growth to cumulative GDP growth in each period.
 Additionally, the fall in the unempl
oyment rate during the current expansion 
period has been particularly notable from a historical perspective.
 Over the 
period 2014
-18 the unemployment rate declined by an average of 0.7 percentage 
points per year, which is the fastest rate of decline in any
 five
-year period during the 
sample period (see Chart C). This fast
-paced decline occurs against the backdrop of 
historically high levels for the unemployment rate. Taking a long
-term view, a possible 
structural change in the unemployment rate in the group
 of 12 countries can be 
identified around the mid
-1970s, when the unemployment rate moved to a 
substantially higher level.
22 Indeed, over the past three decades, the annual 
unemployment rate has rarely declined below 8%. If the unemployment rate continues 
to decline at the current rate, it will fall below its pre
-crisis levels by 2020. However, it 
remains to be seen whether the unemployment rate in the euro area could decrease to 
levels closer to those observed before the 1980s.
                                                                     22  Various authors have tried to explain the increase in European unemployment. See, for example, 
Blanchard, O., 
ﬁEuropean unemployment: the evolution of facts and ideas
ﬂ, Economic Policy
, Vol. 21, No 
45, 2006, pp. 5
-59, which
 argues that there are 
several possible
 cause
s of the increase in European 
unemployment in the 1970s. 
The main explanations for
 the initial increase in unemployment in Europe
 are related to the impact o
f adverse and largely common shocks, 
such as the increase in 
oil price
s and 
the slowdown in productivity growth
. Moreover, 
different institutions have led to 
heterogeneous
 outcomes 
across
 countries; and some labour market policy responses were inadequate t
o address the increase in 
unemployment.

 The decline in unemployment and the increase in employment i
n the current 
expansion 
have 
occurred alongside moderat
ing
 labour costs, but that 
moderation has been 
weaker
 than 
that seen 
in the previous expansion.
 Real
 wages increased at an average rate of 0.3% per year over the period 2014
-18, 
which 
is lower than the
 rate of 
0.5% observed during the previous expansion period. 
However, average productivity growth during the current expansion 
has 
been only 
0.7%, while in the previous expansion 
it stood at 1.1%.
23 Thus, real unit labour costs 
have continued to decline, al
though at a lower rate
24 (see 
Chart 
D). Taking a 
longer
-term perspective, the
 decline in average GDP growth, 
together
 with the
 higher 
elasticity of 
employment growth
 to GDP growth
, 
is associated with 
a slowdown in the 
growth rate of labour productivity per 
person employed. 
The productivity slowdown in 
the 12 countries in the sample has been prolonged over the course of the last four 
decades and has been accompanied by decelerating real wage growth. The 
deceleration in real wage growth was particularly marked
 in relation to the slowdown in 
productivity growth during the 1980s, leading to a sharp decline in the labour share 
during that period,
 as real wage
s became less responsive to labour productivity 
developments
.                                                                     23  Real wages are defined as real compensation per employee for the total economy, while labour 
productivity is defined as real gross domestic product per person employed. The conversion from 
nominal to real is condu
cted using the price deflator for GDP at market prices.
 24  The growth rate of real unit labour costs can be calculated as the difference between the growth rate of 
real wages and the growth rate of labour productivity. As such, real unit labour costs decli
ned on average 
by 0.6% per year during the 1995
-2008 employment expansion and are declining on average by 0.4% 
per year during the current employment expansion.

 Overall
, this long
-term analysis helps 
to 
put the recent recovery into 
perspective, in 
the context
 of past employment expansions and contractions.
 The reaction of employment to GDP growth has increased since 
the 
mid
-1980s, with 
the current expansion being more empl
oyment
-rich than past expansions
. However, 
the elasticity of employment to GDP has
 historically 
been higher (in absolute 
terms
) during employment contractions
 than during expansions
, revealing some asymmetry 
in the 
way employment 
adjust
s during upturns and
 downturns.
 The relationship 
between employment growth and GDP growth might have been affected by many 
factors, 
including structural reforms aim
ed at increas
ing
 flexibility in labour and 
product markets
, or long
-term shifts in the sectoral composition of e
mployment and 
the increase in employment in the services sector. 
All in all, the observed changes in 
the long
-term relationship between employment and GDP on the one hand and 
between real compensation per employee and productivity on the other could also 
reflect other factors such as a favourable shift in the schedule of labour supply, as well 
as unfavourable total factor productivity and/or capital productivity developments 
favouring a strengthening of the demand for labour relative to the demand for capit
al.

 Household income risk over the business cycle
  58 5 Household income risk over the business cycle
 Prepared by Maarten Dossche and 
Jacob Hartwig
 Household income and wealth inequality have become more important in 
explaining the macroeconomy
. Since the financial crisis, there has been increased 
awareness that heterogeneity across households and firms is key to understanding 
business cycle fluctuations (e.g. via balance sheets, credit constraints).
25 At the same 
time, public interest in the distributional aspects of economic policies has continued 
to 
grow. In addition, the increased availability of microdata makes it possible to document 
relevant microeconomic stylised facts. In this vein, this box sheds light on the 
relationship between business cycle fluctuations and income changes at the level of
 individual workers in the euro area.
 Evidence suggests that household income risk varies over the business cycle 
and affects workers unequally.
 Individual earnings risk may be considered the most 
direct type of household income risk, before any insurance 
from social transfers or 
intra
-household resource pooling. Based on this, Guvenen et al. document the 
variation in individual earnings risk using a
 large 
administrative micro 
dataset
 for the 
United States
.26 They
 find that 
the skewness
 of 
income changes 
is strongly 
procyclical
: large upward earnings movements 
are
 less likely
 during recessions
, 
whereas large drops in
 earnings 
are
 more likely. 
In addition, they find that a
ggregate 
shocks 
do not affect 
workers with different characteristics
 in the same way: the
 income 
of some workers (e.g. young, lower
-wage earners) is systematically more sensitive to 
the business cycle than that of others. This is 
quite different 
from 
purely 
random 
income 
shocks that 
are mostly used when modelling
 household
 income risk
. Househo
ld income risk is important for the propagation of macroeconomic 
shocks and the transmission of economic policies.
 Several authors find that the
 dynamics of 
household income 
risk give rise to a cyclical precautionary savings motive 
that substantially raise
s the 
sensitivity of
 consumption
 to fluctuations in aggregate 
income
.27 Evidence also shows that the marginal propensity to consume out of 
disposable income (MPC) is greater in households with higher income risk, which 
makes aggregate consumption even more 
sensitive to the business cycle.
28 To the 
extent that incomes of households with a high MPC

across countries.
 Chart A shows th
e variation in the proportion of workers 
experiencing a fall in labour income compared to the previous year (i.e. realised 
income risk).
31 As the number of workers becoming unemployed increases during 
recessions, the proportion of workers seeing a fall in i
ncome rises during recessions 
and vice versa. This is clearly visible in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, but 
even more so in Spain in 2011 and 2012 during the sovereign debt crisis. In Spain, the 
higher variability of unemployment is also reflec
ted in a higher variability of the share 
of workers experiencing a decline in labour income. This is much less common in 
Germany, France and Italy, where labour markets are known to be less fluid.
                                                                     31  The percentage share of individuals experiencing 
a decline in wage income
 captures a range of different 
phenomena: periods
 of unemployment, wage cuts and labour supply adjustments on both the intensive 
and the extensive margin. This indicator can therefore not be interpreted as a measure of wage rigidity.

ct on lifetime 
incomes.
 Chart B shows how following a large drop in an individual™s labour income, 
income also tends to be significantly lower during the two following years. This 
suggests that realised downward income risk is persistent, implying that job
 losses 
may significantly affect individual lifetime labour income, and thus also consumer 
spending.
32 In addition, the persistence also seems to depend on the state of the 
business cycle: drops in income since 2013, the start of the current economic 
expans
ion, seem to be less persistent than those seen at the start of the financial 
crisis. While there are significant differences from country to country in the variation of 
the proportion of workers seeing a drop in labour income, the degree of persistence 
seems quite comparable.

that the case for using macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilising the business cycle

 Household income risk over the business cycl
e  64 assessing
 how harmful economic downturns are.
36 In this context, Chart D shows the 
distribution of real labour income across age groups in 2008 and 2016. It 
suggests 
that, since the financial crisis, the incomes of younger workers have not increased to 
the same extent as those of older workers. In Germany and Spain, the income of 
younger workers in real terms was even lower in 2016 than in 2008. Taking into 
account heterogeneity across individuals, the welfare costs of business cycles are 
therefore likely to be quite substantial in the euro area.
 Household income risk behaves in a similar way in the euro area as in other 
economies, an insight which is useful fo
r assessing the current economic 
outlook
. All in all, the analysis suggests that, as in the United States, (i) individual 
earnings risk is strongly connected to the performance of the labour market, and (ii) in 
a downturn it increases much more for some gr
oups of workers than for others. This is 
important for understanding how
 economic policy is transmitted 
and macroeconomic 
shocks
 are amplified.
 In the wake of the significant external shock that recently hit the 
euro area economy, the ongoing resilience in
 the labour market (cf. Section 3) may 
help to explain why household income risk has so far not amplified the 
macroeconomic impact of this shock.

 How do profits shape domestic price pressures in the euro area?
  65 6 How do profits shape domestic price pressures in the euro 
area?
 Prepared by 
Elke Hahn
 Profits can account fo
r a significant part of domestic price formation and
 affect 
the pass
-through of changes in costs to final prices
. National accounts contain a 
broad measure of profits, gross operating surplus, which can tell us more about the 
role of profits for domestic p
rice pressures, as measured in the GDP deflator. 
Chart 
A depicts this role in terms of 
movements in unit profits
, thus 
gross operating surplus 
divided by 
real 
GDP
, the measure of profit margins used in this box. Unit profits 
accounted for roughly one
-third
 of the increase in the euro area GDP deflator over the 
past two decades. 
This 
box
 illustrates how profits have recently shaped domestic price 
pressures in the euro area. It explains which factors are the main drivers of the 
movements in profit margins and
 discusses how they have likely contributed to their 
recent developments.

 (annual percentage changes, 
p.p. contributions to annual percentage changes, quarterly data

 Notes: 
The combined contributions from compensation per employee and labour productivity provide the contribution from unit labour 
costs. The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2019.
 The contributions from unit profits to domestic cost pressures de
creased in 
2018 and slightly strengthened but remained low during the first half of 2019.
 Unit
 profit growth weakened noticeably in the course of 2018
, that is to say,
 over the 
period whe
n wage
 growth (measured in terms of compensation per employee)
 and unit labour cost 
growth picked up strongly
, thereby restraining the pace of increase in 
the growth rate of the GDP deflator (see Chart A). In the first half of 2019, unit profit 
growth turned slightly positive and supported the gradual further increase in th
e growth rate of the GDP deflator. At the aggregate level, t
here are two main driving 
factors 
that typically account for the movements in the unit profit contribution, the 
economic cycle and the terms of trade.

 How do profits shape domestic price pr
essures in the euro area?
  66 Profit margins are empirically found to procy
clical
ly move alongside
 developments in economic 
activity (see Chart B).
 In a downturn, unit labour costs 
typically rise since contractually fixed wages respond only with some delay to the 
downturn, while labour productivity drops immediately given the fas
ter downward 
reaction of output than employment. As the weaker economic environment limits the 
scope for offsetting price increases, there is a squeeze in profit margins in a downturn 
and vice versa in an upswing. Profit margins, hence, show a strong posit
ive response 
to real GDP and labour productivity developments as broad cyclical indicators. Chart B 
illustrates that this comovement also pertained in 2018 when growth in unit profits 
weakened in tandem with the slowdown in real GDP and labour productivity
 growth. In 
the first half of 2019, the deteriorations in all three indicators came to a halt, while unit 
profit growth had already started to strengthen gradually, reflecting the impact of other 
factors than the cycle.

 B Unit profits, GDP and labour
 productivity
 (annual percentage changes, quarterly data)
  Sources: Eurostat

 Note: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2019.
 Profit margins are sometimes 
also 
closely
 related
 to developments in 
the terms 
of 
trade
, in particular if these are subject to strong changes 
(see Chart C).
 Such 
changes can be traced back to different sources. 
Improvements in the terms of trade
 related to a drop in the prices of imported inputs 
such as
 oil can have a positive impact 
on profit margins
, if firms adjust their selling prices downwards by less than the fall in 
their input costs. This appears to have been the case in 
the period from mid
-2014 to 
early 2016. Changes in export prices, 
related to
 a depreciation 
in the 
euro 
exchange 
rate
, can 
benefit 
profit margins if exporters price their products to the market and keep 
their 
export 
prices in foreign currency unchanged. 
Furthermore, terms of trade 
developments can also be influenced by development
s in relative prices between the 
domestic and foreign economy if these are also reflected in the dynamics of export 
and import prices. In this respect, stronger relative price developments in the domestic 
economy than those of the foreign economy could ent
ail improvements in the terms of 
trade with positive repercussions for profit margins. In 2018, the terms of trade appear 
to have weighed on profit margins and this was mainly due to the increase in oil prices. 
Oil prices, however, have come down since the
 end of 2018 leading to improvements

  Sources: Eurostat

 Note: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2019.
 The sector composition of developments in unit profits confirms that the 
weakening 
in unit profits in 2018 
occurred mainly in cyclically
-sensitive 
sectors
, while the gradual strengthening in unit profits in the first half of 2019 
reflected developments in 
less cyclically
-sensitive 
sectors (see Chart D).
 A procyclical impact on unit profits is visible, in particular, for the industrial sector 
(excluding construction), which is heavily exposed to developments in trade and has 
thus suffered the most from the d
eterioration in the global environment and the euro 
area business cycle since end
-2017. The deterioration in the terms of trade associated 
with the rebound in oil prices in the course of 2018 is likely to have contributed to the 
moderation in profit margin
s in 2018 particularly in sectors such as transportation (part 
of the services sector), and the ensuing decline in oil prices may have likewise 
supported their rebound. At the same time, developments in profit margins in more 
domestically
-oriented sectors 
such as the construction sector have been holding up 
better over the entire period, which owes also to the currently very favourable 
financing conditions.
                                                                     37  A further factor that contributed to the increase in unit profit growth in the first half of 2019 is the 
implementation of a fiscal measure in France
 in 2019. This fiscal 
measure entails 
the conversion of a tax 
credit (the CICE) into a permanent cut to employers™ social security cont
ributions
, thereby implying a 
decrease in compensation per employee growth but a corresponding increase in unit profit growth.

 Notes: In the decomposition of unit profit growth by economic sectors unit profits are calculated based on value added. The l

observations a
re for the second quarter of 2019.
 To conclude, aggregate profit margins weakened in the course of 2018 and 
dampened the increase in domestic price pressures in the euro area for that 
year, but started to increase gradually in the first half of 2019.
 The decline in profit 
margins in 2018 was a reaction to the 
recent slowdown 
in economic activity and the oil 
price
-related deterioration in the terms of trade in that year.
38 The adjustment implied

 1 Derivatives transactions data and their use in central bank 
analysis
 Prepared by Lena Boneva, Benj
amin Böninghausen, Linda Fache 
Rousová and Elisa Letizia
 Data on d
erivatives transactions have recently become available at a number of 
central banks, including the ECB, and have opened up new avenues for analysis. 
Collected as a result of reforms of the
 over
-the
-counter 
(OTC) 
derivatives market
, which
 were primarily designed 
to counter
 systemic risk
, the data ha
ve numerous 
applications beyond the 
domain of 
financial stability.
 This article presents two such applications. 
It demonstrates how data gathered u
nder 
the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) can be used to 
better
 understand two types of derivatives market that are of particular importance for central 
bank analysis, namely the interest rate derivatives and inflation
-linked swap markets.
 For the interest rate derivatives market, the article shows how investor expectations 
for
 interest rates may be inferred 
through
 ﬁpositioning indicators
ﬂ that track how a 
set
 of 
ﬁinformed investors
ﬂ take positions in the market in anticipation of future in
terest rate 
movements. Such 
quantity
-based
 indicators can complement other, more established 
indicators of interest rate expectations, such as forward rates or survey
-based 
measures.
 For euro area inflation
-linked swap markets, the article exploits the fac
t that EMIR data 
allow a first systematic look at trading activity in these markets, which can provide 
valuable and timely information on 
investors™
 inflation 
expectations
. 
It highlights a
 number of structural features 
of activity in these markets and disc
usses
 their possible 
implications for the monitoring of market
-based measures of inflation compensation.
 1 Introduction
 Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and near
-failure of AIG in 2008
, OTC 
derivatives have been recognised as one of the amplifiers of 
the global financial 
crisis.
 In response, G20 leaders pledged at the Pittsburgh summit in September 2009 
to reform OTC derivatives markets to improve their transparency, prevent market 
abuse and reduce systemic risks. In Europe, this initiative was formali
sed in 2012 in 
the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). EMIR imposes several 
requirements on entities that enter into a derivative
s contract
, such as the 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Articles
 Derivatives transactions data and their use in central bank analysis
  70 implementation of risk management standards, clearing of certain contracts through 
central counterparties (CCPs) and reporting obligations.
39  While 
the 
OTC derivative reforms were primarily designed with the aim of 
reducing systemic risk, data from EMIR have applications in central bank 
analysis beyond the financial stability domain.
40 Following a brief introduction to 
the EMIR data (see Section 2), this article presents two examples of such use
s. First, 
it shows how EMIR data on interest rate derivatives can be used to gauge 
the 
expectations of investors regarding the future evolution of 
key interest rates (see 
Section 3). 
This is based on the premise
 that investors expect
ing
 lower interest rates 
in the future
 position themselves by buying more contracts (
than
 they sell) that benefit 
from
 lower interest rates. ﬁ
Positioning indicatorsﬂ 
calc
ulated on this basis can thus be 
seen as capturing the strength of informed investors™ expectations and 
have the 
potential to complement other indicators of interest rate expectations such as forward 
rates or survey
-based measures. Second, the article look
s at structural activity 
patterns in euro area inflation
-linked swap markets (see Section 4). It provides an 
overview of the most relevant contracts and the counterparties that trade in those 
markets, and draws some 
conclusions
 for the ECB™s monitoring of 
market
-based 
measures of inflation compensation
, in particular regarding the information content at 
various maturities
. 
Both applications demonstrate the 
wide 
potential 
for
 the use of 
EMIR data in central bank analysis.
 2 The EMIR data
 In February 2014 
EMI
R introduce
d mandatory reporting of all
 individual
 derivative
s contracts.
 This reporting obligation applies to both OTC and 
exchange
-traded derivatives in all five main asset classes, i.e. commodity, equity, 
foreign exchange, credit and interest rate deriv
atives. Trades cleared via CCPs are 
also included. 
The reporting covers 
information on 
both 
the counterparties involved 
and the characteristics of the contract,
 which may
 change over the life cycle of a 
derivative trade
 and are submitted daily.
41 All EU
-loc
ated entities that enter a derivatives contract
 are subject to the 
reporting obligation.
 They 
must 
report to 
one of the
 seven trade repositories 
                                                                    39  For a comprehensive overview of the elements of the OTC derivative reforms, see the article entitled

 Daily 
transaction
-by-transaction 
derivatives data 
are then made available 
to over 
100 authorities in the EU, 
depending on
 their mandate 
and jurisdiction. For example, the 
ECB obtains a subset of the data reported by 
euro area 
counterparties.
42 One 
important implication of this is that tran
sactions between two counterparties domiciled 
outside the euro area (e.g. between two UK banks or between UK and US banks) are 
typically not available to the ECB.
 Owing to 
their
 volume, velocity and variety, the EMIR 
data can be classified as 
ﬁbig data
ﬂ, which poses many challenges for using 
them
. In cooperation with 
the 
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the ECB
 has developed an EMIR
-dedicated 
IT infrastructure
 to store and access the data received from all trade repositories
. 
Despite the significant i
mprovement 
in data quality 
since the launch of EMIR reporting 
in 2014,
 a careful data cleaning procedure has to be applied before the data can be 
used for policy analysis
; for example, 
observations 
are deleted when 
both the market 
and notional values are 
missing
 or whe
n the notional value is considered an outlier.
43 This article focuses on data between 2 May 2018 and 12 June 2019, as the cleaned 
data 
Œ even as a time
-series 
Œ are of sufficiently good quality and easily accessible 
through the EMIR IT infrastr
ucture.
 3 Inferring market expectations for future interest rates from 
EMIR data
 The interest rate derivatives market allows market participants to trade financial 
products linked to future interest rates.
 The market value of these contracts 
changes as int
erest rates move
, and investors can use them to hedge against 
movements in interest rates or for speculative purposes. By analysing the positioning 
of participants in the market, some inference can be made about their views 
on the 
outlook for
 interest rates.
 The m
arket positioning indicators 
based on EMIR data help
 to inform 
central 
bank analysis
. Information on the 
positioning
 of certain groups of investors 
in interest 
rate derivatives can complement price
-based indicators
 and surveys, which 
are both 
commonly used 
to infer financial market expect
ations
 for monetary policy or the 
macroeconomic outlook
.44  Positioning indicators rely on three main building blocks
: (i) the assessment of 
an investor™s ﬁnet longﬂ (or ﬁnet shortﬂ) position in a certa
in contract, (ii) the 
identification of a specific set of ﬁinformed investorsﬂ, and (iii) the choice of appropriate 
interest rate derivative contracts.
                                                                     42  In fact,
 the ECB™s access is somewhat wider than this. See Article 2 of ﬁ
Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) No 151/2013
ﬂ.
 43  This is when the value exceeds a fixed thre
shold. The thresholds differ across asset classes and have 
been set on the basis of ECB market intelligence activity.
 44  Price
-based indicators include, in particular, those calculated on the basis of forward contracts on key 
euro area interest rates such 
as EONIA and EURIBOR, either for a given forward horizon (e.g. a one
-year 
rate, one year ahead) or for reserve maintenance periods that are tied to specific ECB Governing Council 
meetings. Surveys considered by the ECB include those from private providers 
commonly referenced in 
the marketplace as well as the ECB™s own, recently introduced 
Survey of Monetary Analysts

 Derivatives transactions data and their use in central bank analysis
  72 An investor™s net long (or net short) position captures how and to what extent 
they may profit from futu
re interest rate movements.
 In the case of a fixed
-income 
futures contract 
Œ say, a bond futures contract 
Œ a buyer, or an investor holding a long 
position, gains from a decline in interest rates owing to the inverse relationship 
between interest rates and
 the value of the underlying bond. The opposite is true for a 
seller, or the investor who holds a short position. Where an investor simultaneously 
holds long and short positions, exposure to future interest rate movements is 
determined by netting all posit
ions. As a result, investors with a ﬁdovishﬂ interest rate 
outlook (i.e., expecting interest rate declines) are likely to be positioned net long, while 
those with a ﬁhawkishﬂ view would position themselves net short.
 Any meaningful positioning indicator ne
eds to single out a particular subset of 
investors since the market 
overall
 is positioned 
neither 
net long nor net short.
 This follows from the fact that, if one investor takes a long position, another investor 
has to take an equivalent short position in t
he same derivative. As a consequence, the 
net long (and net short) position of all investors combined must be equal to zero, 
barring reporting errors and/or sample limitations. An informative position
ing
 indicator 
therefore has to focus on a particular, me
aningful set of investors.
45 The positioning indicator constructed here aims 
to singl
e out ﬁinformed 
investorsﬂ who actively take positions in interest rate derivatives 
on the 
bas
is
 of their expectations 
for
 future interest rates.
 Their identification is ch
allenging
, 
however
. Box 1 explains how EMIR data are enriched to obtain a detailed sector 
classification which facilitates this task. But even a granular sector classification 
cannot fully capture the heterogeneity 
of individual investors™ trading strategi
es in 
interest rate derivatives.
46 To address these challenges, ﬁinformed sectorsﬂ are 
chosen according to the following criteria: (i) they form a view on future interest rates 
on the basis of 
monetary policy and macroeconomic developments, (ii) they react 
quickly
 to a change in the outlook, (iii) they trade
 actively
 in derivatives 
contracts,
 primarily to 
generate a 
profit from 
them
, and (iv) they 
pursue
 a strategy that is neither 
very
 short
-term (e.g. arbitrageurs trading to exploit intraday volatility) nor 
very
 long
-term (e.g. insurance companies or banks hedging their balance sheet duration 
gaps). 
The sector referred to as 
ﬁhedge funds
ﬂ can
 satisfy all these criteria
, in 
particular a
s it is normally identified as comprising entities which take positions on the 
basis of their expectations for the future evolution of financial market prices in a 
relatively unconstrained way
. However, there are many 
difficulties
 in correctly 
identifying 
such
 funds
47 and there 
may
 be other classes of investors acting in a similar 
manner.
 Therefore, w
e report a range of positioning indicators based on different 
investor categories (Table 1).
 The first sample follows the definition of hedge funds 
                                                                    45  The frequently cited (disaggregated) Commitment
s of Trad
ers report published by the 
US 
Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission 
provides such subsets. Some market observers use it to follow the 
evolution of the long and short positions of commercial and non
-commercial counterparties in futures 
contracts on, for 
ins
tance, currencies and commodities.
 46  Other approaches, complementary to the one employed here, can be more data
-driven, e.g. focusing on 
investors that 
change their position often 
or
 whose activity in the market is particularly intense
. Such 
approaches 
will be explored in further extension of this work.
 47  The main difficulty is limited data coverage and disclosure, as many hedge funds are domiciled in 
off
-shore centres.

, as well as UCITS

 (see Box 1)
. 
The second 
sample is broader as it includes all investment funds. One rationale for broadening the 
category is that 
an asset manager would have only one view 
on the short
-term interest 
rate outlook, 
but would typically control several funds, some of them falling into the 
category of hedge funds and others not.
 The third sample also includes 
other 
financial 
institutions 
Œ which are not
 banks, insurance companies or pension funds
 Œ to control 
for misclassification and to capture other types of active investor
 such as systematic 
trading firms
. Finally, to capture only large and active
50 investors, all previous samples 
are restr
icted to 
the 
counterparties that hold the largest 100 portfolios in terms of gross 
notional 
amount 
on average 
over
 time.

-6 is not always

the largest portfolios are not active over the full period.
 Finally, a class of interest rate derivatives needs to be 
chosen.
 A basic choice 
is 
between
 derivatives with linear payoffs (e.g., swaps, forwards or futures) and 
derivatives with non
-linear payoffs (most notably options). Since 
the
 positioning 
indicator
s are intended to
 capture exposure to general interest rate movements
 rather 
than unusual developments
, this suggests a preference for derivatives with linear 
payoffs. In addition, the market segment has to be sufficiently liquid
, which is not 
always the case for options m
arkets
. The full interest rate derivatives market
 in the euro area is very large in terms of 
both volume
 and the number of instruments it contains (Chart 1).
 As of June 
2019 the total outstanding notional amount in interest rate derivatives was around 
                                                                    48  The 
Manual on investment fund statistics
 defines 
hedge 
funds as funds ﬁwhich apply relatively 
unconstrained investment strategies to achieve positive absolute returns, and whose managers, in 
addition to management fees, are 
remunerated in relation to the fund™s performanceﬂ
, but it is 
acknowledged that 
a generally accepted definitio
n of hedge funds does not exist.
 49  The classification of funds into UCITS and non
-UCITS depends on whether they fall under the 
EU 
Directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)
. UCITS funds are 
mutual funds which can be sold to retail investors and are perceived as non
-speculative, diversifi
ed and 
well
-regulated investments
. 50  Classifying funds on 
the basis of 
their description 
as active 
or passive 
shows
 that 
the
 sample is not 
dominated by passive funds

  74 •200 trillion, which accounted for two
-thirds of the total euro area derivatives market.
51 Interest rate s
waps and futures are key instruments in 
the interest rate derivatives
 market. Swaps are the most prominent contracts, covering about 54% of the notional 
value of outstanding contracts. Swaps 
(including those based on EONIA) 
are traded 
ﬁover
 the
 counter
ﬂ and are used for a wide range of purposes, including the hedging of 
interest rate risks on banks and insurers™ balance sheets (e.g. risks arising from 
positi
ve and negative duration gaps respectively). 
The futures market is smaller 
than 
the swaps market, 
but 
is exchange
-traded and hence much more standardised and 
extremely liquid. Among futures, three
-month EURIBOR futures have the largest 
notional 
amount 
outs
tanding (around •7 trillion out of •15 trillion in June 2019), 
followed by 
eurodollar
 and Bund futures.

 The notional amounts reported should be interpreted as an upper bound because transactions could be counted 
more th
an once as a result of transactions that could not be paired. In addition, if a clearing member clears a trade on behalf of a
 client, 
two transactions (a transaction between the client and the clearing member and a transaction between the clearing member a
nd the 
CCP) are counted.
 The positioning indicator
s are
 based on 
EURIBOR
 futures contracts, owing to 
their significant information content 
as regards
 euro area interest rate 
developments.
 As suggested by
 market intelligence, informed investors make 
extensi
ve use of 
EURIBOR
 futures
, primarily on account of their substantial liquidity 
and high degree of standardisation. Investors that need to adjust their positions may 
often prefer futures contracts 
to
 interest rate swaps, since it is eas
ier
 to close out 
existing positions. Moreover, futures on the three

 are attractive

 their
 direct 
link to euro area 
short
-term 
interest rate developments
 at 
specific horizons
. The basis risk of tracking EONIA through a 
EURIBOR
 futures 
contract is fairly limited at present given the stable spreads between the two.
 The focus 
of the positioning indicators 
is on 
EURIBOR
 futures with a residua
l maturity of 
above one year
 to facilitate comparison with gauges of interest rate expectations 
commo
nly used by
 central bank
s, for instance the 
one-year 
EON
IA, one year ahead.
52 The 
positioning measure is the ratio of 
informed investors™ net long 
positions to 
their 
gross positions.
53 The net long position (long minus short)
 of each investor
 is 
normalised b
y their gross position (long plus short). This measure has at least two 
advantages. First, because the measure is normalised by the gross position, it allows 
the views expressed by all informed investors
 to be considered
, including smaller 
investors that m
ay have strong views but are unable to take sizeable absolute 
positions. 
A simple sum of net long positions across all informed investors without any 
normalisation would give significant weight to very large investors and idiosyncrasies 
of individual playe
rs. Second, the sum across all informed investors and the 
normalisation also make the indicator more robust against misreporting.
 The 
measure reveals
 that
 the positioning of 
investment funds is 
relatively
 polarised
, suggesting that a focus on this investor
 category is indeed 
warranted since investment funds appear more inclined to express a view on 
future interest rates than other types of investor.
 Using all investment funds 
(positioning measure 2) as the category representative of informed investors, Char
t 2 
shows that around 60% of these investors take an either extreme hawkish or extreme 
dovish view, with the extreme dovish view clearly predominating on the date in 
question (12 June 2019). This pattern is different from that for dealer banks, for 
example
, which
 tend to be positioned in a more neutral way
, as they typically act as 
market makers. This does not imply that dealer banks do not have views 
on monetary 
policy or the macroeconomic outlook, but their dealing activity generally 
outweighs
 the 
proprie
tary risk
-taking motive.
 Since dealing activity also implies that many of their 
positions offset each other, their portfolios tend to be large in terms of gross notional 
amount (as indicated by the size of the bubbles) but less so in terms of the net notio
nal 
amount.
                                                                     52  In addition, for maturities of over one year 
the mechanical roll
-over effect in the nearest
-dated futures
 is 
removed
. 53  Positioning at the sector level is computed as the
 average of individual positions.

how interest rate expectations have evolved over the period under consider
ation. 
It
 shows a downward trend starting in late 2018 as investors started pricing in a more 
accommodative monetary policy and became less sanguine about the global 
economic outlook. Consistent with these developments, informed investors have 
increased th
eir net long positions 
over the same period. The results shown here thus 
suggest that the positioning indicators 
Œ as a quantity, or volume
-based, proxy for 
expectations about monetary policy and the general economic outlook 
Œ can provide 
signals comparabl
e to price, or rate
-based, proxies. Further data analysis may also 
help identify sectors whose positioning, on average, appears to be the most indicative 
of the market™s price formation mechanism. Ideally, such analysis would also shed 
new light on the inf
ormation embedded in forward interest rates, in particular in 
situations where the signals from the positioning and price
-based indicators are not 
entirely consistent.

 Box 1
 Identifying counterpart
y sector in EMIR data
 Prepared by Francesca D. Lenoci and Elisa Let
izia
 A prerequisite for the definition of 
ﬁinformed
 investors
ﬂ is comprehensive and detailed 
information on sector classification
. This
 box explains how EMIR data are enriched to obtain
 such 
a classification.
 While EMIR data contain a field with 
information on the sector of a reporting counterparty, 
this information suffers from some limitations.
 The first relates to data quality: 
the sector reported 
by 
some counterparties varies over time
, and in some cases
 the sector is missing. The second 
limit
ation is conceptual: the EMIR sector classification is not sufficiently detailed for many central 
bank purposes and does not single out entities with key roles in the derivative
s market. In particular, 
CCPs, 
their 
clearing members and banks 
which are subsi
diaries of the
 16 largest 
dealers
 (G16)
 are 
not directly identifiable.
54 Furthermore, the EMIR sector breakdown
55 does not always overlap with 
the widely used ESA 2010 classification.
56                                                                     54  The G16 are: 
Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Crédit Agricole, Credit Suisse, 
Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Royal Bank of 
Scotland, Société
 Générale, UBS 
and Wells Fargo.
 55  The EMIR sector classification distinguishes eight types of financial entity: 
alternative investment funds, 
assurance undertakings, credit institutions, insurance undertakings, investment firms, institution
s for 
occupational retirement 
provision, reinsurance undertakings, 
undertaking
s for 
collective 
investment in 
transferable

 (UCITS) and their management companies, 
and a residual category.

ions, general government, households, non

 Derivatives transactions data and their use in central bank analysis
  78 To overcome these limitations, EMIR data are enriched with eight data sou
rces to obtain a 
sector classification.
 The classification is performed using one source at a time, thereby 
establishing a hierarchy among sources. In the first step, counterparties are classified using four 
official lists: the ECB™s lists of monetary fina
ncial institutions and investment funds, 
the
 list of 
insurance undertakings
 compiled by the European Insurance and Occupational Authority (EIOPA)
 and ESMA™s list of CCPs
. As these lists cover only a limited set of entities located in the EU/euro area
, four
 more data sources are used in the second step: the 
European System of Central Bank
s™ Register 
of Institutions and Affiliates Data (RIAD) and three commercial data sources (BankFocus, Lipper and 
Orbis). As a last source in the hierarchy, the sector 
given
 in the 
EMIR data is used, but 
only if reported 
consistently.
 The 
resulting sector 
classification
 has a good coverage, is detailed and shows whether an 
entity plays a key role in the derivatives market.
 As of 
mid
-2019, the counterparty sector 
has been
 identi
fied for more than 98% of the notional value of outstanding trades in EMIR data (Chart A).
57 Granular information on subsectors is often also available. For instance, banks are further split into 
investment and commercial banks
, and investment funds into UCITS and 
alternative 
investment 
funds. Information on investment funds™ strategy (e.g. bond, equity, hedge fund) is also at hand. 
Moreover, entities with key roles in the derivatives market
, such as clearing members and banks 
belonging to the G16 dealers
, 
are flagged as such.
                                                                     57  For the remaining 2%, the domicile of the counterparty is either not available or outside Europe.

 Derivatives transactions data and their use in central bank analysis
  80 which contain important information on the inflation expectations of investors.
 Inflation expectations play a central role for the ECB, since its primary objective i
s to 
maintain price stability in the euro area. In the conduct of monetary policy, 
such 
expectations 
are relevant in their own right
, since 
they influence economic decisions in 
areas such as consumption and investment, as well as wage and price setting, an
d thus inflation. Moreover, they serve as a cross
-check on the inflation outlook in the 
Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections
, which
 in turn inform the ECB™s 
monetary policy decisions. In addition to survey
-based measures, which capture 
inflation 
expectations as expressed directly in regular expert surveys, 
there are 
market
-based measures of inflation compensation
, reflect
ing
 the information derivable 
from the prices of financial instruments. These include inflation
-linked swaps, 
inflation
-linked b
onds 
and inflation options, 
all of 
which are linked to future inflation 
outcomes. Since these financial instruments are traded continuously, market
-based 
measures not only provide additional valuable information on the inflation 
expectations of investors, 
but can also give more timely indications of potential shifts 
in the inflation outlook.
58 EMIR data allow a first quantitative look at the structure of the euro area 
inflation
-linked swap (ILS) market.
 To date
 the ECB 
has 
relied heavily on market 
intelligen
ce regarding the activity underlying developments in, for instance,
 ILS
 rates. 
Such market intelligence 
Œ while useful 
Œ is generally qualitative in nature, and 
challenging to 
gather in 
a consistent fashion across counterparties in practice. The 
EMIR data 
complement this type of information and 
allow 
it to be
 cross
-check
ed by 
offering a quantitative, more systematic look at trading activity in euro area 
ILS
 markets. This section uses the EMIR data to 
demonstrate
 some structural features of 
the
se markets.
59 The data suggest that activity in the 
euro area 
ILS market is dominated by 
swaps linked to aggregate euro area inflation 
rather than
 national consumer 
price indices.
 Chart 4
 shows that, on average, 
swaps linked to the euro area 
Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices excluding tobacco (HICPxT) account for more 
than 80% of both the number of transactions and the notional 
amount 
involved. 
The remaining euro area ILS market is almost exclusively linked to the French 
consumer 
price index (
CPI
). Activity in swaps linked to other 
countries
™ CPIs is very limited, 
even
 Italian CPI
-linked swaps
, despite the 
existence
 of a sizeable Italian CPI
-linked bond 
market.
60 Since the monitoring of investors™ inflation expectations relies on market 
quotes (as ILSs
 are traded ﬁover the counterﬂ), it appears reasonable to assign a 
higher information content to th
ose ILSs 
for which 
quotes are more firmly supported by 
                                                                    58  For more information s

 59  The portion of euro area ILS markets covered by the 
data 
available at the ECB has an outstanding 
notional amount of close to •1 trillion. However, since these data represent a subset of the market (see 
Section 2), the actual size of the market is larger, an
d potentially significantly so. In any case, the subset 
reveals that, in the euro area, the ILS market is substantially smaller than the interest rate derivatives 
market. For instance, the outstanding notional amount of EURIBOR futures contracts is roughly
 ten times 
as high as that of euro area HICP
-linked swaps.
 60  Inflation
-linked bonds are also primarily indexed to the aggregate euro area HICPxT, but both France and 
Italy have substantial 
Œ and comparable 
Œ amounts of bonds outstanding that are linked to
 their 
respective national CPIs.

61 On that basis and in light of the above observations, monitoring 
aggregate euro 
area inflation expectations in ILS markets seems most reliable. 
However, this does not preclude the monitoring of individual 
countries

rates to detect expectations of possible deviations from the aggregate at the national

 Data are as at mid

50% of all activity in

he fact that 
almost 
a quarter of 
activity is clustered at the 
ten
-year spot point, 
with the second
-largest share at
 the 
five

forward
 ILS 
rates, the five
-year
 rate five years ahead
 Œ which commands considerable attention in 
the marketplace 
Œ is also the 
rate
 most supported by underlying activity. Moreover, 
rather than declining

activity is 
still notable 
at a number of 
longer

spot 
curve, for example at the 15, 20, and 30

maturities. In the context of central bank analysis, this is reassuring since longer

ILS rates are less affected by short
-term transitory shocks and may thus provide a 
cleaner guide to investors™ ﬁsteady sta
teﬂ inflation expectations.
                                                                     61  Note 
that these quotes are ﬁcreatedﬂ in large data warehouses of global banks and probably also include

nderlying 
activity is 
useful 
in judging the information content of 
quotes in OTC

. This is because, while 
the 
actual price (or rate) at which two counterparties transact remains confidential
, a sizeable amount of 
activity 
in 
these 
markets is intermediated by dealers that
 take (at least) one side of the transaction and 
simultaneously provide quotes for the product in question. Hence, published dealer quotes are informed 
by 
Œ and adjusted in response to 
Œ the trades conducted between dealers and other investors. This 
sugges
ts that the more sizeable the underlying activity in an

it is that

The activity shares are based on the average of four measures that

 (ii)
 define maturity either as maturity date minus effective date or as maturity date minus

 There are important differences 
in sectoral activity across maturit
ies
: hedge 
funds are quite active at the very short end of the curve
, while pension funds 
show above
-average activity in the long to ultra
-long segments.
 Chart 6 sorts 
transactions into different maturity buckets instead 
of focusing on individual maturity 
points. It further 
shows
 sector pairs involving banks on at least one side of the 
transaction. This is due to the 
dominant
 role played by banks in the ILS market and 
because 
activity accounted for by other sector pairs is
 negligible. Apart from 
highlighting the dominance of bank
-bank and bank
-investment fund transactions 
across maturity buckets, Chart 6 shows notable activity of hedge funds at short 
maturities. This observation is consistent with market intelligence
, accor
ding to which 
some hedge funds have in recent years stepped up their efforts 
to
 forecast near

inflation and then trad
e on the 
basis of those forecasts in ILS markets. Moreover, the 
fact that pension funds are over

  Sources: EMIR data and ECB calculations.
 Notes: 
Sectors are identified using the classification reported in the EMIR database, enriched by a more granular classification and
 following a thorough data qu
ality check. For example, inflation funds are identified as investment funds whose names and descriptions 
suggest a strong focus on inflation
-adjusted or real returns. S
hares are based on the average of the share of the number of transactions 
between June 
2016 and January 2018 and the share of the notional amount involved in these transactions. Percentages add up to 100% 
for each maturity bucket across the six sector pairs shown. Data are based on reports from DTCC
, which is 
one of the 
seven
 trade 
repositor
ies 
reporting under EMIR 
currently authorised by 
ESMA
. The results 
show that it is important
 for the ECB
, in assessing investors™ 
inflation expectations,
 to 
consider not only
 overall activity patterns across the 
ILS curve 
but also
 the sectoral composition of activity in different segments of 
the curve.
 More precisely, 
while the article has shown that
 activity in longer
-dated 
euro area ILSs of 15 years and beyond is not negligible compared 
with 
shorter
-dated 
maturities
, 
the sectoral
 analysis 
indicates
 that a relatively 
large
 share of that activity 
stems from pension funds. 
Since the latter often use the ILS market to hedge against
 developments in 
inflation, 
they
 tend to act more as price takers, certainly when 
compared 
with
 hedge fun
ds active at the short end of the ILS curve
, which are
 more 
likely to express particular views on 
future 
inflation. Thus, when price sensitivity
 is also 
factored in
, the information content of longer
-dated ILS rates may be lower than 
suggested by overall a
ctivity in that maturity bucket.
 Overall, EMIR data help uncover a number of interesting structural features of 
euro area ILS markets, suggesting that further EMIR
-based analysis 
can help 
the ECB better assess future developments in these markets.
 The find
ings 
presented in this section are consistent with market intelligence received. This 
supports the notion that the EMIR data can indeed serve as 
a complement 
to 
and cross
-check 
other information 
by offering a quantitative, more systematic view. Natural 
extensions of the more structural analysis presented here are tracking overall activity 
or the activity of different investor groups over time as well as across maturities. 
Moreover, the richness of
 the data extends beyond the information touched upon in 
this article, most notably to the prices at which counterparties transact with each other. 
EMIR data 
are thus
 an important addition to the ECB
™s toolbox for
 analysis of euro 
area ILS markets.

 Derivatives transactio
ns data and their use in central bank analysis
  84 5 Concl
usions
 This article has shown how EMIR data can be used for analys
is beyond the 
domain of 
financial stability.
 This article presents examples based on two classes of 
derivatives market
 that 
are of particular importance for central bank analysis: the 
intere
st rate and inflation
-linked derivatives markets.
 The first example illustrates how EMIR data can help infer investor expectations 
for
 future interest rates.
 The positioning indicators developed track how a 
group
 of 
ﬁinformed investors
ﬂ position themselves
 in the futures market in anticipation of future 
interest rate movements. Such 
quantity
-based
 indicators can act as a complement to 
other, more established indicators of interest rate expectations, such as forward rates 
or survey
-based measures.
 While this
 article provides first insights from such 
quantity
-based indicators, further data analysis may help refine the indicators and also 
shed new light on 
the information embedded in forward interest rates, particular
ly in 
situations where the signals from the 
positioning and price
-based indicators are 
not 
entirely consistent.
 The second example shows how EMIR data allow a first systematic look at 
trading activity in euro area inflation
-linked swap markets.
 This example 
highlights 
a number of structural features
 of these markets, which can provide 
valuable and timely information on the inflation outlook of investors. Overall, the 
results support the notion that EMIR data can complement and 
help to 
cross
-check 
more qualitative market intelligence on activity in th
ese markets. 
For example, the 
data can help assess the information content of inflation
-linked swap rates, both 
across different maturities and on the basis of the relative activity of different types of 
investors. 
The data can thus be seen as an important
 addition to the analytical toolbox 
of the ECB.
 Despite the many challenges in using these 
ﬁbig data
ﬂ, the use of EMIR data at 
the ECB and at central banks more generally is on the rise.
 The increasing scale 
of analysis based on these data underlines the b
enefits for policymakers

 The taxonomy of ECB instruments available for banking supervision
  85 2 The taxonomy of ECB instruments available
 for banking 
supervision
 Prepared by Rinke Bax and Andreas Witte
 1 Introductio
n In November 1999, the ECB Monthly Bulletin featured an article on the 
legal 
instruments of the European Central Bank.
 Since being
 entrusted with 
the task of 
supervis
ing
 credit institutions 
in 2014, the ECB
 has adopted a wide range of further 
legal and non
-legal instruments in the context of prudential supervision. 
These tasks 
have been conferred on the ECB by the SSM Regulation
62 and give the ECB the 
exclusive competence to carry them out with respect to all
 credit institutions. The SSM 
Regulation establishes specific types of legal act which the ECB can adopt for the 
purpose of exercising its tasks under that regulation. The SSM Regulation also 
stipulates that the ECB™s supervisory tasks must be exercised se
parately from those 
relating to monetary policy. This
 article describes the instruments the ECB has 
adopted in its role as banking 
supervisor in recent years.
 Supervising banks involves changes to their legal position, e.g. 
as a result of 
the imposition of
 supervisory measures which 
must
 be complied with as a legal 
obligation, or by granting permission 
for
 a course of action which the bank 
would 
otherwise
 not be allowed to take
. Such changes in legal position can only be 
effected by means of a binding legal
 instrument. For these purposes, primary law 
(primarily
 the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the 
Statue of the 
ESCB
) and secondary law (
primarily
 the SSM Regulation) 
provide
 a broad range of 
instruments (some of which qualify as legal ac
ts) 
for
 the ECB 
to adopt 
as tools to carry 
out its supervisory tasks.
 In many cases, however, it may be useful for the ECB 
Œ or, for that matter, any 
other supervisory authority 
Œ to issue instruments other than binding legal 
acts.
 Such instruments can, fo
r instance, be used to communicate to the public the 
ECB™s position on a question of policy, or to provide guidance on how it intends to use 
its su
pervisory powers in the future.
 There is, th
erefore
, a range of instruments which the ECB may use in the area
 of supervision, reflecting the relatively wide range of supervisory activities it 
undertakes.
 Different kinds of instruments may be useful for different purposes. The 
present article attempts to bring some order to this multitude of different instruments 
and to describe their legal implications. Section
 II
 will discuss legal acts of a binding 
nature
 while
 Section
 III

 legally non
-binding instruments and 
documents, some of which qualify as legal acts in spite of their non
-binding nature.

summarise and 
draw some 
general
 conclusions.
 2 Binding legal acts and other binding instruments
 2.1
 General re
marks
 Article 4(3) of the SSM Regulation lists the 
binding 
legal instruments which are 
available for adoption by the ECB in its supervisory capacity.
 This 
list was not 
created entirely 
by the drafters of the SSM Regulation, but 
rather 
builds on the primary 
law catalogue of legal acts under Union law in Article 34.1 of the 
Statute of the 
ESCB
63, which lists
 regulations, decisions, recommendations and opinions
64. In 
addition, the SSM Regulation mentions several other instruments which are n
ot 
included in the primary law catalogue of legal acts but which can be adopted in a 
binding manner in order to carry out its tasks under the SSM Regulation.
 There are five main tools available to the ECB for this purpose
: regulations, 
decisions, guideline
s, recommendations and instructions to NCAs 
(mentioned 
in Article 9(1)
(3) of the SSM Regulation and Article 22 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation).
 2.2
 ECB Regulations
 ECB Regulations are characterised by two defining features which they share 
with Regulation
s adopted by Parliament and the Council: they 
apply on a
 general 
Œ rather than case
-specific 
Œ basis
 and they are directly applicable in 
the Member States (of the euro area for the ECB regulations).
 In this sense, the 
term ﬁregulationﬂ in Article 4(3) of t
he SSM Regulation is used in the same sense as in 
Articles 288(2) and 132(1), first indent, TFEU and 
Article 
34.1, first indent, of the 
Statute of the 
ESCB.
 They also 
benefit from
 the supremacy of Union law and 
supersede the application of conflicting nati
onal legislation. However, in the 
supervisory field the ECB is not a legislator itself; it is 
Œ as is made explicit in Article 
4(3) of the SSM Regulation 
Œ bound by the ﬁsingle rulebookﬂ 
This 
consist
s of the ﬁlevel 
1ﬂ texts adopted by Parliament and 
the 
Council, most importantly CRD IV (Directive 
2013/36/EU), the BRRD (Directive 2014/59/EU), the CRR (Regulation 575/2013), the 
SRM Regulation (Regulation 806/2014), 
as well as
 the ﬁlevel 2ﬂ texts. 
These 
ﬁlevel 2 
textsﬂ consist large
ly of Regulatory Technical S
tandards (RTS
s) drafted by the EBA on 
the basis of Article 10 of the EBA Regulation and subsequently adopted by the 
Commission on the basis of Article 290 TFEU, using an empowerment included in a 
                                                                    63  It corresponds, in substance, to Article 132(1) TFEU, which, in turn, constitutes a specifica
tion of the 
general catalogue of Union legal acts in Article 288 TFEU. Not all legal acts listed in the latter are also 
included in Article 132(1) TFEU and Article 34.1 
of the Statute of the 
ESCB; in particular, the omission of 
directives makes it clear th
at the ECB is not empowered to adopt this type of legal act.
 64  ECB 
Opinions will not be discussed
 and further in this article
. Although ECB 
Opinions may be adopted in 
relation to draft legislation relating to the supervision of credit institutions, th
ey a
re not intrinsically linked
 to the exe
rcise
 of the ECB™s supervisory powers.

s) dra
fted by the EBA on the 
basis of Article 15 of the EBA Regulation and subsequently adopted by the 
Commission on the basis of Article 291 TFEU, also using an empowerment in a level 1 
text. In addition, there are cases where the Commission adopts 
delegated 
regulations 
in the area of banking supervision directly on the basis of Article 290 
of the 
TFEU and 
an empowerment in a level 1 text without the need for an EBA drafting procedure 
under Article 10 of the EBA Regulation
. One
 example 
of this is Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2015/61 which, on the basis of Article 291 
of the 
TFEU and Article 
460 of the 
CRR, defines the calculation of the 
liquidity 
coverage 
ratio
 (LCR). R
TSs
, 
ITSs
 and Commission Delegated Regulations make up the vast
 majority of ﬁlevel 2ﬂ 
texts 
and are adopted in the form of regulations, ensuring their direct applicability 
throughout the Union. The ECB is mandated to apply these acts and it 
may not
 amend 
or deviate from them or enact new legislation in the form of gen
erally applicable 
Regulations not foreseen in the level 1 acts
.65 Article 4(3) is not, in itself, a sufficient legal basis for the adoption of 
regulations but rather presupposes an otherwise existing legal basis for the 
ECB to act
. It
 is limited to stating 
that, in principle, 
regulations are also an 
admissible legal 
act which the ECB 
may use
 in the area of banking supervision.
 An example 
of the ECB act
ing
 in a regulatory 
capacity
 is Regulation 2016/445
, in 
which the ECB exercised options and discretions avai
lable under relevant Union law
 with direct applicability within the Member States participating in the SSM
, with the 
exception of Member States in close cooperation
. The ECB could exercise these 
options and discretions only where they are entrusted not to 
Member States but to the 
competent authority 
Œ a role which, 
according to 
Article 9(1) of the SSM Regulation, is 
now exercised by the ECB for significant institutions. Another example is Article 6(7), 
which enables the adoption of 
regulations establish
ing
 a framework to organise the 
practical arrangements for the implementation of the interaction between the ECB and 
the NCAs within the SSM and which has been used, most importantly, for the SSM 
Framework Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 468/2014). 
These exampl
es show some 
parallels with the ECB™s competence to adopt regulations within the area of monetary 
policy. The ECB may also only adopt regulations for specific fields of monetary policy, 
unlike the EU legislator which, once it is conferred a competence, is 
normally granted 
the choice of the most appropriate legal instrument to adopt.
66 In 
the 
case of ECB 
regulations, publication in the Official Journal of the EU is mandatory for them to enter 
into effect (Article 297(2) 
of the 
TFEU and Article 17.7 of the ECB
 Rules of Procedure).
                                                                     65  It would therefore appear that ECB Regulations are ﬁregulatory actsﬂ as opposed to ﬁlegislative actsﬂ in 
the dichotomy developed by case
-law for the purposes of Article 263(4) 
of the 
TFEU. See Case C
-583/11 
P Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, ECLI:EU:C:2013:625.
 66  This difference is visible in the field of banknotes and coins: while the rules on coins are adopted in the 
form of a regulation, the rules
 on the reproduction of banknotes had to be adopted via a decision as the 
Statute does not allow the ECB to adopt regulations in the field of banknotes.

 ECB Decisions
 Different types of 
ﬁdecisions
ﬂ As in the rest of the Treaty, 
the word 
ﬁdecisionﬂ 
has
 three different 
connotations:
  First
 Œ and this is the narrowest meaning 
Œ the term is used in the same sense as 
in Articles 288(4) and 132(1), second indent, 
of the 
TFEU and 
Article 
34.1, 
second indent, of the 
Statute of the 
ESCB. In other words, it describes an act 
which is intended to cre
ate legal effects which are case
-specific and sometimes 
limited to specific addressees, rather than
 applicable in
 general 
Œ this constitutes 
the main difference from a 
regulation. This is the meaning of the 
word
 ﬁdecisionﬂ 
which 
is the 
focus of the 
present
 discussion.
  Second
, the term is used in Article 26(8) of the SSM Regulation to describe the 
decision
-making process within the SSM. In this sense, ﬁdecisionﬂ is a generic 
term that encompasses any act which must be adopted by the Governing Council 
of the 
ECB upon a proposal from the Supervisory Board. This decision
-making 
procedure applies to all measures 
involving
 an assessment connected to the 
exercise of the tasks conferred on the ECB by the SSM Regulation, unless a 
decision
-making power has been delega
ted to heads of 
business areas
 within 
the ECB 
Œ again, by the Governing Council upon
 a proposal from the Supervisory 
Board, to whom the act adopted under delegation is attributed. Th
is second
 meaning includes all decisions 
under the 
first bullet point, but
 also 
goes well 
beyond
 this
; the adoption of an ECB Regulation in the area of supervision
, for 
inst
ance,
 would also be a supervisory ﬁdecisionﬂ in this sense.
  Finally, in the broadest possible sense and in the sense which is closest to 
non-technical common
 usage, the word ﬁdecisionﬂ is, within the ECB, sometimes 
also used for any kind of resolution made by bodies of the ECB. These 
ﬁdecisionsﬂ need not necessarily have legal effect towards parties outside the 
ECB
, but they 
are
 binding for the institution and
 the body that has adopted them. 
For example, certain letters to banks are decided on by the Supervisory Board of 
the ECB in its meetings without these letters being sent through a non
-objection 
procedure.
 Such ﬁdecisionsﬂ 
on the text of letters sent to ba
nks 
are not legal acts 
(and not ﬁdecisionsﬂ in the present sense) but rather tools 
for the 
execution of 
supervisory tasks (Articl
e 26(1) of the SSM Regulation).
 As mentioned 
above
, the first meaning of the word ﬁdecisionﬂ, that 
correspond
ing
 to Articles 28
8(4) and 132(1), second indent, 
of the TFEU, 
is the 
meaning on which the present discussion will focus.
 In this sense, a decision is 
characterised by its binding legal effect, which it has in common with a regulation. The 
primary difference between the two
 lies in 
their
 scope
 of applica
tion.
 While r
egulations 
are general
ly applica
ble,
 decisions without addressees apply only to a specific object. 
Decisions, 
moreover
, come in two varieties, either as decisions with specified 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Articles
 The taxonomy of ECB instruments avail
able for banking supervision
  89 addressees or decisions without ad
dressee
 yet addressing a specific issue (see 
below)
.67 Decisions with addressees
 A decision with addressees 
must
 specify these addressees unambiguously and 
is binding only on them.
 For this reason, it is the usual form of legal act used by the 
ECB 
to carry 
out its
 supervision in concrete individual cases
. S
upervisory measures 
imposing requirements on supervised entities, or conversely granting a permission 
required under applicable law, 
for example, 
almost always take the form of a decision 
with addressee. F
or this reason, it can be thought of as analogous to case
-specific, 
legally binding forms of legal acts in national administrative law systems, e.g. the 
Verwaltungsakt
 in Germany, the 
acte administratif
 in France, or the 
Bescheid
 in 
Austria. Owing to its l
egally binding nature, the decision with addressee is 
challengeable before the Union courts, usually by means of an action for annulment 
under Article 263 
of the 
TFEU
. The specified addressees have automatic standing for 
such an action, 
while 
(non
-privileg
ed) non
-addressees 
do so 
only if they can 
demonstrate that they are directly and individually 
affected
 by it. 
Such decisions must
 be notified to their addressees
.68 Decisions without addressees
 The decision without addressee is also binding, but it cannot b
e used to 
directly affect the legal situation of a given party, e.g. a supervised entity
, 
for
 which
 purpose 
a decision addressed to that entity would be needed.
 It is the 
appropriate legal form to define, with legal effect, a case which affect
s more than
 the situation of a particular party while establishing binding rules for the ECB in the 
conduct of certain tasks. It is often used 
to establish
 organisational arrangements in a 
legally sound manner, e.g. the Administrative Board of Review and its procedure 
or 
the internal separation between the supervisory and the monetary policy functions of 
the ECB (see below). There is, th
erefore
, a certain overlap with the 
scope of 
application 
for regulations,
 the 
only 
difference being the internal
ly binding 
nature
 of th
e decisions without addres
sees.
 The ECB has 
already 
adopted several such 
decisions without addressees in the 
context of the 
SSM, some of
 which
 have been published in the Official Journal.
 This list 
shows
 that the majority of such decisions without addressees are of an 
institutional nature

this distinction has been
 explicitly codified in Article 288(4) 
of the 
TFEU, but 
it 
was
 common practice even before.
 68  This follows also from Article 17a.4 of the ECB Rules of Procedure. In addition to the addressees, and 
according to Article 24(5) 
of the 
SSMR
, persons to whom the decision is of 
ﬁdirect and individual concern
ﬂ may also request a review of a decision.

 ECB Instructions and guidelines
 National competent authorities are responsible for assisting the ECB, where 
appropriate, with the preparation and implementation of any act
s relating to the 
ECB™s supervisory tasks.
 To this end, the SSM Regulation 
gives
 the ECB the power 
to adopt guidelines and instructions addressed to national competent authorities.
 Such guidelines and instructions are not legal acts (because they are not 
included in the catalogue of legal acts defined in Article 132(1) 
of the 
TFEU and 
Article 34.1 
of the Statute of the 
ESCB), but they are legal instruments and are 
binding on the national competent authorities to which they are addressed.
 More specifically, 
ECB instructions exist in two variants.
 They can be 
case
-specific or general, 
i.e.
 relating not to an individual case but to a particular 
subject and applying in all 
relevant 
future cases.
 Case
-specific ECB Instructions
 Case
-specific instructions command t
he national competent authority to take a 
particular course of action with regard to an individual case.
 The instruction can, 
most importantly, order the adoption of a national decision or other administrative act 
by the national competent authority, makin
g use of a power available to it (but not to 
the ECB) under the relevant national law. These instructions, which are analogous to 
intra
-Eurosystem instructions pursuant to Article 14.3 
of the Statute of the 
ESCB in the 
realm of monetary policy, 
have
 their 
legal basis in Article 9(1), third sub
-paragraph
, of 
the SSM Regulation, 
as further
 specified in Article 22 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation. 
The ECB may also adopt instructions addressed to the national 
competent authority of a Member State in close cooperation within the meaning of 
Article 7(1) of the SSM Regulation. 
The instructions are binding on the national 
competent authority to which the
y are addressed; this can be concluded from the word 
ﬁrequireﬂ in the legal bas
is cited, which denotes the creation of a binding obligation. 
They 
must
 be notified to their addressees (Article 17a.3 of the ECB Rules of 
Procedure).

  92 General ECB Instructions
 In addition, instructions can be general, 
i.e.
 not relating to an individual case 
but rather to a subject, to be applied in all future cases in which the issue 
governed by the instruction arises.
 In this case, the instruction is of a general 
nature. Such ge
neral instructions
, normally addressed to only one NCA,
 contain the 
general framework and the main rules to be implemented by the national competent 
authorities.
 Article 6(5)(a) 
of the 
SSM Regulation explicitly empowers the ECB to adopt 
general 
instructions governing the supervision of less significant institutions 
by the national competent authorities.
 This is consistent with the principle that 
carrying out specific supervisory tasks 
for
 less significant
 institutions is 
the
 responsibility of the
 national competent authorities, including the adoption of 
supervisory decisions, with the exception of licencing and the qualifying holding 
regime (Article 6(6)
 of the
 SSM Regulation). The ECB exercises general oversight 
over the functioning of the system
 (Article 6(5)(c) 
of the 
SSM Regulation) but does not 
intervene in individual cases, with the 
caveat
 that it can take over direct supervision 
entirely where necessary (Article 6(5)(b) 
of the 
SSM Regulation). The SSM Regulation 
therefore 
only allows
 the ECB
 to issue 
case
-specific instructions to significant 
institutions for which 
it is directly competent
, or in the case of close cooperation, while 
limiting it to general instructions for less significant institutions
. Nonetheless, within 
their scope of applic
ation general instructions are also binding on the national 
competent authorities to which they are addressed; they are not mere ﬁsoft lawﬂ 
instruments. They can thus be seen as an embodiment of the idea, emphasised by the
 European
 Court of Justice, that t
he ECB has been conferred exclusive competences 
as r
egards the tasks listed in Article
 4(1) of the 
SSM
 Regulation for the prudential 
supervision of less significant institutions 
as well, 
and that the activities of the national 
competent authorities in this
 regard are a case of assistance provided by them to the 
ECB rather than an exercise of an inherently national competence
.79 ECB Guidelines, which are addressed to all national competent authorities, are 
also of 
a general rather than case
-specific 
nature
, y
et 
are 
nonetheless binding 
on their addressees.
 The line between general instructions and guidelines is 
th
erefore
 not easy to 
establish, and practical experience in the adoption of general 
instructions is limited
. 
However, it can be argued that the 
main di
fference lies in the 
fact that 
guidelines are of a quasi
-regulatory nature. Even though they do not impose 
obligations directly on third parties other than national competent authorities (in 
particular
 not on
 credit institutions), they do govern a particul
ar area in a general 
manner, applying to all national competent authorities and prescribing in an abstract 
way what 
is entailed in the performance of
 the activities governed by the guidelines. 
General instructions, on the other hand, can be addressed to on
e or a subset of 
national competent authorities and in response to a narrow supervisory topic, such as 
a pressing need to take action which has arisen, but applying to all less significant 
institutions subject to the supervision of these authorities and wh
ich find themselves in 
the situation envisaged by the general instruction.

 The taxonomy of ECB instruments available for banking supervision
  93 The ECB has to date adopted and published several ECB Guidelines:
  Guideline (EU) 2015/856 of the ECB of 12 March 2015 laying down the principles 
of an Ethics Framework for the Singl
e Supervisory Mechanism (ECB/2015/12), 
(OJ L
 135, 2.6.2015, p. 
29).80  Guideline (EU) 2016/256 of the ECB of 5 February 2016 concerning the 
extension of common rules and minimum standards to protect the confidentiality 
of the statistical information 
collected by the ECB assisted by the national central 
banks to national competent authorities of participating Member States and to the 
ECB in its supervisory functions (ECB/
2016/1), (OJ L 47, 24.2.2016, p. 
16).  Guideline (EU) 2016/1993 of the ECB of 4 Nov
ember 2016 laying down the 
principles for the coordination of the assessment pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and the monitoring of 
institutional protection schemes including significant and less signifi
cant 
institutions (ECB/2016/37), 
(OJ L 306, 15.11.2016, 
p. 
32).  Guideline (EU) 2016/1994 of the ECB of 4 November 2016 on the approach for 
the recognition of institutional protection schemes for prudential purposes by 
national competent authorities pursuan
t to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council (ECB/2016/38), 
(OJ L 306, 15.11.2016, 
p. 37
).  Guideline (EU) 2017/697 of the ECB of 4 April 2017 on the exercise of options 
and discretions available in Union law by national co
mpetent authorities in 
relation to less significant institutions (ECB/2017/9), 
(OJ L 101, 13.4.2017, p. 
156). In any case, it is imperative 
to distinguish between
 guidelines of the ECB 
and
 those issued by the EBA under Article 16 of the EBA Regulation (Reg
ulation 
(EU) No 1093/2010).
 In spite of the use of the same label, these EBA guidelines are 
not legally binding; they are soft law instruments addressed by the EBA to competent 
authorities (the ECB being one of them) which carry only a comply
-or-explain 
obligation.
 Since ECB 
Guidelines, like general instructions, are not addressed to credit 
institutions, the
y cannot have any binding legal effect on such institutions
. They are, however, binding upon the national competent authorities. In addition
 to this
, and in line with the principle of harmonious interpretation, one would expect the 
national competent authorities not only to faithfully implement the guidelines but also 
to interpret and apply their respective national law in a manner which gives the best 
possible effect to the guidelines. T
here are no obligations under Union law to publish 
ECB Guidelines; they only need to be notified to their addressees (Article 17a.2 of the 
                                                                    80  Unlike 
the other guidelines in this list, this particular one was adopted on the basis of a special 
decision
-making procedure in Article 6(7) of the SSM Regulation, rather than the non
-objection 
procedure under Article 26(8) of the SSM Regulation which is the usu
al procedure for the adoption of 
instruments in the area of banking supervision. The reason behind this is that the non
-objection 
procedure does not apply to the general framework under which supervisory decisions 
are
 taken
, like the 
organisational framewo
rk referred to in Article 6(7) of the SSM Regulation; see recital (6) of Decision 
ECB/2014/1.

. However, 
in line with the transparency obligation of 
EU public institutions
, the ECB has published parts of the ECB Guidelines which are of 
interest to the general public. This, in turn, enhances the transparency of the activities 
of 
European banking supervision
. 3 Non
-legally binding legal acts, instruments and documents
 3.1
 General remarks
 In addition to the legal acts and binding instruments 
described above, the ECB 
may also make public any non
-binding instruments or documents for the 
purpose of providing transparency to supervised entities and the general 
public.
 In doing so, the ECB shall ensure that such instruments are not perceived as 
having any binding effect
 on third parties. It is noted that instruments and policy 
documents published on the ECB™s website, 
while
 not imposing any obligations on 
third parties
, do bind the ECB and therefore create legitimate expectations as to how 
European 
banking supervision
 will perform its supervisory tasks. To the extent it has 
created legitimate expectations the ECB is bound to act accordingly
.81 3.2
 ECB Recommendations
 ECB Recommendations are legal acts without binding effect. They are normally 
adopted 
by the Governing Council.
82 ECB Recommendations may be published in 
the Official Journal, in which case they are published in all official 
EU languages. 
There are t
wo types of ECB Recommendation.
 First, ECB Recommendations can be the instrument by which the
 ECB 
recommends legislative procedures at the Union level, leading to the enactment 
of complementary legislation.
 Although recommendations of this type may be 
adopted in relation to legislation relating to 
the ECB™s supervisory tasks, 
this 
contribution to 
the legislative activity is not intrinsically linked to the exercise of the 
ECB™s supervisory powers.
83 Second, ECB Recommendations can also be used by the ECB to recommend 
action
s to be taken.
 In the 
execution
 of its supervisory tasks, the ECB has made use
 of this type of recommendation on a number of occasions to 
provide
 credit institutions 
                                                                    81  See for instance Case T
-374/04 Germany v Commission
, paragraph 111.
 82  Article 17
.4 of the 
ECB Rules of Procedure 
states
 that ECB recommendations shall be adop
ted by the 
Governing Council or the Executive Board in their respective domain of competence, and sh
all be signed 
by the President.
 83  The ECB has adopted a Recommendation for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 
2532/98 concerning the powers 
of the ECB to impose sanctions 
(ECB/2014/19), 
(OJ C 144, 14.5.2014, p. 
2).  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019

.84 To date, dividend 
distribution is the only topic on which the ECB has issued recommendations 
addres
sed to all credit institutions. The ECB has also addressed national competent 
authorities in a recommendation on common specifications for the exercise of some 
options and discretions available 
under Union law by national competent authorities in 
relation 
to less significant institution
s.85 All of the aforementioned ECB 
Recommendations have been published in the Official Journal.
 3.3
 Supervisory disclosure obligations
 Directive 2013/36/EU
86 requires competent authorities responsible for banking 
supervision to
 disclose the texts of laws, regulations, administrative rules and 
general guidance adopted in their Member State in the field of prudential 
requirements, as well as the manner of exercise of the options and discretions 
available in Union law, the general 
criteria and methodologies 
of 
the 
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) 
and aggregate statistical 
data on key aspects of the implementation of the prudential.
 In keeping with 
these rules, the ECB makes public information on rules and guidance, o
ptions and 
national discretions, the SREP 
and aggregate statistical data 
on its Banking 
Supervision website
. The ECB applies all relevant Union law and all the implementing relevant laws 
and regulations of the Member States whose currency is the euro or wh
ose 
currency is not the euro but which have established a close cooperation.
 In view 
of the large number of relevant laws and regulations applicable, the ECB™s website 
refers to the website of the EBA
 for 
information on 
these laws and regulations. The 
EBA lists on its website the national laws and regulations adopted by each EU 
Member State to implement the provisions 
of 
CRD IV and 
the 
CRR, the administrative 
rules, e.g. instructing supervised banks on how to comply with legislative and 
regulatory requireme
nts, and general guidance, e.g. explicit disclosure requirements 
under CRD IV, or any other information that supervisory authorities publish to increase 
understanding of the new capital adequacy framework. 
The ECB 
also 
refers to the 
EBA™s website
 regarding 
the manner of exercise of the opti
ons and discretions 
available under
 Union law. Additionally, the ECB has adopted and published on its 
                                                                    84  Recommendation of the European Central Bank of 28 January 2015 on dividend distribution policies

information includes year

supervisory measures and administrative penalties as well as waivers.
 3.4
 Policy documents
 In addition to
 dis
clos
ing
 those instruments typically made public as part of the 
supervisory disclosure requirements, 
the ECB
, in an ongoing effort to provide 
transparency to supervised entities and the general public, 
also publishes 
different types of policy documents, whi
ch are not legal acts and are not legally 
binding on third parties, with the purpose of clarifying supervisory practices 
and expectations and ensuring 
the 
consistent application and equal treatment 
of supervised entities.
 Such policy documents have differi
ng names, including 
ﬁPolicy stance
ﬂ, 
ﬁGuidance
ﬂ, 
ﬁJoint Supervisory Standard
ﬂ, 
ﬁMethodology
ﬂ, 
ﬁGuide
ﬂ or 
ﬁLetter
ﬂ. These policy documents are to be distinguished from non
-binding ECB lega
l acts such as recommendations.
 Apart from the letters to Members of 
the European Parliament 
from
 either the 
President of the ECB or the Chair of the Supervisory Board, 
of 
which 
there have 
been
 over 160 to date, these 
various 
policy documents can be divided in
to three 
further broad categories
: guides, reports and letters to
 CEOs of credit 
institutions.
 The ECB has published guides and guidance on a number of different topics.
 Guides typically aim to ensure consistency 
between 
and equal treatment of significant 
credit institutions, for instance by setting out the details of p
rocesses applied by the 
ECB in the exercise of its supervisory tasks (see as an example the Guide to 
assessments of licence applications, the Guide to internal models, the Guides to the 
internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) and the interna
l capital 
adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), the Guide to on
-site inspections and internal 
model investigations and the Guide to fit and proper assessments). Generally 
speaking, the ECB will make use of 
ﬁGuides
ﬂ or 
ﬁGuidance
ﬂ where its policy objective 
is to provide transparency to credit institutions either on how the ECB intends to apply 
the relevant Union law or to describe the details of processes applied by the ECB in 
carrying out its supervisory tasks
, as well as how
 it 
would expect a prudent credit 
institution to act in view of relevant Union law. It may be expected that, with the initial 
phase of the SSM 
behind it
, 
future
 ECB 
publications 
on its supervisory policies 
would 
increasingly
 be labelled with names such as 
ﬁGui
deﬂ or 
ﬁGuidance
ﬂ. Guides or 
                                                                    87  Regulation (EU) 2016/445 of the ECB of 14 March 2016 on the exercise of options and discretions 
available in Union law (ECB/2016/4),

) and ECB Guide on options and 
discretions available
 in Union law of November 2016.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 / 2019
 Œ Articles
 The taxonomy of ECB instruments available for banking supervision
  97 guidance cannot and should not aim to create new obligations or requirements on 
credit institutions. Similarly, such documents should not appear to exclude any 
different application of relevant Union law in specific cases. Acco
rdingly, the wording 
and context, its substance and the intention of the ECB should not produce any legal
 effect on credit institutions.
 The ECB also publishes reports, such as the Report on recovery plans
88, the 
Report on the Thematic Review on effective r
isk data aggregation and risk 
reporting
89, the SSM thematic review on profitability and business models
90 or 
the ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities.
 These documents aim to inform 
the general public of supervisory activities performed by the ECB or l
essons learned 
from such supervisory activities. Such documents are typically purely descriptive in 
nature and follow either a specific supervisory exercise or activity. With the notable 
exception of the ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities, these r
eports are 
normally produced only once.
 Finally, the ECB publishes letters to CEOs of credit institutions, providing 
transparency to the general public on the existing supervisory practices or 
supervisory tasks performed.
 Typically, letters to CEOs of cred
it institutions are 
addressed to all credit institutions and contain general, non
-confidential information 
relevant for all credit institution
s or a large portion of them. Examples of such letters 
are the 
ﬁAnnouncement letter to institutions on the launch 
of the validation reporting on 
internal models for credit risk
ﬂ of 5 March 2019, the 
ﬁLetter on variable remuneration 
policy
ﬂ which has been sent to credit institutions on a more or less yearly basis and 
recalls the importance of
 a sound remuneration polic
y and the expectation that credit 
institutions take into account future legislation when determining remuneration 
policies. Only non
-confidential letters to credit institutions are made public
, and usually 
only those letters that are addressed to or releva
nt for all credit institutions. 
Occasionally, a letter to one specific credit institution is made public, for instance the 
letter to Dexia of 27 November 2017containing an ECB Decision permitting Dexia 
Crédit Local S.A.
, on the basis of the consolidated si
tuation of Dexia S.A.
, to include in 
Common Equity Tier 1 the instruments issued as a result of the conversion of the 
preferred shares into ordinary shares. Letters to CEOs may also merely contain 
information on upcoming publications or supervisory exercis
es. Examples of such 
letters are the letter on Validation reporting on internal models for credit risk of 5 March 
2019 or the letter with a Status update on TRIM: overview of outcome of general topics 
review and interim update on preliminary results of cre
dit risk on
-site investigations of 
15 June
 2018. Although most of the documents made public by the ECB in the exercise of its 
supervisory tasks can be placed in one of the broad categories
 listed above
, 
not all such documents fit perfectly in
to one of these categories.
 A case in point 
would be the SSM thematic review on profitability and business models of September 
                                                                    88  Report 
on recovery plans of July 2018.

and risk reporting of May 2018.

 4 Distinguishing between bind
ing and non
-binding instruments
 In its supervisory capacity the ECB is to execute the policy devised by the 
Union legislator, the Commission and the EBA.
 The ECB may adopt 
the necessary 
regulations to organise or specify the arrangements 
required for it to
 carry out t
he tasks conferred on it by the SSM Regulation
. The ECB is prevented from adopting 
rules of general application 
imposing 
prudential requirements
 on credit institutions
. 
Similarly, the ECB cannot regulate fields which the legislator has, for the
 time being, 
decided not to harmonise, nor can it complem
ent 
Union law when the latter leaves 
options or discretions to the national 
legislature
 or to the financial institutions 
themselves. The power to act by adopting rules of general application on these
 matters lies with the Union legislator, together with the Commission and the EBA, as 
appropriate, i
n accordance with the Treaties.
 In practice, the distinction between rules of general application on the one 
hand
, and providing transparency on 
the 
consist
ent application of relevant 
Union law and equal treatment on the other hand
, may not always be apparent.
 For instance, a guide setting out supervisory expectations regard
ing
 the 
implementation of a specific 
provision under 
Union law may be perceived as bin
ding 
by its addressees if that Guide does not make explicit that such expectations will 
always be assessed against all 
the 
relevant circumstances of an individual case and 
will be adjusted where appropriate. This distinction 
must
 nevertheless be made
 on th
e basis of the content of a document as well as its
 title
, 
as the jurisprudence of the ECJ
 makes clear that
 the content of a document
, and not its 
form or designation,
 determines its legal effect and whether it can be challenged
.91 Therefore, the distinctio
n between legally binding acts containing prudential 
requirements, on the one hand, and non
-binding legal acts and documents, on 
the other, needs to be carefully applied by the ECB when adopting legal acts or 
when publishing policy documents.
 This is not o
nly a question of legal certainty for 
the intended addressees of an instrument but can also be of crucial relevance in 
litigation, since case
-law (including a ruling against an ECB policy document
92) has 
made it clear that acts with legal effects are 
subjec
t to 
action
s for annulment
 and may 
imply liability on the part of the ECB
, irres
pective of how they are titled.
 In order to determine whether an act has legal effects, the wording and context 
of the act in question
93 as well as its content are examined by t
he European 
                                                                    91  See for instance Commission v Council, 22/70, paragraph 39 and Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, Case 
C521/06, paragraphs 43 and 45. As the General Court recalled in its judgment in United Kingdom v ECB 
Case T
-496/11,
 paragraph 30, case
-law is intended to prevent the for
m or designation given to the act by 
its author from allowing that act to escape judicial review even though it 
does, 
in fact
, have
 legal effects.

  99 Court of Justice.
94 Measures producing legal effects 
likely
 to affect an addressee's 
interests by clearly altering 
its
 legal position constitute acts or decisions open to 
challenge by an application for annulment, no matter what their title, nam
e or 
qualification.
95 In addition, the Court has consistently held that the binding legal effects of a 
measure must be assessed in accordance with objective criteria, such as the 
contents of that measure
96, taking into account, as appropriate, the context in
 which it was adopted
97, and the powers of the institution which adopted the 
measure
.98 In extreme cases, this objective assessment can lead to an admissible 
action for annulment even against acts which were not subjectively intended to be 
binding by the ado
pting institution.
99 Against this background, the ECB, when publishing non
-binding documents, 
either in the form of legal acts (recommendations) or in the form of policy 
documents, 
must ensure
 that they cannot be considered as legally binding by 
any interes
ted party and that they should not have effects that modify the legal 
rights of a third party.
 This is particularly difficult in this context, in which markets 
have an impact on individual positions, and in which the markets react to ECB/SSM 
communications
, even though they are not meant to be binding but rather only a 
clarification or preannouncement of the policy which will be applied in the future.
 5 Conclusions
 The ECB may adopt a wide range of legal instruments 
in the exercise of its 
supervisory tasks, and 
has 
also has regularly published non
-legal acts to 
further clarify its position.
 The ECB may adopt a number of legally binding legal act
s for the purpose of 
exercising its supervisory powers and its supervisory 
discretion.
 The ECB has 
some regulatory powers to fulfil its supervisory tasks, but it can only exercise them 
within the 
scope granted to it
 by the legislator; it cannot legislate to amend or deviate 
from the Single Rulebook, or enact new legislation in th
e form of generally applicable 
regulations. By adopting legal acts, legal instruments or by disclosing documents, the 
ECB can
, however
, bind its discretion with a view to the principle of self
-commitment. 
On the other hand, the ECB is mandated to adopt ind
ividual supervisory decisions 
addressed to credit institutions, and it does 
so on a continuous basis. In addition, the 
                                                                    94  See e.g. judgments of 9 Octobe

  100 ECB has adopted decisions without addressees, mainly to further organise the 
functioning of the SSM. The ECB may
 also
 also adopt non
-bind
ing legal acts, 
primarily
 consisting of 
recommendations to banks a
nd NCAs.
 An important tool for banking supervisors, and also for the ECB in the exercise 
of its supervisory tasks, is the disclosure of non
-binding policy documents to 
provide transparency o
n supervisory practices and expectations towards credit 
institutions.
 These policy documents are not legal acts and are therefore to be 
distinguished from recommendations. The ECB has made public a large number of 
such policy documents on its website and i
s expected to continue to make use of this 
useful and practical tool. Considering that there may be only a very fine line between 
adopting 
rules of general application
, on the one hand
, and providing transparency on 
the 
consistent application of relevant U
nion law and equal treatment
, on the other
, the 
ECB must 
give due consideration
 to the limitations of such documents and make 
adequate efforts to be clear on the non
-binding nature of its stances in this respect. 
Policy documents should not appear to conta
in rules of general application, 
in either
 title 
or content, as the content of a document and not its name determines its legal 
effect and whether it can be challenged.
