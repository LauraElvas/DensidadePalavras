 Overview
 Based on a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook
 for the 
euro area, also taking into account the latest
 staff macroeconomic projections, 
the Governing Council took a series of monetary policy decisions
 at its 
monetary policy meeting on 6 June to support the convergence of inflation 
towards levels of below, but close to, 2%.
 Despite the somewhat better than 
expected data for the first quarter, the most recent information indicates that global 
headwinds continue to weigh on the euro area outlook. The prolonged presence of 
uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and 
vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving its mark on economic sentiment. At the 
same time, further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the 
resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation. Against this 
overall 
background, the Governing Council decided
 to keep the key ECB int
erest rates 
unchanged and adjust its forward guidance on the 
key ECB rates to indicate its 
expectation that they will remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 
2020, a
nd in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained 
convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium 
term
. It also 
reiterate
d its forward guidance on reinvestments
. And, finally, it decided 
upon the 
modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO III), most notably their pricing parameters. 
The Governing Council 
also assessed that, at this point in time, the positive contribution of negative interest 
rates 
to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence 
of inflation is not undermined by possible side effects on bank
-based intermediation. 
However, 
the Governing Council
 will continue to monitor carefully the bank
-based 
transmission
 channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
6 June 2019
 Underlying global growth momentum continued to soften in early 2019, 
notwithstanding better than 
expected data in some key advanced economies.
 Survey
-based indicators signal continued weakness in global manufacturing activity
, despite some recent stabilisation at low levels
, and a recent deterioration in activity in 
the service sector f
ollowing a peri
od of relative resilience. Global growth is projected to 
decelerate this year amid high and rising policy and political uncertainty, which is 
weighing on global investment, and the renewed intensification of trade tensions 
between the United States and Chi
na. While those headwinds are expected to 
continue to weigh on global activity and trade this year, recent policy measures are 
expected to provide some support thereafter. As a result, global growth is projected to 
decrease in 2019, but to stabilise over t
he medium term. Global trade is expected to 
weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with economic activity in the 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 4 / 2019

 Overview
  3 medium term. Global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained, while 
downside risks to global economic activity 
have intensified.
 Long-term risk
-free rates have declined since the Governing Council™s meeting 
in March 2019 amid market expectations of continu
ed accommodative 
monetary policy and a resurgence of trade tensions.
 Non
-financial equity prices 
have increased
 slightly, 
exhibiting
 some volatility, supported by low risk
-free rates and 
improving earnings expectations. 
However, u
ncertainty related to 
resurgent 
trade 
tensions is weighing on the prices of risky assets. In foreign exchange markets, the 
euro has broad
ly appreciated in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP growth 
increased
 in the first quarter of 2019
 to 0.4% quarter 
on quarter, following 
the slowdown 
in 
the second half of last year
 against the 
background of a weaker trend in euro area external demand.
 However, incoming 
economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the 
second and third quarters of this year. This reflects the ongoing weakness in 
internationa
l trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are 
weighing, in particular, on the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, the 
euro area services and construction sectors are showing resilience and the labour 
market is continu
ing to improve. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue 
to be supported by favourable financing conditions, the mildly expansionary euro area 
fiscal stance, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit 
somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activity.
 This assessment is broadly reflec
ted in the June 2019 Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area
. These projections foresee annual 
real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. Compared wit
h the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP 
growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and has been revised 
down by 0.2 percentage points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021. The 
risks surroun
ding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside on 
account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the 
rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash
 estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 
1.2% in May 2019, after 1.7% in April, reflecting mainly lower energy and 
services price inflation.
 On 
the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline 
inflation is likely to decline over the coming month
s, before rising again towards the 
end of year. 
Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost 
pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation 
and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, und
erlying inflation is expected to 
increase over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the 
ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.
 Compared with the March 
2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been 
revised 
up by 
0.1 percentage points 
for 2019 and revised 
down by 0.1 percentage 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 4 / 2019
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  4 points 
for 2020. 
Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 
1.1% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.
 The annual growth of broad money and loans to the private sect
or increased in 
April 2019
. Broad money (M3) growth stood at 4.7% in April 2019, after 4.6% in 
March. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for 
the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. 
Furthermore, 
M3 growth 
remained resilient in the face of the fading out of the mechanical contribution of the net 
purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP). At the same time, lending 
conditions remained favourable
; t
he annual growth rate of loans to non
-financia
l corporations increased to 3.9% in April 2019 from 3.6% in March
. The monetary policy 
measures
 decided by the Governing Council
, including TLTRO III, will help to 
safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to 
financin
g, in particular for small and medium
-sized enterprises
. The 
aggregate
 fiscal stance
 for the euro area
 is projected to continue to be 
mildly expansionary, 
thereby 
providing support to economic activity
. This profile 
is mainly driven by cuts in direct taxes
 and social security contributions in Germany 
and France, but also by relatively dynamic expenditure growth in several other 
countries.
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
made the following 
decisions
:  First, the 
key ECB interest rates
 were kept 
unchanged. 
The Governing Council
 now expect
s them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 
2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued 
sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over 
the medium term.
  Second,
 th
e Governing Council
 intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase 
programme for an extended period of time past the date when 
it start
s raising the 
key ECB interest rates, and i
n any case for as long as necessary to maintain 
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary 
accommodation.
  Third, regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO
 III), 
the Gover
ning Council
 decided that the 
interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above 
the average rate applied in the Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations over 
the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net 
lending exceeds a 
benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO
 III will be lower, and can be as low as the 
average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation 
plus 10 basis points.
  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 4 / 2019
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Over
view
  5 These decisions were taken to 
provide the monet
ary accommodation necessary for 
inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% 
over the medium 
term
. In fact, they 
ensure that financial conditions will remain very 
favourable, supporting 
the 
euro area expansion, th
e ongoing build
-up of domestic 
price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term. 
At 
the same time, l
ooking ahead, the Governing Council is determined to act in 
the event 
of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjus
t all of its instruments, as 
appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing 
Council™s inflation aim in a sustained manner.

 Underlying global growth momentum continued to soften in early 2019, 
notwithstan
ding better than expected data 
in some key advanced economies.
 This is 
in line with survey
-based indicators, which signal continued weakness in global 
manufacturing activity. Following a period of relative resilience, activity in the service 
sector has als
o deteriorated
 recently
. Global growth is projected to 
decrease
 this year 
amid
 high and rising policy and political uncertainty
, which is weighing on global 
investment, and the renewed intensification of trade tensions between the United 
States and China
. While those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on global 
activity and trade this year, recent policy measures are expected to provide some 
support thereafter. As a result, global growth is projected to decrease in 2019, but to 
stabilise over the m
edium term. Global trade is expected to weaken more significantly 
this year and to grow in line with economic activity in the medium term. 
Global 
inflationary pressures are expected 
to remain contained, while
 downside risks to 
global 
economic 
activity have
 intensified
. Global economic activity and trade
 Underlying 
global growth 
momentum continued to soften in early 2019, 
notwithstanding better than expected
 data 
in some key advanced economies.
 In 
the United States, 
Japan and the United Kingdom, 
growth 
was 
better than expected in 
the first quarter. However
, 
this mostly reflected temporary factors. In the United States 
and Japan, economic activity was supported by p
ositive contributions from net trade
, 
which, however,
 conceal negative growth rates in real imp
orts of goods and services. 
Inventor
y build
ing also bolstered growth, while 
domestic demand 
was subdued. In the 
United States, the latter was associated with 
the partial federal government shutdown. 
A stronger than expected outturn in the United Kingdom la
rgely reflect
ed strong 
government spending and significant stock
-building by businesses in the run
-up to the 
original deadline of 29
 March
 for the country™s withdrawal from membership of the 
European Union (Brexit)
. 
In China, the economy remained on a path
 of 
gradual 
deceleration
, cushioned by expansionary policy measures
. Survey
-based indicators
 confirm a gradual weakening in 
growth
 momentum.
 The global composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI), excluding the euro 
area, softened in the first quarte
r of 2019 
and weakened further in April
 and May
. This 
is mainly 
related 
to a weaker performance 
across advanced economies
, while 
emerging market economies have recorded a slightly smaller deterioration in activity
. Global activity in t
he service sector
, wh
ich had been
 more 
resilient
 overall in recent 
months, deteriorated in May
, 
alongside a further decline in 
global manufacturing 
activity

-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to

. Global f
inancial conditions 
have been volatile in recent months
. In advanced 
economies, they are 
broadly unchanged 
from the levels seen
 at the time of 
the March 
2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections
. 
This stability, however, masks two distinct 
developments: financial conditions initially eased in response to 
monetary policy 
actions taken
 in the United States and other key advanced econ
omies, but 
have 
tightened since the announcement
s of new tariffs
 between the United States and 
China
. The latter
 development
 also 
contributed to a 
tighten
ing of
 financial conditions in 
China and
, to a lesser extent
, in other 
emerging market economies
. 
Fina
ncial 
conditions in Turkey have 
also tightened 
considerably 
in recent weeks 
owing to a 
renewed 
sharp depreciation of the lira, 
against the background of
 dwindling foreign 
currency reserves and rising political uncertainty. 
In global stock markets similar 
developments 
have
 been observed. Until the news about new tariffs broke, global 
equity prices had been rising. 
Since then global stock markets have declined amid 
increased volatility
. Global growth is projected to decelerate this year amid increasing headwi
nds.
 These 
headwinds 
include weak global manufacturing activity and trade in an 
environment of high and rising policy and political uncertainty. The sizeable procyclical
 fiscal stimulus in the United States, including lower taxes and increased expenditure, 
continues to provide impetus to US growth this year. In China, 
the 
slowdown in 
domestic demand 
has been cushioned by policy measures, especially those related to 
fiscal
 policy
. Recent 
monetary 
policy actions 
across key advanced economies have 
supported 
the 
easing of global financial conditions and helped to contain the impact of 
policy uncertainties. 
However, t
he positive effect of these
 factors on demand 
seems to 
have 
been eroded by the recent escalation of the trade dispute
 between the United 
States and China
. Looking further ahead, global growth is projected to stabilise 
at relatively low 
levels 
over the medium term.

  8 over the projection horizon
. 
First, cyclical momentum
 is expected to slow 
in key 
advanced economies
, as capacity constraints become increasingly 
binding, 
and policy 
support 
may 
gradually diminish
 amid 
positive output gaps and low unemployment 
rates. Seco
nd, China is expected to continue its orderly transition to a
 more balanced, 
albeit
 weaker,
 growth path
 that is 
less dependent on investment and exports. 
Finally, 
growth is projected to recover 
in several key 
emerging market economies which 
are 
currently g
oing through, or have recently experienced, deep recessions. Overall, the 
pace of global expansion
 is expected to 
settle at 
rates 
below 
those seen prior to the 
2007-08 financial crisis.
 Turning to developments in individual countries, activity in the United States 
has remained strong, notwithstanding the headwinds related to the trade 
dispute with China and 
the
 less favourable external environment.
 The strong 
labour market, 
accommodative 
financial conditions and 
current 
fiscal stimulus 
continu
e to support growth, while the adverse impact of the partial federal government 
shutdown on 
domestic demand
 is assumed to be temporary. 
Overall, real GDP 
expanded at an annualised rate of 3.1% in the 
first quarter of 2019, accelerating from 
2.2% in the final quarter of last year. However, the surprisingly strong growth data in 
the first quarter also reflected temporary factors, such as the positive contributions 
from inventories and falling imports. At
 the same time, domestic demand has declined, 
suggesting subdued underlying growth. Annual h
eadline
 consumer price inflation 
picked
 up to 2
.0
% in April
 from 1.9% in the previous month, largely on account of 
increasing 
energy price
s. C
onsumer 
price 
inflatio
n excluding food and energy
 also 
increased slightly
, rising 
to 2.1%
 in April
. Growth is projected to gradually return to the 
potential growth rate of just below 2%, while consumer price inflation is expected to 
remain slightly above 2% over the medium term
. Growth in China has 
recorded
 a gradual slowdown.
 In the first quarter
 of 2019
 annual 
GDP growth 
stabilised, 
supported by 
a positive 
net trade 
contribution 
as 
imports decreased more than exports. 
Looking through their volatility, the latest 
indicators 
poi
nt to stable growth momentum
 in the near term. A
 number of fiscal and 
monetary policy measures
 announced and implemented by the Chinese authorities 
recently are expected to cushion domestic demand and thus 
to deliver a smooth 
deceleration 
in activity 
this 
year
. The recent escalation of the trade dispute with the 
United States is expected to weigh on trade, while its impact on growth is 
expected to 
be contained by policies. Looking f
urther ahead, progress with the implementation of 
structural reforms is proj
ected to result in an orderly transition to a more moderate 
growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports.
 In Japan, underlying growth momentum remains muted.
 Growth in the first 
quarter of 2019 was 0.5% (quarter on quarter), which was bette
r than expected, as a 
number of 
transitory factors 
were
 at play
, including 
a large positive contribution from 
net exports 
owing to
 a sharp contraction 
in imports 
which exceeded the weakness in
 exports. 
Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to resume
 its 
path of 
moderate 
growth. 
The s
trong labour market and still favourable financial conditions remain 
supportive, 
although
 the economy is facing headwinds related to weak foreign 
demand, especially from China and the rest of Asia. 
Households are expected

frontload purchases ahead of the consum

  9 which could in turn provide 
a temporary boost to activity over the summer months. 
In 
addition
, fiscal measures aimed at 
counterbalancing 
the negative impact of 
the 
higher
 consum
ption
 tax are expected to support demand later in the year. 
Wage growth

 very tight labour market 
Œ and inflation expectations 
are stable 
at 
low levels
, suggest
ing
 that inflation will remain well below the Bank of Japan™
s 2% 
target over the medium term.
 In the United Kingdom, growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2019 on the 
back of a fiscal boost and strong stock
-building.
 Against the background of a 
last
-minute extension to the long
-anticipated departure date of the 
United Kingdom
 from the European Union
, strong stockpiling, together with fiscal support and 
better 
than expected data on
 both consumption and private investment, resulted in quarterly 
UK real GDP growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, after a modest 0.2% in
 the final quarter 
of 2018. Net trade 
made a negative 
contribut
ion
 to headline growth as imports surged 
at a rate 
rarely seen in the past 40 years, part
ly owing to
 inventor
y building
, while 
exports remained flat. However, short
-term indicators at the start
 of the second quarter 
suggest a continuation of the broad underlying trend of slowing growth momentum 
seen since the 
referendum
 on EU membership
. Annual CPI inflation declined to 1.8% 
in the first quarter of 2019 
Œ slightly below the Bank of England™s 2.0
% target 
Œ as 
sharp
 reductions in energy prices fed through to headline inflation. Stronger domestic 
cost pressures from higher unit labour costs 
amid
 higher
 wage growth at the start of 
2019 have been largely offset by the 
decline in
 import prices 
as the 
impact of the past 
depreciation of 
the pound 
sterling
 following the referendum continues to wane
. CPI 
inflation rebounded slightly to 2.1% in April 2019 large
ly as a consequence of an 
increase in retail energy prices, 
as well as
 marked rises in air fares
 for the Easter 
period
. Over the medium term growth is expected to remain below 
the level recorded 
prior to the 
referendum.
 In central and eastern European countries
, growth is projected to 
moderate 
somewhat this year.
 Investment growth 
remains strong, 
supported by
 EU funds
, and 
consumer spending
 also remains robust, 
underpinned by
 the
 strong labour market 
performance. 
However
, the slowdown in the euro area 
is weigh
ing
 on the growth 
outlook for th
is region. Over the 
medium term 
the pace of economic expan
sion in 
these countries is
 expected to 
decelerate further 
towards potential.
 The outlook for e
conomic activity in large commodity
-exporting countries
 remains mixed
. The outlook for growth i
n Russia 
is shaped
 by 
developments in 
global 
oil market
s, 
the execu
tion of 
fiscal and structural polic
ies,
 and the international 
sanctions 
under which the economy is currently operating.
 As a result, growth is 
expected to decelerate somewhat in the medium term. In contrast, g
rowth 
in Brazil is 
projected 
to 
strengthen,
 sup
ported by accommodative financial conditions. However, 
the existing fiscal constraints and uncertainties about the implementation of the 
current 
reform agenda continue to weigh on investment.
 In Turkey, economic activity contracted significantly in the fou
rth quarter of 
2018. This contraction reflects 
the legac
y of 
last summer™s 
financial turmoil, high 
inflation
, and procyclical monetary and fiscal policies.
 The economy returned to growth 
in the first quarter of 2019, supported by fiscal spending and higher lending by 
state
-owned banks in the run
-up to local elections in March. The expected

  10 disappearance of these supportive factors, together with 
the recent t
ightening of 
financial condition
s, could undermine the
 projected gradual 
recovery 
in economic 
activity this year
. Global trade momentum weaken
ed significantly at the turn of the year.
 It has 
decelerat
ed considerably more than global activity
. This is expla
ined by weaker global 
investment activity and a turn in the global tech cycle
1 amid high and rising policy and 
geopolitical uncertainty, which in turn weighed on manufacturing output and trade.
 The volume of global merchandise imports
, excluding the euro a
rea, 
contracted by 
0.6% in 
March
 in three
-month
-on-three
-month terms
, confirming subdued trade momentum in 
the first quarter (see Chart
 2). As survey indicators signal a further deterioration in 
global manufacturing activity
, the current weakness in global
 trade is likely to continue 
in the near term
. Bilateral trade talks between the United States and China suffered a
 setback in 
early May
. The US 
Administration 
announced that it would increase the tariff rate on 
USD
 200 billion of Chinese exports from 10% 
to 25%. This increase was originally 
scheduled for 1
 January 2019, but had been postponed twice: initially for three months 
owing to the temporary truce agreed between the two countries in early December, 
and again in late February amid tangible progress i
n the bilateral trade talks. China 
retaliated by raising the tariff
 rate on USD
 60 billion of US exports from between 5
% and 10%, to between 10
% and
 25%. In addition, the risk of 
a further escalation looms 
large, as the US 
Administration 
has 
threatened to impose additional 25% tariffs on 
all
 remaining US imports from China. 
The prospect
 of a further intensification of the trade 
dispute between the two countries 
has raised global uncertainty and is weighing on 
investment
. 
Moreover
, 
the possibil
ity that 
the US 
Administration 
may 
impose new 
tariffs on imports from other countries
 cannot be ruled out
. 
For instance, i
n mid
-May it 
announced that new tariffs of 25% on imported automobiles and auto parts, focusing 
primarily on imports from the EU and J
apan, 
would
 be postponed for up to 
six months, 
allowing
 time 
for bilateral trade 
negotiations 
between the U
nited States
 and these 
trading partners

 staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
global
 real GDP growth (excluding the euro area) is 
projected to 
decelerate 
to 3.
3% this year
, 
from 3.
8% in
 2018
. This reflects 
increasing 
headwinds
 to global growth
 in an environment of high and rising political and policy 
uncertainty. Over the period 2020
-21 world economic activity 
is projected to stabilise 
at 
3.6%
, as the (cyclical) 
slowdown 
in key advanced 
economies
 and China™s transition to 
a more moderate 
growth path 
are 
expected 
to be counterbalanced by a recovery 
in 
several key 
emerging market economies
. 
As the 
growth headwinds weigh 
more 
significantly on 
trade
-intensive demand components, such as invest
ment
, growth in 
euro area foreign demand is projected to slow 
more 
significantly 
than global activity 
this year, falling 
to 
1.7%, 
from 
3.6
% in 2018. 
Global imports are projected to 
gradually 
increase
 and grow in line with global activity over the medium te
rm. 
Compared with the 
March
 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections, global GDP growth has been 
revised slightly downwards for 
this year
. 
At the same time, g
rowth in euro area foreign 
demand has been revised 
downwards more significantly over the projectio
n horizon. 
From a geographical perspective, t
hese revisions reflect 
weaker than expected 
trade 
prospects for 
China and the rest of Asia
, as well as 
the outlook of 
slower import 
growth
 across some key trading partners, including the United Kingdom and other
 European 
countries outside the euro area.
 Downside risks to global activity have intensif
ied
 late
ly. A further escalation of 
trade disputes 
may pose a risk to
 global trade and growth. 
Moreover, a
 ﬁno dealﬂ Brexit 
scenario could have 
more 
adverse spillover
 effects, especially in Europe
. A sharper 
slowdown of China
™s economy
 could be 
harder
 to counteract with efficient policy 
stimulus and might prove a challenge to the ongoing rebalancing process
 in China
. 
Repricing in financial markets might weigh significa
ntly on vulnerable 
emerging 
market economies
. A further escalation of geopolitical tensions could 
also 
adversely 
affect global activity and trade.

  12 Global price developments
 While o
il prices 
have declined since April, they have recently been volatile
. Since
 April
 oil prices have declined by 13%. However, 
they 
have 
exhibited more 
pronounced volatility recently. 
While
 potential disruptions to 
the 
global oil supply 
owing
 to geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have sent oil pri
ces higher,
 con
cerns over trade tensions 
between the United States and China and their impact 
on global demand 
have lately led to down
ward pressure on oil prices.
 In the 
June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections 
oil prices 
are 
expected to 
increase in the near 
term and to 
decline
 over the 
projection
 horizon
. Amid
 short
-term volatility, supply factors have
 continued to bolster oil prices
, in particular
 the
 agreement between
 OPEC
 and other major oil producers
 to 
curb 
production
. However, 
weaker global oil demand
 and higher than expected shale oil 
production in the U
nited 
States
 could also weigh on oil price
s. Consequently,
 the oil 
price assumption
s underpinning the 
June
 2019 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections 
were
 around
 10.4% higher
 for this year 
(and 7.3% and 
3.4
% higher
 for 
2020 and 2021 respectively
) relative to the assumptions underpinning the March 2019 
ECB staff macroeconomic projections
. Since the cut
-off date for 
the June 
projections, 
however, the price of oil has 
declined
, 
with Brent crude oil sta
nding at 
USD
 61 per 
barrel 
on 5 June
. Global inflationary pressures remain contained.
 In 
countries belonging to 
the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD)
, annual 
headline 
consumer price inflation 
averaged
 2.5% in April 2019, up from
 2.3% in the previous 
month
, owing to an increase in the
 contribution 
of the energy component
 (see 
Chart
 3). 
Core
 inflation (excluding food and energy) 
increased slightly to 2.2% in April 
from 
2.1%
 in March
. Tight labour market conditions across the major 
advanced 
economies have so far translated into 
only 
moderate wage increases, suggesting that 
underlying inflation pressures remain subdued. 
Nevertheless
, they should recover 
gradually over the projection horizon
, reflecting diminishing slack.

 sharply this year and

 over the medium term. 
This reflects the 
impact of a downward sloping oil price futures curve, which is expected to outweigh 
the up
ward pressure arising from gradually diminishing global spare capacity.

 Since the Governing Council™s meeting in 
March 
2019, global long
-term risk
-free rates 
have declined 
amid both market expectations of continuing accommodative 
monetary 
policy and a resurgence of trade tensions
. 
Non
-financial equity prices have increased 
slightly, amid some volatility, supported by the low risk
-free rates and improving 
earnings expectations. Uncertainty related to trade tensions is weighing on th
e prices 
of risky assets. I
n foreign exchange markets, the euro has 
appreciated
 in 
trade
-weighted terms.
 In the review period l
ong
-term yields 
in both the euro area and the United States
 continued their 
decline
 which started in late 2018
. During the period under review 
(7 March 
to 
5 June 2019
), the euro area ten
-year risk
-free overnight index swap (OIS) 
rate 
fell by 31 basis points to around 0.11% 
and the GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year 
sovereign bond yield
 fell by 27 basis points to 0.50
% (see Chart 4)
. 
Ten-year 
sovereign bond yields in the United States and United Kingdom also dropped, by 50 
and 32 basis points respectively. The fall in global long
-term yields comes on the back 
of communications from both the Federal Reserve System and th
e ECB that were 
perceived by market participants as suggesting continuing accommodative monetary 
policy. It also reflects the resurgence of trade tensions since early May.

 Euro area real GDP growth 
rose
 in the first quarter of 2019, following the slowdown of 
the second half of last year against the background of a we
aker trend in euro area 
external demand. 
However, incoming data and t
he latest survey results point to 
weaker 
but ongoing growth momentum in the near term. The June
 2019 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual real GDP i
ncreasing 
by 
1.2
% in 2019, 
1.4
% in 2020 and 
1.4
% in 2021. 
Compared with the March 2019 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up 
by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and has been revised down by 0.2 percentage 
points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021.
 Growth 
increased
 in the first quarter of 2019, 
largely reflecting temporary 
factors.
 Real
 GDP increased by 0.4%, in quarter
-on-quarter terms, in the first quarter 
of 2019, following average growth of 0.2% in the second half of 2018
 (see Box
 3 for an 
analysis of ﬁsoft patchesﬂ in the euro area). 
Domestic demand remained robust in the 
first quar
ter of 2019. Notably, private consumption and fixed investment spending 
were the main drivers of growth, contributing 0.3 percentage point
s and 0.2
 percentage point
s respectively. Changes in inventories made a negative 
contribution to real GDP growth in th
e first quarter, whereas net trade made a small 
positive contribution
 (see Chart
 10). 
Output growth in s
ome countries benefited from a 
spike in 
exports
 related to exceptionally strong import demand 
in the United Kingdom, 
in anticipation of the original Bre
xit date. In addition, in Germany, private consumption 
rebounded strongly as private car registrations surged following disruptions in car 
production in the second half of 2018. Private consumption was also supported by 
fiscal measures 
that
 became effectiv
e in the first quarter
, when the measures
 are 
expected to have their biggest impact. 
On the supply side, growth was broadly 
supported across all value added components. Overall, in quarter
-on-quarter terms, 
industrial production (excluding construction) in
creased by 0.8% in the first quarter of 
2019, after 
contracting by
 1.2% in the previous quarter.
 Production in construction 
expanded at a faster pace 
(2.0%
) on account of the good weather conditions during 
the first few months of 2019.

 Developments in private consumption continue
d to be driven primarily by the 
recovery in the labour market and stronger household balance sheets.
 Private 
consumption rose by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, following 
somewhat weaker growth in the last quarter of 2018. Passenger car registrations rose 
by 4.7%, month on month, in April, consolidating the rebound witnessed in the first 
quarter and broadly reaching their level of one year ago. The normalisation of car 
regist
rations is consistent with households™ stated intentions to make major purchases 
in the coming year. From a longer
-term perspective, increasing labour income 
continues to support the underlying momentum in consumer spending, which is also 
reflected in abov
e-average consumer confidence. In addition, the further 
strengthening of household balance sheets remains an important factor for steady 
consumption growth, as households™ creditworthiness is a key determinant of their 
access to credit.
 The ongoing recover
y in housing markets is expected to continue to contribute 
significantly to overall real GDP growth.
 Housing investment increased by 1.1% in 
the first quarter of 2019, reflecting its continuing recovery in many euro area countries 
and in the euro area as a
 whole. Recent short
-term indicators and survey results point 
to positive but decelerating momentum. Construction production 
rose for
 the

  22 expectations for euro area annual investment growth in 2019 are broadly unchanged, 
at 4.4%, compared with the previous survey conducted in November
 2018 (see Cha
rt 
12). Evidence from 
the
 survey further suggests that investment should continue to be 
supported by the strengthening of domestic demand, high capacity utilisation rates 
and favourable financing conditions. On a slightly less positive note, investment 
sentiment in recent quarters
 has been hampered by geopolitical factors, trade 
disputes, Brexit and vulnerabilities in China (see Box 4 entitled ﬁConfidence and 
investmentﬂ).

 Euro area trade 
has remained
 weak but
 has shown
 initial signs of stabilisation.
 According to the latest release of data from the national accounts, in the first quarter of 
2019 total euro area exports increased by 0
.6% in real terms, while imports increased 
by 0.4% on a quarterly basis. 
The most recent
 data on the monthly trade in goods 
have 
confirm
ed the weak performance, as nominal extra
-euro area exports recorded a 
slight contraction in March (
-0.2% month on month
), while nominal extra
-euro area 
imports 
have 
recovered somewhat after their decline in February (0.7% month on 
month). Goods export volumes to China recovered in March and exports to the United 
Kingdom surprised positively in February, driven by anticipat
ion effects, while exports 
to the United States weakened during the winter. 
The l
atest survey indicators based 
on export orders 
give
 mixed signals.
 Despite the positive reading of euro area real GDP growth in the first quarter of 
2019, the most recent
 econ
omic data and survey information point to somewhat 
weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year
. Although the impact 
of country and sector
-specific factors appears to have dissipated to some extent, 
elevated global uncertainty continues to w
eigh on the euro area growth outlook. The 
European Commission™s Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) stood

 Euro area economic growth is expected to continue at
 a moderate pace in the 
near term.
 The ECB™s monetary policy measures continue to support favourable 
lending rates, fostering economic growth in the euro area. Private consumption is 
supported by healthy labour markets, ongoing employment gains and househo
ld 
sentiment. Housing investment remains robust, while business investment is backed 
by favourable financing conditions and solid domestic demand. Global headwinds, 
however, continue to weigh on the near
-term outlook for euro area growth, as the 
threat of 
increased protectionism and geopolitical factors has intensified more 
recently. In this context, the risks surrounding euro area growth remain tilted to the 
downside.
 The June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee annual

 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in 
May 2019, down from 1.7% in April. Looking through the recent volatility due to 
temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remain
 generally muted, but 
labour cost pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity 
utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is 
expected to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by 
the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage 
growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 
1.3
% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. Compared with the March 2019 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up by 
0.1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2020. 
Annual HICP
 inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 1.
1% in 2019, 1.4% 
in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.
 Headline inflation 
decreased 
in 
May owing to weaker annual inflation rates in 
more volatile categories
. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area an
nual 
HICP inflation 
fell to 1.2% in May 2019
 from 1.7% in April
 (see Chart
 14). 
The increase 
in April and subsequent decrease in May largely reflected the late
r timing of Easter this 
year
 and the effect this has on the year
-on-year growth rates of prices o
f certain 
travel
-related items
. This effect is particularly evident in the evolution of HICP services 
inflation, which increased from 1.1% in March to 1.9% in April before falling back to 
1.1% in May. HICP energy inflation declined from 5.8% in April to 3.
8% in May.

  25 (see Chart 15). As with overall HICP inflation, t
he increase in this underlying inflation 
measure in April and its subsequent decrease in May
 also reflected
 the 
effect of the 
late
r timing of Easter
. This temporary upward im
pact on the April inflation rate is also 
captured by the trimmed
-mean measures included in the swathe, and it is likely that 
the May numbers will not change the broad picture of sideways movements in 
measures of underlying inflation observed in recent mont
hs. Indeed, those m
easures 
that help to abstract from such temporary effects, such as 
the 
HICP excluding 
energy, 
food, travel
-related items and clothing and footwear,
 the
 Persistent and Common 
Component of Inflation 
(PCCI
) and the 
Supercore 
indicator 
were 
all unchanged in April 
(the latest available data).
2 Looking ahead, measures of underlying inflation are 
expected to increase 
gradually, especially driven by the 
robust
 wage growth and the 
pick
-up seen in producer output price inflation.

 May 2019 
(flash estimate) for 
HICP excluding energy

 and 
for April 2019
 for 
all 
the

measures
. The range of 
measures of 
underlying 
inflation
 consists of the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding

food; HICP excluding energy, 
food,

mean; the 30% tri
mmed mean;
 and the

 median of the HICP.
 Growth rates for
 HICP excluding energy and food for 
2015 are 
distorted upwards 
owing
 to a methodological change (see Box 5 in 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 2, ECB, 2019
). Price pressures 
in
 the later stages 
of the
 non-energy industrial goods supply 
chain remained 
well above their historical average,
 but eased 
slight
ly in the 
earlier
 stages
. Producer price inflation for non
-food consumer goods sold in the euro 
area 
declined slightly to 0.9% in April from 1.0% 
March
, although this was still well 
above
 its historical average of 0.55%. Its rise from a trough of 
-0.2% in December 
2016 has been broad
-based across 
the
 constituent manufacturing sub
-sectors, 
suggesting some robustness. The corresponding import price inflatio
n continued on a 
steady rise to 1.5% in March from a recent low of 0.3% in December, largely reflecting 
the impact of the recent depreciation of the euro effective exchange rate. This may 
have counterbalanced somewhat weaker global price pressures, with gl
obal Producer 
Price Index
 (PPI) inflation excluding energy easing further in March to 3.3%, down 
from its
 peak of 4.8% in September 2018
.                                                                     2  For more information on these measures of underlying inflation, see Boxes 2 and 3 in

to the wage drift, negotiated wage growth is more persistent, reacting gradually to 
cumulative changes in the unemployment rate. The outlook for continued strong 
negotiated wage growth a
head 
largely rests on some 
longer
-term 
agreements (in 
some cases up to 2020) and should support 
a robust pace of 
growth 
in compensation 
per employee 
throughout
 2019.

1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in

%, 
1.5
% and 1.6
% respectively
 in the

These revisions are 
largely explained by the energy component
, which is revised upwards 
markedly 
for 
2019, due to stronger growth in oil prices, and downwards for 2020, due to a more 
steeply downward sloping profile for oil pr
ice futures. 
HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food 
is projected to follow an upward path,
 supported by the more gradual
 but 
continued economic recovery
 and the 
tightening labour market conditions
, leading to 
higher domestic cost pressures
. HICP inflatio

ood is expected

 the fading out of the mechanical 
con
tribution of 
the

asset purchase programme (
APP). 
At the 
same time, bank funding and lending conditions remained favourable
, also reflecting 
the monetary policy measures announced in March and June
. 
Net issuance of debt 
securities by NFCs 
rebounded in the first quarter of 2019 after declining
 in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2018, 
amid an improvement in 
bond market conditions
 and, until April, the 
decline in the cost of market
-based debt financing
. Broad money
 growth 
edged up
 in 
April, returning to its growth rate at the end of 
2017. The annual growth rate of M3 
increased to 4.7% in April 2019 from 4.6% in 
March 
(see Chart 19), supported by lower opportunity costs.
 In this respect, M3 growth 
remained resilient 
in the face of
 the fading out of the mechanical contribution of the 
APP, implying that the latter had a smaller positive impact.
 M3 growth had moderated 
from late 2017 until a recent low in August 2018, as
 the 
net asset purchases
 were 
scaled down. The narr
ow money aggregate M1, which includes the most liquid 
components of M3, remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The annual 
growth rate of M1 was broadly stable 
in April at 7.4%
, as opposed to
 7.5% in March, 
confirming the halt of the downward 
trend observed since late 2017
. Given
 the leading 
properties of real M1 with respect to real GDP growth, th
is development 
is consistent 
with a stabilisation in economic activity going forward.

vernight deposits held 
by

notwithstanding some short

urrency in circulation
 has 
followed its long
-established trend, thus speaking against any material substitution of
 cash for 
deposits in an environment of very low or negative interest rates
 for the

. 
The contribution of short
-term
 deposits 
other than overnight deposits 
(i.e.
 M2 minus M1) 
became positive for the first time since late 2013, continuing the 
upward trend observed in recent quarters and supported by lower opportunity c
osts of 
holding M3.
 Marketable instruments (i.e.
 M3 minus M2)
 continued to contribute 
negatively to M3 growth as a result of the relatively low remuneration of these 
instruments.
 The decreasing mechanical contribution 
of the 
APP to M3 growth has been 
large
ly offset
, from the counterparts™ perspective
, by positive contributions 
from credit to the private sector and
, recently
, from external monetary inflows
 (see Chart 20).
 The positive 
contribution
 to M3 growth from

securities held by the E
urosystem
, which reflects the mechanical contribution of the

 peak of 4.3%. This is 
in line with its lagging cyclical pattern with respect to real economic activity and the 
slowdown in aggregate demand observed over 
the course of 
2018. The moderation 
was
 largely driven by diminished loan d
emand
 owing to firms™ lower financing needs
. 
By contrast, 
bank 
lending
 and bond market conditions 
remained favourable (see 
below), suggesting that supply forces are not weighing on credit dynamics given the 
ample degree of monetary policy accommodation
. Loan growth for firms was 
characterised by considerable
 heterogeneity
 across countries 
(see Chart
 21). 
The annual growth rate of loans to households 
increased slightly to
 3.4% in 
April, from 
3.3% in March, also characterised by cross
-country heterogeneity
 (see Chart
 22). 
The 
overall gradual expansion 
of loans to households continue
d to be driven by both 
consumer credit and 
housing loans
, the latter 
growing
 moderate
ly in net terms by 
historical standards
 for the euro area as a whole. At the same time, housing 
loan 
growth and house price developments are also heterogeneous across countries.

 Bank
s™ debt
 funding conditions 
have improved further
. In April, the 
composite 
cost of debt financing
 for euro area banks
 decreased further, down from its recent 
peak in January 2019 and returning to its level in February 2018 
(see Ch
art
 23). This 
development was driven mainly by a considerable decline in bank bond yields. Still, 
compared with deposits, bank bonds remained the more expensive source of funding, 
accounting for a limited share in banks™ overall debt funding. In addition, 
euro area 
banks™ deposit rates 
remained broadly stable 
in April. The improvement in banks™ debt 
funding costs was widespread
 across the largest euro area countries. While deposit 
rates remained broadly unchanged across these countries, bank bond yields dec
lined 
considerably in April. In addition, euro area banks reported improved access to 
funding in the first quarter of 2019 in their responses to the ECB™s bank lending survey, 
primarily on account of their access to debt securities funding. At the same tim
e, the 
level of bank funding costs remained heterogeneous across the largest euro area 
countries. In April, euro area banks™ loan
-deposit margins decreased somewhat for 
new business. Simultaneously, the compression of loan
-deposit margins is ongoing for 
th
e rates on outstanding loans in countries with a high reliance on fixed
-rate contracts, 
indicating a gradual repricing of old loan contracts at new, lower rates. 
The 
compression of loan
-deposit margins as such exerts a dampening impact on bank 
profitabilit
y, which is however compensated by the positive impact of the low or even 
negative interest rate environment on credit quality
 (which reduces provisioning cost
s) and lending volumes
. Overall, euro area banks™ funding 
conditions
 have remained 
favourable, re
flecting t
he ECB™s accommodative monetary policy stance 
and the 
strengthening of bank
s™ balance sheets.
 At the same time, despite banks™ progress in 
consolidati

for instance by

ly low
. In April 
2019 the c
omposite bank lending rate for NFCs
 (see Chart 24)
 declined to 1.62%, 
matching its historical low level of May 2018. More favourable bank funding cos
ts as 
well as continued strong competitive pressures had a dampening impact on NFC bank 
lending rates. In addition, low credit risk for NFCs on aggregate, as indicated by low 
expected default frequencies, also contributed to keeping lending rates at low le
vels. 
The composite bank lending rate for housing loans 
declined to
 1.75% in 
April, 
reaching a new
 historical low 
(see Chart 25). Competitive pressures as well as more 
favourable bank funding costs exerted a dampening impact on lending rates for euro

households have 
fallen
 significantly since the ECB™s credit easing measures were 
announced in June
 2014. 
Between May
 2014 and 
April 
2019 composite lending rates 
on loans to NFCs and ho
useholds fell by 
around 
130 and 115 basis points
, respectively.
 The reduction in bank lending rates for loans to NFCs, as well as for 
loans to small firms (assuming that very small loans of up to •0.25 million are primarily 
granted to small firms), was par
ticularly significant in those euro area countries that 
were 
more affected by
 the financial crisis. This indicates a more uniform transmission 
of monetary policy to bank lending rates across euro area countries and firm sizes.

  35 securities issuance and non
-MFI loans) were hi
gher. This is consistent with favourable 
debt financing conditions and stronger corporate balance sheets. Overall, given the 
typically lagged reaction of NFC external financing to economic activity, the recent 
moderation in NFC external financing is consis
tent with the weakening of economic 
activity in 2018 and the resultant lower financing needs of firms.
 In the first quarter of 2019, 
the net issuance of debt securities by NFCs 
rebounded strongly from the negative level recorded in the last quarter of 2018
. The main driver of the positive net flow of NFC debt securities 
issued 
in the first 
quarter of 2019 is most likely the postponed issuance in the last quarter of 2018 that 
was related to the deterioration in the economic outlook and the increase in the 
spreads of the bonds issued by NFCs, in the context of broader risk aversion in the 
market. The rapid decline of the cost of market
-based debt financing since the end of 
2018 prompted a rebound in NFC net issuance of debt securities. Taking a somewhat 
longer
 perspective, the annual net issuance flows
 for March 2019 were above those in 
December 2018 
Œ which was the lowest reading since May 2016 (see Chart 26) 
Œ and 
in line with a gradual stabilisation that started at the beginning of 2019. 
Market data 
suggest 
that the net issuance of debt securities 
by both investment
-grade and 
high
-yield issuers in April and May 2019 was much more muted than it was in the first 
quarter of 2019. The n
et issuance of listed shares
 continued to weaken in the first 
quarter of 2019,
 reflecting a series of negative net monthly flows that started in 
November 2018.

-2014, when market expectations 
regarding the introduction of the public sector 
purchase programme
 began to emerge
. According to the latest Survey o
n the Access to Finance of Enterprises, SMEs 
in the euro area continued to signal support 
for
 accommodative financing 
conditions while indicating some concerns about past developments in their 
business environment
. Fewer SMEs indicated increases in the ava
ilability of 
external sources of finance, despite 
a positive willingness of banks to extend credit. 
Furthermore, an increasing share of SMEs across most euro area countries perceived 
the macroeconomic outlook as an impediment to their access to external fi
nance. 
Nevertheless, 
as in the previous survey, 
they ranked access to finance as their lowest 
concern, although significant cross
-country differences still exist. The percentage of 
distressed SMEs in the euro area has remained broadly unchanged at around 3
%, far 
from its historical peak of more than 14% in the second half of 2012. On balance, a 
declining but still sizeable share of SMEs reported higher turnover in a context of 
unchanged profits. Competition, difficulties in finding customers as well as grow
ing 
labour and other costs (for material, energy and interest expenses) may have all 
weighed on profits.

 The euro area fiscal stance is projected to continue to be 
mildly expansionar
y, thus 
providing support to economic activity. At t
he same time, countries where government 
debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should 
reinforce 
their efforts
 to achieve a more growth
-friendly composition of public finances. 
Likewise, the transparent and consistent implem
entation of the European Union™s 
fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains 
essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy.
 Following an improvement last year, the euro area general government budget 
defic
it is projected to deteriorate in 2019 and 
remain
 stable in the following 
two 
years.
4 The general government deficit ratio for the euro area 
stood at 0.5% of GDP 
in 2018, compared with 1
.0%
 of GDP in 2017. 
The 
improvement
 in 2018
 was mainly 
the result of 
favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments
. The 
improvement is likely to be reversed this year on account of a significantly lower 
cyclically adjusted primary balance. The higher deficit is also expected to persist over 
the following tw
o years (see Chart 27).
 The outlook for the euro area general government deficit 
ratio has improved 
marginally over the whole projection horizon 
compared 
with the March
 2019 ECB staff projections
. The 
lower
 deficit mainly reflects a smaller deterioration i
n the

 Fiscal developments
  38 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been neutral 
in 2018 but is projected to 
be mildly expansionary
 from 2019 onwards.
5 This 
profile is 
mainly driven by cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions in both 
Germ
any and France but it is also a result of relatively dynamic expenditure growth in 
several other countries.
 The decline in the euro area aggregate public debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
continue at a slower pace.
 According to the 
June
 2019 Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections
, the aggregate general government debt
-to
-GDP ratio in 
the euro area is expected to decline from 8
5.1% of GDP in 201
86 to 
80.6%
 of GDP in 
2021. The projected reduction in 
the 
government debt 
ratio 
is supported by both 
a negative interest rate
-growth rate differential
7 and continued primary surpluses (see 
Chart 
28), although d
eficit
-debt adjustments are expected to offset some of these 
effects. Over the projection horizon, the debt ratio 
is projected to 
fall or 
increase only 
slowly 
in all euro area 
countries 
but 
it 
will continue to far exceed the reference value of 
60% of GDP in a number of countries. Compared with the 
March
 2019 projections
, the 
decline in the aggregate euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio is expected to be 
somewhat 
more pronounced, with the projected ratio for 2021 being revised down by 0.5 
percentage points. This is mainly due to slightly higher primary surplus projections 
coupled with small downward revisions to the deficit
-debt adjustment.

 In 2018 the financial account of the euro area bala
nce of payments recorded net 
outflows of 2.7% of euro area GDP (see Chart A).
 The
 decrease in net financial 
outflows, from 3.4% of GDP in 2017, is in line with the narrowing of the 
euro area 
current account surplus recorded in 2018 and partly reflects 
the
 stepwise reduction in 
the net purchases
 of the 
Eurosystem™s 
asset

APP). The net 
outflows 
continued to be driven by
 portfolio investment 
in 
debt securities as well as

Œ financial derivatives, 
foreign direct investmen
t (FDI) and reserve 
assets. At the same time, the euro area recorded net inflows of portfolio investment in

 Notes
: For assets, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non
-euro ar
ea instruments by euro area investors. For 
liabilities, a positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of euro area instruments by non
-euro area investors. 
The latest 
observation is for the fourth quarter of 2018.
 As regards portfolio investm
ent in the euro area,
 persistent net sales of euro 
area government debt securities by
 non
-residents
 have been another key 
feature of euro area financial flows since the launch of the 
APP
. This mainly 
reflects the important role of 
non-residents 
as counterp
arties to the Eurosystem in 
the 
implement
ation of
 the 
APP.
12 In line with this, non
-resident investors™ net sales of euro 
area government bonds were particularly high in the four quarters up to the first 
quarter of 2017 (Chart C), i.e. in the period when average Eurosystem monthly 
net 
asset purchase
s peaked
 at •80 
billion
. Subsequently, non
-residents™ net sales of 
euro 
area
 government debt
 securities 
gradually declined. In  all likelihood, this fall was 
related
 to the stepwise reduction in the pace of Eurosystem
 net purchases
 until the 
                                                                    12  See the box entitled ﬁ

 The retrenchment in FDI in 2018 
mainly 
reflected transactions vis
-à-vis the 
United States
, linked in part to the US tax reform 
(see Chart 
D). The net 
FDI 
disinvestment 
in the euro area 
by 
US 
residents 
amounted to
 2.3% of 
euro area 
GDP
 in 
2018 and was particularly pronounced in the first 
half of 2018. 
This development is at 
least partly attributable to 
the
 impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act 
passed 
by the US 
Federal Government
 in December 2017
, which led to 
the repatriation of accumulated 
foreign earnings by
 US-based parent companies of
 multinational enterprises
.14 In 
addition, residents of offshore financial centres accounted for net FDI disinvestments 
in the euro area of 1.2% of euro area GDP, possibly also due to the impact of the US 
tax reform via intermediary entities resident in the
se jurisdictions. Moreover, this may 
also reflect changes to international tax policies aimed at addressing
 profit shifting 
practices of multinational enterprises.
 The largest net FDI investments in the euro area 
(0.5% of euro area GDP), on the other hand,
 were made by residents of Switzerland in 
2018. Regarding euro area FDI abroad, euro area residents disinvested mainly from 
the United States (1.5% of euro area GDP) and offshore financial centres (1.1% of 
euro area GDP). T
he aforementioned 
US tax reform m
ay 
also 
have been 
a factor in 
these cases, as multinational enterprises frequently channel their internal financial 
transactions via special purpose entities, some of which are resident in the euro 
area.
15 Moreover, for the first time since 2008, euro area 
residents made FDI 
disinvestments in the United Kingdom (1.1% of GDP) 
in 2018
.                                                                     13  See Cœuré, B., ﬁ

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 30 January to 16 April 
2019  46 2 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from 
30 January to 16 April 2019
 Prepared by 
Iwona Durka and Annette Kamps
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the 
first 
and 
second
 reserve maintenance periods of 201
9, which ran from 
30 January to 12 
March 2019 and from 13 March to 16 April 2019
 respectively.
 Throughout this 
period the interest rates o
n the main refinancing operations (MROs), the marginal 
lending facility and the deposit facility remained unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and 

continued the reinvestment phase of 
its asset purchase programme (APP),
 reinvesting principal payments from maturing 
public sector securities, covered bonds, asset
-backed securities and corporate sector 
securities
. Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as 
the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •1,
496.4
 billion, 
a decrease of •15.1
 billion compared 
with the previous review period (i.e.
 the 
seventh
 and 
eighth 
maintenance 
periods of 2018).
 This slight reduction in liquidity needs 
was largely the result of a 
decrease in net autonomous factors, which declined by 
•16.2
 billion to •1,
368.3
 billion 
during the review period
. The 
decline
 in net autonomous factors was due to 
an increase i
n liquidity
-providing
 factors
, which was stronger th
an the growth in 
liquidity
-absorbing factors
. The most significant contribution to the increase on the 
liquidity
-providing side came from net assets denominated in euro, which grew on 
average by 
•43.2
 billion
 to 
•196.6 billion. This means that net assets d
enominated in 
euro almost fully reversed their decline in the previous review period as a result of the 
seasonal pattern at year
-end, when they decreased by 
•46.7
 billion
. The higher level 
of liquidity
-providing factors was also caused by an increase in th
e value of net foreign 
assets, which grew on average by 
•32.2 billion. 
Among liquidity
-absorbing factors, 
banknotes in circulation, 
government deposits 
and other autonomous factors
 rose 
on average by
 •2.2 billion to •
1,212.2
 billion
, by 
•27.2
 billion to •
263.3
 billion
 and by 
•29.9

 Liquidity provided through t

owing to 
redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Market Programme.
 Redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Market

first
 two 
covered bond purchase programmes totalled •
8.0
 billion.
 Regarding the APP 
portfolios, since 1 January 2019
 the 
programme
 has been in
 the reinvestment phase
. While net asset purchases ha
ve come to an end, 
reinvestments of 
principal payments 
from m
aturing securities purchased under 
the 
APP 
are intended to continue 
for an 
extended period of time past the date when 
the Governing Council
 start
s raising the 
key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain 
favourable liquidity
 conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
 The 
reinvestments adhere to the principle of market neutrality, via smooth and flexible 
implementation
. Limited temporary deviations in the over
all size and composition of 
the 
APP may occur during 
the reinvestment phase for operational reasons.
16 The nominal value of the 
APP portfolio 
remains
 stable 
Œ in the review period it increased by 
only 
•2.1
 billion
 to 
•2,567.9

 on average.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed a
bove, average excess 
liquidity 
increased
 slightly compared with the previous review period, by 
•4.3
 billion to •
1,872.5
 billion (see Chart
 A).
 This 
increase 
reflects 
lower net 
autonomous factors, which were partially offset by slightly lower liquidity prov
ided 
through the Eurosystem™s tender operations and monetary policy portfolios. The APP 
portfolio remained stable as a consequence of the programme having entered the 
reinvestment phase on 1 January. 
Regarding the allocation of excess liquidity holdings 
between current accounts and the deposit facility, average current account holdings 
marginally increased, 
by •

  52 3 Definitions and characteristics of soft patches in the euro 
area
 Prepared by Mattia Duma, Magnus Forsells and Neale Kennedy
 Following 
an 
exceptionally strong 
performance
 in 2017
, growth slowed in 2018, 
raising the 
question
 of whether this 
was
 just a temporary ﬁsoft patchﬂ or 
should 
have been seen as pointing to a more prolonged period of weakness
. The term 
ﬁsoft patchﬂ is used widely in the media and elsewhere to describe a temporary period 
of slower growth during an expansion
ary
 phase characterised by higher trend growth 
rates.
18 However,
 there appears to have been relatively little analysis of suc
h periods
, particularly for the euro area
. The euro area economy has experienced five peaks and troughs since the 
beginning of the 1970s.
19 The concept of a ﬁsoft patchﬂ is only relevant during 
expansions, i.e.
 the periods between troughs and peaks. Chart
 A plots the five 
expansionary periods in the euro area since the beginning of the 1970s, as identified 
by the 
CEPR Euro Area Business Cycle Dating Committee
 (where the trough is 
indexed to 100).
20 It is important to note that the latest expansionary phase, w
hich 
started in the first quarter of 2013, has not as yet come to an end.
21 Looking at these 
expansionary phases, including the current one, it becomes clear that they differ 
substantially in terms of both duration and strength. At the same time, a common 
feature across the various expansionary phases is that they have been characterised 
by relatively low volatility. Despite this, there are short periods within each of these 
expansionary phases when output growth has slowed
 temporarily.
                                                                     18  See

 Note
s: The chart displays the five expansionary periods in the euro area since the beginning of the 1970s (as identified by the CE
PR). 
The lines start with the trough (ind
exed 
to 100) and end with the peak. The latest expansionary phase, which started in 
the first quarter of 
2013, has as yet not come to an end.
 There is no precise definition of a soft patch.
 A soft patch is typically seen as one 
or more quarters of a slowdo
wn in quarterly GDP growth. For the purpose of the 
analysis of this box, it is necessary to come up with a more precise definition. As 
presented in Table
 A, four alternative definitions of a soft patch are considered.
22 These are 
when the GDP growth rate
s during two 
or three consecutive
 quarters 
are
 less than during the quarter t
hat preceded these quarters (Definitions
 1 and 2, 
respectively) or, to avoid that the identification of a soft patch is determined by what 
could be an 
exceptionally strong 
growth r
ate in any one quarter,
 when the GDP growth 
rate
s during 
two or three consecutive quarters are
 less than the average of the two 
quarters t
hat preceded these quarters (Definitions
 3 and 4, respectively).
23 The number of soft patches varies significantly depe
nding on the 
precise 
definition
. Table
 A shows the n
umber of soft patches for every 
euro area 
business 
cycle expansion according to the different definitions
 applied. The figures reported are 
the number of quarters where a soft patch is identified accordin
g to the respective 
definition. 
This method implies that longer soft patch
es are recorded as a number of 
consecutive shorter soft patches (with the number varying depending on the 
definition). An alternative option, which is not considered here, would be t
o count 
consecutive soft patches as a single soft patch. This way of counting would lead to a 
lower number of soft patches for all definitions applied.
24                                                                     22  An exception is Anderson

 and Liu
, Y.
, ﬁOn th
e Road to Recovery, Soft Patches Turn Up Often
ﬂ, 
The 
Regional Economist
, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, January 2012
. The first two definitions of a soft 
patch are in line with this earlier analysis.
 23  An alternative approach, not considered here, 
would be to consider the trend growth rate during the 
expansionary phase, and to look at consecutive quarterly growth rates that were below this trend. One 
disadvantage of this approach relates to the uncertainty surrounding the estimation of trend growth,
 particularly towards the end of the sample period.
 24  In order to make the identification of soft patches more robust and less sensitive to marginal differences, 
the computations are conducted on data rounded to one decimal
 place

 Note: The first expansionary phase (Q2 1970 
Œ Q3 1974) is incomplete due to data unavailability.
 Soft patches during the expansionary phase of the business cycle are quite 
common
 and are not a reliable leading indicator of recessions.
 Chart
 B illustrates 
this by showing the level of euro area output alongside soft patches (according to 
Definition
 3) and recession periods. 
This finding, which also holds true for the United 
States, 
suggests that it is not straightforward to draw any strong conclusions with 
regard to an imminent turning point. Although the analysis here
 identifie
s several 
soft 
patches that closely preceded a 
recession, many 
soft patches
 took place without the 
economy 
entering a recession in the following year

own of GDP, all expenditure components tended in the past to contribute to soft 
patches. However, investment and private consumption have been the major contributors.

significant changes in the assessment of the current cyclical position of the economy.

 Confidence and investment
  57 4 Confidence and investment
 Prepared by Ma
lin Andersson
 and 
Benjamin Mosk
 Economic agents™ confidence and 
developments in the
 real economy
 are 
intrinsically 
linked.
26 Periods of high confidence could, per se, spur activity, while 
currently lower confidence 
could reinforce the magnitude and persistence
 of the 
ongoing economic slowdown in the euro area
. In terms of the expenditure components 
of GDP, business investment is particularly affected by changes in confidence and 
uncertainty
, as firms may postpone their investment plans and choose to ﬁwait and 
seeﬂ in times of high uncertainty
.27 This 
box looks at the potential 
propagation effects 
of lower confidence
 on investment in recent times.
 Following an extended period of improving sentiment, e
conomic confidence in 
the euro area has worsened since 
the 
end
 of 2017. The deterioration in
 sentiment 
is not just 
a result of expectations of weaker economic fundamentals
, but also 
reflects 
heightened uncertainty related to geopolitical factors, the threat of 
an escalation of 
protectionism, Brexit and vulnerabilities 
in emerging markets, including China. 
Confidence is illustrated
, inter alia,
 by indicators such as the 
European Commission™s 
Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI). The ESI is a composite indicator 
measuring 
confidence in 
the industrial, services, construction
 and retail trade sectors
, and among 
consumers
.28 Since the end of 2017
 the ESI has 
declined
 significantly in the larger 
euro area countries and in the euro area as a whole
, although it remains above its 
long
-term average value of 100 (
see 
Chart
 A). The dec
line in confidence in the euro 
area is common across sectors (see Chart B).
                                                                     26  See, for example, ﬁ
Confidence indicators and economic developments
ﬂ, Monthly Bulletin

 27  To 
simplify, e
conomic 
ﬁconfidence
ﬂ captures expectations about the outlook (first moment) and economic 
ﬁuncertainty
ﬂ refers to the variance or dispersion of such expectations (second moment).
 28  The indicator is constructed to have a long
-term mean of 100 and
 a standard deviation of 10, such that 
values greater than 100 indicate an above
-average economic sentiment

 Confidence and investment
  59 can be used to assess macroeconomic developments
.29 As an illustration, confidence 
may decline during a sharp economic downturn, but this may still correspond to a 
positive confidence shock if the 
underlying economic conditions justify an even lower 
confidence level. Such confidence shocks might be instrumental in supporting expert 
judgement in order to complement model
-based projections.
 Model evidence suggests that confidence
 shocks
 have had an overall positive 
impact on investment growth 
in the past two years and a negative impact in 
2019. The New Multi
-Country Model (NMCM),
30 the ECB™s main model for 
macroeconomic projections,
31 does not explicitly feature confidence but 
can be 
augmen
ted with a mechanism to quantify the impact of structural confidence shocks. 
Confidence is introduced in the model in two steps. First, confidence shocks are 
identified using a structural vector autoregression model that includes the variables of 
the NMCM™
s investment equation.
32 In the second step, those confidence shocks are 
introduced in 
the NMCM
. The model residuals for the investment equation, which 
capture the difference between the model™s output and economic 
outcomes
, can 
partially be explained by th
e confidence shocks.
33, 34 Based on these 
empirical 
results
, the model 
is used to decompose historical investment growth into a 
confidence factor and other factors
, which shows 
that investment growth was
, overall, 
significantly and 
positively impacted by confidence 
in 2017 and 2018 (see 
Chart 
C). 
This analysis can be extended to the forecast after making assumptions about future 
confidence indicators and interpreting the Eurosystem staff forecast data through the 
lens of the NMCM.
35 Assuming that the euro area ESI remains at its May 2019 level
, 
model simulations point towards 
a negative 
but modest 
contribution
 of confidence
 to
 investment growth in
 2019, partially counteracting factors that support the euro area 
expansion, such as 
favou
rable financing conditions, further employment gains and 
rising wages, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ expansion in global activity.
 To conclude, the quantitative exercise shows that confidence shocks could have a 
sizeable impact on investment.

 32  Confidence shocks are identified us
ing a Cholesky scheme, where the euro area ESI is last in the 
Cholesky ordering. This reflects the conceptual assumption that confidence reacts contemporaneously 
(within a quarter) to developments of other economic 
statistics, 
while
 confidence shocks
 do
 no
t contemporaneously affect other variables (e.g. user cost of capital).
 33  A linear regression of the residuals of the investment equation from the NMCM on lagged structural 
confidence shocks yields statistically significant coefficients, whereby statistic
al measures indicate 
significant explanatory power for the structural confidence shocks.
 34  In comparison, p
rivate consumption and employment 
residuals 
show a much weaker relationship to 
confidence. For the purposes here, only the investment equation is au
gmented to react to confidence 
shocks, and private consumption and employment are only affected indirectly through spillovers.

data are inverted using t
he NMCM to obtain a model

 Rent inflation in the euro area since the crisis
  61 5 Rent inflation in the euro area since the crisis
 Prepared by Moreno Roma
 Rent infl
ation has recently strengthened, rather than mitigated, the still 
relatively subdued developments in services and underlying inflation in the 
euro area.
 Having been hovering around 1¼% since January 2018, rent inflation has, 
on balance, stayed below the in
flation rate for 
services as a whole (see Chart 
A). While 
this was the case for most of the pre
-crisis period
36, it appears more striking now, as 
rent inflation is typically considered to be a more resilient inflation component that is 
relatively higher in 
periods when other components of HICP inflation tend to be low. 
These developments are also interesting in the context of public debates, in many 
euro area countries, about strong rent increases, and against the background of the 
sustained increases in eur
o area house prices over recent years. This box puts recent 
developments in euro area rent inflation into perspective. As housing and rental 
markets have remained heterogeneous, this box also looks at developments across 
euro area countries.
 Chart A
 Euro a
rea HICP excluding energy and food, services and rent
 (year
-on-year percentage changes)
  Source: Eurostat.
 Notes: The latest observations are for the first quarter of 2019. Annual inflation rates for services in 2015 are distorted u
pwards owing to 
the int
roduction, since January 2019, of a new methodology for calculating the German package holiday price index.
 In the post
-crisis period, rent inflation and its contribution to euro area services 
inflation have been declining.
 Annual changes in the rent compo
nent of the euro 
area HICP were, on average, 1.8% in the pre
-crisis period but have fallen to 1.4% in 
the post
-crisis period (see Chart B, panel a). The low rent inflation has been 
associated with a progressive decline in the contribution of rent to HICP s
ervices in the 
euro area. This contribution declined by one
-third between the pre
- and post
-crisis 
periods (see Chart B, panel b). The pattern was shared by all large euro area countries 
with the exception of Germany, where the contribution of rent to HICP
 services 
increased post
-crisis. However, developments in individual episodes can reflect 
                                                                    36  We use the term ﬁpre
-crisis periodﬂ to refer to the period between January 1999 and December 2007, and 
the term ﬁpost

-specific factors. For instance, in France, the negative contribution of rent to 
HICP services since January 2018 is accounted for by rent cuts for social hous
ing 
implemented in the course of 2018.
37 In Germany, the relatively low rent inflation in 
recent years may partly reflect the higher weight of private households as landlords in 
the statistical sample since 2015, given that private landlords tended to raise
 their rent 
less than, for instance, local authorities, housing associations and private 
companies.

 Note: The latest observations are for April 2019 for all variables, with the exception of house prices, for which the latest 
observation is for

 The decline observed in the contribution of rent to HICP services inflation 
was 
mainly driven by the fall in rent inflation.
 The contribution of rent to HICP services 
inflation is affected not only by the level of rent inflation but also by the weight of rent in 
HICP services, which varies widely across euro area countries (see Ch
art C, panel a). 
Of the five largest euro area countries, in Germany and the Netherlands rent has a 
greater weight than the euro area average, while in Spain and Italy it has a lower 
weight. This reflects, inter alia, the respective degree of owner
-occupie
rs versus 
tenants across countries (see Chart C, panel b), as owner
-occupied housing is 
excluded from the HICP
39. At the euro area level, the weight of rent in HICP services 
has stood at 14.5% since January 2018, slightly down from an average of 15.1% for 
the period starting in 1999. This implies that changes over time in the weight of euro 
                                                                    37  The rent cuts in social housing took place in June 2018 and amounted to •800 million. 
They coincided
 with a reduction in housing allowances to tenants
. The share of rents at reduced prices or free in France 
in 2017 stood at 16.4%,
 above the euro area average of 10.3% (see Chart C, panel b).

 Strong house price developments are not necessarily associated with high rent 
inflation.
 There is generally a limited link between the two indicators
40, and this was 
observed also in the most recent period of subdued rent inflation associated with 
house price inflation exceeding 4% (see Chart B, panel a). When considering 
residential property as an asset, higher house prices should be the result, ceteris
 paribus, of a higher discounted value of future rent flows (viewed as a proxy of the 
corresponding dividends). However, several factors may explain a limited 
pass
-through between house prices and rents, including rent regulation, fiscal policy 
measures re

 Rent inflation in the euro area since the crisis
  64 these factors may weaken the theoretical long
-term relationship between house prices 
and rents.
 Several factors can affect rent formation, including maintenance costs, 
mortgage rate
s and demand conditions.
 First, the costs that owners incur for the 
maintenance and repair of dwellings can normally be expected to be partially or fully 
passed on to tenants via higher rents. In practice, in most of the five largest euro area 
countries, r
ent inflation in the post
-crisis period has been below the inflation rate in 
ﬁmaintenance and repair of the dwellingﬂ
41, suggesting only a partial recuperation of 
maintenance costs by owners. Second, mortgage rates also affect rent formation: if a 
buy-to
-let purchase is financed by a mortgage, the higher the financing costs the 
higher the rent the owner will demand from the tenant. In this respect, lower financing 
costs in the post
-crisis and most recent periods partly explain subdued rent 
developments. At t
he same time, the prevailing low
-yield environment has made a 
given rental yield comparatively more attractive (even in cases of limited rent 
increases) vis
-à-vis alternative investments in the equity or bond market.
42 In addition, 
housing demand should, in
 principle, also be a factor affecting rent formation, 
especially in certain jurisdictions or in urban areas, where supply can be constrained. 
Higher housing demand could allow owners to increase rents and mitigate some of the 
risks related to the fact tha
t the property may become vacant, should the tenant move 
out after a rent increase. However, there are a number of institutional features in rental 
markets that can prevent rents from responding freely to cost and demand conditions.
 Indexation may impose l
imits for the evolution of rents.
 Some form of indexation 
prevails in many euro area countries. Among the largest, in Spain rent increases are 
Œ at least for an initial period 
Œ generally capped by the rate of increase in the consumer 
price index (CPI). In
 France and Italy, rent increases cannot usually exceed, 
respectively, a rent reference index published quarterly by the Institut national de la 
statistique et des études économiques and based on the CPI excluding tobacco and 
rent, and a consumer price ind
ex for employees™ households. In the Netherlands, the 
maximum yearly rent increase is based, inter alia, on the inflation rate and the income 
situation of households. In Germany, some rental contracts are indexed to the German 
CPI, others 
Œ ﬁstep
-upﬂ renta
l contracts 
Œ set out the increases applicable during the 
life of the contract, while a majority of contracts contain no explicit provision for rent 
increases. In the case of the latter, the rent can be increased, for instance, when the 
dwelling is moderni
sed
43 or when the rent is below the local average rent for 
comparable properties. In general, private owners often refrain from raising the rent to 
minimise the risk of the dwelling standing vacant if the tenant moves out
44. All in all, 
some form of contract
ual indexation to the rate of inflation and a low turnover in rental 
contracts are important factors preventing rents from increasing freely.
                                                                     41  ﬁMaintenance and repair of the

 43  Such nominal rent increases due to building modernisation may, however, not show in the official statistics to the extent tha

 Rent inflation in the euro area since the crisis
  65 Relatively subdued rent inflation in the euro area is mainly due to low inflation 
and a limited turnover in rental
 contracts.
 These factors explain the fairly moderate 
contribution of rent to services and to underlying inflation in the euro area, and the 
apparent disconnect between rents and house price developments. Should these 
factors persist, rent inflation will l
ikely continue to make a relatively moderate 
contribution to services and underlying inflation.

 1 The euro area labour market through the lens of the 
Beveridge curve
 Prepared by Agostino Consolo and António Dias da Silva
 In this article we look at
 the euro area labour market using the framework underlying 
the Beveridge curve, which captures 
the
 negative relationship between the 
unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate. The Beveridge curve shows that
, at a 
given moment in time
, there are jobs vacant and people unemployed, while the shape 
and the position of the curve provide important information about the functioning of the 
labour
 market
. There are two key concepts associated with the Beveridge curve: 
labour market tightness an
d matching efficiency. Labour market tightness is the 
number of vacant posts per each unemployed person and matching efficiency reflects 
the market™s ability to match individuals to jobs. We analyse the importance of these 
two concepts for wage development
s using a simple version of the search and 
matching model
, where unemployment, wages and vacancies are jointly determined 
and the Beveridge curve features prominently.
45 First, we derive two aggregate 
measures that 
encapsulate
 the changes in the vacancy
 -unemployment space: labour 
market tightness and matching efficiency. Second, we look at the information content 
behind market tightness and job matching efficiency to analyse the euro area labour 
market and its cyclical conditions. Third, aggregate measures 
of labour market 
tightness and efficiency are used in a standard wage Phillips curve equation to 
measure their marginal impact. The results support the view that labour market 
tightness and labour market efficiency 
both 
play a role in explaining wage 
devel
opments. However, the quantitative implications for wages differ only marginally 
from those of the standard Phillips curve approach. Overall, labour market efficiency 
provides an important qualitative margin of labour market functioning that is not 
capture
d in standard wage Phillips curve specifications.
 1 Introduction
 The Beveridge curve captures the relationship between the unemployment rate 
and the job vacancy rate.
 The underlying intuition behind the negatively sloped 
curve is that as vacancies (vacant 
job positions) increase, the number of people 
unemployed decreases. Figure 1 illustrate
s the main concepts associated with the 
Beveridge curve. Movements in the vacancy
-unemployment space are usually related 
to labour market tightness and labour market eff
iciency. Labour market tightness, 
, is 
defined as the ratio of vacancies to unemployment and captures movements along the 
                                                                    45  A simple description of this framework i

46, 
, relates to the number of people that find jobs given a 
certain level of the vacancy
-unemployment ra
tio.
 In this context, labour market 
efficiency is not directly observable and has to be estimated (see Section 3).

 Notes: This figure provides a visual exampl
e of movements along, and side
-to-side shifts of, the Beveridge curve. The example in the 
right
-hand panel also 
includes
 a change in market tightness, which is not described here for simplicity.
 Movements along the 
Beveridge 
curve are usually associated wi
th changes in 
market tightness
, as measured by the vacancy
-unemployment ratio.
 For 
instance, during an economic recession the vacancy rate decreases because firms 
post fewer job openings, which
, in turn,
 is associated with higher unemployment rates. 
In Fig
ure 1.a this is represented by a movement from 
 to
  along the curve, 
which 
reflect
s a decrease in market tightness. Following the work by Blanchard and 
Diamond
47, movements along the Beveridge curve, 
, as depicted in Figure 1.a 
have usually been i
nterpreted as business cycle fluctuations.
 Shifts of the Beveridge curve are related to labour market efficiency.
 Figure
 1.b 
shows an outward shift of the Beveridge curve, 
. This reflects a situation in which 
number of vacancies remains the same but th
e unemployment rate is higher. The 
Beveridge curves, 
 and , reflect two labour market situations in which the 
efficiency of the job matching process 
Œ allocating unemployed workers to job 
openings 
Œ differs. Therefore, the further away the Beveridge curve from the origin, the 
lower the labour market efficiency. T
he efficiency of the matching process, and thus 
the position of the Beveridge curve in relation to the origin, depend
s on a number of 
factors. For instance, an increase in the share of long
-term unemployment has been 
found to lower the search effort and re
duce the propensity of employers to fill their 
                                                                    46  In this article two concepts of efficiency will be used, almost interchangeably. Matching efficiency is 
strictly 
related to the efficiency of the matching process (derived from the matching function 
Œ see Section 
3 and Box 2). Labour market efficiency is a broader concept that includes matching efficiency and relates 
to side
-to-side shifts of the Beveridge curve.

  68 vacancies.
48 Another factor that can reduce efficiency is the geographical dispersion 
of unemployment and vacancies as result of idiosyncratic shocks within local labour 
markets.
 A comprehensive analysis of the
 cyclical changes in the vacancy
 -unemployment space hinges on both labour market tightness and labour 
market efficiency.
 A common interpretation 
is that 
structural changes in the labour 
market 
are responsible for 
inward or outward shifts of the Beveridge 
curve. However, 
this interpretation may not always be accurate. First, it is normal for there to be an 
outward shift of the curve at the beginning of periods of recovery as the process of 
posting vacancies is faster than that of matching unemployed workers
 to jobs. 
Second, as pointed out by Elsby et al.
49, the distinction between business cycle shifts 
and structural shifts is only relevant for constant job separation rates, which is not the 
case for euro area data. Additionally, Barnichon and Figura
50 
in et al.
51 provide theoretical and empirical evidence on the cyclicality of matching efficiency. In 
this article we take a broader view and do not rule out that efficiency may also have 
cyclical features.
 The job finding rate can be described by a quantita
tive margin (tightness) and a 
qualitative margin (efficiency).
 The matching function is an important concept in 
search and matching models
52 that determines the flow from unemployment to 
employment, i.e. the job finding rate.
53 The job finding rate is relate
d to a quantitative 
margin and a qualitative margin. The quantitative margin is the level of market 
tightness (vacancy
 -unemployment ratio), while the qualitative margin is related to the 
efficiency of the matching process
54. For example, two labour markets
 with the same 
level of tightness may have different hiring rates 
owing to 
differences in the efficiency 
of the matching process (see also Figure 1.b).
 The empirical information from the Beveridge curve complements standard 
measures of labour market slack 
based on the Phillips curve.
 The unemployment 
gap and the vacancy
-unemployment ratio both tend to capture cyclical conditions in 
the labour market from a quantitative perspective by balancing out the effects of labour 
demand and supply. A measure of labour
 market efficiency extracted from the 
Beveridge curve analysis adds a qualitative margin to the labour market analysis. It 
provides an additional margin to describe how the labour market is functioning for any 
                                                                    48  Bova, E., Jalles

  69 given amount of slack and is consistent with t
he recent work by Crump et al. that 
compares both approaches
55. 2 A look into the data
 One of the major challenges in analysing the euro area Beveridge curve is the 
quality of the data
. Vacancy data series are relatively short and there is significant 
cross
 -country heterogeneity in the coverage of vacancies within small firms.
56 Moreover, if not corrected, statistical and measurement breaks in the series 
of some 
countries could lead to spurious conclusions. To this end, the job vacancy rates 
depicted here ha
ve been corrected for breaks in the job vacancy statistics using 
information provided by Eurostat.
57 As the heterogeneity across countries and the 
breaks in the time series could affect the euro area Beveridge curve, we re
 -compute 
the aggregated euro area 
job vacancy rate by aggregating the rates of the five largest 
euro area countries (EA
-5) adjusted for breaks and scale.
58 The derived EA
 -5 Beveridge curve is displayed in Chart 
1.59 Correcting breaks helps to ensure that the 
conclusions drawn are based on m
ovements in vacancies and not on changes in the 
measurement of vacancies or other statistical issues.
 A look at the Beveridge curve aggregated over the five largest euro area 
countries shows a significant outward shift during the crisis.
 As mentioned 
earli
er, distinguishing between cyclical and structural shifts of the Beveridge curve is 
not straightforward, especially as some cyclical episodes, such as an increase in job 
separation, can shift the Beveridge curve to the right. Therefore, this section provid
es 
a factual description of the Beveridge curve without characterising the nature of 
apparent shifts. The Beveridge curves in Chart 
1 are robust for use as an indicator of 
labour market shortages as an alternative measure to job vacancies. In fact, the 
sur
vey indicator ﬁlabour as a factor limiting productionﬂ gives scatterplots with similar 
shapes to those using job vacancy rates like in Chart 
1. This occurs across countries 
and at the aggregate euro area level.
60 The same Beveridge curve patterns are also 
                                                                    55  See Cru

Brookings Papers on Economic Activity
, BPEA conf
erence drafts, 2019.
 56  The short length of the job vacancy rate series in the euro area means that a longer
-term 
Beveridge 
curve, such as that for the US labour market in Box 1, cannot be produced.
 57  Eurostat provides information and the dates on which national statistics offices changed their statistical 
methodology for measuring vacancies.
 58  The job vacancy rates
 adjusted for statistical breaks were standardised by their respective historical 
average and standard deviation. The aggregation of the country series is weighted by the share of GDP. 
As a robustness check, the share of the labour force has also been cons
idered, but it had no impact on 
the overall results of the EA
-5 Beveridge curve.

mainly 
focus
 on the 
five 
largest euro area countries

 illustrate 
some relevant heterogeneity

 The euro area labour market through the lens of the Beveridge curve
  70 observed if a broader measure of unemployment, such as the U6,
61 or long
-term 
unemployment are used instead of the unemployment rate.
 The aggregated Beveridge curve is a combination of different country
-specific 
dynamics.
 Outward shifts of the curve 
are
 more pronounced in France, Italy and 
Spain, although Spain features a quicker inward movement after a very significant 
outward shift. In these cases, it could also be the case that there is simply a medium
 -term loop around the Beveridge curve. However, i
n the case of Italy and France the 
curve has steepened significantly since 2016, indicating that more and more 
vacancies are needed for a small decrease in unemployment to occur. By contrast, in 
Germany the Beveridge curve was very flat between 2005 and 20
13 and has since 
steepened. It is not clear if the Beveridge curve for Germany has shifted inward. The 
Beveridge curve for the Netherlands shows a typical anticlockwise movement 
characterised by an increase in vacancies that is faster than the decrease in 
the 
unemployment rate during the recovery phase.
 The Beveridge curve 
for
 the United States has not shown large outward shifts 
such as those in the euro area.
 
62 analysed the behaviour of the 
US Beveridge curve since the 1950s and concluded that shifts in the Beveridge curve 
are common occurrences (see also Box 1). According to the data, the outward shift 
of the US Beveridge curve occurred towards the end of 2009 
and since then there has 
been a steady improvement in labour market efficiency and reduced elasticity 
(flattening of the Beveridge curve) between unemployment and vacancies.
 The main cause of t
he outward shift of the 
euro area 
Beveridge curve 
appears 
to be
 a decrease in the job finding rate.
 During the crisis the job separation rate 
increased and the job finding rate decreased. However, 
when 
the Beveridge curve 
shifted 
in 2011, the dec
rease
 in the job finding rate was more pronounced than the 
increase in th
e separation rate
 (see Chart 2), thus
 largely contributing to the outward 
shift 
of the Beveridge curve.
63 The weakness in the finding rate can be explained by 
lower matching efficiency (see Section 3). Overall, the analysis of job flows shows that 
inward or
 outward shift
s of the Beveridge curve can have a business cycle component, 
as described in Elsby et al.
64                                                                     61  The U6 is a br

-49. Flows t
o and from inactivity are assumed constant. The latest observations 
are for the third quarter of 2018. Eurostat has published data on flows since the second quarter of 2010 (data are available 
for the five the 
largest euro area countries except Germany). T
he analysis of these data shows that there have not been significant changes in the flows 
from unemployment to inactivity, while flows from inactivity to unemployment increased in Italy and France, but decreased in 
Spain
. Job vacancy rates are at a very 
high level, while the finding rate is yet to reach 
previous peaks and unemployment remains above previous lows.
 This suggests 
both increased tightness and lower efficiency in the labour market. Labour market 
tightness at the aggregate euro area level is su
bstantially higher than before the crisis, 
but there is large heterogeneity across countries (Chart 3). In Germany, the 
vacancy
-unemployment ratio has quadrupled since 2006 and is the major determinant 
of the labour market tightness observed at the aggrega
te euro area level. In addition, 
in France labour market tightness is 
higher
 than before the crisis and has increased 
rapidly in the last two years. On the contrary, in Spain and Italy labour market tightness 
is significantly below previous peaks. At the a
ggregate euro 
area 
level, labour market 
tightness has been above pre
-crisis levels since the third quarter of 2017. Meanwhile,

 The vacancy

capture cyclical conditions in the labour market 
from a quantitative perspective 
by 
balancing out the effects of labour demand and supply. This measure is similar to other 
common
ly used measures of the unemployment gap derived using the Phillips curve 
framework (see Chart 4 for a comparison). In the wage Phillips curve, the derived 
non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU) is assumed to 
implicitly 
embed labour market mism
atch. The information content extracted from the analysis 
of the Beveridge curve, on the other hand, can disentangle labour market tightness 
from efficiency. In doing so, job matching efficiency complements labour market 
tightness with a qualitative margin
 (see Section 3) and thus may provide richer 
information on the dynamics of wages.

. Box 
1  The Beveridge curve for the US labour market
 Prepared by Ramon Gomez Salvador
 This box looks at unemp
loyment rate developments in the United States from the perspective 
of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the vacancy rate, which is 
represented by the Beveridge curve.
 The unemployment
-vacancy relationship appears to be an 
informative tool
, given that it can give a broad indication of whether changes in the unemployment 
rate are caused 
solely
 by cyclical developments in economic activity or by more permanent or 
structural factors.
 Developments in the US Beveridge curve since the 1970s point
 to efficiency gains as the 
dominant factor in the unemployment
-vacancy relationship.
 Past developments in the US 
Beveridge curve illustrate the presence of both activity shocks and structural shocks (see Chart A). 
Anticlockwise loops reflecting activity s
hocks can be clearly identified starting (following the 
recessions) in 1973, 1981, 1990 and 2008, with much shorter ones in 1980 and 2001. In all cases, the 
vacancy rate followed a downward pattern in the recessionary part of the cycle, while the 
unemploym
ent rate grew, with the reverse occurring in the expansionary phase. However, it is worth 
noting that, together with activity shocks, shifts in the unemployment
-vacancy relationship have taken 
place since the 1970s. In particular, an initial outward shift 
between 1973 and 1980 was more than 
compensated for by an inward shift between the 1980s and the 2000s, which points to the dominant 
role of positive structural shocks in the US labour market, 
i.e. 
shocks leading to an increase in the 
effectiveness of the 
job matching process.

 -178. The latest observation is 
for December 2018.
 Developments since the global financial crisis point primarily to cyclical shocks. A very deep 
recession brought the unemployment rate to levels not seen since the early 1980s and th
e vacancy rate to historical lows.
 This was followed by a particularly long and slow expansion in 
historical terms
. F
rom the labour market perspective 
this 
implied less
-smooth changes in both the 
unemployment rate and the vacancy rate compared with previou
s cycles, 
although
 the 
unemployment rate still reached record lows at the end of 2018 and the vacancy rate was close to 
historical highs. There has been some discussion as to whether the Beveridge curve has shifted 
slightly in the current business cycle, p
articularly at the early stages of the recovery, but there is a 
broad consensus that some friction in the matching process after recessions is visible in most 
recovery phases without implying a sustained rise in structural unemployment.
65 Indeed, most 
estimates point to a decline in structural unemployment in the United States over the last few years.
66 3 Measuring labour market efficiency
 In this section we derive measures of labour market efficiency for the euro area 
to further the analys
is of the labour market and wage dynamics.
 As discussed in 
the previous sections, the Beveridge curve framework requires labour market 
tightness to be complemented with a measure of efficiency to provide a more 
comprehensive picture of the euro area labour
 market. In this section the assessment 
of the cyclical position of the labour market will therefore require information derived 
from labour market tightness and labour market efficiency. These two measures are 
                                                                    65  For a discussion on the interpretation of outward shifts

s The euro area labour market through the lens of the Beveridge curve
  76 important for assessing the overall strength 
of the labour market and for 
understanding how they jointly affect wage developments.
 Two empirical measures of labour market efficiency can be derived from the 
Beveridge curve and the job finding rate.
 In the simple theoretical framework 
presented in Box 
2, the matching efficiency affecting the job finding rate is the only 
underlying factor generating a shift of the Beveridge curve. In practice, the Beveridge 
curve may also shift for reasons other than matching efficiency. Therefore, measures 
of efficiency
 based on the Beveridge curve and
 measures of efficiency based on
 the 
finding rate (matching function) may ultimately differ. Comparing these two 
approaches helps 
to 
increase the robustness of the exercise. This empirical exercise 
comes with a number of ca
veats as data on vacancies and job flows have a relatively 
short time span and, in the context of the euro area, there are no micro data available 

67). Nevertheless, 
this is a useful exerc
ise as it may provide a more comprehensive view of labour market 
adjustment 
in the euro area 
and highlight new implications for euro area wage 
dynamics.
 A first measure of matching efficiency can be derived by recalling the aggregate 
matching function and 
using the job finding rate.
 Following the
 work of Petrongolo 
and Pissarides
68, the matching function is specified as a constant returns to scale 
Cobb
-Douglas function of the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate.
 The 
aggregate matching function can be esti
mated by looking at the quarterly job finding 
probabilities (
) and the vacancy
-unemployment ratio (market tightness).
69 The 
outflows from unemployment (
) are measured following Shimer
70, while market 
tightness is derived using the break
-adjus
ted vacancy rate
.71 The matching efficiency 
() is therefore defined as the residual from estimating a reduced
-form matching 
function
72 =++    (1) where the vacancy
-unemployment ratio is usually defined as labour market tightne
ss, 
(). An alternative measure of job matching efficiency can be derived by estimating 
the elasticity between vacancies and unemployment.
 Such a measure directly 
reflects the shifts in the Beveridge curve while also accounting for the negative 
relationsh
ip implied by the vacancy to unemployment ratio (i.e. market tightness), 
specified as follows:
                                                                     67

 71  In the same way as for the vacancy rate, job vacancies have also been adjusted following the description 
of structural breaks related to statistical changes in the measurement of
 job vacancies
 provided by 
Eurostat.
 72  The estimation has been performed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalised method of 
moments (GMM) methods on the logs of the Cobb
-Douglas matching function. For the GMM method, 
lags of the vacancy and 
unemployment rate have been used as instruments.

  77 =++    (2) Empirically, such a crude measure of labour market efficiency features both an 
outward shift and a steepening of the slope. As sho
wn in Chart 
1, the 
euro area 
Beveridge curve has also become steeper following the post
-2011 outward shift.
73 The derived residual after estimating a constrained regression
74 between the vacancy 
rate and the unemployment rate provides a time series for labou
r market efficiency 
which can proxy the side
-shifts of the Beveridge curve between the second quarter of 
2004 and the first quarter of 2018.
 According to these measures, matching efficiency deteriorated during the 
crisis (see Chart 5).
 These two efficiency
 measures are closely related but they do 
display some differences. The matching efficiency derived from the Beveridge curve 
(equation 2) tends to be more comprehensive than that derived using the matching 
function (equation 1). While the method based on t
he matching function directly 
captures the matching process, the Beveridge curve efficiency measure also captures 
the dynamics of job separations as well as potential labour force movements from 
inactivity to the labour market. Overall, the correlation bet
ween these two measures is 
relatively high and the information content is consistent. These two measures indicate 
that labour market efficiency has not fully recovered compared with pre
-crisis times. 
According to the search and matching model sketched in B
ox 2, the information on the 
functioning of the labour market (efficiency) complements the purely quantitative 
indicator of labour market tightness. In the pre
-2008 period matching efficiency and 
tightness were positively correlated (see Chart 5), a situat
ion which, all other things 
being equal, can lead to higher wages. By contrast, more recently efficiency and 
tightness have been moving in opposite directions, leading to counterbalancing effects 
on wages.
                                                                     73  Such an equation is also estimated by imposing a coefficient 
restriction 
which finds the average of the 
slope of the Beveridge curve before and after 2011.
 74  For robustness, the average elasticity 
between vacancies and unemployment before and after 2011 is 
used. The derived matching efficiency measure is on the whole robust to statistically small changes.

  Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: Measures of labour market efficiency are based on equations 
(1) and (2) respectively. Labour market tightness is the ratio of the 
GDP
-weighted aggregate vacancies for the five largest euro area countries to the respective seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
. Vacancies are break
-adjusted and standardised by their 
country
-specific mean and standard deviation.
 The heterogeneity of the unemployment pool and the dispersion of 
unemployment across countries may have had a negative impact on matching 
efficiency.
 During the crisis the unemployment pool became more heteroge
neous. 
The unemployment rate of low
-skilled workers also grew significantly and still remains 
far above the unemployment rate of medium and high
-skilled workers (see panel (a) 
of Chart 6). This type of imbalance between skill supply and skill demand causes
 the 
unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate to rise simultaneously, shifting the 
Beveridge curve to the right. At the same time, the dispersion of the unemployment 
rate increased across countries (see panel (b) 
of Chart 6). The geographical 
dispersion 
in unemployment and vacancies has led to a situation in which there is a 
high number of vacancies in some local labour markets at the same time as high 
unemployment in other labour market segments, which reduces the response of 
unemployment to vacancies. B

 The euro area labour market through the lens of the Beveridge curve
  80 rate, a vacancy rate and a real wage that are mutually consistent. In fact, an analysis of the Beveridge 
space (the vacancy
-unemployment diagram) in itself does not provide enough information to pin 
down the dy
namics of wages, productivity and labour demand and has to be enriched with (i) a firm 
job creation condition and (ii) a wage setting mechanism. We therefore follow a simpler version of the 
model developed by Mortensen and Pissarides
77 to provide a coherent
 narrative of the fluctuations in 
unemployment, vacancies and wages.
78 This framework offers a simple yet coherent tool to analyse possible movements in the 
Beveridge space.
 Changes in the Beveridge space can 
reflect
 movements in market tightness 
and shifts
 in job matching efficiency. Market tightness movements are characterised by a negative 
relationship between vacancies and unemployment, and shifts in job market efficiency by a positive 
relationship. 
Both m
arket tightness and matching efficiency can play 
an important role in the 
determination of wages. The framework introduced in this box can account for the driving forces 
behind changes in the Beveridge curve and can also be helpful in rationalising the effects on wages.
79 Equilibrium conditions from a sea
rch and matching model
 A simple description of the search and matching model with constant (exogenous) job destruction 
rates 
Œ following Pissarides
80 Œ can be summarised by three equilibrium conditions for the main 
variables of interest: unemployment rate, 
, vacancy rate, 
, and real wages, 
: ():      =+
(,) ():       =(+)(,) ():       =(1)+(1+) with exogenous destruction rates, 
, search costs, 
, bargaining power of the worker, 
, 
unemployment benefits, 
, productivity, 
, and the discount rate, 
. The variable 
=/ is usually 
defined as market tightness as it reflects the relative strength between labour demand and labour 
supply factors, which are proxied by the number of vacancies and the number of
 people searching for 
a job, respectively. 
The function 
() is a transformation of the matching function.
81 The first equation (
) is the Beveridge curve, which describes the relationship between the 
vacancy rate and the unemployment rate and is deriv
ed from a steady
-state condition on job 
flows in and out of the unemployment pool.
82 The second equation (
) refers to the job creation 
condition based on the assumption that firms will keep posting vacancies as long as the marginal job 
has a non
-negativ

. These three equations jointly provide a simple yet consistent framework 
for analysing the dynamic
s of the Beveridge curve and wages. As these equations show, all three 
theoretical relationships are needed and it is not possible to consider the implications for wages using 
the Beveridge space alone. Figure A.1 shows the 
 space and the equilibrium 
arising from the 
intersection between the job creation condition, 
, and the Nash wage equation, 
, point A. 
Figure A.2 shows the 
 space and the equilibrium arising from the intersection between the 
Beveridge curve 
 and market tightness line

 is derived from Figure A.1.
 The model can account for the following possible exogenous drivers of labour market fluctuations: (i) 
productivity, (ii) job matching efficiency, (iii) worker™s outside option and bargaining power, and (iv)
 job
-posting search costs.
 Job matching efficiency
 In view of the empirical analysis undertaken in Section 3 of this article, the focus will be on 
providing a theoretical description of a job matching efficiency shock under the search and 
matching framewor
k. Such a diagrammatical description can also be viewed as a simple description 
of an impulse response function in a theoretical macro model of equilibrium unemployment.
 In this framework, a job matching efficiency shock affects the 
 curve and the 
 curve via 
the matching function.
 Figure A.1 shows the 
 space that includes the job creation condition 
 and the Nash wage equation 
. The intersection point A is the equilibrium 
(,). An 
exogenous shift in efficiency generates a downward
 translation of the job creation conditions curve 
. For instance, if efficiency were to decrease, both 
() and () would decrease and the ratio 
()
() would increase. All other things equal, wages and 
 would decrease.
84 An extension of the 
model with endogenous job destruction rates 
Œ in which 
 depends on the level of productivity of the 
job match 
Œ would suggest an even larger increase in this ratio as lower productivity matches will 
feature higher destruction rates. This would further com
press the wage offered in the job creation 
condition. This discussion highlights that there may be an important labour demand channel when 
accounting for the effects of job matching efficiency. In a more general set
-up, a higher skills 
mismatch in the labo
ur market could affect the productivity of a job match and drive down the wages 
firms are willing to offer.
                                                                     83  This means that 
the 
 curve does not shift 
following a
 job matching efficiency shock
. 84  This ratio can be interpreted as the average expected search cost of posting a vacancy. If firms keep 
posting vacancies 
and the market (the matching function) does not make 
enough job matches
, firms will 
have t
o bear 
higher search costs
 or increase the search effort to fill their vacancies. In net present value 
terms, these higher costs from search and matching will negatively affect the strength of labour demand 
and the 
wage offered

 The downward

reduction in the tightness from

  Box 
3  Labour market tightness and efficiency in the wage Phillips curve
 Prepared by Mario Porqueddu
 This box aims to clarify whether the combination of labour market tightness and matching 
efficiency can help to explain wage growth in the euro area in an augm
ented Phillips curve.
 It
 is still unclear as to why wages grew only moderately from 2013 to 2017 despite a notable reduction in 
the unemployment rate of the euro area. The original Phillips curve suggested a simple inverse 
relationship between wage growth 
and the unemployment rate, i.e. the lower the unemployment rate, 
the higher the rate of wage growth.

  83 example, in Galí
86, are more complex; they suggest that nominal wage growth is determined by
 the 
cyclical stance of the economy, inflation expectations and productivity growth developments. The 
equilibrium conditions of a simple version of the search and matching model suggest 
that 
an additional factor is necessary to fully describe the changes i
n the vacancy
-unemployment space. Job 
market efficiency measures should 
therefore
 be included in the wage Phillips curve given that, 
empirically, labour market tightness and efficiency may 
produce
 different information over the 
business cycle.
 The precise 
functional form of the wage Phillips curve (for example in terms of lag structure 
or linearity vs non
-linearity) and the chosen determinants remain subject to discussion.
 One 
way to hedge against such model uncertainty is to use a large set of proxies for 
the labour market 
cycle, inflation expectations and productivity growth.
87 This box shows the results for a set of wage 
Phillips curves that alternate 18 slack measures (
including
 unemployment rate, unemployment gap 
from various institutions (ECB, IMF, OECD
), and job market tightness), 16 inflation expectations 
measures (including those collected by Consensus Economics and in the ECB Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (SPF), and lagged headline inflation) and the measures of job market 
efficiency.
88 One
-third
 of the specifications are standard, without a job market efficiency measure, 
one-third include the job market efficiency measure derived from the Beveridge curve and one
-third 
include the measure derived from the matching function.
 Measures of matching ef
ficiency help to explain past moderate wage developments in the 
euro area.
 According to a measure of fit (Schwarz info criterion) some of the best specifications 
include the job market efficiency measures. Chart A shows the range of the paths of compensati
on per employee obtained using the wage Phillips curve models and conditioning on the path of slack, 
productivity, and past or expected inflation starting in 2012. When job market efficiency measures are 
added to the wage Phillips curves there is a margina
l downward shift of the range of projections 
compared to the baseline models that do not include these measures. This suggests that the job 
market efficiency measures may be useful in explaining the moderate wage growth in the euro area 
over the last eight
 years, albeit to a rather limited extent.

 Notes: Results are based on a thick modelling approach that includes a broad range of fixed coefficient specifications of the
 Phillips curve including or excluding 
job market inefficiency measures. The parameters are estimated over the sample period 2005Q1

for the period 2012Q1
-2018Q2. The ranges depict forecasts for the growth of compensation per employee coming from differently specified Phillips cu
rves. The 
specifications include permutations 
across the expectation formation (backward or forward
-looking), the variables representing slack and the job matching 
efficiency (JME) measures. In the chart the range of projections of the models without JME measures is represented by the blu
e and yellow 
area (A+B) while the 
range of projections from models that include JME measures is
 represented by
 the yellow and red area (B+C).
 The decomposition of the contribution of the exogenous variables confirms that 
a decline
 in 
job market efficiency ha
s a dampening effect on wages.
 Chart B shows the contribution of the 
exogenous variables to wage growth (as a deviation from the long
-run mean) for a specification that 
includes job market tightness and matching efficiency. From 2012 to 2015 cyclical develo
pments 
measured by job market tightness explain most of the lower
-than
-average developments in wages, 
while in 2017 and 2018 the contribution becomes positive. Job market inefficiency has a dampening 
effect on wages over the full period, 
and in particular 
in 2013 and 2014. A very important additional 
driver of low wage growth is low inflation, particularly in 2016. Similar results can be obtained using 
only the unemployment rate, with the contribution of this variable corresponding to the combined 
impact of
 job market tightness and matching efficiency.

 Notes: The

 line shows deviations of year

quarterly growth rate) is regressed against its own lag, a measure of slack (job market tightness), the job matching efficiency m
easure derived from the residuals 
of the job market matching function, productivity growth, the four
-quarter moving average of head
line inflation and a constant. Past developments of these 
variables impact current compensation per employee through lagged compensation per employee. In the chart these contributions
 are associated with the single 
exogenous variables despite showing a gen
eric contribution of lagged compensation per employee.
 The results suggest that, despite some caveats, job market efficiency measures help to 
explain past moderate wage growth in the euro area.
 The caveats relate to the fact that the 
analysis does not allo
w for a structural interpretation of shocks that would explain wage 
developments, i.e. there is not necessarily a causal relationship between the explanatory variables 
depicted in Chart B and low wages, as they could simply be reacting to the same common s
hocks. 
Also, the reliability of these results is affected by the low number of observations available for these 
measures and, therefore, the length of the estimation sample. Although
 this framework provides a 
useful and complementary perspective for unders
tanding wage developments, and may help to 
partially explain past moderate wage developments in the euro area, the overall quantitative 
implications for wages are largely consistent with those of the standard Phillips curve 
approach.
 4 Concluding remarks
 The article analyses the main patterns of the Beveridge curve and highlights 
the importance of both labour market tightness and labour market efficiency.
 The Beveridge curve seems to have significantly shifted outwards in the euro area, 
with the unemploymen
t rate approximately similar to the pre
-crisis period and the job 
vacancy rate currently significantly higher. Our empirical findings show that there has 
been a significant deterioration in aggregate matching efficiency since the start of the 
crisis. The d
eterioration in matching efficiency is not necessarily structural and 
contains useful cyclical information that can be used to assess the state of the labour 
market and possible implications for wage developments. We show that lower 
matching efficiency may
 have marginally contributed to weaker wage dynamics. This 
framework therefore helps to enhance our understanding of unemployment and wage

  86 fluctuations. However, the quantitative implications for wages presented in this article 
differ only marginally from 
those of the standard Phillips curve approach.
 The reasons behind the sharp decline in matching efficiency require further 
investigation into the heterogeneity and composition of the labour market.
 According to recent studies, the two main factors driving 
the decline in matching 
efficiency are the increased heterogeneity of the unemployment pool and the 
increased dispersion of unemployment rates across countries. However, other factors 
may be at play. First, the dynamics of the labour force and its composit
ion may also 
affect labour market efficiency. The euro area labour force participation rate has 
increased steadily
 since 
the 
early 2000s but 
has grown at a lower than average rate 
since the crisis
. 
Therefore, i
n the context of the euro area Beveridge curve
 analysis
, 
the outward shift in 2011 cannot be 
linked to 
the movements of the participation rate. 
Second, the role of sectoral reallocations may also have contributed marginally to the 
outward shift of the Beveridge curve as reallocations are usually assoc
iated with a 
significant spike in job separation rates. However, the timing of the outward shift of the 
Beveridge curve cannot really be linked to the slight change in the euro area job 
separation rate in 2011.

 area over time: a

 Prepared by Elena Bobeica and Andrej Sokol
 In this article we 
review
 the evolution of 
euro area HICP inflation excluding energy and 
food since
 the Great 
Financial Crisis
 through the lens of the Phillips curve. 
This period 
is particularly interesting, as the euro area experienced two recessions (in 2008
-2009 
and 2011
-2014) and a protracted episode of low inflation from 2013 onwards. 
We 
estimate a large set of Phillips curve models for the euro area and review the
 interpretation of inflation developments 
that 
they
 provide over time
. We find that our 
models can 
account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation 
between 
2013 and mid
-2017, 
but that they cannot account for the weakness in underlying inflation 
towards the end of our sample.
 1 Motivation and overview
 The decade since the onset of the Great Financial Crisis 
in 2008 
is known for a 
ﬁtwin puzzleﬂ in inflation developments across advanced economies.
 The
 first 
years following the crisis are associated with a 
missing disinflation 
episode
, as 
inflation appeared to fall 
by 
less than 
the ensuing recessions 
would have 
led us to 
expect
.89 More recently, as 
most economies
 gradually 
recovered, economists have 
puzz
led over 
missing inflation
,90 with the
 latter episode
 being
 much more prolonged
. Taking averages since the launch of the euro as benchmarks, in the euro area 
both 
headline HICP 
inflation 
and HICP inflation
 excluding energy and food (HICPX
, 
henceforth ﬁunder
lying inflationﬂ
) drop
ped below 
their respective averages after 
2009 (see 
Chart
 1), but the 
missing disinflation
 view would have predicted an even more 
marked fall.
 After a short
-lived recovery, inflation rates again fell from 2013 onwards, 
initiating a pr
otracted period of below
-average inflation
, which i
n the case of 
underlying 
inflation
 persists to the present day
. The 
missing inflation
 view finds the latter episode 
hard to square with
 a gradual recovery in economic activity in the euro area 
that has 
bro
ught the unemployment rate back to pre
-crisis levels 
(see 
Chart
 2).

 Both 
academic
s and pract
itioners use
 versions of the 
Phillips curve to 
understand and communicate inflation developments.
 In
 the broadest sense, the 
Phillips curve
 is an expression of the notion in economic theory that economic activity, 
and more precisely the degree of excess de
mand or supply, should have a bearing on 
price and inflation developments. 
The relationship is grounded in many popular 
economic theories
, such as the New Keynesian framework, where inflation is primarily 
linked to firms™ marginal costs (often proxied with
 a measure of economic slack) and 
forward
-looking inflation expectations. Phillips curves have long enjoyed great 
popularity as an empirical tool,
 but for that very reason the 
missing disinflation
 and missing inflation
 episodes 
have stirred intense debates
 about the relationship
, 
including whether it is alive or dead (i.e. steep or flat), and linear or non
-linear.

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspective
  89 Attempts to simply link the behaviour of inflation to the level of economic 
activity raise some important questions.
 For instance, a naïve look a
t the stability 
of such 
a relationship (
see 
Chart
 3) would suggest that, compared 
with
 the pre
-crisis 
period, the link between real activity and inflation might have 
ﬁflattened
ﬂ in the 
following period, which includes the two puzzling episodes. 
But
 many
 economic 
factors can 
shift the level of inflation for a given amount of economic slack, blurring the 
underlying economic relationship when viewed in a scatterplot. 
For example, inflation 
expectations 
and the cost of imported inputs 
are important element
s of price
-setting 
decisions
, and their changes can lead to shifts in the Phillips curve relationship
 without 
necessarily changing its slope
. 
On the other hand, the 
behaviour of economic agents 
could change over time, for example depending on whether the econo
my is in 
recession or not
, meaning that the slope could vary over different periods
. Without 
appropriately taking into account
 such considerations
, there
 is a risk of drawing the 
wrong conclusions about the strength of the link between inflation and econom
ic activity.

 Note: Linear regression lines for the two samples are shown in grey.
 The ECB 
has 
also 
relied on
 Phillips curve models to understand and 
communicate inflation developments since the Great Financial Crisis
. The 
Phillips curve is an intuitive yet powerful way of conveying the link between inflation 
and economic activity, which lies at
 the heart of monetary policy
. 
Thus, as
 in other 
central banks and policy institutions (see Box
 1 for some case studies), Phillips curves 
are one element of the analytical toolkit routinely deployed 
by the ECB 
to analyse and 
communicate inflation (and wage
 growth
)91 developments. 
Reduced
-form estimates 
of this relationship remain popular due to their simplicity and transparency. However, 
they require regular review and scrutiny in order to remain useful for analytical, 
decision
-making and communication purpo
ses. This includes all the important choices 
that have to be made for their empirical set
-up: for instance, 
whether to focus on 
                                                                    91  See Box 3 in the article entitled ﬁ

revisit the recent history of inflation in the euro area through the 
lens of a
 large
 set of 
reduced
-form
 Phillips curve model
s, and find that
 estimated 
Phillips curves can account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation since 
2013, imputing the bulk of it to its key determinants
, except for the last few outturns, 
which cannot be explained well by our models.
 Box 
1  Other countries™ experience
s with Phillips curves
 Prepared by Alexander Al
-Haschimi
 Major central banks 
use 
the Phillips curve to assess and communicate inflation developments. For 
instance, 
the Federal Reserve 
System 
tracks closely how well Phillips curve
s estimated using a 
variety of approaches can explain data 
on the US
 economy.
92 Some results suggest that in the 
United States
, the link between unemployment and inflation has weakened over time. Indeed, in 
recent years the U
nited 
States
 has been experienci
ng both low unemployment and low inflation 
concurrently, which is consistent with a flatter Phillips curve. Federal Reserve 
Chair Jerome
 Powell 
has 
argued that a number of factors 
have 
weakened the effect of labour market tightness on 
inflation.
93 One facto
r cited was
 a more effective conduct of monetary policy, resulting in a stronger 
anchoring of inflation expectations. Other factors potentially relate to the internationalisation of 
production structures and the higher import content of goods consumed, whi
ch give exchange rates 
and global prices a greater role in price determination.
94 A related question, particularly relevant given the very tight labour markets in some advanced 
economies, including the U
nited 
States
 and Japan, is to what extent the Phillips
 curve is non
-linear. In 
his remarks at the 2019 US Monetary Policy Forum, J
ohn
 Williams 
also 
discusse
d the possibility that 
the employment
-inflation relation
ship
 becomes strong only when unemployment is very low
, as 
suggested by Hooper, Mishkin and Sufi (
2019).95 This finding would be highly policy
-relevant, as it 
suggests that while thus far a tight labour market has co
-existed with low inflation, a further tightening 
in the US labour market may lead to inflation rising above target. Williams point

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time
: a Phillips curve perspective
  91 for this type of non
-linearity in the Phillips curve are often not robust, but their existence would 
significantly alter the policy trade
-offs a central bank is facing.
96 In Japan, 
the linearity of the Phillips curve
 has also been questioned
.97 Japan has also been 
experiencing a tight labour market and low inflation, which could be an indication of a flatter Phillips 
curve. There are a number of potential explanations for why the country™s low unemployment rate 
does not feed through more stron
gly to wage and price inflation. Some factors cited are structural, 
and relate in part to worker preferences for employment stability over wage increases, as well as 
hidden labour market slack arising from involuntary part
-time workers 
who
 are not fully ca
ptured by 
the unemployment rate. However, 
as in 
the U
nited 
States
, there is a debate as to when the low and 
falling unemployment rate should lead to stronger increases in wages and prices. Harada (2018) 
recently discussed this issue within a Phillips curve
 framework. He showed estimates suggesting that 
inflation becomes more responsive to the labour market when the unemployment rate falls below 3
%, and concluded that this could imply that the unemployment rate needed to decline further for inflation 
to reach its target of 
2% (see Chart
 A).98                                                                       96  This

s for euro area underlying inflation: what 
are the choices?
 We follow a ﬁthick modellingﬂ approach and bring a large 
number of 
reduced
-form single
-equation Phillips curve models to the data.
 As emphasised 
in ECB (2014),
99 there are countless 
Œ similarly plausible 
Œ empirical specifications of 
the Phillips curve, reflecting various choices, such as the variables to be incl
uded, the 
functional form and the estimation strategy
. One way to mitigate some of this model 
uncertainty is to choose a 
generic specification, and estimate different versions of it, 
changing how we measure each variable 
Œ an approach referred to as ﬁthick
 modellingﬂ.
100 The general specification is the following:
 =+++++ where 
 is inflation
, 
 is a measure of 
inflation expectations, 
 is a 
measure of 
economic activity or ﬁslackﬂ
 and 
 captures
 external price shocks
, which in some 
specifications are allowed to enter the equation with a longer lag 
 to allow for a 
slower pass
-through to domestic prices
. The choice of functional form
 and estimation 
strategy addresses 
tractability and simplicity 
concerns
, but also 
reflects the proven 
ability of such models
 to fit 
euro area data
 reasonably well

 While the objective of the ECB is
 unambiguously defined in terms of headline 
HICP
 inflation, in this article we focus on measures of underlying inflation, 
which are less volatile
 and can help 
to identify and illustrate the key drivers of 
price developments 
(see Figure
 1, panel
 A).
 Developments in total 
consumer price 
index (CPI) 
inflation may be temporarily influenced by factors that are of 
a short
-term 
nature, such as swings in commodity prices. 
In order to focus on the more persistent 
factors driving inflation
, in many empirical applications of the Phillips curve model
 (and 
beyond)
, underlying inflation measures are 
used instead.
 However, 
the
re are many 
available measures of 
underlying inflation. Popular choices include: permanent 
exclusion
 measures (
such as
 HICP 
inflation 
excluding energy and food), temporary 
exclusion measures and model
-based measures.
102 We use several measures of economic sl
ack or activity to capture the impact of 
firms™ costs on inflation 
(see Figure
 1, panel
 B).103 Most empirical approaches 
assume that marginal costs are proportional to economic slack,
104 proxied by the 
output gap or the unemployment gap. Such unobservable gaps
 can be obtained by 
                                                                    102  All three types of measure are explained and di

  94 applying statistical filtering techniques, via 
estimates 
of potential output 
based on 
a production function (e.g.
 OECD or IMF methodologies), or endogenously, in a manner 
consistent with inflation developments, as in Blanchard et al. (2
015), Jaroci
ski and 
Lenza (201
8) and Chan et al. (2016)
.105 Using multiple measures is one way of 
mitigating the model uncertainty inevitably surrounding estimates of economic slack. 
Another approach is to directly use observable measures of economic activi
ty, such as 
the unemployment rate or GDP growth, which, however, has the significant downside 
of blurring demand and supply factors. 
More recently
, several studies 
have 
recommend
ed using the short
-term unemployment rate or gap instead of total 
unemployment
 measures.
106 Regardless of the reference measure
, additional 
complications arise from 
estimating
 slack in real time, partly related to the potentially 
large revisions to some of the macro data used to proxy slack.
107 We use available survey measures to proxy inflation expectations 
(see Figure
 1, panel
 C).108 The 
inflation expectations of firms 
and workers/consumers 
are 
not available for most countries, so several strategies have been adopted to 
address
 the issue. 
Backwar
d-looking expectations, i.e.
 assuming that they are based on past 
inflation, are the simplest one, and the inclusion of a lagged inflation term in 
equation
 (1) is partly motivated by this. To measure forward
-looking expectations, 
survey measures are a conv
enient way to proxy the beliefs of economic agents 
regarding future price movements. Their main caveat is that such surveys usually 
reflect expectations of professional forecasters, which could differ markedly from 
those of price setters or consumers.
109  We also control for external supply
-side shocks that might hit domestic prices 
(see Figure
 1, panel
 D).110 In an increasingly globalised world, both domestic 
headline and underlying inflation can be sensitive to various external supply
-side 
shocks, such as tho
se coming from commodity and other import prices. There is some 
empirical evidence for the United States and other countries that import prices do 
affect inflation in a Phillips curve framework.
111 On the other hand, there is less 
                                                                    105  Blan

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the eur

  95 empirical support when it c
omes to an independent influence of 
the global business 
cycle on domestic inflation.
112 The relevant variables to include are not the only source of uncertainty in the 
Phillips curve
; the functional form matters as well.
 The choice of
 specification is 
often
 driven by the 
scope and 
purpose of the analysis
; for example, if a linear 
specification turns out not to offer a satisfactory explanation of outcomes, non
-linear 
specifications can be deployed. Box
 2 discusses some important departures from the 
linear benc
hmark model in equation

curves.
 We estimate 550 versions of the baseline model and find t
he euro area Phillips 
curve to be alive, but 
we 
also 
find evidence pointing to
 the importance of 
inflation drivers ot
her than domestic real activity.
 Estimation results point to a 
statistically significant and economically plausible link between euro area inflation and 
its key drivers. Focusing on the 
relationship
 with real activity, 
Chart 4 shows the 
Phillips curve slop
e across specifications for each measure of slack or economic 
activity. In virtually all 550 models under review, the real activity measure is statistically 
significant with the theoretically implied sign, confirming the visual impression given in 
Chart
 2 regarding the co
-movement between underlying inflation and economic 
activity in the euro area. However, the slope is generally not very steep and the 
coefficients of other relevant drivers, such as inertia, expectations and external 
shocks, are often also 
significant, pointing to the importance of factors beyond slack 
for adequately explaining inflation developments. In other words, not only movements 
along
 the Phillips curve, but also 
shifts
 in the curve, need to be taken into account.

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspective
  96 Box 
2  Linear and non
-linear Phillips curves
 Prepared by Andrej Sokol
 Empirical 
Phillips curve models are often linear
. Equation
 (1) in Section
 2 is a fairly standard 
specification of a single
-equation linear Phillips curve,
 where 
lagged inflation, a measure of slack, a 
measure of inflation expectations and a measure of import prices 
are included. Linearity refers both to 
linearity 
of the parameters (the right
-hand-side term is a linear function) and 
of the variables 
(i.e.
 variables enter the equation with the units they are measured in). Both assumptions can 
be relaxed in a number of 
ways.
 There are several possible non
-linear specifications of the Phillips curve
. The most common 
forms of non
-linearity include transformations of the independent variables, such as square (or even 
higher
-order) slack terms, which can introduce both conve
xity and concavity in Phillips curves. Similar 
and more sophisticated relationships can be fitted by weighting the slack measure with another 
variable that captures the state of the economy
; for example, a simple dummy variable can achieve 
several forms of
 ﬁpiecewise linearityﬂ, which can approximate different regimes, such as booms and 
deep recessions, as opposed to ﬁnormal timesﬂ. More sophisticated devices, such as non
-linear 
splines or Markov
 switching, are sometimes also used in the estimation of non
-linear Phillips 
curves.
113 Behind the notion of a non
-linear Phillips curve often lies the idea that pricing behaviour 
could be different at different stages of the economic cycle
. This in turn might be due to 
psychological, institutional or technological con
siderations and their interplay in a modern market 
economy. One argument with a long history 
relates to
 downward nominal wage rigidities; 
i.e.
 workers 
being reluctant to accept (or firms to impose) cuts in nominal wages in a downturn. This could be due 
to 
collective bargaining arrangements, or a psychological reluctance to see one™s pay cut in nominal 
terms. The implication is that in the presence of a large amount of economic slack, wages (and 
therefore prices) will change at a different rate than during m
ore normal periods, thus potentially 
bending the Phillips curve into a more convex shape. A similar phenomenon can occur if firms 
experience short
-run capacity constraints that make it difficult to immediately satisfy further increases 
in demand. One examp
le would be mothballed equipment that can only be put back into use with a 
time lag and at some cost. In such a situation, firms might increase prices before increasing their 
capacity to fully satisfy the additional demand, whereas in more normal times the
y would adjust inputs 
to production first, thus again making the Phillips curve more convex. Another source of convexity is 
the idea that price changes could be more frequent in periods of high inflation.
 Some theories predict a concave rather than a conve
x Phillips curve, 
i.e. 
inflation being more 
responsive to slack when there
 is a large amount of it than in normal times or booms
. For 
example, this is consistent with firms operating in market structures where they can make different 
pricing decisions depe
nding on market conditions. When there is a large amount of slack, firms may 
be more willing to cut prices in order not to lose market share to rival firms. Conversely, firms might be 
reluctant to increase prices in periods when output is close to or above
 potential 
to avoid losing 
market share.
                                                                     113  See, for example,

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspective
  97 Convexity and concavity do not need to be mutually exclusive
. One way to reconcile the 
presence of both are 
ﬁthreshold effects
ﬂ, namely a steeper relationship between inflation and slack 
only for extreme values of t
he slack variable (e.g.
 during deep recessions and/or after prolonged 
periods of above
-trend growth). One microeconomic 
notion 
consistent with such a set
-up is that 
prices are more responsive when there
 is a lot of slack (because firms do not want to lose market 
share) or when firms are operating way above potential (because of higher costs), and less 
responsive in between (when adjusting factor utilisation is preferred to changing prices). In such 
a case,
 the Phillips curve is concave when there is a lot of slack and convex when the economy 
is operating 
considerably above potential.
 Other microeconomic arguments for non
-linearity do not fit the convexity
-concavity 
dichotomy
 as neatly, but may nonetheless b
e important
. This may either be because they only 
operate during upturns or downturn
s, or because they depend on the rate at which slack is closing. 
Menu costs are one example: when firms face costs to change their prices, typically only a fraction of 
them
 will adjust prices in a given period
, but it is likely that the larger the demand shock they face, the 
greater the share of firms adjusting their prices will be. In such a case, the rate at which slack closes 
(or opens up) will determine the slope of the 
Phillips curve for any given level of slack.

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspective
  98 Quadratic slack terms and other forms of non
-linearity have been tested extensively, with 
mixed results
. In an empirical exercise featuring a large number of different specifications, quadratic 
slack terms (which seek to
 introduce convexity in the relationship between slack and inflation) were 
statistically significant in some of the specifications, but
, in models that controlled for imported 
inflation
, that significance largely disappeared
, consistent with the 
view 
that 
linear models with 
suitably chosen control variables are 
even 
able to fit 
data 
well that appear non
-linear in a 
reduced
-form relationship (
see 
Chart
 C). In the same exercise, a dummy variable for positive values 
of the output gap (in principle 
able 
to fit 
both convex and concave relationships) turned out to be 
significant only in a fraction of the models.

s: For two measures of inflation (HICP

HICPX inflation), versions of 
equation 
(1) including and excluding external variables and a different form of 
non-linearity (quadratic terms 
for
 economic slack or 
0/1 dummy variables 
for
 economic slack above/below a 
certain 
threshold) are estimated for various 
measures of slack (see 
the n
otes to Chart 
4). The bars denote the share of models 
in which 
the coefficients on the non
-linear terms are statistically signific
ant at 
the 10% level.
 Some evidence in favour of non
-linearity comes from considering more sophisticated 
threshold effects
. Models allowing for a steeper slope 
of the Phillips curve when slack is outside 
certain bounds help fit the data even when including
 expectations and imported inflation in the 
specification. This is the case both when the output gap and 
when 
the unemployment gap are used 
as measures of slack. Using regime
-switching Phillips curves
, where the slope is allowed to change 
with the level of
 the output gap, some evidence of non
-linearity was found for the euro area.

115 At the onset of the Great Financial Crisis, underlying inflation was well 
above its historical average, largely explained by the economy running 
at 
above 
normal capacity (see the large cont
ributions from economic tightness). However, as 
early as the second half of 2009, the inflation gap 
Œ the deviation of inflation from its 
mean 
Œ turned negative. To a
 certain
 extent, this was due to increasing levels of slack 
with the unfolding of the 
ensu
ing recession,
 and also to a 
slight
 softening of inflation 
expectations
, but part of the weakness cannot be accounted for by our explanatory 
variables.

015. The missing disinflation 
and missing inflation episodes are partly reflected in 
Phillips curve estimates
. The evidence presented in Chart
 5 support
s th
e missing 
disinflation 
narrative from 2011 onwards, when a large unexplained pos
itive 
contribution to underlying inflation begins to appear. One explanation put forward for 
this pointed to a larger impact from external factors during the recovery phase than 
simple Phillips curve models could capture.
116 In the course of 
2013, 
underlying
 inflation 
fell
 well below its historical average, where it has remained until the present 
day.
 The Phillips curve models lend some support to this 
missing inflation 
puzzle, as 
the negative contributions from the residuals indicate the models™ inability to
 fully 
account for the weakness in inflation over almost the entire period. One explanation is 
related to ﬁpent
-up restraintsﬂ: while declines in prices and wages during the recession 
were limited due to downward nominal rigidities, in the early phases of 
the recovery, 
                                                                    115  Thi

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspec
tive
  100 price and wage inflation may have been correspondingly subdued.
117 In other words, 
the missing inflation could have been a consequence of the missing disinflation period, 
at least in the initial stages of the economic recovery.
 Nevertheless,
 except for the last year or so, estimated Phillips curves can 
account for much of the weakness in underlying inflation since 2013, imputing 
the bulk of it to its key determinants rather than to unexplained residuals.
 The
 relative importance of the three key 
inflation drivers has changed throughout this 
period. 
Based on the average contributions across models in Chart
 5, the drag coming 
from economic slack dominated the picture in the early part of the period, and 
continued to play a (diminishing) role until s
pare capacity in the euro area was largely 
absorbed. As underlying inflation continued to turn out well below its historical 
average, some of its weakness began being attributed to lower 
short
-to
-medium
-term 
inflation expectations, which exerted a mild 
drag up to recent quarters. External 
developments, in the form of lower oil, commodity and other import prices
, also began 
gradually 
to feed 
through to underlying inflation. While the negative contributions of 
these factors had largely faded by early 2018,
 underlying inflation remained weak 
throughout 2018.
 The more recent weakness 
in underlying inflation 
is difficult to explain within 
the Phillips curve
 framework.
 Even within our thick modelling framework, the 
narrative summarised in Chart
 5 is subject to 
a large degree of uncertainty, as different 
models impute inflation developments to different factors at any given point in time. In 
the following subsections, we provide a quantification of the uncertainty around the 
contributions of slack, inflation expe
ctations and external prices to inflation, and also 
review some of the economic sources of such uncertainty. The overall picture that 
emerges is that uncertainty surrounding individual drivers could potentially account for 
some of the unexplained residuals
 in Chart
 5 until mid
-2017, but given the fading 
contributions of all three main drivers, the more recent weakness in underlying 
inflation cannot be accounted for by standard Phillips curve models.
 3.1
 Slack
 Slack 
played a leading role in explaining underl
ying inflation from 
2013 until 
2016. Given
 the euro area sovereign debt crisis 
in 2010 
and the 
ensuing 
recession 
(2011
-2014), i
t is understandable that explanations of inflation 
over that period
 focus 
on the role of domestic drivers
, especially slack,
 in t
he euro area.
118 Nevertheless, 
Phillips curve models do not paint the full picture; the initial 
fall
 in underlying inflation 
after 
mid
-2012 was unexpected, and although slack can account for the bulk of it
 in 
Chart
 5, unexplained factors 
also 
played a major 
role
.119 Furthermore, the range of 
contributions of slack to inflation across the 550 models that we estimate is particularly 
wide over that period (see Chart
 6). Two explanations for the difficulty in explaining 
                                                                    117  Praet, P.

015. Changes in Phillips curve slopes and potential mismeasurement of slack add to 
the uncertainty surrounding the
 contribution of slack to inflation.
 As early as 
2014,120 the ECB discussed
 the possibility of a stronger relationship between
 inflation 
and slack
, and 
lower nominal rigidities in some euro area 
countries 
due to structural 
reforms
121 being implemented
 are cons
istent with such a view. Nevertheless, i
t is 
challenging
 to distinguish a change in the Phillips curve slope from 
a mismeasurement 
of slack
. 
Alternative estimates of slack
, where the output gap 
is required
 to 
be consistent with
 inflation dynamics
 within a 
stable Phillips curve
 relationship, would 
have to have been much larger over the missing inflation period
.122 Also, 
the legac
y of 
the 
prolonged euro area sovereign debt 
crisis 
suggested that the full extent of slack in 
the labour market could be better captu
red by broadening the range of labour market 
indicators, also taking into account workers who 
became discouraged or worked 
part
-time 
for 
economic reasons
, but Phillips curves estimated with such measures 
would still show negative residuals in the more rece
nt period.
123 Moreover, r
eal-time 
estimates 
of economic slack 
can be sub
ject to large measurement error
, and revisions 
are common.

 Inflation expectations
 The decline in survey

some 
concerns that the Phillips curve had shifted downwards, 
but the 
message from our estimates is mixed
. Over the 
period from

-2017, 
Chart
 5 shows 
that inflation expectations might have contributed to the drag on 
underlying inflation.
 Neverthel
ess, as discussed in Section
 2, available measures of 
expectations are imperfect and it is sometimes di
fficult to interpret the signal
 they 
provide
 for inflation
. 
Chart
 7 highlights this uncertainty within our thick modelling 
framework. The range of the co
ntributions of expectations over the 2014
-2017 period 
can be wide at times, reflecting the fact that it covers measures with various forecast 
horizons, including both 
short
-to
-medium
-term survey
-based
 inflation expectations
 (which can be noisier and
 more c
losely
 trail
 developments in past inflation
) and 
long-term measures of survey inflation expectations 
(which, by comparison, have 
been more stable
). The most recent weakness in underlying inflation does not appear to be 
explained by developments in inflatio
n expectations.
 Not
 only has the average 
contribution gradually faded towards zero, but the range of contributions across 
models has also become remarkably small, reflecting the gradual pick
-up in the 
available survey

ns.

 External factors
 Global factors in general, and low oil
 and other commodity prices in particular, 
have 
featured prominently in inflation narratives over recent years
.125 Chart
 5 highlights
 the increasing drag on 
underlying 
inflation associated with external price 
developments
 from 2015 onwards.
 Underlying inflat
ion is affected by external price 
movements through two main channels: a direct one, via the price of imported final 
consumption goods; and an indirect one, via the price of imported intermediate goods 
used in production within the euro area.
 The drop 
in 
oil prices starting 
in 
mid
-2014 was 
one of 
the largest since the inception of 
Economic and Monetary Union (
EMU
) and left 
its mark on 
the 
headline 
inflation profile for the 
subsequent 
years. 
For underlying 
inflation, however, the negative contributions from 
external price developments were 
relatively modest when looking at the average contribution across models, but for part 
of this period could have been substantially larger, according to our range of estimates 
(see Chart
 8). However, over the last few quart
ers, both the average contribution and 
the range around it have shrunk substantially.

r 2015. Global influences on domestic inflation could extend beyond what can be 
captured by import and commodity prices alone, but the empirical evidence on 
additional channels is mixed.
 In
 a globali
sing
 world, the inflation process might 
reflect
 increased trade flows, 
the 
integration of emerging economies in
to
 the world 
economy 
and the rise of global value chains shifting part
s of production abroad. All 
these phenomena 
can 
affect inflation via numerous channels

with long 
lags

 their influence within a traditional Phillips curve model 
can be
 empirically challenging.

 4 Conclusions
 Phillips curve models provide a useful and intuitive framework for 
understanding and communicating inflation developments
. We employ a
 parsimonious, yet not overly simplistic specification tha
t spans the key determinants of 
inflation beyond the level of economic activity
. We
 combine
 it with a thick modelling 
approach that mitigates some of the pervasive model uncertainty, allow
ing
 us 
to draw 
a more robust inference about the strength of the rel
ationship between inflation and its 
drivers. 
Our results
 provide
 a plausible narrative for the evolution of underlying 
inflation in the euro area since the onset of the Great Financial Crisis.
 Estimated Phillips curves can account for much of the weakness 
in underlying 
inflation 
between
 2013 and mid
-2017, while the more recent weakness in 
underlying inflation remains largely unexplained.
 The average contributions of 
slack, inflation expectations and external prices across all estimated models can 
account fo
r the bulk of the deviations of underlying inflation from its historical average 
over large spans of the period we consider. However, given the fading contributions of 
all three factors and the narrowing of uncertainty ranges around them over the most 
rece
nt period, the persistent weakness in underlying inflation highlights the need for 
other, complementary, approaches.

 Drivers of underlying inflation in the euro area over time: a Phillips curve perspective
  105 Like
 any other analytical tool, 
Phillips curves
 also have limitations and 
shortcomings
. For example, while being intuitive and transparent,
 reduced
-form 
estimates are, by nature, partial
-equilibrium and thus open to both theoretical and 
empirical objections. Furthermore, to remain tractable, they inevitably miss many 
aspects (for example, fiscal policy and financial factors) that could noneth
eless be 
important for explaining underlying inflation but require more sophisticated modelling 
approaches.
 Finally, statistical and measurement issues can also cause instability in 
Phillips curve relationships over specific periods of time. Despite these 
shortcomings,
 Phillips curve models are an integral part of a much broader analytical toolkit deployed 
by central banks 
to understand the inflation process. They have often provided 
relevant
 insights, at times leading the way 
for 
more sophisticated approac
hes 
and at 
other
 time
s offering a cross
-check 
for
 analyses or forecasts originating elsewhere
. The very 
lively debate surrounding them
 bears testimony to their usefulness.
