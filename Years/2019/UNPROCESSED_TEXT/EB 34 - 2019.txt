 developments
 Overview
 Based on a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook
, the 
Governing Council took a series of monetary policy decisions
 at its mone
tary 
policy meeting on 7
 March.
 The weakening in economic data poi
nts to a sizeable 
moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current 
year, even though there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors 
dampening growth are starting to fade. The persistence of un
certainties r
elated to 
geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets 
appears to be leaving marks on economic sentiment. Moreover, underlying inflation 
continues to be muted. The weaker economic momentum is slowing the adjustm
ent of 
inflation towards 
the Governing Council™s
 aim. At the same time, supportive financing 
conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to 
underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. 
Against
 this 
background, the Governing Council decided to 
adjust 
its
 forward guidance on the key 
ECB interest
 rates 
to indicate 
its
 expectation that 
they
 will ﬁ
remain at their present 
levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessa
ry to 
ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but 
close to, 2% over the medium term
ﬂ, as well as to reiterate its forward guidance on 
reinvestments. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to launch a new series
 of 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-III) and to 
continue conduct
ing
 all 
lending operations as fixed
 rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until the 
end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 202
1. These decisio
ns 
were 
taken to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are 
below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
7 March 2019
 Global growth momentum co
ntinued to moderate in late 2018
. Global growth 
is projected to decelerate in 2019, but
 to stabilise over the medium term
. 
The slowdown 
has been more pronounced in the manufacturing sector, with global trade decelerating 
sharply as a result. Heightened global uncertainties relating to trade disputes, the 
financial stress in emerging market economies last summer and signs of 
weaker 
growth in China have contributed to 
the
 slowdown in global growth and trade. While 
those headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on the global economy this year, 
recent economic policy measures are expected to provide some support. Global trade 
is expected to weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with activity in the 
medium term. Global inflationary pressures are expected to remain contained, while 
downside risks to global activity have been accumulating.
 Long-ter
m risk

in December 2018,

  3 outlook and a perceived slowing of the pace of monetary tightening in the 
United States.
 The prices of euro area risk assets such 
as equities and corporate 
bonds have recovered amid improved risk sentiment, fuelled in part by greater 
optimism regarding global trade negotiations. In foreign 
exchange markets, the euro 
has broadly weakened in trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP gro
wth remained subdued in the fourth quarter of 
2018 at 
0.2% quarter on quarter
. Incoming information suggests that growth will continue at 
moderate rates in the near term. Data 
releases 
have continued to be weak, in 
particular in the manufacturing sector, r
eflecting the slowdown in external demand 
compounded by some country and sector
-specific factors. The impact of these factors 
is turning out to be somewhat longer
-lasting, which suggests that the near
-term growth 
outlook will be weaker than previously anti
cipated. Looking ahead, the effect of these 
adverse factors is expected to unwind. The euro area expansion will continue to be 
supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising 
wages, and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower
 Œ expansion in global activity.
 This assessment is broadly reflected in the 
March 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections 
for the euro area.
 These projections foresee 
annual 
real GDP increas
ing
 by 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. Compared with 
the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real 
GDP growth has been revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020. The 
risks surrounding the euro ar
ea growth outlook are still tilted to the downside, on 
account of
 the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of 
protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annua
l HICP inflation 
increased to 1.5% in February 2019, from 1.4% in January.
 On the basis of current 
futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain at around current levels 
before declining towards the end of year. Measures of underly
ing infl
ation 
have 
remain
ed generally muted, but labour cost pressures have strengthened and 
broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets.
 Looking ahead
, underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually over the medium 
ter
m, supported by the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic 
expansion and rising wage growth.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflatio
n at 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021
. Compared with the 
December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP 
inflation has been revised down across the projection horizon, reflecting in particular 
the more subdued near
-term growth outlook. Annual HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food is expected to be 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021.
 Money growth and credit dynamics moderated in January 2019
, but 
bank 
funding and lending
 conditions remained favourable
. Broad money (M3) growth 
decreased to 3.8% in January 2019, from 4.1% in December 201
8. M3 growth 
continues to be backed by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation 
in credit dynamics. 
The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corpo
rations 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2 / 2019
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  4 declined to 3.3% in January 2019, from 3.9% in December 2018, reflecting a base 
effect but also, in some countries, the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in 
economic activity, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained 
stabl
e at 3.2%. 
Borrowing conditions for firms and households are still favourable, as the 
monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continue to support access to 
financing, in particular for small and medium
-sized enterprises. The 
Governing 
Council
™s decisions
, in particular the new series of TLTROs, will help to ensure that 
bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been broadly 
neutral in 2018, but is projected to be m
ildly expansionary from 2019 onwards.
 This is mainly the result of a loosening fiscal stance in a less favourable 
macroeconomic environment. 
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
made the foll
owing decisions
:  First, t
he key ECB interest rates 
were kept 
unchanged
. The Governing Council 
now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least
 through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the 
continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close 
to, 2% over the medium term.
  Second, t
he Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset 
purchase 
programme for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the 
key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain 
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary 
accommodation.
  Third, th
e Governing Council decided to launch a
 new series of quarterly targeted 
longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-III), starting in September 2019 and 
ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. These new operations 
will help to preserve favo
urable bank lending conditions and the smooth 
transmission of monetary policy. Under TLTRO
-III, counterparties will be entitled 
to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28
 February 2019 at a rate 
indexed to the interest rate on the main ref
inancing operations over the life of 
each operation. Like the outstanding TLTRO
-II
 programme, TLTRO
-III will feature 
built
-in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable. Further details on 
the precise terms of TLTRO
-III will be communicated in d
ue course.
  Fourth, t
he Governing Council decided to conduct the 
Eurosystem™s lending 
operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as 
necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in 
March 202

 Global
 growth mome

urvey
s suggest 
that it has
 weakened further 
in 
early 
2019. The slowdown has been more pronounced 
in the manufacturing sector, with global trade decelerating sharply as a result. 
Heightened
 global 
uncertainties 
relating to 
the trade dispute between the United 
States and China, 
the 
financial stress 
that was seen 
in 
emerging market economies
 last
 summer and, more recently, signs of 
weaker
 growth in China
 have all contributed 
to the slowdown in global gr
owth and trade
. While those headwinds are expected to 
continue to weigh on the global economy this year, recent economic policy measures 
are expected to provide some support. As a result, global growth is projected to 
decrease in 2019, but to stabilise ove
r the medium term. Global trade is expected to 
weaken more significantly this year and to grow in line with activity in the medium term. 
Global inflationary pressures are expected 
to remain contained, while
 downside risks 
to global activity have been accum
ulating.
 Global economic activity and trade
 Global growth momentum moderate
d further in late 2018
. Economic activity in 
advanced economies 
weakened
 in the fourth quarter of 2018, 
with
 growth slow
ing
 in 
both 
the United States and the United Kingdom. While g
rowth in Japan 
strengthened
 in th
at quarter
, this 
followed
 a contraction in the previous quarter 
on account of
 a series of natural disasters. Growth in emerging market economies (EMEs) also 
weakened
 in late 2018
 Œ including in China.
 Survey
-based evidence 
suggests that growth 
has continued to 
weaken in 
early 
2019. The global composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) excluding the 
euro area has continued to decline
, owing mainly to weakening global manufacturing 
activity. Service sector 
activity has also 
moderated recently
, 
although its 
decline has 
been weaker
 and from 
a higher level (
see 
Chart 1). Global manufacturing activity 
has 
slowed against the backdrop of maturing business cycle
s in key advanced economies. 
At the same time,
 the pac
e of this slowdown has been accentuated by heightened 
uncertainties weighing on the global economy, such as the lingering trade dispute 
between the United States and China, 
the 
financial stress 
that was seen 
in EMEs 
last
 summer and, more recently, signs of
 weaker
 growth in China. The slowdown 
in global 
manufacturing activity 
is also weigh
ing
 on global trade.

February 2019
. ﬁLong-term averageﬂ refers to the period from January 1999 to 
January 2019
. Financial conditions in advanced economies remain accommodative overall, 
while the picture for EMEs remains mixed.
 Market expectations of further interest 
rate increases in the Unit
ed States have eased amid a further decline in Treasury 
yields, partly reflecting developments in term premia. In China, financial conditions 
have also eased as policymakers 
have 
adopted 
a looser monetary policy stance in 
response to indications of weakeni
ng activity. Following 
a sharp decline at the end of 
2018 against the backdrop of renewed concerns 
about the global economy, global 
stock prices have rebounded since the turn of the year. However, global risk sentiment 
has not yet fully recovered
, and vola
tility in financial markets remains elevated. 
In some of 
the EMEs that were hardest hit by the financial market turbulence 
last 
summer 
Œ including Argentina and Turkey 
Œ financial conditions remain relatively tight 
and are continuing to weigh on activity.
 Global growth is projected to soften this year amid increasing headwinds.
 These include weaker global manufacturing activity and trade in an environment of 
high and rising political and policy uncertainty. The sizeable procyclical fiscal stimulus 
in the Un
ited States 
(which 
includ
es tax
 cuts
 and increased 
spending)
 is continu
ing
 to 
help drive
 US and global growth, 
but 
the partial federal government shutdown, 
which 
ended in late January
, is 
expected to weigh on growth in the first quarter of 2019
. In 
China, 
domestic demand is 
expected
 to 
weaken 
in the first half of this year, as the
 impact of recently implemented
 policies
 is likely to kick in with something of a lag.
 Looking further ahead, global growth is projected to stabilise over the medium 
term.
 Three ke
y forces
 look set to
 shap
e the global 
economy
 over the projection 
horizon
. First, cyclical momentum 
is expected to slow 
in 
key 
advanced economies as 
capacity constraints become increasingly 
restrictive
 and policy support gradually 
diminishes amid positive 
output gaps and low unemployment rates. Second, China is 
expected to continue its orderly transition to a 
weaker
 growth path
 that is
 less 
dependent on investment and exports. And finally, growth

  8 several key EMEs
 which are
 currentl
y going through, or have recently experienced, 
deep recessions. Overall, the pace of global expansion 
is expected to
 settle at 
rates 
below th
ose seen prior to the 2007
-08 financial crisis
. Turning to developments in individual countries, 
activity
 in the United States 
has remained 
relatively robust
. The 
country™s 
strong labour market, favourable 
financial conditions and fiscal stimulus 
are 
continu
ing to
 support growth, outweighing 
the adverse impact of 
the 
trade dispute with China. The negative impact of the partial 
federal government shutdown is expected to be temporary. Annual headline 
consumer 
price
 inflation 
fell
 to 1.6% in January
 from 1.9% in the previous month
, largely 
on account of falling
 energy pri
ces
, while
 consumer 
price 
inflation excluding food and 
energy remained unchanged at 2.2%
. In Japan, 
recovering 
domestic demand 
supported growth in late 2018.
 This 
recovery followed a sharp contraction in the third quarter 
on account of
 a series of 
natural 
disasters. Looking ahead, 
the country™s
 accommodative monetary policy 
stance, 
its
 strong labour market and 
its robust
 demand for investment 
(despite 
a weakening external environment
) are 
all 
projected to support growth. In addition, fiscal 
measures are exp
ected to smooth out the negative impact of the 
consumption tax
 increase that is
 scheduled for October 
of 
this year. 
The fact that
 wage growth 
remains 
modest (
despite a very tight labour market
) and inflation expectations 
are 
at low levels 
suggest
s that inf
lation will remain below the Bank of Japan™s 2% target over the 
medium term.
 In the United Kingdom, heightened political uncertainty 
is 
continu
ing
 to weigh 
on growth.
 Even
 the 
short
-term outlook 
is subject to considerable uncertainty 
as a 
result of
 the 
forth
coming vot
es on the EU withdrawal agreement in 
parliament. Over 
the medium term, growth is expected to remain below 
its
 pre
-referendum trajectory.
 In central and eastern European countries
, growth is projected to 
moderate 
somewhat this year.
 Investmen
t growth 
remains strong, supported by
 EU funds
, and 
consumer spending
 also remains robust, 
underpinned by strong labour market 
performance. 
However
, the slowdown in the euro area 
is weigh
ing
 on the growth 
outlook for th
is region. Over the 
medium term, 
grow
th levels in these countries are
 expected to 
fall back 
towards potential.
 Growth in 
China 
has lost some of its
 momentum in recent months.
 Moreover,
 monthly indicators suggest that this trend is likely to continue in early 2019. In order to 
shield
 the econo
my from a sharper 
slowdown
, the Chinese authorities have 
announced a number of fiscal and monetary policy measures, which are expected to 
deliver a smooth deceleration in activity this year. 
Looking f
urther ahead, progress with 
the implementation of struct
ural reforms is projected to result in an orderly transition to 
a more moderate
 growth path 
that is 
less dependent on investment and exports.
 Economic activity in large commodity
-exporting countries
 is projected to 
gradually strengthen
. The outlook for gro
wth i
n Russia is shaped by 
developments
 in 
global oil markets, a
nd past declines in oil price
s are projected to weigh on activity this 
year. Looking 
further 
ahead, economic activity 
in Russia 
is expected to gradually 
strengthen, amid constraints

  9 relat
ing
 to the implementation of structural reforms and spending commitments 
announced last year. 
Growth 
in Brazil is 
also 
projected to 
strengthen,
 supported by 
accommodative financial conditions and declining p
olitical uncertainty.
 In Turkey, economic activity contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2018 
as a result of
 the legac
y of 
last
 summer
™s
 financial turmoil, high inflation and 
procyclical monetary and fiscal policies.
 Following 
a strong adjustmen
t 
in late 
2018, 
growth is projected to resume 
later this year and gradually rise thereafter
. Global trade growth moderated
 last year
 amid significant volatility,
 with
 a strong performance 
being recorded in the first half of
 2018, followed by
 a relatively s
harp deceleration.
 That slowdown reflects weakening global 
manufacturing activity, heightened trade tensions and, more recently, a significant 
deterioration in trade in Asia 
Œ particularly in China. According to CPB data, the 
volume of global merchandise i
mports fell by 1.2% in December in 
three
-month
-on-three
-month terms, signalling a further weakening of global trade 
momentum in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see Chart 2). Moreover, incoming data 
indicate
 that global trade growth 
has 
remain
ed weak in the fir
st quarter of 2019.
 A temporary truce agreed between the United States and China in December 
2018 put a further escalation of trade tensions on hold.
 Tariffs on USD 200 billion 
of Chinese exports to the United States had originally been set to rise from 10
% to 
25% as of 1 January 2019, 
but 
that increase was put on hold as a result of the agreed 
truce. While this sent a positive signal, there remains considerable uncertainty as to 
whether the ongoing trade negotiations will lead to a significant 
de-escalation of trade 
tensions. Meanwhile, President Trump has recently announced that the truce is to be 
extended, citing progress achieved in those trade negotiations, which means that the 
increase in tariff rates remains on hold. A formal trade agreeme
nt between the United 
States and China is currently expected to be signed in late March. Risks remain, 
however, as trade tensions could intensify again and the US administration could 
impose new tariffs on imports from other countries.

 Note: The latest observations 
relate to
 February 2019 for the PMIs and December 2018 for global merchandise imports
. Following a 
robust
 performance last year, global 
economic 
growth is projected 
to 
weaken
 this year, before 
stabilis
ing
 over the medium term.
 According to the 
March 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
global
 real GDP growth (excluding 
the euro area) is projected to 
fall
 to 3.5% this year
, down
 from 3.7% in 2018
. This 
reflects 
increasing headwinds
 to global growth, such as
 weaker global manufacturing 
activity in an environment 
of high and rising political and policy uncertainty. Over the 
period 2020
-21, it is 
then 
projected to stabilise 
at 
around 3.6% 
as a result of
 a slowdown 
in key advanced economies, China™s transition to a 
weaker
 growth path and 
an expected pick
-up in growth
 in several key EMEs. 
As a result
 of global growth 
headwinds weighing significantly on global trade, growth in euro area foreign demand 
is projected to slow significantly 
this year, falling 
to 2.2%
, down
 from 4
.0
% in 2018. In 
the medium term
, euro area for
eign demand is expected to grow in line with activity, as 
the impact of 
the 
heightened political and policy uncertainty is expected 
to 
graduall
y dissipate
. Compared with the 
December
 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, global GDP growth has been revised slightly downwards for 
this year
. 
Meanwhile, g
rowth in euro area foreign demand has been revised 
significantly 
downwards for this year and slightly downwards for next year. These revisions 
reflect 
disappointi
ng data 
releases
 in late 2018
, coupled with
 projected 
declines in
 demand 
for imports in
 China
 and the rest of emerging Asia, as well as 
in 
European economies 
outside the euro area.
 Downside risks to global activity have been accumulating.
 Despite 
the
 tempo
rary 
truce
 between the United States and China
, tail risks stemming from 
an intensification 
of global trade tensions remain high. A sharper slowdown 
in China™s economy might 
be more
 difficult to address 
using

will 
also 
pose
 challenge
s in 
the context o

Meanwhile, a

the reversal of 
capital flow
s, though the risk of 
significant 
numbers of EMEs suffering 
acute stress has recently subsided.
 Global price developments
 Oil prices have 
remained highly
 volatile.
 In the final quarter of 2018, oil prices 
declined amid assurances 
by Saudi Arabia and Russia 
that they would
 offset the effect 
on oil supply of the
 US sanctions 
against 
Iran. Th
at downward pressure 
then 
intensified
, with
 the US government grant
ing
 temporary waivers for key importers of 
Iranian oil and US crude oil production st
anding at a
 high 
level 
amid renewed concerns 
about the global economy. Oil prices 
then 
recovered somewhat at the turn of the year 
as 
the 
OPEC+ agreement to cut production 
too
k effect,
 amid 
unexpected
ly high
 levels 
of 
compliance by 
the various
 member
 countrie
s. Looking ahead, oil prices are 
expected to remain broadly stable 
at this lower trajectory over the projection horizon. 
Consequently,
 the oil price assumption
s underpinnin
g the March 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections 
were
 around
 8.6% lower for this year 
(and 8.2% and 8
.0
% lower for 2020 and 2021 respectively
) relative to assumptions underpinning the 
December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
. Since the 
cut
-off date 
for 
the March 
projections, however, the price of oil has increased further, 
standing 
slightly above 
USD
 65 per barrel 
on 6 March
. Global inflationary pressures remain contained.
 In 
countries belonging to 
the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operat
ion and Development (OECD)
, annual 
headline 
consumer price inflation 
averaged
 2.4% in December 
2018, down 
from 2.7% in the 
previous month
, owing to 
a decline in the
 contribution 
of the energy component (
see 
Chart 3). 
Underlying inflation (excluding food an
d energy) was 
also down 
slightly 
on the previous month, standing
 at 2.2%. Tight labour market conditions across major 
advanced economies have so far translated into moderate wage increases, and the 
pace of underlying inflation re
mains subdued
. 
Past 
declines in oil price
s are expected 
to 
weigh on headline inflation going forward.

 2Since the Governing Council™s meeting in 
December 
2018, global long
-term risk
-free 
rates have declined in 
the context
 of a 
deterioration in the
 macroeconomic outlook
 and 
a perceived slowing of the pace of monetary tightening in the United States
. 
The 
prices of euro area 
risk
 assets, such as 
equit
ies
 and corporate 
bonds, have recovered
 amid improved risk sentiment, 
fuelled 
in part 
by a greater sense of optimism 
regarding
 global 
trade negotiations
. I
n foreign exchange markets, the euro has broadly 
weakened in trade
-weighted terms.
 Long-term yields have declined in 
both 
the euro area and the United States.
 During the period under review (13
 December 2018 
to 
6 March 2019
), the euro area 
ten
-year risk
-free overnight index swap (OIS) rate 
fell to 0.48% 
(down 23 
basis point
s) and the GDP
-weighted euro area ten
-year sovereign bond yield
 (see Chart 4)
 fell to 
0.84
% (down 23 
basis point
s). In the United States
, 
the ten
-year 
sovereign bond yield 
fell by 22 basis points over that period to stand at 2.71
%, whil
e the equivalent yield in
 the United Kingdom
 fell 8 basis points to stand
 at 1.22%. 
Global long
-term yields fell 
following communications from the Federal Reserve System which were interpreted 
by the markets as signalling a slower intended pace of monetary
 policy tightening. In 
addition to possible spillovers from the United States, euro area bond yields also 
reflected a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook following a number
 of 
worse 
than expected
 macroeconomic data releases
, as well as some reapprai
sal of the 
monetary policy outlook for the euro area as signalled by the short end of the yield 
curve.

than at the time of
 the trough 
in 
the second quarter of 2013.
 Continu

growth 
combined
 with 
a drop in GDP growth in 2018
 has 
led 
to a moderation in

 Empirically, a
djustments in

 Private consumption growth

 is 
expected to regain 
further 
momentum
 in the quarters ahead

 Private consumption increased by 0.
2%, quarter on 
quarter, in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2018, following somewhat 
weaker
 growth in the 
third
 quarter. The weakness in household expenditure partly reflected temporary 
bottlenecks in the car sector, affecting the consumption of durable goods, and the 
negative effect 
of energy price increases on household purchasing power. The crude 
oil price (in 
euro
) increased from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, 
which negatively affected consumption growth, in particular of non
-durable goods, i.e. 
food and energy. Subsequently, the oil price declined sharply (before recovering 
somewhat in
 the last two months). This should support consumption of non
-durable 
goods in the near term. Furthermore, employment growth strengthened in the fourth

  20 growth in households™ re
al disposable income and supports consumer confidence and 
spending. In addition, while financing conditions remain very favourable, households™ 
net worth improved at a strong rate in the third quarter of 2018. 
 Latest indicators 
also 
suggest some strengthe
ning of private consumption 
momentum 
in the course of the year ahead.
 Recent data on retail sales and car 
registrations indicate moderate but steady growth in consumer spending. The volume 
of retail sales 
increased by 1.4% in January 2019, 
following 
a drop
 in the previous 
month
. As a result, sales stood at 1.5% above their average level 
in the fourth quarter 
of 2018. The indicator for new passenger car registrations posted its fourth 
consecutive increase in January 2019, rising by 4.8% on a monthly basis. T
his 
confirms previous expectations for a normalisation in car registrations, fol
lowing the 
volatile developments triggered by the introduction of the new Worldwide Harmonised 
Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) on 1 September
 2018
. In addition, consumer 
confidence increased for a second consecutive month in February, halting the 
declining trend observed throughout most of 2018. The latest improvement reflects 
households™ more benign views 
regarding
 their past and future financial situation, as 
well as the e
xpected general economic situation
 and unemployment. Consumer 
confidence remains above its historical average level and is consistent with ongoing 
steady growth in private consumption. 
 The ongoing recovery in housing markets is 
also 
expected to
 continue, 
albeit at 
a slower pace
 than in 2018
. Housing investment increased by 
0.6
% in the 
fourth 
quarter of 2018, reflecting the 
ongoing
 recovery in many euro area countries and in the 
euro area as a whole. 
Although growth over 2018 was slower than the buoyant gro
wth 
experienced in 2017, it remains at solid, healthy levels. In line with these 
developments, r
ecent short
-term indicators and survey results point to positive, but 
slowing
 momentum. Construction production in the buildings segment
 increased by 
0.2%, quar
ter on quarter, in the 
fourth 
quarter of 2018, 
recovering 
from 
-0.8
% in the 
third
 quarter
. 
The European Commission™s construction confidence indicators 
for
 the 
past few months point to positive, albeit weakening, momentum in the fourth quarter 
of 2018
 and early 2019
. T
he Purchasing Managers™ Index (PMI) for housing activity 
averaged 5
2.0
 in the last quarter of 2018, but decreased to 50.6 in January 2019
. 
However, both the PMI indicators and the European Commission
™s confidence 
indicators remain clearly above their long
-run averages.
 Business investment
 in the euro area
 appears to have lost some momentum in 
the second half of 2018
, but fundamentals remain supportive.
 Available country 
data for some of the larger euro 
area countries point overall to a slowdown in business 
investment growth in 
the fourth quarter of 
2018. 
The slowdown in business investment 
partly reflects heightened policy uncertainty and financial volatility 
in some euro area 
countries. Persistent conce
rns about global trade

the possibility of 
a no-deal Brexit and economic weaknesses in China also appear to have adversely 
affected business confidence. The assessment of export order books a

2018 total euro area 
exports increased by 0.9%, while imports increased by 0.5% on a quarterly basis.
 In
coming 
data on the 
monthly trade in goods confirm a poor performance 
by total euro 
area trade 
in the fourth quarter, mostly driven by intra
-euro 
area tr
ade. In December
 2018 nominal euro area exports contracted by 0.5%
, month on month
, with intra
-euro 
area exports decreasing even more (by 0.9%). Nominal euro area imports 
saw a slight 
month
-on-month increase
 of 
0.4%. Temporary factors
, such as the new regu
lation
s on vehicle emissions tests,
 have weighed on export
s. However
, a generalised decrease 
can be observed across
 all product categories. The U
nited 
Kingdom
, Turkey and 
China 
continue to drive the weakness in extra
-euro area exports observed in the last
 few
 months of 2018. Looking ahead leading indicators point to a further reduction in 
extra
-euro area exports in the 
coming
 months. In February 
2019 the 
manufacturing 
PMI 
for 
new 
export 
orders outside 
of 
the euro area was at its 
lowest
 since November 
2012 (46.
4), and the E
uropean 
Commission™s
 assessment went more negative 
compared with January.
 The latest survey results
 have continued to disappoint and
 suggest that 
euro 
area 
growth is moderating in the short term
. The European Commission™s 
Economic Sentiment Indicator 
remained broadly unchanged
 in 
February, standing 
above its long
-term average
. So far in 2019 the average stands at 106.2, below the 
108.9 average for the last quarter of 2018. Although the indicator d
eclined for the 
industry and construction sectors, this was broadly offset by positive sentiment in 
services, the retail sector and households. 
The composite output PMI 
increased 
slightly in February, but the average for the first two months of 
the 
first q
uarter of 2019
 stood below that for the previous quarter (
51.4
 compared with
 52.3
). Despite the current slowdown, over the medium term the 
broad
-based 
economic expansion is expected to 
regain traction and to 
continue
 over the 
period ahead
. The ECB™s accomm
odative monetary policy continues to strengthen 
domestic demand. 
Ongoing 
growth
 in employment and
 wages should 
keep
 private 
consumption
 high
. At the same time business investment is supported by 
healthy
 domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and improving balance sheets
, and
 housing
 investment remains 
strong
. The 
March
 2019 ECB
 staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
forecast
 annual real GDP 
to 
increas
e by 
1.1

  24 Measures of unde
rlying inflation
 continued their recent sideways movement 
after rising from earlier lows
. HICP inflation excluding energy and food was 1.0% in 
February
, down from 1.1% in 
January. It thus continued to hover around the 1% rate 
that it reached after rising f
rom its low in mid
-2016. Th
e decrease in February 
reflected 
a decline in services inflation from 1.
6% to 1.3%
, while
 non
-energy industrial goods 
inflation 
remained
 unchanged at 0.
3%. Other measures of underlying inflation
, 
including the Persistent and Common Component of Inflation indicator (PCCI) and the 
Supercore indicator,
1 which are 
only available 
for the period to January
, 
also 
pointed 
to a continuation of the broad sideways movement of recent months (see Chart
 14). 
Nonetheless, each of the statistical and model
-based measures remained higher than 
their respective lows in 2016.
 Looking ahead measures of underlying inflation are 
expected to increase gradually, driven by a further strengthening of 
wage growth
 and the pic
k-up observed in 
domestic producer price inflation
. Chart

 (annual percentage changes)

 Notes: The latest observations are for
 February 2019 
(flash estimate) for 
HICP excluding ene
rgy
 and food
 and 
for January 2019
 for 
all 
the 
other measures
. The range of 
measures of 
underlying 
inflation
 consists of the following: HICP excluding energy; HICP excluding 
energy and 
unprocessed food; HICP excluding 
energy and 
food; HICP excluding energy,
 food, 
travel
-related items and clothing; the 10% 
trimmed mean; the 30% trimmed mean;
 and the
 weighted
 median of the HICP.
 Growth rates for
 HICP excluding energy and food for 
2015 
are distorted upwards 
owing
 to a methodological change (see Box 5 in this issue of the ECB™s Economic Bulletin
). Price pressures for non
-energy industrial goods 
increased at the later stages
 of the pricing chain
, while signals at the earlier stages were mixed
. At the very early 
stages,
 pipeline
 price pressures have rebounded, as t
he annual rate of change in oil 
prices and industrial raw material prices (in euro terms) 
increased markedly in 
February
. Global non
-energy producer price inflation
, in contrast,
 declined slightly 
further in Ja
nuary. The
 previous weak price pressures in the early stages 
have had an 
impact on import price and producer price inflation for intermediate goods, with both 
continuing to decline sinc
e August last year. 
At the 
later stages
, the year
-on-year 
growth of imp
ort prices for non
-food consumer goods increased to 1.3% in January 
from (a 
revised 
downward
s) 0.4% in December. 
Also
, domestic producer price 
inflation 
for these goods 
increased to 1.0% in January 2019, after recording a stable

 Recent 
developments in wage growth signal a continued upward trend and 
support the notion of a gradual buil
d-up in domestic cost pressures.
 Annual 
growth in compensation per employee increased to 2.5% in the third quarter of 2018, 
compared with 2.2% in the second
 quarter of 2018. Negotiated wage growth was 2.2% 
in the fourth quarter of 2018, up from 2.1% in the third quarter (see Chart 16
). More 
generally, wage 
growth 
indicators now stand
 visibly
 higher than in the first half of 2016. 
These developments are in lin
e with increasing 
tightness in the labour market. While 
the early phase of the strengthening of the 
growth
 in compensation per employee was 
driven mainly by wage drift
, most of the momentum in recent quarters
 came from 
the 
rise in the annual growth of nego
tiated wages
, which 
bolster
ed confidence in the
 positive outlook for
 wage growth

 Market
 and survey
-based
 measures of longer

lation expectations have 
fallen somewhat
. The five

-linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 
1.51% on 
6 March
 2019, 
13 basis points lower than the level which prevailed in 
mid
-December (see Chart 17).
 The forward profile of market
-based measures of 
inflation expectations continues
 to point towards a prolonged period of low inflation 
with a gradual return to inflation levels below, but close to, 2%.
 The risk
-neutral 
probability of negative average inflation over the next five years implied by inflation 
options markets is negligible,
 which suggests that markets currently consider the risk 
of deflation to be very low.
 According to the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters 
for the

 The March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projectio
ns expect underlying 
inflation to increase gradually over the projection horizon
. On the basis of the 
information available at mid
-February, these projections expect headline HICP 
inflation to average 
1.2
% in 2019, 
1.5
% in 2020 and 
1.6
% in 2021,
 compared w
ith 
1.6%, 1.7% and 1.8% 
respectively
 in the 
December 
2018 Eurosystem 
staff 
macroeconomic projections (see Chart
 18). This pattern reflects a sharp decline in 
HICP energy inflation 
in 2019, which is 
mainly accounted for by the strong drop in oil 
prices 
at the end of 2018 
and downward base effects related to their 
prior
 increase in 
2018. Looking ahead HICP energy prices are expected to grow at subdued rates 
consistent with the relatively flat oil price futures curve. 
HICP inflation excluding 
energy and fo
od will be on a gradual upward path
 supported by the more gradual
 but 
continued economic recovery
 and the 
tightening labour market conditions
, leading to 
higher domestic cost pressures
. HICP inflation excluding energy and f
ood is expected 
to rise from 1.2%
 in 2019 to 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6

At the same time, bank funding and

 3.8% in 
January 2019 from
 4.1% in 
Dec
ember 2018 (see Chart 19). This 
development shows the
 resilien
ce of M3 growth
 in the face of
 the declining mechanical 
contribution of APP purchases
. M3 growth has eased since late 2017, coinciding with 
the phasing
-out of
 net asset purchases
. This in turn i
mplies that the APP had a smaller 
positive impact on M3 growth. The narrow money aggregate M1, which includes the 
most liquid components of M3, continued to make a large contribution to broad money 
growth, despite declining to 6.2% in January. Money growth
 continued to receive 
support from sustained economic expansion and t
he low opportunity cost of holding 
the most liquid instruments in an environment of very low interest rates.

. 
Marketable instruments (i.e.
 M3 minus M2)
, which are curren
tly
 growing at a slow pace
 given the low remuneration of these instruments, had a neutral 
overall impact on M3 growth.
 Credit to the private sector remained the largest driver of broad money growth 
from a counterpart perspective (see Chart 20).
 In the
 cont
ext of 
the 
aforementioned
 phasing
-out of monthly
 net 
purchases under the 
APP,
 the 
positive 
contribution
 to M3 growth from
 general government securities held by the Eurosystem
 decreased further 
(see the 
red
 parts of the 
bars in
 Chart
 20). 
This has been 
largely 
offset by a moderate
 increase in the contribution from credit to the private sector since 
late 2017
 (see the 
blue
 parts of the 
bars in 
Chart
 20). 
While private credit remain
ed the 
main source of money creation, the decline in the contribution of th
e APP has recently 
been replaced by external monetary flows 
(see the yellow parts of the bars in Chart 
20) 
and credit to the general government
 (see the light green parts of the bars in Chart 
20). T
he increasing 
contribution from net external assets
 in par
t 
reflects investors™ 
preferences for euro area assets
 in the context of a greater aversion to risk linked to 
higher uncertainty
. Moreover, p
urchases of government securities by commercial 
banks 
have 
increasingly 
stabilised 
M3 in recent months
. 
These devel
opments
 mark an 
ongoing shift towards more self
-sustained sources of money creation

Heterogeneity across countries was considerable, given that political uncertainty was

 At the same time, the costs

 The 
repercussions of higher

s of funding 
through the issuance of debt securities 
on the overall composite cost of funding for

 have been rather limited
 owing to 
this type of funding™s

, bank funding

The reduction in bank lending rates for loans to NFCs, as well as for

granted to small firms),
 was particularly significant in those euro area countries that

 Fiscal developments
  36 6 Fiscal developments
 A mildly expansionary euro area fis
cal stance and the operation of automatic 
stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries 
where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries 
should continue to increase efforts to ach
ieve a more growth
-friendly composition of 
public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the 
European Union™s fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across 
countries remains essential to bolster the resilience 
of the euro area economy.
 Following an improvement last year, the euro area general government budget 
deficit is projected to deteriorate in 2019 and 
remain
 broadly stable in the 
following 
two 
years.
2 Based on data for 2018 that are
 still incomplete, t
he g
eneral 
government deficit ratio for the euro area 
is estimated to have stood at 0.5% of GDP, 
compared with 1
.0%
 of GDP in 2017. 
The fall in 2018
 was mainly the result of 
favourable cyclical conditions and declining interest payments
. The improvement is 
likely to be reversed this year on account of a significantly lower cyclically adjusted 
primary balance. The higher deficit is also expected to persist over the next two years 
(see Chart
 27).
 The outlook for the euro area general government deficit for the next two years 
has deteriorated compared with 
the 
December 2018 Eurosystem staff 
macroeconomic projections.
 The higher deficit is 
partly the outcome of a lower 
primary balance reflecting poli
cies that are more expansionary than previously 
expected in several of the largest euro area countries. It is also the result of a lower 
cyclical component given that the macroeconomic outlook has been revised 
downwards.
                                                                     2  See

. Notes: The data refer to the aggregate general government sector of the euro area.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is assessed to have been broadly
 neutral in 2018 but is projected to 
be mildly expansionary
 from 2019 onwards.
3 This profile is 
mainly driven by cuts to direct taxes and social security contributions in 
both Germany and France but it is also a result of relatively dynamic expenditure 
gro
wth in several countries.
 The decline in the euro area aggregate public debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
continue at a slower pace.
 According to the 
March 201
9 ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections
, the aggregate general government debt
-to
-GDP ratio in the 
euro area is 
expected to decline from 86.8% of GDP in 2017
4 to 
81.1%
 of GDP in 2021. The 
projected reduction in government debt is supported by both the negative interest 
rate
-growth rate differential
5 and continued 
primary surpluses (see Chart
 28), 
althou
gh d
eficit
-debt adjustments are expected to offset some of these effects. Over 
the projection horizon, the debt ratio 
is projected to 
fall or 
increase only slowly 
in all 
euro area 
countries
 but will continue to far exceed the reference value of 60% of GDP 
in a number of countries. Compared with the 
December 2018 projections
, the decline 
in the aggregate euro area debt
-to
-GDP ratio is expected to be more subdued 
over the 
whole horizon. This is mainly 
due to
 the
 increasing interest
-growth differential in 2019 
reflecting
 the downward revision of GDP growth, as well as lower primary balances
.                                                                     3  The fiscal stance reflects the direction and size of the stimulus from fiscal policies 
to the economy, 
beyond the automatic reaction of public finances to the business cycle. 
It is measured
 here
 as the change 
in 
the cyclically adjusted primary balance ratio net of government support to the financial sector
. For more

Gomez
-Salvador and Lucia Quaglietti
 This box looks at the current phase of the business cycle in 
major non
-euro 
area advanced economies with a view to assessing the factors behind the 
transition to weaker growth.
6 Although growth in non
-euro area advanced 
economies has been slowing, signals of a severe slowdown or recession appear 
contained at the cur
rent juncture and our baseline scenario remains one of a modest 
economic deceleration
.  From a historical perspective, the current expansion 
in 
non-euro area 
advanced 
economies has been relatively unusual in terms of both length and pace
. Following the global financial crisis, the recovery in activity started in a context of very 
large output gaps. The global expansion has now entered its tenth year and is on track 
to become the longest on record. Seen in a historical perspective, it has a
lso been 
comparatively shallow, with cumulated GDP growth of less than 20% since 2009, 
which is 
well below the levels seen in previous expansions (see Chart A). The 
sluggishness of the recovery might be consistent with the view that potential growth 
has fa
llen in the past decade.

  40 A more in
-depth analysis of the dynamics of the business cycle requires a more 
refined definition of its various phases.
 For the purpose of this box, we 
combine 
two approaches
. First we detect recessions
 relying on the pure technical definition, i.e. 
a recession implies at least two quarters of decline in the level of real GDP
, b
y adopting 
the Bry
-Boschan algorithm.
7 This is 
referred to
 in the literature a
s the ﬁ
classical
ﬂ approach to business cycle dating.
8 Once the dates of recessions have been 
established, we 
use
 the cyclical component of GDP
, obtained by de
-trending real GDP 
levels using estimates of potential GDP growth
, to distinguish different phases
 of 
cyclical expansions
.9 We separate movements in the GDP cycle into four additional 
phases according to whether actual GDP is expanding faster or slower than potential, 
and whether the output gap is in positive or negative territory
, imposing again a 
min
imum of two consecutive quarters in defining each phase
.10,11 Chart B 
presents 
an example
 of the five phases based on the aggregate of non
-euro area advanced 
economies.
 The second step allows us to provide a more refined characterisation of the 
different pha
ses of expansions.
 Specifically
, it allows us to take into account the 
implications stemming from a declining pace of potential growth. By combining 
recessions as identified in step 1 (red
-shaded area in Chart B) with the additional 
cyclical phases 
detected in step 2 (
light 
green
, dark green, yellow
 and orange shaded 
areas) we separate ﬁhard landingsﬂ, i.e. outright recessions, from ﬁsoft landingsﬂ, i.e. 
periods in which economic activity decelerates relative to potential, with the output 
gaps fallin
g into negative territory at times, 
but 
without entering a recession.

GDP.

 10  The analysis in this box

estimates of potential GDP. 
IMF
 and ECB 
estimates of potential 
growth are utilised.
 Annual data have 
been interpolated by cubic spline t
o obtain quarterly frequencies. Estimates of potential growth for the 
period before 1980 are obtained through simple de
-trending techniques.
 11  The OECD Composite Leading Indicators
 follow an alternative approach that focuses on anticipating 
turning points in economic activity.
 12  As a result of the two
-step approach, r
ecession phases 
could follow any of the four expansionary phases,

 to a lesser extent, phases B and D

 Notes: The chart shows a periodisation of 
five phases of the business cycle for advanced economies. In a first step we rely on the 
classical approach to business cycle dating in order to separate expansions from recessions, adopting the Bry
-Boschan algorithm 
applied to real GDP levels (in logs). T
he second step separates movements in the cyclical component of real GDP into four phases. 
Phase A refers to periods in which the output gap is still negative but GDP is growing 
faster than 
potential. Phase B indicates the case in 
which the output gap is p
ositive with GDP growing faster than potential. In phase C, a positive output gap is associated with GDP 
expanding slower than potential. Lastly, phase D characterises periods in which the output gap is negative and GDP is expandi
ng slower 
than potential.
 The latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2018.
 This methodology suggests that in several key advanced economies the output 
gap is currently in positive territory
, with activity still expanding faster than 
potential (see Chart C).
 Our estimates s
uggest that in the United States, Japan, 
Canada, Switzerland and Denmark output gaps are positive with activity still 
expanding at a faster pace than potential. Sweden, however, might have already 
transitioned into a phase in which activity is increasing a
t a pace below potential. By 
contrast, the recovery in the United Kingdom, Norway and Australia appears to have 
endured since the Great Recession, but some spare capacities still prevail in these 
economies.

t gap is still negative but GDP is growing 
faster than 
potential. Phase B indicates the case in which the output gap is positive 
with GDP growing faster than potential. In phase C, a positive output gap is associated with GDP expanding slower than potent
ial. Lastly, 
phase D characterises periods in which the output gap is negative and GDP is expanding slower than potential.
 The latest observation is 
for the fourth quarter of 2018.
 Past experience suggests that economies can operate above potential for quite
 some time, with economies more likely to experience 
a soft
 landing rather than 
outright recessions.
 Chart C indicates that in economies with positive output gaps 
GDP can grow above potential for about two to three years 
on average 
before the 
cycle turns. 
Moreover, in most cases, economies gradually slow down and experience 
a soft landing. Historical (unconditional) probabilities of transitioning between different 
phases of the business cycle suggest that, following a period in which the output gap is 
posit
ive and growth is expanding at a pace above potential (phase B), about one
-third 
of countries experience a recession, while two
-thirds transition to a phase of more 
modest growth as activity decelerates below potential growth.
 Our baseline scenario remains
 one of a modest economic deceleration in 
advanced economies.
 After peaking in 2017, GDP growth in advanced economies 
started to slow in the first half of 2018, and survey
-based indicators point to a further 
moderation at the turn of the year. The slowdown
 in manufacturing activity appears to 
be particularly pronounced, probably accentuated by growing uncertainties weighing 
on global investment and activity. The latest update of the IMF World Economic 
Outlook
 suggests that 
overall 
growth in 
the 
advanced eco
nomies will gradually decline 
from 2.3% in 2018 to 2.0% in 2019 and further to 1.7% in 2020, which is broadly in line 
with the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.
13  Overall, although
 growth in 
non-euro area 
advanced economies
 has been 
slowing, 
signals of a 
severe slowdown or recession
 appear contained
. This 
notwithstanding, downside risks abound and have increased lately. An exacerbation of

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 31 October 2018 to 29

  44  Liquidity conditions and mo
netary policy operations in the 
2period from 
31 October 2018 to 29 January 2019
 Prepared by 
Toshi Nakamura and Pamina Karl
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the 
seventh
 and 
eighth
 reserve maintenance periods of 2018, which ran f
rom 
31 October 
2018 to 18 December 2018 and from 19 December 2018 to 29 January 2019
 respectively.
 Throughout this period the interest rates on the main refinancing 
operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility remained 
unchange

continued to purchase public sector securities, covered bonds, asset
-backed 
securities and corporate sector securities as part of its asset purchase programme 
(APP), with a target of •
15 billion of 
net 
purchases on average per month until 
the 
end of December 2018. It then entered the reinvestment phase on 1
 January 2019.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the su
m of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •1,511.5
 billion, an increase of •51.8
 billion compared 
with the previous review period (i.e.
 the fifth and sixth maintenance periods of 
2018).
 This rise in liquidity needs was largely the resu
lt of an increase in net 
autonomous factors, which 
grew 
on average by •
51.4
 billion to •
1,384.5
 billion during 
the review period, while minimum reserve requirements increased on average by 
•0.4
 billion to •
127.1
 billion.
 The growth in net autonomous factor
s was due to 
an increase i
n liquidity
-absorbing factors 
and a decrease in liquidity
-providing factors
. Among 
liquidity
-absorbing factors, 
banknotes in circulation 
and other autonomous factors
 rose 
on average by •
16.8
 billion to •
1,210
 billion and by •
18.5
 billion to •
730.7
 billion 
respectively
, partly offset by a decline in government deposits of 
•23.3
 billion to 
•236.1
 billion. 
The most significant contribution to the growth in net autonomous 
factors came from a decrease in 
net assets denominated in euro,
 which 
declined 
on average by •
46.7
 billion to •
153.5
 billion. Eurosystem liabilities to non
-euro area 
residents in euro 
increased
 on average by •
50.5
 billion, reflecting a 
more 
pronounced 
seasonal pattern 
at the year
-end than at the quarter
-end during the
 previous review
 period
14 and thus contributing 
negatively
 to the 
(liquidity
-providing
) average net 
assets denominated in euro.
                                                                     14  Eurosystem liabilities to non
-euro area residents in euro mainly consist of euro
-denominated deposits in 
accounts held by non
-euro area 
central bank
s with the Eurosystem. Quarter
-ends, and to a lesser extent 
month
-ends, are typically af
fected by increases in these deposits, as commercial banks are more 
reluctant to accept cash, either in the unsecured or secured market, ahead of balance sheet reporting 
dates. On 31 December 2018 liabilities to non
-euro area residents denominated in euro 
increased 
to 
•459.3
 billion
, compared to an average of •315.3
 billion during the seventh and eighth maintenance 
periods. This implied a more pronounced effect than that observed on 30
 September 2018, when these 
liabilities increased to •301.7
 billion, comp
ared to an average of •264.7
 billion in the fifth and sixth 
maintenance periods.

 Employment growth and GDP in the euro area
 50  Employment growth and GDP in the euro area
 3Prepared by Vasco Botelho and António Dias da Silva
 This box analyses developments in the euro area labour market with respect to 
recent changes in GDP growth.
 The labour market remained relatively robust 
throughout 2018, in spite of the slowdown in real GDP growth. A decomposition of 
GDP into labour productivity, labour market outcomes and demographic trends shows 
a larger
 contribution to real GDP growth 
from
 employment (
see 
Chart A). In 
the first 
three quarters of 2018, economic growth was strongly supported by employment 
growth and by the stable decline in the unemployment rate. These developments
 contrast sharply with 
trends during the early period of the recovery and highlight the 
strength of the labour market in the euro area against the background of the slowdown 
in GDP growth in 2018. Indeed, despite the 
considerable
 heterogeneity observed 
acr
oss different euro area countries, the aggregate euro area unemployment rate 
was,
 in December 2018
, at its lowest since October 2008, with the 
employment
-to
-population ratio higher than in 2008
16. Chart
 A 
Decomposition of real GDP growth
 (percentages, year
-on-year growth rates)
 Sources: Eurostat and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: 
Real GDP is decomposed into labour productivity (real GDP/total hours worked), average hours worked per employed worker, 
employment rate (total employment/labour force), labour force participation rate (labour force/population) and total population. 
The 
labour force is defined as the sum of employed and unemployed workers.
 An estimated simple static relationship between employment/unemployment 
and GDP illustrates the good labour market performance since the beginning of 
the recovery in the euro area (see Chart B).
 Employment growth was 0.4 
percentage point above its expected level at the end of 2018, based on a long
-term 
static relationship between employment and GDP growth. These positive employment

Heterogeneity in unemployment rates rem
ains high, as more than 15 percentage points separate the 
highest and lowest rates of euro area countries. The employment
-to-population ratio, defined here as 
total employment divided by the segment of the population aged 15
-74, increased by 0.8 percentage
 point, from 58.7% to 59.5%, between the third quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2018.

 Employment growth and GDP in the euro area
  51 residuals since the start of the recovery became even more accentuated in the last 
three quarters of 2018, as the year
-on-year GDP slowdown was not accompanied by a 
proportionate deceleration in employment growth. The positive residuals 
are also 
translated into positive residuals of growth in total hours, i.e. total hours have grown by 
more than would be expected given the rate of GDP growth. Similarly, the 
unemployment rate also indicates a strong labour market performance, trending belo
w its expected value, as estimated by the traditional static Okun™s law. The observed 
strength of the labour market is broad
-based across countries
17, with the Okun 
relationship consistently showing a stronger than expected labour market 
performance
, which 
may be due to structural reforms that 
contributed to
 higher 
employment creation during the recent economic recovery

-on-year growth rate in total employment and 
the year

to the contemporaneous year

 However, the current labour market performance will be dependent on the 
nature of 
the 
shocks affecting the observed slowdown in real GDP.
 A static Okun 
approach conveys a long

the business cycle. A
llowing for a dynamic

 assess the time profile between real GDP growth and labour market 
outcomes 
would 
show that 
the labour market performance
 depends not only 
on current changes
 in real GDP growth
 but also on p
ast GDP innovations
19. In addition, 
as the implied Okun elasticitie

total hour and negative unemployment rate residuals; E
stonia, with negative employment and total hour 
residuals but positive unemployment rate residuals; and Malta, with positive employment, total hour and

 Employment growth and GDP in the euro area
  52 imply a somewhat protracted and mitigated response of 
total employment, 
the 
unemployment rate and total hours
. Moreover, the current strong labour market 
performance a
nd its subsequent path could 
als
o be affected by the specific nature of 
the shocks hitting the economy.
 Overall
, these results highlight the strong labour market dynamics since the 
beginning of the recovery and underline the recent robustness of the labour 
market in the face of the recen
t slowdown in real GDP in 2018.
 Indeed, while GDP 
growth decelerated by 0.7 percentage point during 2018, employment
 growth 
decelerated only by 0.2 percentage point, with the static Okun residuals becoming 
even more negative for unemployment and more posit
ive for employment and total 
hours. However, the labour market is also characterised by a protracted response to 
changes in GDP, and that will be one of the various factors influencing how the labour 
market evolves in subseq
uent quarters.

 Prices: a

 Prepared by Martin Eiglsperger
 Harmonised indices 
of 
consumer price
s 
(HICPs) for food, industrial goods, 
services and energy are measures 
that 
the ECB uses for its more detailed 
analysis of inflation in the euro area.
 With the release of the HICPs for January 
2019, these analytical groups 
- 
special aggregates 
- 
are 
based on a
 more exact 
allocation of products. As a result, the distinction between goods and services a
nd between unprocessed and processed food is now more precise. This improvement 
has been
 achieved by deriving special aggregates from
 the HICP™s generic 
classification
 Œ 
the ﬁEuropean Classification of Individual Consumption according to 
Purposeﬂ (ECOICOP)
 Œ 
which provides a more detailed level of breakdown than the 
product classification used thus far
. Another recent 
enhance
ment is the extended use 
of supermarket scanner data. ﬁWeb
-scrapingﬂ 
Œ 
an automated approach to collecting 
mass data from websites 
Œ i
s also being more broadly applied. Overall, these changes 
reflect better the actual consumer price developments in the economy, especially 
since they increase the coverage of sales prices.
 The ECB monitors and analyses inflation using the HICP grouped
 into
 unprocessed food, processed food, industrial 
goods
, services and energy.
 These special aggregates often exhibit distinct properties, such as the greater volatility 
of the HICPs for unprocessed food and for energy. Some measures of underlying 

inflation are
 derived by excluding some of these special aggregates.
20 In general, 
special aggregates are used to better analyse and understand the drivers of inflation.
 Statistical offices in the European Union have introduced a further level of 

detail into the HICP cl
assification by consumption purpose.
 At its most detailed 
level, 
ECOICOP includes around 300 sub
-categories, for example ﬁMobile telephone 
equipmentﬂ (formerly the most detailed level of breakdown grouped all telephone and 

telefax equipment in one category
). ﬁRepair of telephone or telefax equipmentﬂ has 
also been grouped as a separate category. Statistical offices
 are providing 
breakdowns of 
the
ir national HICPs 
in accordance with
 ECOICOP
 for different time 
spans. While France and Lithuania 
have back
-calcu
lated the entire time series, 
Ireland and Finland
 have only published
 data from 2017 on
wards
. Price indices for analytical groups based on the more detailed classification
 of 
products by consumption purpose
 have been introduced w
ith the publication 
of the 
euro area HICP for January 2019.
 Eurostat
, the statistical office of the 
European Union, has 
calculated 
these new special aggregates
 back to January 2017
 for the euro area and the European Union as a whole, as well as for all individual EU 

Member States. The old HICP special aggregates have been replaced. Up to 

December 2016, data for HICP special aggregates
 remain based on the less detailed 
breakdown, implying a statistical break in the respective time series.
 Chart A illustrates 
how the more detailed level of product breakdown impacts on the HICPs for

  54 unprocessed food and for industrial goods excluding energy.
 Apart from the split into 
unprocessed and pro
cessed food
, the effects of the more detailed 
data on
 special 
aggregates
 are 
relatively 
minor
. Nevertheless, this may have some implications for the 
forecasting and seasonal adjustment of HICP special aggregates.

  Source: Eurostat.
 Having HICPs for food, goods, services and energy derived from a more 
detailed classification
 of products by consumption purpose
 is an important 
improvement.
 It helps to better identify d
rivers of inflation
, such as
 wage increases for 
services activities
. Econometric modelling of inflation by 
analytical 
groups 
can also be 
expected to 
benefit from the more precise allocation.
 With t
he publication of HICPs for January 2019, the use of web
-scraped data 
has expanded
 further
; supermarket scanner data are already used by several 
statistical offices
. Traditionally, prices in brick
s-and-mortar shops are collected by 
price observers
, who foc
us on 
the 
prices of the most sold product variants and 
visit
 outlets
 at least once a
 month
; for more volatile prices the visits are more frequent
. 
While in 
many
 EU Member States price collection in shops is still 
central to
 HICP data 
sampling, 
many
 statistical offices have started 
or 
are intensifying
 the use o
f scanner 
and web
-scraped data.
 These new data collection 
methods
 provide 
considerably
 more price data, 
reflecting
 product variability
, and 
they 
also 
cover a greater number of 
shopping 
days 
sam
pled 
within a month.
 In contrast to the standard survey
-based price 
collection in bricks
-and-mortar stores, index calculation using s
canner data 
uses
 turnover by product bar codes
 (Global Trade Item Number, GTIN) or another 
identification code
. Prices are 
derived by dividing the turnover of a certain product
, 
identified by its item code,
 by the amount sold.
 Scanner data ensure that many more 
products are included over a longer time period. Prices derived from scanner data are 
closer to the average for the m
onth, compared with point
-in-time price collection.

  55 New data collection methods require new statistical approaches.
 The 
significantly
 larger
 volume
 of data requires statistical 
offices
 to 
treat
 the 
data in a
n automated manner. The compilation of product
-specific price indices from scanner 
data poses several challenge
s, i
n particular the treatment of discount prices and the 
greater purchase volumes
 trigge
red by discounts
. Low turnover in post
-discount 
periods implies that price indices, weighted by 
sales vol
umes
, 
tend to
 be prone to 
a downward 
drift
 when es
tablished price index formulae are
 applied.
21 In most cases, 
statistical offices that use scanner data currently compile drift
-free indices by not 
incorporating index weights derived from concurrent 
turnover. S
tatistical researchers 
are currently developing methods to
 tak
e account
 of turnover by means
 of expenditure 
weights while avoiding downward biases
.22 Relaunched products may
 also 
cause compilation issues
 when scanner data 
are used
. While maintain
ing
 their essential product features, 
relaunched products
 may change their 
item
 code and sell at a higher price. Compiling price indices at the 
level of item codes
 would 
not capture
 such price increases.
 It is therefore necessary to 
develop methods that id
entify relaunches also when item codes have changed.
 A larger range of
 product variants, 
a greater 
frequency of recording and 
higher 
coverage of the reporting month are the three main ways scanner and 
web
-scraped data affect 
the 
HICP.
 Scanner data 
typicall
y refer to
 a period of two 
to
 three weeks
 of a month
. HICP flash estimates may cover less than this
. Therefore, the 
use of scanner data may occasionally lead to higher and/or more frequent revisions to 
flash estimates
. 
Overall, t
he larger amount of data im
plies that 
monthly price indices 
are more affected by the 
price
 setting
 of supermarkets and internet retailers. 
For 
example,
 weekend days
, as well as 
the 
shopping days before Easter and Christmas
, are covered better 
using
 these new methods
. Scanner data be
tter indicate sharp change
s in prices related to discounts.
 Sales 
prices around Christmas may have an impact, in particular when scanner data are 
incorporated for the first time, since the HICP formula requires chain
-linking over 
December. Generally, with the use of scanner data, sales prices are covered more 
comp
rehensively, both across time and across products, implying that scanner 
data
-based price indices may be significantly more volatile.

 A new method for the package holiday price index in Germany and its impact on HICP inflation

  56 5 A new method for 
the 
package holiday price ind
ex
 in 
Germany and its impact on HICP inflation rates
 Prepared by Martin Ei
glsperger
 Harmonised indices 
of 
consumer price
s (HICPs) 
are regularly updated 
for 
changes in consumption weights and the items included, and on occasion also 
for methodological improvements.
 One such improvement is 
a change in the 
way
 the 
price ind
ex for p
ackage holidays 
is calculated 
in the HICP for Germany
, which was 
implemented with the 
HICP 
release for January 2019. Th
is has led to
 revisions 
of annual rates of change not only for Germany, but also for the euro area as a whole.
 The German price index for
 package holidays now shows a more meaningful 
seasonal pattern.
 While the previous method used 
seasonal expenditure weights 
Œ i.e. different weights in the price index for package holidays taken at different times of 
the year
 Œ the new approach 
uses
 annual weights that are kept fixed over the entire 
year. 
This means that
 the price index for package holidays is no longer affected by 
the 
switch between seasonal
 weights at the 
beginning and end
 of seasons. 
However, t
he application of fixed weights 
implies
 that
, during out
-of-season periods, when prices for 
seasonal trips are not observable, the missing changes in prices have to be estimated. 
For instance, in summer it is necessary to include estimates for the changes in prices 
of trips normally taken in the win
ter, and in the winter it is necessary to use estimates 
for the changes in prices in the summer. The estimation
 is done by means of 
imputation, 
where changes in holiday prices in out
-of-season periods
 are estimated on 
the basis of
 the 
price dynamics of oth
er trips actually conducted
 in that season
. 
Whereas t
he former approach treated winter and summer holidays separately
, the new integrated sample 
also 
includes destinations to which trips are 
made
 over
 the 
entire calendar year. 
This establishes a 
relationship between price developments of 
seasonal trips
. The methodological change has led to a more pronounced seasonal profile for 
the package holiday price index for Germany and also for the euro area
. Chart A 
shows that the index for the euro area ha
s greater seasonal
 variation
 than before
, with 
higher
 values in 
the 
summer months
 and lower values
 in 
the 
winter months.
 While the 
new index 
varies more between seasonal peaks and troughs
, 
however, 
its profile is 
less erratic

 The revised data have had a considerable impact on the annual rates of change 
of several aggregates of the euro area HICP for the first year for which the 
methodological change was incorporated; afterwards the impact is more 
moderate (see Chart B).
 Index numbers from 2015 onwards

e holidays. 
The annual

 for
 2015 are

 that 
are based on differing

the box entitled
 ﬁNew features in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices:
 analytical 
groups, scanner data and web

 in this issue of the Economic Bulletin
. Users 
must
 look through the distortions in annual growth rates
, especially
 for 
2015, when assessing past inflation developments.
 This 
is particularly the case,
 for i
nstance
, for
 euro area 
HICP inflation excluding 
food and 
energy as a measure of 
underlying inflation (see Chart C). The 
revision of the
 series 
distorts
 the picture of 
successive years of low underlying inflation. For analytical purposes, users can 
correct 
the series of annual percentage changes in different ways.
24 A simple 
approach to obtaining annual inflation rates that do not comprise data based on 
different methods is to use annual rates of change 
up to December 201
5 based on the 
index before the method
ological change, and to use annual growth rates that are 
derived from the index calculated according
 to the new method
 from January 2016
.25                                                                     24  Approaches to mitigating the impact of the distortions could be facilitated by the 
use of time series 
analysis techniques such as seasonal adjustment.
 25  However, 
this method cannot be used to derive an HICP time series. The HICP is a price index based on 
a Laspeyres
-type formula (
See Eurostat, ﬁ
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), Methodological 
Manual
ﬂ, November 2018, p. 170.
), meaning that annual expenditure weights are applied to component 
indices rather than their growth rates.

 Interest rate
-growth differential and government debt dynamics
  60 6 Interest rate
-growth differential and government debt 
dynamics
 Prepared by Cristina Checherita
-Westphal
 The difference between the average interest rate that governments pay on their 
debt and the nominal growth rate of the economy
 is a 
key variable for debt 
dynamics and sovereign sustainability analysis.
 The
 change in 
government 
debt 
between two years equals the interest paid on the stock of debt, the primary deficit 
(excess of expenditure
, excluding interest payments
, over revenue)
, and
 other factors 
(deficit
-debt adjustments). For 
ratios
 to
 GDP, the change in debt
 is then mainly 
determined by the 
primary balance 
and the difference between the interest rate and 
the GDP growth rate. 
If the interest rate
-growth differential (
) is stri
ctly positive, a 
primary fiscal surplus is needed to stabilise or reduce the debt
-to
-GDP ratio. T
he higher the initial debt level, the higher the
 primary surplus will need to be. Conversely, 
a persistently negative
  on government debt
 (<) would imply that debt ratios 
could be reduced even in the presence of primary budget deficits (lower than the debt 
effect induced by the differential).
26 Recently, 
 has turned negative
 in most advanced economies
, including 
euro area
 sovereigns.
 Accord
ing to the European Commission™s 
Autumn 
2018 forecast, all euro area countries except Italy had negative 
 in 2017
. The 
differential 
is projected to 
increase in 12 euro area countries by 2020, but to remain in 
negative territory for all countries excep
t Italy.
 The
 debate on the role of fiscal policy
 with
 a persistently negative interest 
rate
-growth differential has been revived by 
Olivier 
Blanchard in his 2019 AEA 
Presidential address
.27 Using the 
US example
, Blanchard 
makes the point that the 
costs of g
overnment debt may be smaller than generally assumed in the policy 
discussion. 
This is because the 
(US) safe interest rate 
(a proxy of marginal bond rates) 
is below the nominal 
GDP 
growth rate and this is more the historical norm rather than 
the exception.
 With a negative 
 differential, public debt may have no fiscal cost. It 
may still have welfare costs, but these may 
also
 be lower than typically assumed. An 
implication of this proposition would be that the US can sustain (roll
-over) high(er) 
debts wi
thout significant costs. 
The author stresses, however, 
that the purpose of 
the 
lecture 
is 
not to argue for higher debt per se, but to allow for a richer discussion of debt 
policy and appropriate debt rules than is currently the case.
 Theoretical models 
do not provide clear cut conclusions with respect to the 
sign and size of the interest rate
-growth differential on government debt.
 In 
                                                                    26  =  +
    (.1) Equation 1 (the typical debt accumulation equation)
 provides a simple accounting framework to 
decompose the change in the government gross debt
-to-GDP ratio (
) into its key drivers, consisting of: 
(i) the ﬁsnowball effectﬂ, i.e. the impact 
of the difference between the average nominal interest rate 
charged on government debt (
) and the nominal GDP growth rate (
) multiplied by the debt
-to-GDP 
ratio in th
e previous period (
); (ii) the primary budget balance (surplus) ratio (
); and (iii) the 
deficit
-debt adjustment as a share of GDP (

) or the stock
-flow adjustment, comprising factors that 
affect debt but are not included in the budget ba
lance (such as acquisitions or sales of financial assets).

28 Moreover, 
it 
must
 be recognised that 
such models analyse the ﬁrisk

 rateﬂ, while accounting for 
sovereign credit risk or possibility of default would raise the cost of public debt.
29 Empirically, t

around 
one percentage point.
30 Positive value
s are also 
typically 
observed for the 
largest 
euro area 
economies (see Chart A). On the other 
hand, negative 
 values are observed for advanced economies during periods of 
overheating or, more generally, for emerging economies. As documented in the 
empirical literature
31, the 
main 
factors behind the ﬁpuzzleﬂ
 of persistently negative 
differentials in emerging economies are 
financial repression, including during periods 
of hyperinflation, and to some extent also the 
income 
catch
-up effect. Finally, the 
primary balance also plays an important role
 in debt dynami
cs. Even in the presence 
of negative 
, large enough primary deficits would prevent debt ratios from 
stabilising. In this respect, primary surpluses in most euro area countries have helped 
put debt ratios on a downward path.

1980s, 
to a certain extent
 the 
GDP 
growth rate
 has done so as well
. Since the 
1980s in particular, real interest rates in advanced economies have declined and, in 
the wake of the global financial crisis
, plummeted to exceptionally low levels. This 
development has often been associated with a decline in the 
estimated 
natural or

, which in turn
 has been linked in m

 Notes: 
The chart depicts 
the difference between the 
average nominal interest rate charged on government debt
 () and the nominal GDP 
growth rate (
). In annual terms,
  is defined as the ratio between total interest payment at time t and the debt stock at t
-1, then averaged 
over the periods shown in the chart. In general, A
MECO
 series cover the general govern
ment debt according to 
the 
ESA-2010 definition 
(for the US, federal debt). The horizontal lines represent the average 
 over 1966
-2010 (not all countries in the sample available for 
the entire period, as explained in Escolano et al., 2017). 
Countries s
hown are the six largest euro area economies. 
Euro area 12 includes 
Belgium, Germany, Ireland (excluding extreme outliers for the years 2015 and 2016),
 Greece, Spain, 
France,
 Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. The values sho
wn in the chart for euro area 12 represent simple averages of 
 across 
the sample. The other c
ountr
y groups 
are as described in 
Escolano et al. (2017) and broadly 
according to the IMF definitions for 
advanced and emerging economies.
 Empirical literatur
e34 identifies several factors 
that influenc
e the dynamics of 
the differential.
 Population ageing has been found to be a relevant factor in the 
decline of the natural rate of interest, but also in the decline of potential GDP growth.
35 In addition, t
he literature 
identifies
 the ﬁglobal savings glutﬂ (as proxied by 
the 
current 
account surpluses of emerging economies) and the one
-off effect of setting up the 
European Monetary Union
36 as relevant factors contributing to the decline of 
 across advance
d economies. 
Cyclical conditions and economic policies 
also 
seem to 
play an important role. The differential can increase quickly in recessions, especially in 
high
-debt countries. More generally, weaker fiscal positions (higher debt and deficits) 
are found
 to be associated with higher 
. Table 
A presents historical 
 averages
 for 
euro area 
12, taking into
 account high public debt ratios and the position 
in the business cycle. 
The differential is higher, on average, when public debt is high 
(for the 
period 1999
-2017,1.7 percentage point when debt is 
greater
 than or equal to 
90% of GDP versus 0.0 
when
 debt 
is lower than 90%; similar results are recorded for 
the longer period since 1985). This is partly explained by the position in the cycle: in 
                                                                    34  See, for instance,

 7 The European Commission™s 2019 assessment of 
macroeconomic imbalanc
es and progress on reforms
 Prepared by Nick Ligthart
 On 27 February 2019, the 
European 
Commission published its annual 
assessment of macroeconomic imbalances and 
the 
progress made with 
structural reforms based on the country
-specific recommendations (CSRs)
 as adopted in July 2018.
 This assessment is a key part of the European Semester 
framework for 
coordinating
 economic and fiscal policies across the EU. Within this 
context
, the macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP) provides a framework 
for
 assess
ing
 macr
oeconomic imbalances. It aims 
to
 prevent the emergence of harmful 
imbalances 
and to
 actively correct 
imbalances
 where they 
have
 already 
become 
excessive.
40 Macroeconomic imbalances
 According to the Commission, the number of countries experiencing 
imbalances
 has increased to 13 overall
, from 11 in 2018 (see Table A).
 This year, 
three countries have been assessed as experiencing ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ 
Œ Italy
, Cyprus 
and Greece. 
While Italy and Cyprus were also included in this category last 
year, 
Greece has been included 
in this exercise 
for the first time this year 
as it 
exit
ed its financial assistance programme in summer 2018. Its major challenges are high 
public debt, 
a negative net international investment position, 
a very 
high share of 
non-performing loans, 
a still
-high unemployment rate and low growth potential. 
Cyprus 
is still facing challenges related to high levels of both non
-performing loans and 
external, private and government debt. For Italy, the Commission finds that fiscal 
sustainabil
ity risks, as well as broadly stalling reform progress and backtracking, are 
now overshadowing the progress made in previous years. In addition, the Commission 
recategorised two countries in this year™s assessment. 
Croatia
 was recategorised
 from 
ﬁexcessive
 imbalancesﬂ to ﬁimbalancesﬂ, 
owing to a decrease of 
private, public and 
external sector debt
, among other factors
. Romania was 
also 
recategorised
, 
from ﬁno 
imbalancesﬂ to ﬁimbalancesﬂ
, due to 
factors including reduced
 competitiveness and a 
widening of cur
rent account imbalances.
                                         
               
 40  To identify 
imbalances, the Commission uses a standardised scoreboard to select countries that require 
an in
-depth review. There are three possible outcomes from th
ese in
-depth reviews: 
ﬁno imbalances
ﬂ, ﬁimbalancesﬂ
 or 
ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ
. If the Commission identif
ies imbalances, the country concerned 
will receive policy recommendations meant to address 
them
. When the imbalances are 
assessed as 
being 
so se
vere that they are found to be ﬁ
excessiv
eﬂ
, the Commission can take further action by 
recommendi
ng that the Coun
cil activates the excessive imbalance procedure (EIP).

 Notes: 
The three countries in blue (Croatia, Romania and Greece) are those whose MIP classification changed in 2019. For all countri
es 
in the ﬁno imbalancesﬂ group, the Commission had already assessed 
that no imbalances existed in the first stage of the procedure 
Œ the 
Alert Mechanism Report. Thus, no in
-depth review was drafted for any of these countries.
 Despite the persistence of excessive imbalances in some Member States, the 
excessive imbalance pro
cedure has never been triggered since the 
introduction of the MIP in 2012.
 Under this so
-called corrective arm of the MIP, the 
Council can require a Member State experiencing excessive imbalances to submit a 
corrective action plan and can eventually impose
 fines
, if needed.
 The repeated 
non-activation of the excessive imbalance procedure risks undermining the credibility 
and effectiveness of the overall procedure. 
Chart A shows that a quarter of EU 
Member States have experienced excessive imbalances that pe
rsisted for multiple 
consecutive years. While some countries have managed to reduce the severity of the 
imbalances over time, the persistence of excessive imbalances over several years 
in 
some countries 
indicates that the correction of imbalances could be 
better facilitated 
by the MIP
. Applying all available tools 
Œ including 
activating
 the corrective arm of the 
procedure for countries with excessive imbalances 
Œ could increase the procedure™s 
effectiveness and credibility. This has also been explicitly cal
led for by the five 
Presidents in their 2015 report
41 and, more recently, by the European Court of 
Auditors
42.

 Notes: The chart shows those countries assessed by the European C
ommission as experiencing

 indicated. A country subject to an economic adjustment programme enters the MIP automatically once the programme ends. In 201
2 no country was assessed as having excessive imbalances.
 Persistent 
macroeconomic imbalances 
Œ whether excessive or not 
Œ leave 
Member States vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic shocks
 and tend to 
increase the probability of recessions, which often carry high social and 
economic costs
. While the EU has experienced economic
 growth for the past seven 
years, uncertainties related to geopolitical factors
, 
the threat of protectionism 
and macroeconomic imbalances 
pose downside risks to economic activity. It is therefore 
important that countries undertake ambitious reform efforts 
to strengthen the 
resilience of their economies to adverse 
shocks.
 Debt levels are still historically high in some Member States, for both 
government and private debt, which makes responding to 
a downturn or to 
negative shocks more difficult.
 Higher economic growth has helped 
to reduce 
debt-to
-GDP ratios 
in recent years
, but debt levels 
in several cases 
remain 
very 
high. 
Corporations have managed to reduce debt levels faster than households. At the 
same time, in a number of countries the high 
public and private indebtedness is 
reflected in large stocks of external debt, which highlights the need to ensure sufficient 
current account surplus
es. To 
support rebalancing and avoid new imbalances 
in cost
 competitiveness 
across the EU, accelerating gro
wth 
in 
unit labour cost
s in some countries 
has
 to be carefully monitored.
 In particular, in 
countries 
with current account surpluses 
that
 the Commission finds 
are experiencing 
a lack of domestic demand
 and labour 
shortages
, unit labour cost growth
 that is
 higher than 
the 
euro area average might 
facilitate rebalancing among euro area countries. At the same time, a relative 
deterioration of cost
 competitiveness in more vulnerable countries 
with relatively high 
unemployment 
should be monitored carefully so tha
t a reversal of the
 positive
 adjustment achieved in 
recent
 years can be avoided.

Reform progress
 Reforms remain 
crucial to address
 these imbalances, and progress on 
recommended reforms is assessed annually by the Commission.
 Specifically, 
the Commission ha
s reviewed the implementation of the 
CSRs
 that were adopted in 
July 2018 by the Council. Each CSR provides a Member State with guid
ance in a 
specific policy area.
 The Commission assessment again finds only limited progress on 
recommended reforms.
 The progr
ess made is evaluated using five categories: ﬁno 
progressﬂ, ﬁlimited progressﬂ, ﬁsome progressﬂ, ﬁsubstantial progressﬂ and ﬁfull 
implementationﬂ.
43 Table B summarises this year™s assessments. Out of 73 CSRs, 
none saw full implementation, and substantial pr
ogress was made in only two cases. 
For the overwhelming majority of CSRs (more than 90%), the Commission found that 
Member States made at best some or limited progress. On two CSRs, no progress 
was made. According to the Commission methodology, ﬁno progres
sﬂ means that the 
Member State concerned did not even ﬁcredibly announceﬂ measures that would aim 
to address the policy recommendation. Finally, 
and most concerning, 
despite 
being 
very vulnerable
, the countries experiencing excessive imbalances did not mak
e significantly more reform progress during the last year than the 
EU 
average. The same 
is true for the countries experiencing imbalances. Overall, progress on reforms this 
year was 
as weak 
as last year.

Commission even finds cases of backtracking on reforms, for instance regarding the 
long
-term sustainability of public finances (including pensions).
 Further reforms 
to 
improv
e the investment environme
nt are essential to
 stimulate well
-targeted investment that improves productivity, potential growth 
and resilience.
 The Commission finds 
that 
the highest barriers to investment are low 
quality of institutions and burdensome regulations. Creating an investm
ent-friendly 
environment will help strengthen investment focus
ed on productivity and growth 
Œ essential at this point in the business cycle. In turn, investment needs to be well
 targeted to be most effective. While investment in education, research, develo
pment 
and innovation is needed in most EU countries, it is important that 
it flows to those 
sectors where it would most increase productivity growth and competitiveness. To this 
end, the Commission has 
taken the positive step of adding
 a new annex to the c
ountry 
reports. The annex identifies country
-specific investment needs and bottlenecks, and 
also aims 
to
 better align the use of EU fund
s with the European Semester™s analysis.

 1 Taking stock of the Eurosystem™s
 asset purchase 
programme after the end of net asset purchases
 Prepared by Felix Hammermann, 
Kieran Leonard, 
Stefano Nardelli and 
Julian von Landesberger
 Following the Governing Council™s decision in December
 2018 to end net asset 
purchases under the Euros
ystem™s asset purchase programme (APP), this article 
reviews the implementation and effects of 
the
 asset purchases. The APP has proved 
to be an adaptable and effective instrument to ease monetary and financial conditions, 
foster economic recovery, countera
ct disinflationary pressures and anchor inflation 
expectations, thereby supporting a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation 
towards price stability. The APP has been part of a package of policy measures 
together with negative interest rates on 
the d
eposit facility
, forward guidance and 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), jointly creating synergies that 
have enhanced the effectiveness of each of the package™s individual components. 
From an implementation viewpoint, the Eurosystem ens
ured that asset purchases 
were conducted smoothly and flexibly by striving for market neutrality and mitigating 
unintended side effects for market functioning.
 Whereas net asset purchases have come to an end, 
principal payments from maturing 
securities pur
chased under 
the APP will continue to be reinvested as this, together 
with enhanced forward guidance, provides the monetary accommodation that the 
Governing Council judges to be required for the 
continued sustained convergence 
of 
inflation 
to levels that a
re below, but close to, 2% over the medium term
. 1 Introduction
 The APP is part of a package of policy measures that was initiated in mid
-2014 to support the monetary policy transmission mechanism and provide the 
amount of policy accommodation needed to en
sure price stability.
 The room for 
further interest rate cuts had become very limited after monetary conditions were 
eased in the wake of the financial and sovereign debt crises by cutting key interest 
rates and deploying unprecedented measures to support 
monetary policy 
transmission. The APP, in combination with negative interest rates on 
the deposit 
facility
, forward guidance and TLTROs, has helped the ECB meet its price stability 
objective. The APP comprises the third covered bond purchase programme (CBP
P3, 
launched on 20
 October
 2014), the asset
-backed securities purchase programme 
(ABSPP, launched on 21
 November
 2014), the public sector purchase programme 
(PSPP, launched on 9

stable by reinvesting principal payments from maturing securities.
 2 The monetary policy rationale for launching the APP
 Follow
ing a double
-dip recession in the wake of the financial and sovereign 
debt crises, the euro area experienced a prolonged period of deleveraging, an 
atypically shallow recovery and persistently weak inflation.
 Bank lending 
conditions started to deteriorate 
and loan volumes (in particular those involving 
non-financial corporations) to contract at the end of 2011. Persistent weakness in the 
underlying growth momentum perpetuated capacity underutilisation, as also visible in 
high levels of unemployment. Inflati
on rates exhibited a protracted downward trend: in 
the core components, this was due to the general economic weakness, while declines 
in energy and food prices influenced the headline readings. Euro area inflation was 
generally 
projected
 to remain weak and
 fall over time, as reflected in successive 
downward adjustments in macroeconomic projections by most international 
organisations and the ECB (see Chart
 1). Euro area annual HICP inflation fell to 
-0.2% 
in December
 2014, and Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections entailed further 
substantive downward revisions of inflation forecasts, from 1.1% to 0.7% in 2015 and 
from 1.4% to 1.3% in 2016.

13-2014 contributed to a downtrend in inflation 
expectations and an increasing risk of those expectations becoming unmoored 
from the ECB™s price
 stability objective.

  71 assigned a probability 
of 
almost 50% to deflation and 
saw
 only a marginal probability 
of annual inflation reaching a level close to 2% or
 above (see Chart
 9 below). These 
developments indicated risks that too prolonged a period of low inflation could become 
entrenched in inflation expectations, with adverse consequences for price stability.
 To reverse the downtrend in inflation and forestal
l a disanchoring of inflation 
expectations, the APP was designed to expand and complement existing 
monetary policy measures.
 With the APP, announced in January
 2015, the PSPP, 
an additional programme
 consisting of purchases of debt securities issued by pub
lic entities, was launched
 to
 complement the two ongoing asset purchase programmes, 
the 
CBPP3 and the ABSPP.
 During the period 2015
-2018 net asset purchases under the APP were the 
principal instrument of monetary policy and their size and duration were lin
ked 
to achieving a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards price 
stability.
 In January 2015, following the APP announcement, net asset purchases 
were made the principal policy instrument and 
the Governing Council adopted a 
structured forward 
guidance. The first building block of this guidance 
pertained to 
the 
principal instrument itself and featured a combination of 
a time
-dependent and 
state
-dependent 
formulation
. The time
-dependent leg stated that the net asset 
purchases were intended to run at a certain 
monthly 
pace 
at least 
until a specific date 
(see Figure
 1). The state
-dependent leg established a
n explicit
 link to the price 
stability objective (ﬁor beyond, if
 necessary, and in any case until the Governing 
Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation 
aim
ﬂ). As shown in Figure 1, following the first announcement in January 2015 the 
Governing Council extended the prog
ram
me through a series of recalibrations, in 
which the minimum horizon for the monthly purchases was pushed back sequentially 
and the pace of purchases was adjusted as necessary to 
advance 
progress towards 
the sustained adjustment. The second building bloc
k of the 
forward
 guidance 
pertained to the 
period
 over which the Governing Council expected that it would not be 
appropriate to raise the key ECB interest rates. 
In March 2016 t
he length of that 
period
 was linked to the end of the net asset purchases.

  73 The APP was designed to take into account 
both 
market structures
 and 
the 
institutional set
-up of the euro area.
 Purchases of public debt instruments were 
guided by the ECB capital key, which 
specifies
 the share 
of the ECB™s capital
 attributable to each of the 
national central banks. At the same time, private sector 
programmes were based on the market capitalisation of the eligible bonds included in 
the purchases.
 3 Implementation issues
 3.1
 Market neutrality
 When implementing the AP
P, the Eurosystem aimed to ensure market neutrality 
in order to minimise the impact on relative prices within the eligible universe 
and unintended side effects on market functioning.
 For instance, while aimed at 
affecting bond prices, the APP purchases wer
e conducted with a view to preserving 
the price discovery mechanism and limiting distortions in market liquidity. Key features 
designed to ensure market neutrality in APP implementation are detailed below.
 Clear and observable monthly APP targets were defined, 
with 
seasonal patterns 
in market liquidity
 also being taken into account
. The average monthly APP target 
set ex ante by the Governing Council was decomposed internally into monthly 
purchase guidance pe
r programme. The programme operating in the most liquid 
market, the PSPP, acted as a buffer to ensure the precise fulfilment of the overall 
monthly purchase target. In addition, the Eurosystem took into account seasonal 
patterns in fixed income market acti
vity, such as the decline in market liquidity from 
mid
-July to late August and in December. Purchase activity was front and back
-loaded 
around these periods (see Chart
 2). In all months, the purchase guidance was 
expressed in monthly totals, rather than st
rict daily volumes, providing flexibility in the 
day-to
-day execution of purchases.

 2 Pace and composition of net APP purchases
 (EUR billions)
  Source: ECB.
 Note: The average monthly APP targets were first set by the ECB Governing Council at the beg
inning of the PSPP in March 2015. 
 Comprehensive ex ante communication on the operational parameters of the 
APP supported the price discovery mechanism.
 The parameters defined the 
operational scope of the APP through (i
) stringent eligibility criteria aligned with the 
procedures in place for the Eurosystem collateral framework
45 and using the expertise 
of Eurosystem collateral management experts, (ii)
 maturity restrictions,
46 (iii)
 the 
exclusion of certain issuers,
47 (iv)
 pricing frameworks to ensure that purchases were 
conducted taking into account available market prices, and (v)
 different limit 
systems.
48 The Eurosystem took a rule
-based approach to the composition of purchases 
with a view to maintaining adequate diversifi
cation across issuers and 
counterparties.
 APP purchases were broad
-based across jurisdictions, maturity 
segments, issuers and types of eligible bond in terms of different coupon types or 
different collateral types
, for instance
. For the PSPP, the ECB™s cap
ital key provided a 
straightforward, stable guide
line
 for the composition of purchases across jurisdictions.
                                                                     45  Assets were thus subject to a minimum credit quality requirement of step
 3 on the Eurosystem™s
 harmonised rating scale, which implied having at least one credit rating provided by an external credit 
assessment institution accepted under the Eurosystem credit assessment framework. Assets were also 
required to be euro
-denominated and issued and settl
ed within the euro area
. For ABSs
, the underlying 
debtors were required to be predominantly located within the euro area.
 46  At the end of 2018, t
he minimum remaining maturity for the PSPP was one year and the maximum 
remaining maturity
 30
 years
. The minim
um remaining maturity 
for the CSPP was
 six months 
and
 the 
maximum remaining maturity
 30
 years. No maturity restrictions were defined for the CBPP3 or the 
ABSPP.
 47  Securities
 issued by credit institutions were not eligible for the CSPP.
 Debt securities of bad banks were 
not eligible for the PSPP.
 48  The issue
 share
 limit for the private sector purchase programmes was 70%, with lower limits for the 
CSPP in specific cases. 
The 
PSPP issue 
share 
limit was 33% of the issued amount outstanding
, subject 
to case
-by
-case verification that it would not lead to the Eurosystem having a blocking majority for the 
purpose of collective action clauses (in which case it was set at 25%). The 
PSPP issuer limit was also 
33%.

 Taking stock of the Eurosystem™s asset purchase programme after the end of net asset

  75 The Eurosystem geared its monthly purchase allocation to align a jurisdiction™s

share of the ECB capital key by the end of the net asset purchase phase.

. Chart
 3 Deviation in the share of net cumulative purchases relative to the ECB capital key
 at 
the end of 
2018 (percent)
  Source: ECB.
 A relative share of the PSPP stock above the ECB capital key in a jurisdiction 
resulted mechanically from the need to offset downward deviations in other 
jurisdictions
. These 
downward 
deviations arose for two reasons. First, 
Greek 
government bonds
 were ineligible for 
the 
PSPP 
over
 the entire net asset purchase 
phase. Second, limitations 
were experienced 
in the availability of bonds for purchase
, 
which arose,
 for instance
, as bonds were held by hold
-to
-maturity investors 
or 
beca
use of 
the overall size of the eligible universe
 in 
some
 jurisdictions.
 APP purchases were executed regularly, while some flexibility was maintained 
to adapt to prevailing market conditions (see Box
 1).
 The Eurosystem aimed 
to 
maintain 
a continuous market 
presence throughout the day, thereby avoiding 
temporary market dominance. 
Depending on a central bank™s operational modalities
, 
flexibility
 can relate 
inter alia 
to the selection of securities to purchase, the timing of 
operations and the overall purchase 
amount for the day. Moreover, spreading 
purchases flexibly across the different asset classes included in a programme also 
helped to preserve market neutrality. As an example of this flexibility, the share of 
regional government purchases as a proportion o
f total PSPP purchases fluctuated 
significantly in 2018 (see Chart
 4).

 1 Purchase methods
 Prepared by Bryan Gurhy and Beatriz Soto
mayor
 The Eurosystem executed close to 225,000
 transactions under the APP between 2014 and 
2018. These transactions were conducted in accordance with the conventions 
of the respective fixed 
income market and alongside other market participants. Over time, 
the Eurosystem fine
-tuned its 
purchase methods to reflect evolving market conditions. This box describes the main purchase 
elements of the APP.
 All Eurosystem NCBs and the ECB executed APP purchases, with the ECB also coordinating 
the implementation of the
 programmes.
 PSPP purchases were conducted by the entire 
Eurosystem. The CBPP3 was executed by a large number of NCBs and the ECB, while six 
specialised NCBs
49 bought assets under the CSPP. As of April
 2017, ABSPP purchases 
have
 been conducted exclusively b
y six NCBs acting as internal asset managers.
50 Prior to that
, external asset 
managers and 
some 
NCBs had conducted the ABSPP purchases together.
 Purchases 
under the private sector programmes 
were conducted alongside other market 
participants
 in both the pri
mary and the secondary market, with the proportional shares 
varying over time as a reflection of issuance patterns and secondary market liquidity (see 
Chart
 A).
 The standard Eurosystem primary market bid size 
was set with a view to striking a 
balance 
betwe
en support
ing
 individual issuances 
and drawing on 
the flexibility offered by secondary market 
purchases.
                                                                     49  The six specialised central ba

 Note

Negative values 
for a subcategory 
indicate that redemptions were greater than gross purchases for

 The majority of APP purchases were executed by bilateral trades with counterparties.
 These 
trades
 were conducted via major electronic platforms and by voice. Bilateral trading entails 
responding flexibly to 
market participants™
 offers
, requesting 
prices
 from several counterparties for the 
same security and
 then trading at the best price
. Bilateral 
trades are particularly well suited to the 
liquidity and heterogeneity of euro area bond markets
 as they can be 
tailor
ed to market conditions in 
order to avoid market distortions. For instance, the PSPP purchased securities of 110
 issuers,
51 while 
other maj
or central banks generally purchased only a single sovereign issuer when implementing 
their large
-scale asset purchase programmes.
 The Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banque de France, Lietuvos Bankas and De Nederlandsche 
Bank conducted regular auctions in specif
ic market segments when implementing the PSPP.
 The decision to use auctions reflected the intention to achieve certain volumes
 while also
 taking 
account of transparency considerations. In the days before each auction, market participants were 
provided with
 a list of securities that each NCB was considering buying at prevailing market prices. 
This gave counterparties a well identified ﬁliquidity windowﬂ every week to communicate their interest 
in selling
 specific securities
 while being guaranteed equal prici
ng. Some 
NCBs
 focussed their 
auctions on illiquid bonds, which were difficult to source bilaterally, while other
s used auctions for 
liquid bonds to foster price transparency
 for other market participants
. The Eurosystem applied the 
same 
trading rules
 to al
ign the purchase price in bilateral trading and reverse auctions with the 
prevailing market offer price.
 Bid wanted in competition (BWIC) is a transaction method specific to the ABS market.
 BWICs 
are organised by dealers on behalf of investors to sell ABS 
holdings while ensuring best execution by 
inviting a large range of potential buyers. The ABSPP regularly participated in BWICs for both liquid 
and less liquid jurisdictions and across all ABS collateral types. The share of ABSPP purchases 
                                                                    51  In addition to the 17
 central government issuers, the PSPP purchased securities of 43
 PSPP

agencies and of 43
 regional governments and six EU supranational institutions as well as one 
non
-financial corporate.

 BWICs was relatively low, however, as the Eurosystem aimed to purchase at 
market prices without pushing prices to artificially high levels. The ECB set up a governance structure 
to assess all securities purchased and provide guidance on appropriate market
 pricing.
  3.2
 Fixed income market liquidity and its interaction with APP 
implementation
 The APP purchases were executed 
in a way that
 aimed to 
safeguard the 
liquidity of euro area fixed income markets.
 Eurosystem staff regularly assess
ed bond market liqui
dity indicators
. 
Taken together with market intelligence, the
se assessments 
indicate that the design of the APP has been successful in mitigating 
potential detrimental effects on market functioning and that the impact of the APP on 
market liquidity has bee
n at most transitory.
52 Daily purchase modalities
, and in particular the day
-to-day selection of 
securities to be purchased, were applied with a view to preserving market 
liquidity conditions.
 The Eurosystem actively incorporated the offers from a broad 
ran
ge of counterparties in the daily bond selection. In addition, significant efforts were 
undertaken to avoid buying securities that were scarce, as measured by such metrics 
as relative value indicators, pricing in the repo market and trading volumes.
 The si
ze of individual transactions was responsive to the observed offer sizes.
 For APP transactions, the average secondary market transaction ranged from 
•4 million in the CSPP to •14
 million in the PSPP. These averages mask 
compositional heterogeneity, with tr
ansaction sizes increasing for more liquid 
securities and declining for illiquid bonds.
 Using a broad set of counterparties facilitated the smooth implementation of 
purchases and fostered competition, with the Eurosystem trading with more 
than 350
 counterp
arties.
 A very large majority of APP purchases involve 
counterparties located in a different country from the purchasing central bank
, which 
also impacted the distribution of Target 2 balances across jurisdictions
.53 Individual 
central banks expanded their 
set of counterparties in order to reach all relevant 
segments of the fixed income market. APP implementation thus avoided persistent 
effects in the micro
-structure of bond market segments through the competitive use of 
counterparties. Against this backgrou
nd, the Eurosystem adopted a wide range of 
transparency tools to minimise the informational advantages for eligible 
counterparties. These initiatives helped to level the playing field among financial 
market participants while preserving the timely executio
n of operations (see Box
 2).

 2 Providing additional transparency on aggregate APP holdings
 Prepared by Kieran Leonard and Beatriz Sotomayor
 Transparency has played a central role in the APP by allowing market participants to better 
understand how the p
rogrammes are implemented.
 The regular disclosure of information on APP 
purchases and holdings on the ECB website was complemented by additional information on the 
CSPP in a box in the June
 2017 issue of the Economic Bulletin.
54 Similar
 data on the aggregate 
holdings of the CBPP3 and the ABSPP are presented below.
 In addition, the box provides a 
comparison of the weighted average maturity of PSPP net cumulative purchases with the relevant 
eligible universe.
 CBPP3 purchases were broadly o
riented towards a market capitalisation
-based benchmark of 
eligible securities, with due consideration being given to market liquidity conditions.
 This 
allowed purchases to be conducted across a broad range of countries on an ongoing basis. The 
Eurosystem 
was responsive to the availability of individual bonds in day
-to
-day implementation.
 Table
 A Country and rating distributions of 
CBPP3 
holdings and benchmark at the end of 2018
 Sources: 
ECB 
and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The benchmark is constructed using the 
universe 
of eligible securities pertaining 
at the end of
 2018. 
The w
eights of certain covered bond classes
 have 
been adjusted lower to reflect their lack of availability and illiquidit
y. Only bonds with an asset rating are included in the data for the 
credit rating 
distribution. 
The 
ratings are first
-best asset ratings.
 The distribution
s are
 by nominal value.
 The market capitalisation approach evolved over time, with the benchmark weigh
ts attached 
to certain securities decreasing as some covered bond categories were found to be 
increasingly hard to purchase.
 For example, the launch of TLTRO
-II increased the attractiveness of 
retaining covered bonds as collateral rather than placing them 
in the market. To account for this, the 
relative weight of retained covered bonds was reduced in the eligible CBPP3 benchmark.
 To accommodate the dynamic nature of the CBPP3
-eligible universe, with its variable 
issuance patterns and liquidity conditions ac
ross jurisdictions, the market 
capitalisation
-based benchmark was updated regularly so as to guide future purchases.
 This 
evolutionary approach is the main explanation for the differences evident in Table
 A, where, for 
example, CBPP3 holdings in Spanish co
vered bonds are considerably higher than the current

distributed
 across jurisdictions than 
the 
holdings
 at the end of 2018
 would indicate, 
reflecting the prevalence of 
different 
asset types 
in each country.
 For example, auto ABSs dominate the German ABS market. These securities have 
a much lower weighted average life than residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), which are 
more common in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the portfolio composition also refle
cted market 
capitalisation and market liquidity. Core markets with lower yielding securities generally had a higher 
number of actively offered securities
, which has led to some over
-representation of Dutch RMBS in 
the portfolio, for example. At the same ti
me, non
-core and higher yielding securities were largely held 
by hold
-to
-maturity investors and were not offered to the Eurosystem to the same extent. Moreover, 
there was a higher concentration in securities issued since the start of the ABSPP, given the a
bility of 
the ABSPP to 
make
 primary market purchases and hence purchase larger volumes in these issues. 
This resulted in a lower presence in jurisdictions with less issuance since October
 2014, such as 
Spain and Portugal.
 With regard to the PSPP, a 
comparison of the weighted average maturity (WAM) of cumulative 
net purchases with the WAM of the eligible universe shows that they were broadly in
 line 
with 
each other 
at the end of 2018 (see Table
 C).
 The dispersion of WAMs of the eligible universe 
acros

-eligible issuers. The WAM measure 
for cumulative net purchases includes the contribution of bonds which are no longer eligible owing to 
a maturity of less than one year and broadly reflects the av

 Moreover, securities with short to medium
-term maturities at the start of the PSPP were 
already extensively held by the Eurosystem as a result of the securities mar
kets programme. These 
holdings limited the ability to purchase such bonds under the PSPP in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, 
the WAM measure for cumulative net purchases in these jurisdictions is higher than would have 
otherwise been the case.

 3.3
 Securities lending
 APP securities lending facilities addressed challenging repo market conditions.
 Combined with the gradual expansion of
 PSPP holdings, increasing demand for high 
quality liquid assets in line with regulatory requirements contributed to challenging 
repo market conditions through 2016. The Eurosystem purchases reduced the 
effective availability of securities for market participants, which could have resulted in 

a shortage of bonds to be used as collateral
55 and lower market liquidity, while 
possibly impairing the price discovery mechanism. The Eurosystem™s securities 
lending approach served to minimise such unintended consequences of the APP.
56 The Eurosystem conducts securities lending activities, which continue in the 
reinvestment phase of the APP, in a decentralised manner on the basis of 
common principles.
 The Eurosystem acts as a backstop without curtailing normal 
repo market activity.
57 The institutional set
-up of the Eurosystem means that 
securities lending implementation is decentralised and various lending channels are 

used (e.g.
 bilateral lending or through custodians). As illustrated in the 
upper panel of 
Chart
 5, the share of German government bonds trading ﬁspecialﬂ
 Œ 
that is trading at a 
premium to general collateral in the repo market
 Œ 
increased markedly in 2016. The 
Eurosystem responded by introducing a number of
 modifications
 to the securities 
lending facilities, such as the option to borrow bonds against cash collateral. This was 
introduced in December
 2016, effectively increasing the supply of bonds available in 
55  
Government bonds are the main type of collateral used in the euro repo mark
ets due to their safety and 
liquidity.
 56  
PSPP securities were made available for lending in April
 2015, shortly after the start of the purchases. 
Lending of CSPP securities by Eurosystem 
NCBs
 is also mandatory
, 
while lending of CBPP3 holdings is 
voluntary
. However, holdings from each covered bond jurisdiction are made available for lending by at 
least one Eurosystem
 central bank. Lending of ABSPP holdings is possible in principle
, 
but no requests 
have been received since the start of the programme.
 57  
To e
nsure th
is, the lending is conducted at a certain spread against 
general 
collateral (for lending 
against
 securities)
, 
and the cash collateral option (for PSPP only) is offered at a rate equal to the lower of the rate 
of the deposit facility minus 30
 basis 
points and the prevailing market repo rate.

 4 Transmission and impact on the macroeconomy
 4.1
 Main transmission channels
 The APP has provided a substantial improvement in financing conditions via 
several transmission channels, and each individual policy measure, being part 
of a package of 
policy measures, has benefitted from reinforcing synergies.
 Evidence based on event studies shows that yields fell significantly across all financial 
market segments following the APP announcement.
59 Over the course of APP 
implementation, declining bank len
ding rates and credit expansion helped to ease 
financing conditions, support a firming of the economic recovery and counter 
disinflationary forces. As documented by a large body of literature, the APP operate
s through three main channels: the signalling ch
annel, the portfolio rebalancing channel 
and the direct pass
-through channel.
60 The package of policy measures of which the 
APP was part has created mutually reinforcing synergies across the individual 
measures.

  84 Via the signalling channel, the APP has under
scored the ECB™s intention to 
provide sufficient monetary stimulus for an extended period of time, thereby 
also 
contributing to anchor policy rate expectations
. The APP has enhanced the 
signal that key policy rates would remain low for long. Th
e signalling
 aspect
 of central 
banks™ large
-scale asset purchases has always been found to be an important 
component of transmission for such policy programmes. This component was 
reinforced in March 2016, when the Governing Council™s communication of the 
expected fut
ure rate path was made conditional on the end of net asset purchases
. 
 Via the portfolio rebalancing channel, the APP has compressed yields across a 
wide range of asset classes, with negative rates on reserves providing 
additional incentives to the rebalan
cing process.
 With the price of the purchased 
assets being bid up, their yields decrease. The lower yields induce investors to sell 
these securities, 
earning 
the associated capital gain. As sellers may not view holding 
the liquidity received as being a per
fect substitute for the assets sold, they reinvest 
and rebalance their portfolios towards other assets, such as securities and loans (see 
also Box
 4). This process is reinforced by the negative rates charged on reserves.
61 Consequently, yields also decrease
d in other market segments not targeted by the 
central bank purchases
, including a 
rebalancing in non
-euro denominated debt and 
equity markets
.62 Within the portfolio rebalancing channel, the extraction of duration risk 
has 
been
 a particularly relevant mech
anism affecting the term premium component 
of medium and long
-term yields (Box
 3).
 Asset purchases decrease the duration 
risk borne by private investors, thus increasing their risk
-bearing capacity and 
incentivising them to restore the desired overall risk
 profile of their portfolio
 by 
investing in different assets. Therefore, duration extraction affects the pricing of 
maturities and asset classes beyond securities purchased.
 Via the direct pass
-through channel, which comes into play for the ABSPP and 
the 
CBPP
3 in particular, the APP has directly improved credit conditions for the 
private non
-financial sector. 
At 
the same time, the CBPP
3 and TLTROs have 
interacted to foster lending to small and medium
-size enterprises (SMEs) as well.
63 More generally, TLTROs
 have alleviated the funding costs for participant banks, thus 
mitigating possible negative effects on bank lending stemming from negative rates on 
reserves. Central bank purchases 
have 
raised the price of ABS and covered bonds, 
lowered the market interest
 rate paid by the originators and encouraged banks to 
create more loans with a view to repackaging them and selling them on. Through this 
mechanism, bond purchases 
have 
supported borrowing conditions in the private 
non-financial sector. Similarly, the CSPP
 has 
reduced funding costs for firms 
accessing financial markets directly and supported a switch from bank funding to 
                                                                    61  See Ryan, E. and Whelan, K., ﬁ

 3 The impact of the APP 
on the term structure of euro area bond yields
 Œ a model
-based 
assessment
 Prepared by Fabian Eser, Wolfgang Lemke and Andreea Liliana Vladu
 The term premium component of yields reflects the aggregate duration risk borne by 
investors.
 Risk
-free long
-term bo
nd yields have two components: average expectations of 
short
-term interest rates over the life of the bond and a term premium. The latter comprises the 
current and future expected risk exposure of individual bonds (their bond
-specific duration risk), as 
well as the compensation per unit of risk exposure. This compensation
 Œ the ﬁprice of riskﬂ
 Œ depends 
in turn on the aggregate duration risk to be borne by the market.
 Central bank asset purchases decrease the overall duration risk to be absorbed by private 
investors, thus reducing the price of risk and, in turn, the term premium.
 Importantly, the effect 
of asset purchases on the term premium depends on the entire path of the duration
-weighted bond 
portfolio acquired. For a ten
-year bond, lower aggregate dura
tion risk in, say, five years decreases the 
required risk compensation in the future and hence also the term premium 
today
. The APP™s impact on the term premium can be estimated using an arbitrage
-free term 
structure model.
65 The drivers of bond rates are summarised by three factors, one of which reflects 
the ﬁfree float of duration riskﬂ in the hands of those market participants who are deemed willing to 
rebalance their bond portfolio when bond prices change.
66 The model
 link
s current and future 
changes in the free
-float to changes in current term premia
 and can 
thereby 
explain how current and 
expected future APP volumes
 affect the yield curve
.67 The compression in sovereign yields due to the APP
-induced reduction in current and
 expected bond free float is estimated to stand at around 100
 basis points for the ten
-year 
maturity (Chart
 A, left panel).
 The chart illustrates the impact of the APP on term premia across the 
term structure at the time when the PSPP was announced and at 
the end of net asset purchases in 
December
 2018. The term premium impact is larger for longer maturities.
 Looking ahead, the substantial stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments 
mean that a sizeable amount of duration risk will continue t
o be extracted, even after net 
                                                                    64  See the article entitled ﬁ

 A Estimated impact of the APP on euro area sovereign yields
 Source: 
Based on Eser, Lemke, Nyholm, Radde and Vladu (2019).
 Notes: 
The left panel shows by how much the term premium component of sovereign euro 
area yields with maturities of one
 year to ten
 year
s are estimated to be 
compressed due to the APP, at the time of the 
launch 
of the APP (Q1 2015), as well as at the end of the net purchase phase in December
 2018. The right panel 
shows point estimates of t
he ten
-year yield term premia compression over time. The confidence band reflects parameter uncertainty around these point 
estimates, constructed using 
bootstrap/Monte
 Carlo resampling techniques. Euro area yields are proxied by the GDP
-weighted zero
-coupo
n yields of the four 
largest euro area jurisdictions.
 Quantifying the impact of the APP on the yield curve is subject to several layers of 
uncertainty.
 Accounting for parameter uncertainty in the model estimation suggests that the impact 
of the APP on ten
-year term premia currently lies in a range of 70 to 130
 basis points.
68 Additional 
sources of uncertainty relate to model specification, the estimation window and the quantification of 
the free float measure.
  The APP has eased financing conditions across a
sset classes.
 Liquidity injected 
by the APP 
has 
tied up short
-term money market interest rates at levels close to the 
ECB™s deposit facility rate and, together with negative rates and forward guidance, 
anchored the expected path of money market rates in li
ne with the intended policy 
stance. Chart
 7 shows the estimated accumulated easing impact of the APP across 
asset classes
 Œ alongside that from other easing measures
 Œ relative to actual asset 
price changes recorded since 2014.
69 The APP is estimated to hav
e decreased 
sovereign yields and pushed down yields of bonds issued by non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs), and to have contributed to an increase in share prices.
                                                                     68  Chart

 7 Impact of 
policy measures
 on financial prices and yields
  Source: ECB calculations.
 Notes: 
The chart shows the impact of the June and September 2014 policy measures, the APP and cuts in the deposit facility rate (DFR
) on financial prices and yields
. The impact of 
the June and September 2014 policy measures
 is estimated on the basis of an e
vent
-study 
methodology which focuses on the announcement effects of the
se measures
; see the ECB Economic Bulletin article entitled ﬁThe 
transmission of the ECB™s recent non
-standard monetary policy measuresﬂ (Issue
 7/2015). The impact of the 
cuts of the 
deposit facility 
rate (DFR) rests on the announcement effects of the September
 2014 DFR cut, while the impact of the subsequent DFR cuts is difficult to 
disentangle from the simultaneous APP adjustments. 
Both effects are 
therefore 
shown jointly. APP encompas
ses the effects of the asset 
purchase measures adopted at the Governing Council meetings 
in 
January and December
 2015, March and December
 2016, and 
October
 2017. The January
 2015 APP impact is estimated on the basis of two event
-study exercises considering
 a broad set of events 
that, starting from September
 2014, have affected market expectations about the programme; see Altavilla, C., Carboni, G. and Motto, 
R., op. cit., and De Santis, R., op. cit. The quantification of the impact of the December
 2015 poli
cy package on asset prices rests on a 
broad
-based assessment comprising event studies and model
-based counterfactual exercises. The impact of the March
 2016 and 
December
 2016 policy packages is assessed 
using
 model
-based counterfactual exercises. The impac
t of the October
 2017 policy 
package is assessed using two models: a term structure modelling framework similar to 
the one used in Box
 3, and an ISIN
-by-ISIN 
regression framework akin to D™Amico, S. and King, T.B., ﬁFlow and stock effects of large

-448. Banks 
have 
played a crucial role in the transmission of net asset purchases to 
financing conditions.
 Bank-based financial 
intermediation remains very important
, 
notwithstanding a trend towards market funding in the financing structure of euro area 
NFCs over the last decade. The APP, acting in conjunction with negative interest rate
s on the deposit facility and TLTROs, has inc
entivised banks to reinvest the proceeds 
from asset sales into loan creation (see Box
 4).
 As a result, bank lending rates have steadily declined and converged across 
euro area countries since mid
-2014. Composite lending rates to NFCs currently 
stand close 
to record lows (see Chart
 8, left panel). Model
-based results indicate that 
the APP and DFR cuts have led to a reduction 
of around 50
 basis points 
in bank 
lending rates to NFCs since June
 2014 due to their impact on the yield curve.
70 Previously large dispe
rsions in borrowing costs across euro area countries have 
progressively narrowed to the point of being almost fully reabsorbed.
                                                                     70  This 
estimate
 compares to an overall decline of 129
 basis points in bank lending rates to NFCs between 
June
 2014 and October
 2018.
 The estimation is based on lending rate pass
-through mechanisms 
that 
operate via the relationship between government bond yields and bank funding costs, including: 
(i) standard pass
-through mechanisms used for the projections
, and
 (ii)
 pass
-through models using 
granular bank
 balance sheet information.

. Additionally, the TLTROs provided further downward pressure on bank 
lending 
rates.

to have contributed significantly to the recovery in loan 
growth.
 NFC loan volumes started growing again with positive rates in mid
-2015. 
Model

 Box
 4  Impact of the APP on lending to e
nterprises
 Prepared by Miguel Boucinha and Sarah Holton
 All monetary policy measures taken since mid
-2014 have helped to support lending 
conditions, which makes it difficult to separate out the impact of each individual measure
. 
This identification problem
 can be addressed by using granular data. 
It is possible to identify the 
contribution of the APP to lending to enterprises by matching bank
-level qualitative information from 
the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) with individual bank balance sheet characteristics 
and lending flows.
 Granular data show that banks 
had diverse
 liquidity inflows associated with the APP.
72 Asset 
purchases increase bank liquidity directly through sales of bonds by banks and indirectly through an 
                                                                    71  The figure reported corresponds to the average of alternative estimate

  89 increase in deposits stemming from their customers™ bond sales. Linking the BLS with balance sheet 
data
 confirms that, on average, banks with higher holdings of sovereign bonds just before the APP 
was launched reported a stronger impact on liquidity from t
he programme (Chart
 A, left panel). On 
average, just over 20% of banks reported a positive impact on liquidity from the programme in net 
percentage terms, while for the banks with relatively high holdings of sovereign bonds at the end of 
2014, the net perc
entage reporting a positive impact increases by 10
 percentage points to over 30%. 
The banks that experienced an increase in liquidity owing to the APP could then adjust towards other 
assets, such as loans.
 Banks with larger liquidity inflows associated wit
h the APP are found to have recorded 
stronger loan growth to enterprises following the implementation of the programme.
 Using 
BLS data on liquidity inflows to identify banks that were more exposed to the policy, the right panel of 
Chart
 A indicates that th
is group of banks had higher cumulative loan growth than other banks 
following the introduction of the APP. While Chart
 A implies that the policy was effective, the trend 
may be driven by other confounding factors such as the macroeconomic environment, ban
k business 
models and the demand conditions faced by the banks that were more exposed to the policy. To make 
a causal statement regarding the impact of the programme on credit supply, it is necessary to control 
for these factors. Model
-based analysis shows
 that, even after controlling for bank characteristics 
(both time
-varying and fixed unobservable features), demand conditions and macroeconomic 
variation, the APP continues to be found a strong driver of higher credit supply for the banks that were 
more ex
posed to liquidity inflows associated with the APP.

 Impact on the euro area economy and inflation, and progress 
towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation
 The APP, in conjunction with the other monetary policy measures, has provided 
a substa
ntial contribution to the economic recovery and the formation of 
inflation expectations.
 According to 
calculations by 
Eurosystem staff, the overall 
impact of the policy measures adopted since mid
-2014 on the euro area inflation rate 
is estimated to be arou
nd 1.9
 percentage points cumulatively between 2016 and 2020, 
with the strongest impact 
being felt 
in 2016 and 2017 (see Table
 1). The impact on real 
GDP growth is of a similar size.

 Notes: The table reports the estimated impact of all policy measures adopted since mid
-2014. The assessment takes as reference the 
December
 2018 BMPE inf
ormation set. The estimates are derived on the basis of various modelling frameworks, comprising the suite of 
models developed by staff of the ECB and NCBs, as well as the NCBs™ country
-based models. Totals may not add up due to rounding.
 In June 2018
 the 
Governing Council signalled that it expected to end the net 
purchases by the end of the year, and in December 2018 the decision to 
terminate the net purchases was confirmed.
 The decisions taken by the Governing 
Council at different stages of the asset purc
hase programme to extend, expand, scale 
back and finally end net asset purchases have consistently been informed by its 
assessment of the progress made towards achieving a sustained adjustment in the 
path of inflation
. Upon a review of the progress made, i
n June 2018 
the 
Governing 
Council signalled its anticipation that, subject to incoming data confirming the 
Governing Council™s medium
-term inflation outlook, net asset purchases would end in 
December 2018. 
The end of net asset purchases was indeed confirme
d in December 
2018. The assessment that the progress was substantial was based on a 
comprehensive review that took into account, among other elements, 
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage 
pressure, and uncertainties surrou
nding the inflation outlook. 
The 
Governing 
Council™s positive assessment of the progress towards a sustained adjustment of 
inflation that was carried out in June and December 2018 was underpinned by the 
stronger anchoring of longer
-term inflation expectati
ons, the underlying strength of 
domestic demand and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation, 
which provided grounds for confidence that sustained convergence would continue 
and be maintained even after the end of net asset purchases. 
 Over th
e course of
 2018, the 
medium
-term projections for
 headline inflation 
had 
moved closer to 2%
 (see Chart
 1). Furthermore, uncertainty surrounding the 
inflation outlook
 had receded significantly
, with the risk of deflation virtually vanishing.

  91 Inflation expectations as measured 
using 
different sources had been gradually 
improving
, and had moved to levels closer to 
the ECB™s inflation aim. The predictive 
distribution derived from model
-based assessments, market
-based measures of 
inflation compens
ation (see Chart
 9), and survey
-based measures of inflation 
expectations had shown that substantial progress had been achieved. Moreover, 
while measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted, labour cost 
pressures had continued to strengthen ami
d high levels of capacity utilisation and 
tightening labour markets, thereby providing additional supporting evidence that the 
return of headline inflation towards the ECB
™s target 
was sustainable.

  Finally, the path of 
future 
inflation 
was judged to 
have become 
more resilient
 over time
, making it 
less reliant on net asset purchases.
 Consistent wit
h the 
propagation patterns that are characteristic for standard and non
-standard policy 
interventions, the estimated profile of the impact of net additions to the APP portfolio 
had a tendency to diminish progressively over time. Based on this evidence, cur
rent 
and future 
inflation developments 
could be assessed to be
 less reliant on net asset 
purchases
. 5 Outlook
 The Governing Council
™s decision
 in December
 2018 to end net asset 
purchases
 was accompanied by the decision to continue 
reinvest
ing
 the 
principal
 payments from maturing securities purchased under 
the APP and 
to 
enhance its forward guidance on 
policy 
rates and reinvestment.

2018 the Governing Council completed the rotation from net asset purchases to policy 
rates as the new principal pol
icy instrument. As regards the first building block of its

  92 forward guidance, and similarly to the structure adopted during the period of net asset 
purchases, the rate guidance provided by the Governing Council since December 
2018 features a time
-dependent 
leg (i.e. 
key ECB interest rates are expected to 
ﬁremain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019
ﬂ) and a 
state
-dependent leg linking the evolution of policy rates to the price stability objective 
(ﬁand in any case for as long as 
necessary to ensure the continued sustained 
convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium 
termﬂ).
 The second building block of the guidance links 
the 
reinvestment horizon 
directly to the principal policy instrument in 
a chained manner. Accordingly, the 
Governing Council currently states its intention to continue reinvesting, in full, the 
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended 
period of time past the date when key ECB interest
 rates would be raised
, and 
in any 
case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample 
degree of monetary accommodation.
 During the reinvestment phase, the Eurosystem will continue to adhere to the 
principle of market neu
trality 
built around
 smooth and flexible implementation.
 To this end, the principal redemptions
 will be 
reinvested with a view 
to allow for a 
regular and balanced market presence. 
In 2019, APP redemptions will amount to EUR 
203 billion, implying average mo
nthly reinvestments of nearly EUR 17 billion. 
Limited 
temporary deviations in the overall size and composition of the APP may occur during 
the reinvestment phase for operational reasons. Any adjustment to the portfolio 
allocation across jurisdictions will 
be gradual and calibrated as appropriate to 
safeguard orderly market conditions.
 Overall,
 the APP has helped the ECB fulfil its price stability mandate, making it 
an effective instrument in the central bank™s policy toolkit.
 Alongside other policy 
measures
 taken since mid
-2014, the APP has proved to be an adaptable and effective 
monetary policy instrument, helping the ECB 
to carry out
 its mandate.
