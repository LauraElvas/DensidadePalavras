  2 Economic and 
monetary
 developments
 Overview
 Based on 
the
 assessment of the economic and inflation outlook for the euro 
area, 
also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, 
the Governing Council 
decided at its monetary policy meeting on 
12 December to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and to reiterate its 
forward guidance on policy rates, net asset purchases and reinvestments.
 Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting
 in late October
 point
s to continued muted i
nflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics, although 
there are some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild 
increase in underlying inflation in line with previous expectations. Ongoing 
employment growth and increasing
 wages continue to underpin the resilience of the 
euro area economy.
 Against this overall back
ground
 and i
n the light of the subdued 
inflation outlook, the Governing Council reiterated the need for monetary policy to 
remain highly accommodative for a prolo
nged period of time to support underlying 
inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. 
In 
addition, the Governing Council™s
 forward guidance ensure
s that financial conditions 
adjust in accordance with changes to the inflati
on outlook. In any 
event
, the Governing 
Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments
, as appropriate
, to 
ensure that inflation moves towards its aims in a sustained manner, in line with its 
commitment to symmetry
. Economic and monetary
 assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 12 December 2019
 Global
 real GDP 
growth (excluding the euro area) weakened d
uring the first half 
of 2019
, but 
signs of stabilisation started to emerge towards 
the end of the 
year
. The 
weak 
growth 
momentum 
was characterised by 
slowing growth 
in both 
manufacturing and investment, which 
have been reinforced by rising policy and 
political uncertainty
 particularly amid
 escalating
 trade tensions and Brexit
-related 
developments
. More recent information, however, 
point
s to a s
tabilisation in global 
growth, as 
confirmed also by survey
-based data. In particular, t
he Purchasing 
Managers™ Indices (PMI) 
point to a moderate recovery in manufacturing output growth 
and some moderation in
 services output growth
. Looking ahead, the recovery in global 
economic activity is projected to be shallow, reflecting a moderation of growth in 
advanced economies and a sluggish 
recovery 
in 
some 
emerging economies. Global 
trade softened this year and is 
projected to expand at a slower pace than global 
activity in the medium term. Global inflationary pressures remain contained
, and
 the balance of risks to global economic activity
 continues to be
 tilted to the downside
, although 
risks are becoming 
less pron
ounced.
 Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2019 euro area long
-term 
risk
-free rates have increased and the forward curve of the euro overnight index 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8 / 2019
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  3 average (EONIA) has shifted upwards
, 
with markets currently expecting no 
further c
ut in the d
eposit facility rate.
 In line with an
 improvement in global risk 
sentiment, euro area equity prices have increased and corporate spreads have 
tightened.
 Euro area long
-term sovereign yields 
also 
largely reflect the rise in risk
-free 
rates
. In 
foreign excha
nge markets, the euro remained broadly stable in 
trade
-weighted terms.
 Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the 
third quarter of 2019, unchanged from the previous quarter
. The ongoing 
weakness of international trade in an
 environment of persistent global uncertainties 
continues to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and is dampening 
investment growth. At the same time, incoming economic data and survey information, 
while remaining weak overall, point to some stabil
isation in the slowdown of economic 
growth in the euro area. The services and construction sectors remain resilient, 
despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. Looking ahead, the euro area 
expansion will continue to be supported by favourable fina
ncing conditions, further 
employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area 
fiscal stance and the ongoing 
Œ albeit somewhat slower 
Œ growth in global activity.
 This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eur
osystem staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area
. These projections foresee annual 
real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in both 2021 and 2022. 
Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook 
for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2020.
 The risks 
surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising 
protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, 
but have become s
omewhat less pronounced
. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation 
increased from 0.7% in October 2019 to 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly 
higher services and food price inflation.
 On the basis of current futures prices for 
oil, headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in the coming months. Indicators of 
inflation expectations stand at low levels. Measures of underlying inflation have 
remained generally muted, although there are
 some indications of a mild increase in 
line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid 
tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass
-through to 
inflation. Over the medium term, inflation is e
xpected to increase, supported by 
the 
Governing Council™s
 monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and 
solid wage growth.
 This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic projections for the euro
 area, which foresee annual HICP 
inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022.
 Compared 
with the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP 
inflation has been revised up slightly for 2020 and down sli
ghtly for 2021, mainly driven 
by the expected future path of energy prices.
 Annual HICP inflation excluding energy 
and food is expected to be 1.
0% in 2019, 1.
3% in 2020
, 1.4% in 2021
 and 1.6% in 
2022.  ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8 / 2019
 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
  4 In October 2019 the annual growth of broad money remain
ed robust, while 
lending to the private sector continued its gradual recovery.
 Broad money (M3) 
growth 
stood at
 5.6% in 
October
 2019, 
unchanged from the previous month
. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the 
priv
ate sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3
. At the same time, favourable 
bank funding and lending conditions continued to support loan flows and thereby 
economic growth. 
The annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial corporations 
increased to
 3.8% in 
October, up from 3.6% in September. The Governing Council™s
 accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank 
lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, across all 
economic sectors and in partic
ular for small and medium
-sized enterprises.
 The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is 
expected
 to remain mildly 
expansionary in 2020
, 
thus providing support to economic activity.
 The stance is 
expected to remain expansionary in 2021 and
 to
 stabilise in 2022, mainly on account 
of a declining but still positive primary balance.
 In view of the weakening economic 
outlook, governments with fiscal space should 
be ready to 
act in an effective and 
timely manner. In countries where public debt is hi
gh, governments need to pursue 
prudent policies
 and meet structural balance targets
, which
 will create the conditions 
for automatic stabilisers to operate freely.
 All countries should intensify their efforts to 
achieve a more growth
-friendly composition of
 public finances.
 Monetary policy decisions
 Based on the regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council 
decided at its monetary policy meeting on 12 December to keep the key ECB 
interest rates unchanged and to reiterate its forward guidance 
on policy rates, 
net asset purchases and reinvestments
:  First, t
he Governing Council 
expect
s the key ECB interest rates 
to remain at their 
present or lower levels until 
it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to 
a level sufficiently close to, b
ut below, 2% within 
its
 projection horizon, and such 
convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
  Second, after
 restart
ing
 net purchases under 
the ECB™s 
asset purchase 
programme (APP) at a monthly pace of •20 billion
 on 1 November,
 the Governing 
Council
 expect
s them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the 
accommodative impact of 
the key ECB
 interest
 rates, and to end shortly before 
it start
s raising 
those
 rates.
  Third
, the Governing Council 
intend
s to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal 
payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended 
period of time past the date when 
it 
start
s raising the key ECB interest rates, and 
in any case for as long as necessary to maintain 
favourable liquidity conditions 
and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
 The comprehensive package of policy measures that the Governing Council decided 
in September provides substantial monetary stimulus, which ensures favourable

  5 financing condition
s for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing 
conditions for firms and households are underpinning consumer spending and 
business investment. This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build
-up of domestic price pressures an
d, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to 
the 
Governing Council™s medium
-term aim.
 Looking ahead, the Governing Council will
 closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy 
measures on the economy. 
The Governing
 Council
 continues to stand ready to adjust 
all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a 
sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

 While 
global real GDP growth (excl
uding
 the euro area
) weakened during the first half 
of 
2019, the 
latest available da
ta point to a stabilisation in the second half. The weak 
growth momentum was characterised by slowing growth in both 
manufacturing and 
investment
, which have been reinforce
d by r
ising 
policy and political uncertainty
 particularly amid escalating t
rade tensions 
and Brexit
-related developments. More 
recent data, however, point to a stabilisation in global growth in the third quarter, as 
also confirmed by recent survey
-based da
ta. In particular, the
 Purchasing Managers™ 
Ind
ices
 (PMI) 
point 
to a moderate recovery in manufacturing output growth and some
 moderation in services output growth
. Looking ahead, the recovery in 
global 
economic 
activity
 is projected to 
be shallow, 
reflect
ing a moderation 
of growth in 
advanced 
economies 
and a sluggish recovery in 
emerging economies. 
Global trade 
softened 
this year 
and is projected to expand at a slower pace than global activity i

term

Global inflationary pressures remain contained, while 
the balance of risks

. Global economic activity and trade
 While g
lobal growth
 (excluding the euro area) weakened duri
ng the first half of 
the year, signs of stabilisation started to emerge towards the year
-end.
 After 
having peaked in mid
-2018, 
global 
growth entered a period of weakness which 
continued into the first half of 2019, 
marking the weakest period of growth mome
ntum 
since the global financial crisis
. The slowdown has been characterised by 
weakness in 
both 
global manufacturing activity and investment
, 
exacerbated by increasing 
policy 
uncertainty
 amid 
recurring escalations of 
trade tensions
1 and Brexit
-related 
deve
lopments. Recent data, however, point to a stabilisation in global activity, though 
at low levels. Real GDP continued to expand steadily in the United States and Japan, 
while real activity growth rebounded in the United Kingdom. In the United States, in th
e third quarter, 
a strong labour marke
t and 
consumer spending
, and favourable
 financial 
conditions
 remained supportive of growth, while in Japan solid domestic demand was 
the main engine of growth. In the United Kingdom, growth rebounded on the back of 
unexpectedly strong net export growth
, and solid growth in private
 consumption
. 
In 
China, third quarter data confirmed the gradual slowdown in activity, driven by slowing 
investment
, while g
rowth has stabilised across other EMEs.
 Survey
-based indicators 
suggest that the stabilisation of global activity has 
continued in the fourth quarter
. The global composite output Purchasing Managers™ 
Index (PMI) excluding the euro area
 was unchanged 
in the third quarter
 compared to 
the previous quarter
, pointing to a s
tabilisation in global activity. Available data for 
October and November confirm steady, albeit 
subdued
, global GDP growth (excluding 
the euro area) 
in the fourth quarter. 
At a sectoral level, since July/August the gap 
between the manufacturing and service
s output PMIs at the global level has 
                                                                    1. See Box 1 for an analysis of the impact of trade tariffs on economic 
activity in the context of global value

 Global financial conditions have 
eased further
. Since 
the 
finalisation of the 
September
 2019 ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections, 
financial conditions have 
eased in 
both advanced and emerging economies
. In emerging markets
, the 
improvement in financial conditions is mainly accounted for by the fall in bond yields 
and the compression of spreads. Advanced economies, on the other hand, have 
benefited from higher stock valuations (in particular in the United States and 
the 
Unite
d Kingdom
) and the tightening of corporate spreads.
 An easing of trade tensions, 
lower Brexit
-related uncertainty and further monetary accommodation have 
contributed to these
 developments.
 Looking ahead, 
only a mild pick
-up in 
global growth is projected
, r
eflecting a 
deceleration of growth in advanced economies and China, which is offset by a
 moderate recovery in EMEs
. Developments in global growth are shaped by three 
main forces. A slowing cyclical momentum in most advanced economies and the 
gradual transi
tion of China to a lower growth path will weigh on global growth. 
Conversely, a favourable base effect due to a stabilisation of activity in those EMEs 
that 
experienced a (severe
) recession will 
contribute to the recovery. Compared to the 
September 2019 
macroeconomic projection exercise
, the global growth outlook is 
revised down over the projection horizon, reflecting a less dynamic than previously 
expected recovery in some EMEs
, including in the light of domestic instability in some 
of them (e.g. Hong Kong
 and Chile).
 Economic
 activity is expected to remain resilient
 in 
the United States in 
the near 
term
, 
and to decelerate in the medium term.

while non

continued to

exports gr
owing modestly
. 
Annual headline consumer price inflation picked up 
marginally to 
1.8
% in 
October, 
from 
1.7
% in the previous month, largely on account of 
food and energy prices
. Consumer price inflation excluding food and energy 
fell
 slightly
 in October
 to 
2.3
%. 
Over the medium term,
 growth is projected to gradually 
return to the potential growth rate of just below 2%, 
reflecting a maturing economic 
cycle and increasingly binding capacity constraints, 
while consumer price inflation is 
expected to remain abov
e 2%.
 In China, economic activity remains on a gradually slowing
 trajectory.
 In the 
third
 quarter of 2019 annual GDP growth slowed to 6.
0% from 6.
2% in the 
second
 quarter
, 
driven by less supportive net trade. Investment surprised on the downside and is 
exp
ected to remain weak, while the trade conflict with the 
United States
 continues to 
weigh on trade
. 
Looking ahead, growth is projected to dec
rease 
further in 2020
, reflecting slower exports and weak investment
, and to marginally pick up in 
2021 and 2022, su
pported by policy actions. Overall, t
he deceleration in economic activity 
reflects the past deleveraging
 efforts aimed at containing 
financial risks, the 
government™s focus 
on rebalancing 
the economy away from investment and the 
impact of the ongoing trade
 tensions with the 
United States
. 
Implementation of 
structural reforms is projected to result in an orderly transition to a more moderate 
growth path that is less dependent on investment and exports.
 Economic activity remains muted i
n Japan
 and is projecte
d to grow moderately 
over the medium term
. Real GDP grew by 0.4%
 in the 
third
 quarter of 2019 (quarter 
on quarter)
, compared to 0.5% in the previous quarter. S
olid domestic demand
, 
supported by firms™ private non
-residential investment and frontloaded spen
ding 
ahead of the 1 October value
-added tax hike,
 was partially offset by weak
 exports and 
inventory adjustment
s as well as 
some payback 
for 
the relatively strong 
outcome in 
the second quarter 
(partly 
as a result of 
the extended holiday period to 
celebrate
 the 
Imperial succession).
 While growth is projected to temporarily weaken following the 
value
-added tax hike and the natural disasters in October, 
activity is expected to 
gradually return to a moderate growth path as 
Japan 
continues to benefit from 
a highly 
accommodative monetary policy, robust labour market conditions and 
the 
preparations for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics
. 
The recent announcement of a significant 
fiscal stimulus package by the Japanese government 
Œ still to be approved by 
parliament 
Œ is al
so likely to provide support to growth further ahead. At the same time,
 a maturing business cycle, amid increasingly binding labour and capacity constraints
, is expect
ed to limit the pace of growth.
 Real GDP growth recovered modestly in the third quarter i

Kingdom, 
but the outlook remains subdued, despite a reduced risk of a

  9 constraining growth over the short term. Longer
-term growth prospects remain heavily 
dependent on the nature of the eventual post
-Brexit trading arrangements still to be 
agreed between the 
United Kingdom and the EU.
 Inflation 
declined strongly at the 
start of the fourth quarter, with UK annual CPI inflation falling to 1.5% in October, down 
from 1.8% in the third quarter. The fall reflects the impact of lower 
sterling
-denominated oil prices c
ompared with last year, lower import prices owing to 
the appreciation of the pound sterling since September, and a strong downward 
impact on domestic energy prices as a result of the decrease in the regulator™s energy 
price cap, which is likely to be rever
sed in the spring of 2020.
 Real GDP 
growth is projected to remain 
buoyant i
n central and eastern 
European countries over the projection horizon.
 Economic activity continues to be 
supported by solid consumer spending
, underpinned by tight labour markets
, while 
investment is forecast to soften against the backdrop of a more advanced phase of the 
EU funds cycle. Over the projection horizon, growth 
is expected to 
moderate from 
above
-potential rates
, albeit remaining ro
bust.
 Economic
 activity in large commodity
-exporting countries
 is projected to 
rebound modestly from the weakness experienced in the course of 2019
. In 
Russia, 
the feed
-in of contaminated oil into a key export pipeline
 led to 
large
-scale 
disruptions
, but a quicker than anticipated restoration of ou
tput 
result
ed in 
better
 than 
expected GDP and export 
outcomes 
in the 
third quarter of 2019
. Going forward, the 
medium
-term outlook will be shaped primarily by fiscal and structural policy 
implementation
, global oil market developments, 
specifically the commitment by the 
OPEC+ group of major oil producers to sustain oil production cuts, 
and the
 scope of 
the international sanctions regime under which Russia will be operating.
 In Brazil, 
despite some improvements since early 2019, growth re
mains fragile 
owing to
 a tight 
fiscal situation (including budget freezes), an uncertain external environment (e.g. 
trade tension
s and crises in 
Argentin
a and other Latin American countries
) and 
idiosyncratic shocks (e.g. 
a dam collapse in the country
). Wh
ile the recently approved 
pension reform was critical in boosting confidence, the degree to which additional 
necessary fiscal reforms are implemented will significantly influence growth in the 
medium
-to
-long term
. In Turkey, 
growth is projected to remain m
ildly positive in 2019, before 
gradually recovering in the medium term.
 Following the sharp contraction 
in GDP 
in the second half of 2018, the economy rebounded in the first half of 2019 
owing
 to 
fiscal stimulus ahead of the local elections in March, stron
ger household consumption 
and net exports, while investment continued to contract. Growth is expected to remain 
mildly positive in 2019
, assuming continued resilience in household consumption, 
while the external environment could be somewhat less supportiv
e. Economic activity 
is expected to gradually accelerate 
towards the end of the projection horizon
. Global trade 
has declined significantly in 
the 
course of 2019 amid recurring 
escalations of trade tensions and slowing industrial activity.
 After contractin
g in 
the first half of 2019, the latest available data point to a stabilisation in global trade for 
the rest of the year, though at very subdued levels. Across advanced economies, trade 
returned to moderate growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, 
supported by a 
normalisation of imports in the United Kingdom (after the exceptional stock building at

2 and a pick
-up in imports in central and eastern European EU 
countries, following a temporary slowdown in the second quarter. Across E
MEs, trade 
continued to contract in the third quarter owing to trade headwinds in China, the 
economic slowdown in India and political turbulence in Latin America, but there are 
signs of stabilisation in the fourth quarter. According to CPB data, gl
obal mer
chandise 
imports (excl
uding
 the euro area
) increased by 0.8% in 
the third quarter of 2019, 
relative to 
the second quarter, 
after three consecutive quarters of contraction
 and despite the sharp monthly fall in September
 (see Chart
 2). As survey indicators o
n new 
export orders continue to 
remain in contractionary territory, despite some mild pick
-up, 
the current weakness in global trade is likely to continue in the near term.

 Recent developments in the US trade policy stance provide mixed signals 
about a potential dissipation of trade tensions.
 The resumption of the US
-China 
bilateral trade negotiations in early October 
paved the way for a ﬁPhase 1ﬂ trade dea
l, 
triggering hopes of some de
-escalation of the trade conflict. However, at the cut
-off 
date for this commentary, trade talks continued ami
d political skirmishes between the 
two countries and it remained unclear by when a trade deal could be 
signed
.3 In view 
of 
this progress, the 
United States 
has delayed 
indefinitely its 
15 October tariff hike
.4 Furthermore, a 
US decision on
 whether to impos
e tariffs on EU car (
and car 
part) 
imports (initially due by mid
-November) has been postponed
. However, trade tensions 
                                                                    2  In the first quarter of 2019, UK imports grew by around 10%
 quarter on quarter
 on account of stockpiling 
ahead of the first Brexit deadline of 29 March
 2019
. A subsequent unwinding of those stockpiles 
in t
he 
second quarter
 of 2019
 led to a 
13% 
contraction in imports.
 3  The deal under negotiation is expected to touch upon various aspects of the relations

 External environment
  11 have recently escalated vis
-à-vis other countries. In early December the US 
administration threatened to reinstate tariffs on imports of 
steel and aluminium from 
Argentina and Brazil in response to their currency policies. At the same time, following 
the conclusion of an investigation initiated by the US Trade Representative into the 
Digital Services Tax enacted by France in 2019, the Unite
d States has threatened to 
impose tariffs on selected imports of French products, as this tax was found to be 
discriminating against US companies. While the overall volume of trade potentially 
affected by these tariffs is not large, these recent escalation
s do not bode well for a 
potential dissipation of trade tensions.
 Global imports are projected to increase gradually over the medium term, and 
to expand at a more subdued pace than global activity
. The further escalation of 
trade tensions, the effects of w
hich will continue to be felt into 2020, coupled with a 
more gradual than previously projected recovery in emerging economies and the 
structural rebalancing of the Chinese economy, will contribute to a delay in 
the 
recovery in trade. As a result, 
the 
elast
icity 
of trade to economic activity 
is projected to 
remain below the
 unit value over the projection horizon. 
According to the December 
2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections
, g
lobal imports (excluding the euro 
area) are expected to decelerate mark
edly from 4.6% 
growth 
in 2018 to 
zero 
growth 
in 
2019, before recovering to 
0.8
% in 2020, 2.
4% in 202
1 and 2.
7% in 
2022. Euro area 
foreign demand, which expanded by 3.7% last year, is expected to slow down to 0.
7% in 2019, before increasing gradually to 1.
0% in 2020, 2.3% in 2021 and 2.6% in 2022. 
Compared to the September 2019 
ECB staff macroeconomic projections
, 
euro area 
foreign demand 
has been revised down by 0.
3 percentage points 
in 2019, 0.
9 percentage points 
in 2020 and 0.
4 percentage points 
in 2021. In addition to the impact 
of the tariffs announced 
at the end of August 
and weaker data outturns, these 
revisions also reflect a broad
-based weakness in 
import momentum across 
both 
advanced and 
emerging economies
 on the back of a subdued growth ou
tlook
. The balance of risks to 
global activity
 remains tilted to the downside, but risks 
have become somewhat less pronounced
. A further escalation of trade disputes 
would 
be detrimental 
to global trade and growth
 and cause disruptions to global supply 
cha
ins
. Moreover, a ﬁno dealﬂ Brexit scenario could have more adverse spillover 
effects, especially in Europe. A sharper slowdown 
in 
China™s economy could be harder 
to counteract with 
effective 
policy stimul
i and might prove a challenge to the ongoing 
rebalan
cing process in China. Repricing in financial markets might 
dent risk appetite 
globally, while a 
further escalation of geopolitical tensions could also adversely affect 
global activity and trade.
 Upside risks concern a swifter recovery in global trade and 
a more benign resolution of current political uncertainties.
 Global price developments
 Oil prices have increased amid improving market sentiment.
 Concerns about 
weak global oil demand remained a predominant market force until mid
-October when 
US-China trad
e talks resumed
. Since then oil prices 
have 
recovered on the back of 
more buoyant market sentiment
, and have been further supported by the agreement 
by OPEC+ on 6 December to implement more substantial production cuts.

 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 External environment
  12 In the 
December
 2019 Eurosystem
 staff
 macroeconomic projections, oil prices 
are foreseen to decline over the projection horizon.
 Owing to the increase in spot 
prices
, 
the 
oil futures
 curve
 has moved slightly 
above
 th
e one in the September 2019 
ECB 
staff macroeconomic projections
, while the sl
ope is broadly unchanged. 
Consequently, the oil price assumptions underpinning the 
December
 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections 
were around
 2.1%
, 
4.6% and 2.1
% higher for 2019, 2020 and 
2021, respectively
, than 
the assumptions underpinning the 
September
 2019 E
CB 
staff macroeconomic projections. Since the cut
-off date for the 
December
 projections, the price of oil has increased 
further
, with Brent crude standing 
at USD
 65.2
 per barrel on 
11 December
. Global inflationary pressures remain 
muted
. In
 countries belonging to the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD), annual headline 
consumer price inflation 
was 1.6
% in 
October 
2019, 
unchanged from
 the previous 
month. 
Energy prices 
continued to be a drag on headline inflation (fal
ling
 further to 
-3.0%
 from
 -2.7% in September
), while food price inflation 
picked up marginally, 
thereby offsetting the fall in energy prices.
 Annual CPI 
inflation 
excluding food and 
energy decreased
 slightly 
to 2.
0% from 2.
1% in 
September
 (see Chart
 3). 
Inflationary 
pressures remain muted across major advanced economies, despite the easing 
stance of monetary policy 
and 
tight labour market conditions
, which 
are failing 
to fully 
pass
 through to wage increases. Overall
, this suggests that underlying inflation
ary
 pressures are likely to remain sub
dued for the foreseeable future.

 In line with some improvement in global risk sentiment, euro

As euro

environmental regulations and technological change

Declining 
levels of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector
, together with weak firm profit

 Housing investment increased by 0.6% in the third quarter of 2019, following a

 Supported by both its residential

  22 4 Prices and costs
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased from 
0.7% in October 2019 to 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher servic
es and food 
price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to 
rise somewhat in the coming months. Indicators of inflation expectations stand at low 
levels. Measures of underlying inflation have remained genera
lly muted, although 
there are some indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations. While 
labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker 
growth momentum is delaying their pass
-through to inflation. Over th
e medium term, 
inflation is expected to increase, supported by 
the ECB™s
 monetary policy measures, 
the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth.
 This assessment is also 
broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projectio
ns 
for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020, 
1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up slightly 
for 20
20 and down slightly for 2021, mainly driven by the expected future path of 
energy prices
. 
Annual HICP inflation excluding energy and food is expected to be 
1.0
% in 2019, 
1.3
% in 2020
, 1.4% in 2021
 and 1.6
% in 202
2. According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, 
HICP inflation increased from 0.7% in 
October to 1.0% in November.
 This was mainly attributable to rises in services and 
food inflation and, to a lesser extent, an increase in non
-energy industrial goods 
inflation, all of which more than offset a further s
mall decline in energy inflation.

 Producer price inflation for 
domestic sales of non

unchanged since July
 and above its historical average

rom the 2.2% and 2.3% 
recorded in the second and first quarters respectively (see Chart 15). The figures for 
2019 have been affected by a significant drop in social security contributions

.8 Annual growth in wages and salaries per employee, which 
excludes social 
security contributions, was 2.5% in the third quarter, unchanged from the second 
quarter, after 2.6% in the first quarter and 2.3% on average for the previous year. 
Annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area was 2.6% in the third qu
arter of 
2019, up from 2.0% in the second quarter. This increase was due mainly to one
-off 
payments in the manufacturing 
sector in Germany. Looking across the different 
indicators and through temporary factors, wage growth has moved broadly sideways 
since 
mid
-2018, either at around or slightly above historical averages.

the short term and a slightly more
 downward
-sloping oil price futures curve
. 
After a 
moderate rise by the end of 2019, HICP inflation excluding energy and food will move 
sideways at 1.3% in the course of 2020 and increase to 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 
2022. The upward path of HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food is expected to be 
supported by strengthening economic activity, by relatively robust wage growth amid 
tight labour markets and by recovering profit margins as activity regains pace, aided, 
among other things, by the ECB™s Septembe
r 2019 monetary policy measures. Rising 
non-energy commodity prices are also expected to provide some support to HICP 
inflation excluding energy and food.

  27 5 Money and credit
 In October
 2019 the annual growth of broad m
oney 
remained robust, while lending to 
the private sector continued its gradual recovery. The resilient growth of M3 mainly 
reflected the very low opportunity cost of holding money. F
avourable
 bank funding and 
lending conditions 
continued to support 
loan flows and thereby 
economic growth
. 
Net 
issuance of debt securities by 
non-financial corporations (
NFCs
) increased in the third 
quarter of 2019, from an already robust outturn in the previous qua
rter. Bond market 
conditions continue to support debt securities issuance.
 Broad money 
grew at a robust
 pace 
in 
October.
 The annual growth rate of M3 
was 
unchanged
 at 5.6% in 
October (see Chart 18), slightly exceeding
 the 
rate
 of around 
5% observed between
 2015 and 2018
, when 
net asset purchases under the 
asset 
purchase programme (
APP) were positive. Broad money growth was supported by the 
very low opportunity cost of holding monetary instruments, while 
weake
r economic 
growth acted as a drag on it. 
The 
inte
rest 
rate constellation is also affecting the 
composition of M3, as it incentivises the concentration of volumes in the most liquid 
instruments. 
As in previous quarters,
 therefore,
 M3 growth continued to be driven by 
the narrow aggregate M1 
Œ comprising
 overnight deposits and currency in circulation
. The annual growth rate of M1 increased 
in 
October
 to
 8.4%, from
 7.8% in 
September
, continuing the recovery
 observed since 
the start of the year.

 Overnight deposits
 were the main contributor to money g

Stable developments in currency in circulation

deposits with cash in 
view of 
the negative inter
est rate 
environment.
 Short
-term
 deposits 
other than overnight deposits (i.e.

 made a positive contribution to M3 growth in October, which was mainly attributable to 
stronger growth in saving deposits. At the same time, m

 made a sizeable contribution to broad money

 The

financing
 for euro area banks, which
 has decreased since the start of the year in line 
with market rates,
 remained at very low levels in the third quarter of 2019 
(see 
Chart
 21). This development reflects a considerable trend decline in bank bond yields, 
although there has been
 a slight rebound in bond yields since September
, reflecting a 
broader increase in risk
-free rates. At the same time,
 euro area banks™ deposit rates 
recorded new historical lows in October. While developments in banks™ debt funding 
costs were largely simultaneous
 in the largest euro area countries, reflecting the 
monetary policy measures of the ECB,
 the level of bank funding costs remained 
heterogeneous.
 In their responses to the ECB™s October 2019 euro area bank lending 
survey, euro area banks reported that 
the 
resumption of net asset purchases under the 
APP 
is expected to facilitate
 a further 
easing of market financing conditions
, thereby
 contribut
ing
 to further improvements in funding conditions.
 Moreover, the downward 
pressure on 
euro area banks™ loan
-deposit margins, which
 exerts a dampening impact 
on bank profitability
, is being
 compensated 
for 
by increasing lending volumes
, and the 
overall effect on net interest income (as the product

. E
xternal financing to firms edged up in

 low and falling cost
s on financing instruments
. In the third quarter of 2019 the net 
issuance of debt securities by NFCs increased, leaving issuance so far in 2019 close 
to record levels. The increase in the net issuance of debt securities in the third quarter 
of 2019 occurre
d in a context of gradual recovery in overall credit to NFCs 
Œ including 
MFI loans 
Œ and a further improvement in corporate bond financing conditions that 
was more pronounced than the improvement in bank lending conditions. From a 
medium
-term perspective, 
the recovery in debt securities issuance in 2019 has 
brought annual net issuance flows
 in September back to the levels recorded in spring 
2018 and well above the trough of December 2018 (see Chart 23). N
et issuance of 
listed shares
 was positive in Septembe
r but remained negative for the whole third 
quarter of 2019, reflecting both sluggish merger and acquisition activity and an 
increase in the cost of equity financing over the period.
 Recent m

that the net issuance of debt securities

 In September the

still very 
favourable. By the end of 
November, the overall cost of financing is estimated to have remained broadly 
unchanged from September. This reflects a slightly lower cost of equity, which was 
compensated for by a marginally higher cost of market

 lower 
estimated cost of equity was mostly driven by a decline in equity risk premia, in turn 
supported by an improvement in global risk sentiment. Meanwhile, the slight increase

 The euro area fiscal deficit
 is 
expected
 to 
increase
 steadily 
during the years 
2019-21 on account of lower primary surpluses. The decline in the primary balance reflects 
mainl
y a projected 
expansionary 
fiscal stance, which provides support to economic 
activity. The 
euro area government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 is expected to remain
 on a

However, debt levels in a number of countries 
remain high. In these countries, 
governments need to pursue prudent policies and 
meet
 structural balance targets
, which
 will 
help 
create the conditions 
that will allow

governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely 
manner.
 The euro area general government budget 
balance
 is projected to 
decline 
steadily 
during
 2019-21 and to stabilise in 2022

% of 
GDP in 20

projected to continue increasing in 2020 and 2021, and to 
stabilise thereafter at 1.1% of GDP (see Chart 24). 
The decline in the budget balance 
in 2019-21 stems 
mainly
 from 
a lower cyclically adjusted primary balance.
 This is 
partly compensated by lower in

 The effects of tariff hikes in

 1 The effects of tariff hikes in
 a world
 of global value chains
 Prepared by 
Philipp Meinen
 In the context of the trade conflict
 between the United States and China
, global 
value chains (GVCs) 
are 
a potential factor amplifying the impact of higher tariffs 
on economic activity
. Raising
 tariffs in 
a globalised world with international supply 
chains can have significant negative repercussions on economic activity. In general, 
global sourcing 
by firms impl
ies
 that higher tariffs, usually imposed to protect a 
domestic industry, can lead to higher input
 costs for domestic producers. In addition, 
the effects of 
higher tariffs may be
 magnified by GVCs, especially in the case of 
multistage production
 processes, where goods move in a sequential manner from 
upstream to downstream with value added at each stag
e.13 Against this background, 
this box provides some evidence of the adverse effects of tariffs on economic activity 
in the context of global sourcing and GVCs.
 GVC
-related trade
, defined 
here 
as those traded items that cross at least two 
international 
borders
, expanded 
over
 the decade
 preceding the financial crisis
 (as a share of total trade), plateaued thereafter and declined during the most 
recent years with available data
 (see Chart A).
14 GVC
-related trade can be 
decomposed into 
the 
so-called backward
 and forward linkages. Forward linkages 
trade 
refer
s to a country™s value
-added exports that are not absorbed in 
the 
final 
demand of th
at country™s 
direct trade partner
s, but
 (usually after some processing)
 are 
further exported to third markets. Backward l
inkages
 trade, on the other hand,
 comprise
s the foreign content used to produce a country™s exports.
15 Industries 
further upstream in the supply chain (e.g. mining, product development) typically have 
a larger share of forward linkages, while more downstrea
m sectors
, such as 
many 
manufacturing industries
, tend to rely more on backward linkages. Such 
considerations are 
of relevance
 in the context of the
 magnification effects of higher 
tariffs due to GVCs
, since these depend
, among other things,
 on the share o
f foreign 
value added in exports.
                                                                     13  Such sequentially organi
sed value chains are also referred to as 
ﬁsnakes
ﬂ. This is in contrast to supply 
chains sometimes labelled as 
ﬁspiders
ﬂ, where mu
ltiple limbs (i.e. parts) come together 
to form a body 
(i.e. assembly)
 without a particular sequencing. Baldwin, R. and

-254.
 14  GVC-related traded items are
, therefore,
 re-exported at least once before being absorbed in final 
demand
 (Borin and Mancini, 2019)
. Such
 trade flows can be computed on the basis of inter
-country
 input
-output (ICIO) 
tables
. This box uses
 ICIO tables published by the OECD. 
Note that the level of 
GVC-related trade may depend on the source of the ICIO tables (e.g. OECD data versus World Input 
Output Tables), while the displayed dynamics over time (Chart A) tend to be qui
te similar. 
Two releases of 
the OECD ICIO tables are

 Intermediate goods trade

 on the economy
, even more so if there is 
international multistage production.
 International trade 
models which 
include
 sectoral linkages and intermediate goods trade suggest higher 
welfare gains from trade liberali
sation than models which do not include th
ese 
features. 
This is related to the fact that 
Œ when allowing for global sourcing
 Œ reductions in trade frictions not only lower the price of final goods but also the input 
costs faced by firms.
16 Accounting
 Œ in addition
 to this 
Œ for a global multistage

17 First, as goods cross borders multiple 
times in international multistage production processes, they may be taxed each time a 
borde
r is crossed. Second, tariffs are commonly levied on a good™s total (gross) import 
value, instead of the value added in the most recent production stage. 
As a result
, the 
smaller the value added in the last production process (relative to its gross value),
 the 
larger the effective tariff rate ap
plied to this production stage.
 Empirical analysis suggests that tariff hikes can, over the medium term, 
significantly dampen the economic activity of industries which rely on foreign 
inputs.

 The effects of 
tariff hikes in a world of global value chains
  38 industries
 by raising their input costs. Moreover, international multistage production 
implies that input costs are not onl
y affected by a country™s own tariff schedule, but 
also by the tariffs applied to production stages further upstream.
 For example, a tariff 
imposed by the U
nited 
States
 on Chinese exports may hurt Mexican 
firms 
downstream 
if they
 use US inputs with Chinese
 content. 
Consequently, t
he impact of 
tariffs on economic activity depends on a 
country
-industry™s position in the supply 
chain. 
Chart B presents impulse responses of real industrial production to an increase 
by one standard deviation of a variable measuri
ng ﬁ
upstream tariffs
ﬂ for
 country
-industries with low and high backward linkages, respectively.
18 While an 
increase in ﬁupstream tariffsﬂ does not significantly affect the real activity of industries 
with low backward linkages, significant negative effects are found for industries 
downstream in the value chain (i.e. with high backward linkages), which
 seems 
intuitive since their production process relies on foreign inputs.
19 For such industries, 
a one standard deviation rise in upstream tariffs is associated with a decrease in 
industrial production by one percentage point after three years. This effect 
becomes 
statistically insignificant after six years.
                                                                     18  Upstream tariff
s are
 computed as the weighted average of tariffs applied to 
intermediate goods
 used by a 
country
-industry, with weights referring to the share of inputs in a country
-industry™s total output. 
The 
measure is
 extended to also include tariff
s imposed
 by countries 
further upstream in the supply chain by
 following insights on cumulative
 tariff
s presented by Rouzet and Miroudot using the OECD ICIO
 tables. 
The tariff data are 
sourced at detailed product level from TRAINS and the WTO using the World Bank™s 
World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) tool and aggregated to the industry level using constant trade 
shares derived from CEPII™s BACI data set
. Note that tariffs imposed downstream in the value chain 
could also affect the output of upstream industries, wh
ich is not investigated in this box.

 19  The 
impulse responses are obtained by using Jorda™s local projections 
with standard errors clustered at 
the country
-industry level. 
The observational unit is a country
-industry in a given year. The outcome 
variable of interest is real industrial production (sourced from the UNIDO) which varies at the 2
-digit
 ISIC
 industry le
vel. Local projections imply that the change of this variable is regressed on the changes in 
tariffs and a vector of control variables which includes two lags (of each) of changes in the dependent 
variable, variables for input and protective tariffs, and n
ominal value added
 growth
. The model further 
contains country
-industry, industry
-time and country
-time fixed effects to control for various other types of 
factors that may drive industrial activity. The tariff variables are interacted with a country
-indust
ry 
measure of backward linkages computed from the OECD ICIO table for the year 2005
, which is in the 
middle of the sample period
. The sample covers the period 
from 
1995
 to 
2017 and includes 54 countries 
and 22 industries.
 The focus on upstream tariffs may 
mitigate endogeneity concerns regarding the tariff 
variable, while it should be noted that the analysis does not necessarily present causal effects.

 Notes: 
Impulse responses refer to a tariff shock of one standard deviation. Country

 Backward lin
kages measure the foreign content in a 
country
-industry™s exports and are computed using the approach of Borin and Mancini (2019). More details about the data and the 
estimation approach are presented in footnote 7.
 The magnification effects of tariffs due
 to international multistage production 
mean that trade flows associated with downstream sectors are especially 
sensitive to tariffs, which is consistent with estimation results obtained from a 
gravity model.
 Since
 the value 
of output accumulates along the
 value chain
, 
ad valorem trade costs
 (like tariffs)
 are higher in absolute terms for downstream 
producers
. Moreover, international multistage production implies that the cost savings 
derived 
from relocati
on apply only to the value
 added of the particular 
production 
stage 
being relocated
, while 
ad valorem trade costs are levied on the stage™s full value of 
output
. Both aspects suggest that downstream sectors can be expected to be 
especially sensitive to tariffs, which would be consistent with tariff magnific
ation effects 
due to multistage production.
20 This 
can be tested empirically by employing a
n empirical
 gravity framework with tariffs
, where
 bilateral industry
-level exports are 
regressed on time
-varying bilateral industry
-level tariff rates and 
a battery o
f fixed 
effects to control for other trade cost components
.21 The 
tariff
 coefficient
 is here 
allowed to vary with the degree of foreign content in bilateral exports in order to 
investigate whether a larger foreign content share (i.e. more backward) is associated 
with higher trade cost sensitivity. Empirical results 
indeed suggest that
 the
 sensitivity 
of trade to tariffs increases sharply with the foreign content in bilateral trade flows (see 
                                                                    20  For more details, please refer to Johnson, R.C.

 21  The 
applied 
empirical setup is similar to Bergstrand et al.
, who d
iscuss estimation approaches for 
structural gravity models
. For instance, the model contains exporter
-industry
-time and 
importer
-industry
-time fixed effects as well as exporter
-importer
-industry fixed effects.
 The model is 
estimated on sectorial trade and 
production data derived from 
the 
OECD™s ICIO tables for the period 
from 
1995
 to 
2015, covering 62 countries and 18 manufacturing industries.

-0.8, it amounts to around 
-1.4 for sectors with a medium degr
ee of foreign content
, and it jumps
 to
 -2.1 for trade flows with high backward linkages
.22 These findings are 
therefore consistent with significant magnification effects of tariffs in the presence of 
sequentially organised international supply chains.

Low, medium

 Backward linkages measure the foreign content in a country

of Borin 
and Mancini
 (2019)
. The dependent variable refers to bilateral industry
-level export
s, which are regressed on bilateral industry
-specific 
tariff rates, controlling for other factors affecting exports with appropriate fixed effects. More details about the data and
 the estimation 
approach are presented in footnote 9.
 In 
the light of
 the above, GVCs are often thought to play a role in the current 
trade conflict 
between the United States and China 
by amplifying the 
effects of 
tariff hikes
. On the one hand, previous results suggest that tariffs that raise input 
costs can significantly d
ampen the output of sectors whose production processes rely 
on foreign intermediate goods. Since the tariffs imposed by the United States against 
China targeted a large number of intermediate goods, this channel may indeed be of 
relevance in the current tr
ade dispute.
23 On the other hand, the 
importance of 
magnification effects due to global multistage production are less clear 
and depend on
 the pre
dominance of GVC
-related trade 
in bilateral trade relations. 
OECD data for 
2015 suggest that, o
verall
, around 2
5% of the trade between the U
nited 
States
 and China takes place in the context of GVC link
ages (non
-blue bars in Charts D
).24 For 
both countries, this is below the total share of GVC
-related trade in total exports as 
well as the
 (weighted)
 average 
share of 
GVC
-related t
rade in global trade (Chart A
), 
which 
in turn 
may be explained by the large distance between the two
 countries
. 
                                                                    22  The gravity model features a long
-run perspective. An elasticity of 
-1 suggests that a 
10% increase in 
bilateral tariffs would lower bilateral exports by 10%.
 23  Intermediate goods account for more than half of the value of the products affected by the tariffs that the 
United States imposed on imports from China (worth USD 250 billion) in th
e course of the third quarter of 
2018. See, for example, Bown, C. P., Jung, E. and Lu, Z., ﬁ

-tier s
ystem
 Prepared by Luca Baldo, Cristina Coutinho
 and
 Nick Ligthart
 On 30 October 2019 the ECB implemented a two
-tier system under which 
a portion
 of credit institutions™ excess liquidity holdings 
with
 the Eurosystem
 are 
exempt from remuneration at negative rates.
 The two
-tier system applies to excess 
liquidity held by banks in current accounts with the Eurosystem and not to holdings 
with the ECB™s deposit facility.
27 Excess liquidity holdings (i.e. reserve holdings in
 excess of minimum reserve requirements) 
that are exempt 
are remunerated at 0%, 
instead of at the rate of the dep
osit facility, currently 
-0.5%.
 The aim of the two
-tier system is to support the bank
-based transmission of 
monetary policy in preserving the o
verall positive contribution of negative rates 
to the accommodative stance of monetary policy.
 The Governing Council has set 
exempt excess liquidity holdings 
(exemption allowance) 
at six times an institution™s 
minimum reserve requirements. The multiplier i
s the same for all institutions
 and has 
been chosen to support the pass
-through of the negative deposit facility rate
 to bank 
lending rates by offsetting some of the adverse impact of negative rates on bank 
profitability
, while also 
ensur
ing
 that euro shor
t-term money market rates remain close 
to this policy rate. The multiplier and the remuneration rate on exempt excess liquidity 
can be changed over time to ensure that banks continue to extend loans to their 
customers at conditions 
that 
fully reflect the d
esired stance of monetary policy.
 With the introduction of the two
-tier system 
banks holding less excess liquidity 
than the
ir
 exemption allowance increase
d their excess liquidity holdings 
by borrowing from banks
 exceeding their exemption
 allowances.
 On 30 
October 
2019, 
i.e. 
the day the two
-tier system came 
into 
effect, banks reduced their unused 
exemption allowances from 28% to 13% of total exemption allowances. 
Over
 the 
following days banks that had not completely 
used their exemption allowances 
continued 
to
 gradually increas
e their excess liquidity holdings until by 
11 December
 less than 
5% of exemption allowances were unused (
see 
Chart A). At the same time, 
excess liquidity held by banks exceeding their exemption allowance
s declined 
slightly 
Œ indicating a redistribution of excess liquidity through money markets and other 
channels in line with the incentives laid out by the two
-tier system (
see 
Chart B).
                                                                     27  The ECB also published additional information on the

 package of monetary policy
 measures
 adopted by the Governing Council on 12 September 2019.
 The package consists of 
five elements:
 (i) 
a reduction
 in the interest rate on the
 deposit facility
 from 
-0.40% to 
-0.50%, effective from 18 September
, 
while keepin
g the interest rates on the main 
refinancing operations (MROs)
 and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 0.00%
 and 0.25%
, respectively
; (ii) adjustments to the forward guidance on the key ECB 
interest rates
; 
(iii) the restart of net purchases under th
e asset purchase programme 
(APP)
 from 1 November;
 (iv)
 modifications to the modalities of the new series of 
targeted longer
-term refinancing
 operations (TLTRO
 III)
; and (v) the introduction of a 
two
-tier system for reserve
 remuneration
, effective as of the
 seventh 
reserve 
maintenance period starting on 30 October 2019
. 
In parallel, the Eurosystem 
continued to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities 
purchased under the APP. Furthermore, o
n 2 October 2019, the ECB 
started
 publishing
 the new overnight unsecured
 benchmark rate for the euro area, the euro 
short
-term rate
 (•STR
). From that date, the calculation methodology for the euro 
overnight index average (EONIA) was also changed to calculate EONIA by applying a 
fixed spread of 8.5 b
asis points to the •STR.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of net autonomous factors and reserve 
requirements, stood at •
1,559.5 
billion, 
an increase of •48.2 
billion 
compared 
with the previous review period (i.e.
 the 
third
 and 
fourth reserve 
maintenance 
periods of 201
9; see Table A
). This change in liquidity needs was largely the result of 
an increase in net autonomous factors by 
•45.6 
billion to •1,
426.9 
billion
. The 
increase
 in net autonomous factors was due to 
an increase i
n liquidity
-absorbing
 factors
, which more than offset
 the growth in 
liquidity
-providing factors
. Liquidity
-absorbing factors rose mostly on account of 
ﬁOther autonomous factorsﬂ, which grew on aver
age by 
•57.6 
billion
 to 
•846.4 billion. 
Banknotes in circulation increased on average by 
•17.8 billion to 
•1,251.8 billion. 
Government deposits rose by •11.9 billion to 
•282.4 billion on average over the period 
under review and reached a historical high of
 •298.6 billion in the sixth reserve 
maintenance period. Among liquidity
-providing autonomous factors, net foreign assets 
grew by •38.5 billion to •737.9 billion, while net assets denominated in euro remained 
broadly unchanged at •216.1 billion (up by •3.2
 billion).

 Liquidity provided through monetary policy instruments

mon
etary policy portfolios 
Œ decreased
 by •
46.6 
billion to •
3,294.6 
billion (see Chart

 This decrease was driven by lower 
demand in tender operations as well as a smaller liquidity injection stemming from 
monetary policy portfolios, owing to redemptions of
 securities purchased in the past 
under the Securities Markets Programme and a small decline in the book value of the 
assets acquired in the public sector purchase programme (PSPP).

A Evolution of

open market operations and
 excess liquidity
 (EUR billions
)  Source: ECB.
 The average amount of liquidity provided through tender operations declined 
over the review period, by •
31.1 
billion to •
683.9 
billion.
 This decrease was 
mainly attributable to lower 
liquidity provided through 
targeted 
longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTROs)
. The 
outstanding amount 
borrowed under TLTRO II decreased 
by 
•29.5 billion on average in the review period as a result of voluntary early 
repayments of 
•31.8 billion that settl
ed on 25 September. This was only partially offset 
by 
•3.4 billion allotted in the first TLTRO III operation that settled on the same day. 
Lower demand among counterparties also led to a decline in the provision of liquidity 
via MROs and via three
-month lo
nger-term refinancing operations (LTROs), which fell 
by 
•2.6 
billion to •
2.5 
billion
 on average and by 
•0.3 
billion to •
2.9 
billion
 on average, 
respectively.
 Liquidity provided through the Eurosystem™s monetary policy portfolios 
decreased by •
15.1 
billion 
to •
2,610.7 
billion, 
owing to redemptions of bonds 
held under the Securities Markets Programme and a small decline in the PSPP.
 Redemptions of bonds held under the Securities Market
s Programme and the 
first
 two 
covered bond purchase programmes totalled •
9.1 billion
 in the review period
. Regarding the APP, while net purchases had paused between 1 January 2019 and 31 
October 2019, the
 principal payments from maturing securities
 continued to be 
reinvested. Even with full reinvestment, l
imited temporary deviati
ons in the over
all size 
and composition of the 
APP may occur for operational reasons.
29 As a result, t
he book 
value of the PSPP
 declined marginally over the review period by 
•4.8 
billion
 to 
•2,087.6 
billion
 on average.

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operati
ons in the period from 31 July to 29 October 
2019  51 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity 
declined
 compared with the previous review period, by •
94.5 
billion to 
•1,735.2 
billion (see Chart
 A).
 This 
decline 
reflects 
higher net autonomous factors 
and lower liquidity pro
vision through the Eurosystem™s tender operations and 
monetary policy portfolios. In the sixth reserve maintenance period, recourse to the 
deposit facility decreased by •99.1 billion, while excess liquidity deposited at current 
accounts increased by •55.8 
billion. The shift suggests that some intermediaries 
started moving funds from the deposit facility to current accounts anticipating the 
implementation of the two
-tier system for reserve remuneration, which was 
announced on 12 September 2019, as the zero r
emuneration applies only to funds 
held in the current accounts. 
The two
-tier system applie
s as of
 the seventh 
maintenance period starting on 30 October
 2019, therefore it does not affect the 
remuneration of excess liquidity in the period under review. Coun
terparties™ eligible 
reserve holdings are computed on the basis of average end
-of-calendar
-day balances 
held in the institutions™ current accounts over the maintenance period
. Interest rate developments
 During the review period, on 2 October, the •STR was 
published for the first 
time.
 30 Based on a comparison with pre
-publication data, there was no change in the 
•STR around the time of first publication.
 The cut in the deposit facility rate to 
-0.50% with effect from 18 September has 
been transmitted to 
short
-term money market rates.
 In the unsecured money 
market segment, the 10 basis point reduction in the deposit facility rate was fully 
passed through to the •STR, as it averaged 
-0.550% in the sixth reserve maintenance 
period, compared to 
-0.450% in the
 fifth reserve maintenance period.
31 EONIA also 
declined from 
-0.362% to 
-0.462% during the same period. The lower deposit facility 
rate was also transmitted to 
secured 
money 
market
 rates.
 From the fifth to the sixth
 reserve maintenance period, 
the average 
overnight repo rates for the standard and 
the extended collateral basket in the general collateral (GC) pooling market
32 declined 
by 0.097% to

 Indicators of labour market conditions in the euro area
  52 4 Indicators of labour market conditions in the euro area
 Prepared
 by Vasco Botelho and António Dias da Silva
 This box presents two complementary tools 
for
 assess
ing
 the performance of the 
labour market in the euro area. The first is a visualisation tool 
in the form
 of a spider 
chart
 that
 display
s 18 variables characteri
sing the current 
euro area 
labour market 
conditions. The second applies a principal component analysis to the variables 
displayed on
 the spider chart. This approach summarises the available information on 
euro area
 labour market conditions in two synthetic
 indicators
33: level of activity and 
labour market
 momentum. The indicator for the level of activity compares 
developments in the labour market over time
, while
 the indicator for the labour market 
momentum assesses the rate of change in the performance of t
he labour market. The 
analysis presented
 is for the euro area as a whole and does not
 fully show
 cross
-country labour market heterogeneity.
 The visualisation tool
 for the euro area labour market is 
shown in
 Chart A, 
which 
represents
 labour market condition
s using
 a ﬁmultifocal lens
ﬂ approach.
34 This tool allows for a quick overview of the labour market by comparing 
the current values of each time series 
with
 their best and worst outcomes since 2005. 
It also allows a comparison of current labour market 
condit
ions 
with 
those
 at 
other 
points in 
time, such as the peak before the crisis (the first quarter of 2008) and the start 
of the economic recovery (the first quarter of 2013). The variables presented in Chart 
A reflect
 the complexity of the labour market. As s
uch, these variables
 not only 
address
 current employment and unemployment dynamics, but also provide further 
information on other factors characterising the labour market conditions for both 
workers and firms, such as 
(i) 
unemployment conditions
 in terms of duration and age, 
(ii)
 labour market flows and posted vacancies
, (iii)
 the utilisation of labour input and its 
implications for labour productivity and real wages
, and (iv) 
structural factors that may 
be affecting the 
developments 
current
ly observed in the labour market.
                                                                     33  The methodological approach follows that used 
for
 the
 Kansas City Fed™s
 ﬁLabor Mar
ket Conditions 
Indicators (LMCI)
ﬂ.
 Other LMCI have been developed by the 
Reserve Bank of Australia
, the 
Bank of 
Canada
 and the 
Reserve Bank of New Zealand
, using a similar approach.
 34  The presentation of the labour market variables in this form takes inspiration from the 
Atlanta Fed
™s ﬁLabor Market Distributions Spider Chart
ﬂ, which is a tool developed to monitor broad developments in 
the labour market over time. The visualisation approach is slightly

 Indicators of labour market conditions in the euro area
  54 market situation are the record high levels of the employment to population
 ratio 
in the 
prime age population (persons aged 25 to 54 years old) and the labour force 
participation rate. Conversely, the skill mismatch indicator and the geographical 
dispersion of the unemployment rate
36 are
 significantly 
higher than they were
 pre
-cri
sis and remain at levels comparable 
with
 those observed at the start of the 
recovery.
 The second tool applies a 
principal component analysis to consolidate the 
complex
 information 
on the labour market in
to two synthetic indicators.
 This
 analysis uses the a
vailable information on the euro area labour market while isolating 
the main patterns affecting labour market conditions.
37 With this approach
, two main 
components are identified. The first component is related 
to
 the level of activity in the 
labour market,
 reflecting primarily
 the developments in the employment
-population 
ratio for the prime age population, unemployment rate, job finding rate, youth 
unemployment rate and share of long
-term unemployment. The second component is 
more revealing of the momentum
 in the labour market, being related 
primarily 
to the 
growth rate of total employment, growth rate of average hours worked, share of 
long
-term unemployment, PMI on employment and short
-term unemployment rate. A 
third component is identified 
by 
controlling 
for 
any mismeasurement in the calculation 
of the synthetic indicators for the level of activity and euro area labour market 
momentum 
due to the possible non
-stationarity of some labour market variables.
38 The
 synthetic indicators show that the 
level of acti
vity in the 
euro area labour 
market is comparable 
with
 its
 pre
-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2019, 
while labour market momentum remains elevated
, even if it
 has 
slow
ed somewhat (
see Chart B).
 The two indicators appear to closely capture cyclical 
mov
ements in the 
euro area 
labour market. The indicator for the level of labour market 
activity peak
s before the recession in the first quarter of 2008, and then progressively 
declines until the beginning of the employment recovery
, reaching its lowest value in 
the second quarter of 2013. 
It returned to its long
-term average value at the end of 
2016, concurrent with the return of total employment to its pre
-crisis peak
, and i
n the 
second quarter of 2019 reached 
levels 
comparable 
with
 those 
before the crisis. 
The                                                                     36  The geographical dispersion of the unemployment rate is
 measured as the coefficient of variation of the 
unemployment rate across all euro area countries, weighted by their respective employment shares. The 
skill mismatch indicator follows the methodology in Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the 
European System of Central Banks,

). The relevant principal components are chosen according to two criteria: (i) 
the sum of all chosen components has to account for at le
ast 80% of the total variance of all 18 labour 
market variables, and (ii) each component must have a corresponding eigenvalue significantly above 
unity. The components are then passed through a varimax rotation to make them easier to interpret, in 
line wit
h the Kansas City Fed™s LMCI. The LMCI developed for the euro area in this box are robust to the 
removal of any individual labour market variable.
 38  This component (not shown in Chart B) is mostly influenced by trending labour market variables, such as 
the labour force participation rate, skill mismatch indicator, geographical dispersion of the unemployment 
rate, job vacancy rate and labour indicator of the factors limiting production. As such, this component is 
associated with the long
-term changes that o
ccurred in the labour market between 2005 and 2019. 
Excluding the third component would result in a lower observed level for labour market activity and higher 
labour market momentum in recent quarters. The resulting three LMCI account jointly for 84.9% of 
the 
total variance of the 18 labour market variables in Chart A. Developments in the employment rate are 
consistent with the indicator on the level of activity.

to analyse the complex information of the 
labour market.
 The spider chart 
represents the various concurrent dimensions of the labour market, e.g. 
unemployment conditions, developments in labour market flows and vacancies, 
developments of labour input, productivity and real wages, and changes in th
e structural conditions of the labour market in the euro area. The two synthetic labour 
market indicators summarise the most relevant information from the 18 variables 
plotted on the spider chart. These indicators provide a gauge for the level of activity 
and the momentum of the euro area labour market and thus help to assess its 
performance and cyclical position
. The analysis suggests that
 there is scope for
 the 
level of activity in the euro area labour market to continue improving in the near future, 
benefiting from positive labour market momentum
. The indicators do not fully cater for 
country
-specific heterogeneity in the euro area labour market, and improvements in 
labour market conditions are dependent on future changes in the cyclical position of 
the e

 Recent developments in social security contributions and minimum wages in the euro area
  56 5 Recent developments in social security contributions and 
minimum wages in the euro area
 Prepared by Ferdinand Dreher, Omiros Kouvavas and Gerrit Koester
 The behaviour of labour costs can be significantly affected by country
-specific 
changes in social security contributions and minimum wages.
 An awareness of 
the nature and magnitude of such factors is important when assessing the strength of 
wage growth and its implications for producer and consumer price inflation. This box 
examines h
ow these two factors have affected aggregate euro area wage growth.
 Measures of labour costs, such as 
compensation per employee
39, can at times 
be affected by measures related to employers™ social security contributions.
 If
 substantial enough, changes in th
e social security contributions made by employers 
can drive a wedge between different wage measures (see Chart A, panel a). For 
example, the gap between the growth in compensation per employee and the growth 
in wages and salaries per employee in 2015
-16 was related
 to cuts in employers™ 
social security contributions in each of the four largest euro area countries (see Chart 
A, panel b).
40 Since the beginning of 2019, a gap has again opened up, which relates 
mainly to 
a significant drop in social security con
tributions in France
, while in Germany, 
Italy and Spain employers™ social security contributions have increased
. The reduction 
in employers™ social security contributions in France 
was related to a 
legislative 
change
 implying a 
permanent reduction in emplo
yers™ social security contributions
, which 
replac
ed the tax credit for competitiveness and employment (
crédit d™impôt pour 
la compétitivité et l™emploi
 Œ CICE)
. This legislative change held back growth in 
compensation per employee 
in the first three quarte
rs of 2019, with increases of 2.3%, 
2.2% and 2.1% in the first, second and third quarters respectively 
Œ only slightly above 
the long
-term average of 2.1% since 1999. A
nnual growth in wages and salaries per 
employee, which excludes 
employers™ 
social securi
ty contributions and is not affected 
by the legislative change in France, 
hence grew stronger than c
ompensation per 
employee
 at a rate of 
2.6%, 2.5% and 2.5% in the first, second and third quarters 
respectively 
Œ comfortably above the long
-term average of 
2.2% since 1999
. 
Overall, 
growth in wages and salaries per employee is more dynamic at the current juncture 
than growth in c
ompensation per employee
.                                                                     39  Compensation per employee is the total remuneration, in cash or in kind, that is payable by 
employers to 
employees in return for work, i.e. gross wages and salaries, as well as bonuses, overtime payments and 
employers™ social security contributions, divided by the total number of employees.
 40  It should be noted that social security contributions
 to wage growth can reflect more than just changes in 
social security rates.

 Note: The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2019.
 Changes in minimum wages can also significantly affect wage behaviour, as 
they are governed 
by indexation or legislation rules rather than wage 
bargaining processes.
 Minimum wages exist in 15 of the 19 euro area countries.
41 In July 2019 the minimum wage 
paid in
 the 
euro area range
d from
 •430 (Latvia) 
to
 •2,071 (Luxembourg)
 per month
. Over the las
t ten years, 
the minimum wage 
has 
increased,
 on average
, by 
between 1.5% (Ireland) and 
7% (
Estonia
) per year.
42 Minimum wage levels are set 
using different methods 
Œ including predetermined 
formulas, expert committee recommendations and consultation with so
cial partners
 Œ but are often also subject to government discretion
. As a result,
 the frequency of 
change
 differs
 from one country to another
. However, 
most countries usually revise 
their 
minimum wages every one to two years
. Minimum wage growth has so far
 been substantially stronger in 2019 than 
growth in overall wages and salaries per employee.
 An index for the euro area 
compiled on the basis of available country data
43 shows that, after only a 1% increase 
in statutory minimum wages in 2018, minimum wages 
increased by 4.6% year on year 
in the first half of 2019 (see Chart B).
                                                                     41  The four euro area countries with no statutory minimum wages are
 Italy
, Cyprus, Austria and Finland
. 42  Source: Eurostat.
 43  The index is weighted by the number of employees in
 the respective countries. 
For countries with no 
minimum wage, the minimum wage is assumed to be zero. This means that the growth rate of euro area 
minimum wages in Chart B is weighed down by the inclusion of countries with no minimum wage.

 Œ Boxes
 Recent developments in social security contributions and minimum wages
 in the euro area
  59 The direct mechanical impact of changes in the level of the minimum wage on 
overall euro area wage growth tends to be small.
 Calculating
 such direct 
contributions requires information on the number of recipients. This box uses data
 from the 
EU Statistics 
on Income and 
Living 
Conditions
 (EU
-SILC) to derive a proxy 
for the share of minimum wage recipients in recipients of overall wages and salaries.
45 Bearing in mind the considerable uncertainty surrounding this proxy, the data for the
 euro area show that the direct mechanical contribution of minimum wages to growth in 
wages and salaries per employee has increased in 2019, but has 
Œ with a magnitude 
of around 0.1 percentage points 
Œ been quite limited 
(see Chart 
C, panel b
). For some co
untri
es, the direct mechanical impact of changes in minimum 
wages 
on the 
growth 
of 
wages and salaries 
per employee has likely been more 
substantial.
 In
 the first half of 2019, for example, the estimates based on the proxy 
suggest that minimum wage growth h
as contributed up to 0.5 percentage points to 
national wage growth (see Chart C, panel b).
 However, such estimates cover only the 
direct effects of minimum wage changes on wage growth in an accounting sense. 
Hence they abstract from indirect effects of min
imum wages on the wage scale
46, as 
well as from effects linked to the possible repercussions of changes in minimum 
wages on employment
47 or to the dynamic interaction of wage
-setting and minimum 
wage adjustments.
 Taken together, 
wage growth
 has been quite robust recently, especially if 
developments in social security contributions are taken into account.
 While
 growth in compensation per employee has been softening over recent quarters (see 
Chart A), it reflects mainly lower employers™ social
 security contributions. Growth in 
wages and salaries per employee, which exclude employers™ social security 
contributions, remained quite robust and has also benefited recently from a somewhat 
higher contribution of minimum wages
. Overall this box support
s the view that the 
robustness of wage growth is mainly the result of resilient labour markets, especially 
when taking into account recent developments in social security contributions and 
minimum wages.
                                                                      45  First, the share of minimum wage recipients is calculated based on the EU
-SILC data. For this we 
calculate the share of employees with an 
income 
within a
 band of 90% to 110% of the minimum wage
. This share is then applied to the total number of employees in the economy to derive the number of 
recipients of minimum wages in an economy. Multiplying this
 number by the respective level of the 
minimum wage in each country gives the amount of wages and salaries that can be assigned to minimum 
wage recipients and allows for the calculation of the share of this group in overall wages and salaries in 
each count
ry and 
Œ aggregating country results 
Œ the euro area. Controlling for differences in hours 
worked by minimum wage recipients and overall employment does not substantially affect the results. 
The percentages of employees have been estimated using EU
-SILC mi
cro data for every year up until 
the last observation of 2016. For the rest of the sample the percentages are kept constant, except where 
country
-level administrative data are available to complement the analysis.

48 It has two aims:

; and, 
second, it explores the main charact
eristics of exporting SMEs and 
focuses on the 
analysis of 
some financial dimensions 
that 
are relevant 
to 
the decision to export
, as 
derived from the survey 
responses.
 The survey responses confirm that non

area SMEs
. More than a third of SMEs exported goods or services in 2018. In 
addition, the percentage of exporting companies increases with company size, 
with 
only a quarter of micro firms reporting exports outside their domestic market
, but more

 also exported outside the euro area

. Results 
refer to round 
21 of the survey
 (April to September 2019
). Turning to financial characteristics, there is evidence that 
SMEs face several 
challenges in order to become exp
orters.
 Exporting involves 
costs of 
entry into 
foreign markets 
and Œ in comparison with domestic sales 
Œ a longer time span 
between the export order and the final payment 
for 
the sale
. In addition, these 
costs 
are often sunk costs
 that 
have to be paid
 up f
ront
, 
and exporters need to have 
sufficient financial flexibility to cope with the challenges
. For these reasons, it has been 
argued that exporters may be particularly affected by constraints on their access to 
finance, and searching for supporting evidenc
e has been the subject of many 
contributions in the academic literature.

 Export activities of euro area SMEs: insights from the Survey on the Access to Finance of 
Enterprises (SAFE)
  62 Export
ing SMEs tend to be more profitable and innovative than non
-exporting 
ones
. A regular question in the survey on exporting companies
51 allows 
an overall 
picture of the financial 
characteristics of exporting SMEs
 to be formed
. Table A 
reports 
evidence on 
whether 
exporting SMEs 
display a specific characteristic more often than 
non-exporting SMEs (
see Table A, p
anel A). It also 
shows 
the differences 
between 
SMEs exporting 
to
 differen
t markets, i.e. within and outside of Europe (
see Table A, 
panel B).
52 The reported characteristics are those that are 
commonly 
considered to 
explain why a firm decides to export: corporate ownership, financial soundness, 
innovativeness and diversification 
of sources of finance
.53 The signs in the table 
should not be interpreted as signals of a causal relationship but 
as 
a mere description 
of the evidence provided by firms™ replies. 
For instance, a negative sign for the variable 
ﬁfamily
-ownedﬂ indicates that 
the percentage of SMEs that are family
-owned is smaller 
among exporters than among non
-exporters (
see the first column in p
anel A
 of Table 
A) and 
the asterisks show that 
the difference with respect to non
-exporters SMEs is 
statistically significant (
see th
e second column in p
anel A
 of Table A).
 Exporting SMEs tend more often to be listed on stock markets. In addition, there 
is a higher percentage of profitable
54 and more innovative firms among exporting SMEs. 
Furthermore, exporters make more use of external 
sources of finance, in particular 
subsidised loans
 Œ often in the form of guarantees or reduced interest rate loans
 Œ and 
normal
 bank loans. Trade credit is also an important external source 
of 
working 
capital
, as it allows more flexibility in the capital 
requirements.
 SMEs 
exporting 
to markets 
outside Europe tend 
to 
make more use of own 
funds and equity financing than SMEs exporting only within Europe.
 The ad
 hoc 
question also allows 
the investigation of 
which additional dimensions may 
characterise 
SMEs t
hat export outside of Europe rather than 
confining themselves to 
the European market.
55 The prior is that, 
owing 
to additional trade barriers 
Œ technical 
rules, regulations 
and financial requirements, which might be different from those in 
the EU 
Œ and addit
ional cross
-border costs, these firms 
would 
need to be even more 
financially resilient than SMEs 
that export 
only within Europe. The results presented in 
panel B of Table A confirm that SMEs exporting outside of Europe are more innovative 
and tend to finan
ce their activities more with their own funds
 and with subsidi
sed loans
 than firms exporting only within Europe
. 
At the same time, more of them 
report 
raising 
equity capital.
 SMEs 
that operate in the industrial sector and export outside of Europe are 
even more innovative and 
make more 
use 
of 
subsided loans and trade credit 
than their peers who export only within Europe
 (see Table A)
. The fact that SMEs 
exporting outside Europe 
use s
ubsidi
sed loans (or 
grants
) and trade credit 
more 
than 
                                                                    51  For more details, see question D7 of the 
SAFE questionnaire
. 52  All the results presented in Table A are based on univariate analyses. They are confirmed when 
multivariate regression analyses, based on probit models, are performed.

Europe.

 To conclude, t
he 
responses to
 an ad hoc question in the latest round of SAFE 
on the export activit
ies
 of euro area SMEs signal that non
-domestic sales are 
important.
 Moreover,
 a significant percentage of 
exporting SMEs are dealing with 
markets
 outside 
Europe, in particular in the indu
strial sector. In general, exporting 
SMEs tend to be more profitable and innovative than non
-exporting SMEs
. This 
evidence on the export activities of SMEs 
should help
 to
 improve understanding of 
the 
overall export dynamics among all euro area firms and 
the impact of external 
economic conditions on the euro area economy
. However, it has to be taken into 
account that the ad hoc question only focused on direct exports by SMEs, but SMEs 
may well be part of the supply chain for larger companies, which, in tur
n, export other 
products.
 The survey results also point to a few important features of exporting SMEs in the euro 
area. For example, most likely reflecting the additional costs and financing needs of 
exporting firms discussed above, 
the percentage of expor
ting companies increases 
with company size. 
They also tend to have 
greater diversification in 
their 
sources of 
external finance
, which, together with the fact that they are more innovative, may 
suggest that they have to be more capital
-intensive to compete
 in international 
markets. This underscores the need for well
-functioning and well
-developed financial 
markets that guarantee SMEs efficient access to finance to sustain their export 
activities.

  64 7 The review of draft budgetary plans for 2020 
Œ some 
implica

 Prepared by Stephan Haroutunian, Sebastian Hauptmeier and Nadine 
Leiner
-Killinger
 On 2
1 November
 2019 the European Commission released its opinions on the 
draft budgetary plans
 of euro area governments for 20
20, toge
ther with an 
analysis of the budgetary situation in the euro area as a whole.
 Each
 opinion 
include
s an assessment of
 the compliance of
 the 
relevant 
plan with the Stability and 
Growth Pact (SGP)
 based on the Commission™s 2019 autumn economic forecast
. 
This 
review exercise also assesses whether countries have incorporated into their plans 
the country
-specific recommendations for fiscal policies that were addressed to them 
under the 2019 European Semester, as adopted by the Economic and Financial 
Affairs Counc
il on 9 July 2019.
56 The recommendations call on countries with high 
ratios of government debt to GDP to aim for a sufficiently fast reduction of these ratios. 
Some countries with room for budgetary manoeuvre are recommended to make use of 
this room, includ
ing for achieving an upward trend in government investment. The 
review of the draft budgetary plans identifies weaknesses in the follow
-up to 
the 
recommendations. It is
 important that
 such shortcomings be addressed
, inter alia,
 in 
the Commission™s forthcom
ing review of the ﬁsix
-packﬂ and ﬁtwo
-packﬂ regulations, 
which were implemented in 2011 and 2013 respectively in the aim of strengthening 
fiscal governance.
 The draft budgetary plans for 2020 result in a slightly expansionary fiscal 
stance for the euro are
a as a whole while reflecting very different fiscal 
developments across countries.
 Measured as a deterioration in the structural 
primary balance amounting to 0.4% of GDP, the planned fiscal stance in 2020 would 
provide support to economic activity in the e
uro area. As regards its composition, 
however, the Commission conclude
d that ﬁ
compliance with the Stability and Growth 
Pact by euro
-area Member States not at their medium
-term budgetary objectives 
combined with a bigger expansion by euro
-area Member States
 with fiscal space 
would result in a better differentiation between euro
-area Member States
ﬂ.57 In view of 
the weaker growth outlook for the euro area and the elevated level of uncertainty, the 
Eurogroup stated that it ﬁstands ready to co
-ordinateﬂ a differ
entiated fiscal response if 
downside risks were to materialise.
58 In the Commission™s opinions, the draft budgetary plans of nine euro area 
countries are deemed to be compliant with the SGP
: Germany, Ireland, Greece, 
Cyprus, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the
 Netherlands and Austria. These countries 
are projected to record sound fiscal positions in 2020 as defined by their medium
-term 
budgetary objectives (MTOs). In this context, the Eurogroup
 welcomed that some 
ﬁMember States with a favourable budgetary situation have made use of it and plan to 
                                                                    56  See

 The draft budgetary plans of a sizeable number of euro area countries are 
assessed to pose risks of non

particular concern for countries with high government debt

ording 
to the Commission™s forecast, the planned structural 
adjustments
 are expected to fall 
significantly short of the SGP™s requirements in eight countries, namely Belgium, 
Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland (see Chart B). Amo
ng them, Belgium, Spain and Portugal submitted plans on a no
-policy
-change basis, 
reflecting 
the election of new governments 
in the latter two countries and the ongoing 
process for the formation of a federal government in Belgium. The Eurogroup invited 
all
 eight countries ﬁto consider in a timely manner the necessary additional measures 
to address the risks identified by the Commission and to ensure that their 2020 budget 
will be compliant with SGP provisionsﬂ. Importantly, it reiterated that ﬁa slow pace o
f debt reduction from high levels in a number of Member States remains a matter for 
concern and should be decisively addressed, including by making use of windfall 
                                                                    59  For count
ries subject to the SGP™s preventive arm, draft budgetary plans are ﬁbroadly compliantﬂ if, 
according to the Commission™s forecast, the
y may result in some deviation from the MTO or the 
adjustment path towards it, but the shortfall relative to the requirem
ent would not represent a significant 
deviation from it. Deviations from the fiscal targets under the preventive arm are classified as ﬁsignificantﬂ 
if they exceed 0.5% of GDP in one year or 0.25% of GDP on average in two consecutive years.

include the request by the Italian authorities for flexibility under the 
unusual event clause of the SGP.
 The 
exercise of 
review
ing
 the
 draft budgetary plans is a reminder that the EU™s 
fiscal governance framework 
should be improved to facilitate a smoother 
operation of policies in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
. In particula
r, the 
SGP™s rules remain asymmetric and thus cannot guide the aggregate euro area fiscal 
stance. 
Countries that have not yet achieved their MTOs need to make progress 
towards them, while countries that have reached them are not required to use their 
buffe
rs. This can lead to procyclical fiscal policies in times when the euro area 
economy as a whole would benefit from support from budgetary policies. Moreover, in 
several countries the pace of the reduction in government debt from high levels 
remains far fro
m sufficient, despite the strengthening of the rules in 2011 which set in 
place a debt rule to accelerate the decline in government debt
-to
-GDP ratios towards 
the Treaty reference value of 60% of GDP. Notably, owing to the cumulative effects of 
different f
orms of flexibility
 provided for in the SGP
, it 
is not possible to
 ensure that 
countries 
Œ especially high
-debt countries 
Œ will converge towards their MTOs 
sufficiently rapidly. Finally, the fact that the plans of a number of countries with high 
governmen

President

governance in the EU.
62 The EFB suggest
ed changing the anchor for the rules from 
the MTO to 
a long
-term ceiling in terms of government debt to GDP
. It 
also
 suggested 
that this be combined with an expenditure rule as the only operational indicator to 
guide fiscal policies. Accordin
g to the EFB, existing flexibility clauses should be 
merged into a single escape clause, to be triggered on the basis of independent 
economic judgement. In this context
, a stronger role is foreseen for independent fiscal 
councils, while the Commission shou
ld have greater independence in its 
assessments. Sanctions, which have proven difficult to apply, could be complemented 
or replaced by incentive mechanisms
. Such mechanisms could entail 
linking access to
 a macroeconomic stabilisation function (
a ﬁeuro area

with the 
fiscal 
rules. All these suggestions merit in

63 Looking ahead, the operation of the EU fiscal framework is a prerequisite for 
further deepening EMU.
 Beyond the recently adopted budgetary instrument for 
convergence and competitiveness

macroeconomic stabilisation function for the euro area remains indispensable. Such a 
function typically
 exists in other monetary unions to better 
address

 1 What does the 
bank lending survey
 tell us about credit 
conditions for euro area firms?
 Prepared by Lorenzo Burlon, Maria Dimou, Anna
-Camilla Drahonsky 
and Petra Köhler
-Ulbrich
67 This article examines bank lending conditions 
for euro area non
-financial corporations 
(NFCs), making use of the wealth of soft information available in the euro area bank 
lending survey (BLS) since its inception in 2003. O
ne relevant question in this context 
is whether the tightening of 
the 
bank loan
 supply during the financial and sovereign 
debt crises ha
s been offset
 by the easing of bank lending conditions 
for
 loans to 
NFC
s since 2014
. The article illustrates that the easing over this period has come mainly 
through a substantial loosening of the ac
tual terms and conditions applied
 by banks 
to
 new 
loans to firms of average credit quality, while the credit standards that banks 
have 
established for their loan approval decision
s have eased
 by less.
 The
 article 
also 
draws on the responses of individual 
banks to examine the
 differences in 
bank lending 
conditions for NFC loans
 over
 time and 
across 
bank business models.
 This analysis 
reveals 
that the change in credit conditions of 
banks 
with
 business model
s more 
reliant
 on stable funding sources, such as de
posits, 
is more muted. 
In short
, 
it looks at 
additional aspects that 
enhance
 the regular assessment of bank lending conditions 
faced by firms 
based on the euro area BLS
. 1 Introduction
 The euro area bank lending survey (BLS) provides 
a rich set of soft 
inf
ormation 
on changes to
 bank lending conditions
, 
which complements and potentially 
enhances hard statistical data on loan growth.
 When combined with actual loan 
growth and lending rates,
 this unique set of information helps 
us to un
derstand 
developments in 
loan supply and demand and the
 related
 driving
 factors. In addition
, 
BLS data have been shown to have strong leading indicator properties vis

 What does the bank lending survey tell us about credit conditions for euro area firms?
  69 approval criteria for loans 
to non
-financial corporations (NFCs)
 during
 the financial and 
sovereign debt crises, an unprecedented extended easing period was observed 
from
 the beginning of 2014 up to early 2019. 
More recently
, 
there has been some variation 
in the changes made by banks to their
 loan approval criteria ami
d concerns about the 
euro area economic outlook. 
Against this background, the article takes a longer
-term 
perspective on the BLS evidence, covering the period since the onset of the global 
financial crisis, and focuses on three distinct aspects.
 First
, thi
s article 
reviews
 the long
-term 
developments in
 credit standards and 
the 
related 
contributing factors
. Differences in the importance of 
these 
driving 
factors 
over time are analysed with a view to gaining a better understanding of 
changes in bank lending co
nditions
. 
It turns out that the perception of risks in relation 
to the economic outlook is an important driving factor behind bank lending conditions, 
particularly during periods when credit standards are tightened.
 Second
, 
it examines
 whether the tighteni
ng of bank lending conditions during 
the financial and sovereign debt crises has been 
offset
 by the easing of bank 
lending conditions 
for
 NFC loans since 2014
. The article 
analyses
 the information 
from changes in banks™
 credit standards
 and terms and condi
tions
, which
 cover 
complementary aspects, mainly relating to loan
 supply
. While 
actual bank lending 
conditions 
for
 average 
NFC 
loans have loosened substantially
 since 2014 and appear 
to have returned to levels similar to those seen at the beginning of the financial crisis
, banks™ credit standards have eased 
by 
less
. In this context, banks™ supervisory 
requirements, the need to strengthen their balance sheets and 
the avoidance of 
heightened credit risk emerge as likely factors behind the moderate loosening of 
banks™ loan approval criteria.
 Third
, the article 
provides
 evidence on bank lending conditions across bank 
business models
. Based on a new BLS dataset that ma
kes it possible to group 
banks™ responses based on their business model, bank 
loan supply 
conditions are 
analysed over time, and similarities as well as differences across business models are 
highlighted
. 
Importantly, 
business models with 
relatively 
stable
 funding sources show 
more 
moderate 
variations
 in credit conditions
 compared with other bank types. In 
short
, 
this article looks at 
additional aspects that 
enhance
 the regular assessment of 
bank lending conditions
 based on the euro area BLS
. 2 Bank loan su
pply conditions

firms

 Banks
™ credit standards for loans to euro area firms
 Credit standards
, which reflect

, are a key indicator of bank lending conditions.

  70 In addition, 
changes in credit standards 
for
 NFC loans lead actual NFC loan growth by 
around one year.
71 They are therefore helpful for assess
ing
 loan growth 
developments over the coming year.
 Moreover, banks™ expectations in relation to the 
development of their credit standards are generally an accurate reflection of their 
actual development, thereby providing further lead information on the devel
opment of 
bank lending conditions.

 While actual developments of credit standards and loan demand refer to the pa

credit standards refer to banks™ expectations over the next three months and have therefore been shifted by one quarter.
 The net easing of credit standards 
from 2014 up until early 2019 
has been the 
longest net easing period 
since
 the 
inception of the 
BLS 
at 
the beginning of 
2003. Following a 
drastic
 tightening of credit standards 
for
 euro area NFC loans 
between the third quarter of 2007 and the second half of 2011 
during
 the euro area 
financial and 
sovereign debt cris
es (with a ne
t peak of 68% at the time of the Lehman 
Brothers collapse in the third quarter of 2008)
, euro area banks started to ease credit 
standards in net terms in the first quarter of 2014. Th
is net easing lasted for about 20 
quarters (with an interruption in the s
econd half of 2016) until the first quarter of 2019
, equivalent to
 the longest net easing period 
since
 the BLS 
began. 
By comparison, the 
net easing period before the start of the financial crisis, from the third quarter of 2004 
until the second quarter of 
2007, lasted for 
12 quarters. The net easing of banks™ 
approval criteria for corporate loans since 2014 supported the recovery in NFC bank 
loan growth and economic activity in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In the second 
and third 
quarter
s of 2019,
 there 
was
 some 
variation
 in 
the changes made by 
banks 
to
 their 
credit standards 
amid concerns about the euro area economic outlook, while 
actual lending rates remained at historical
ly low levels.

 Which f
actors 
have driven changes in
 credit standards 
for
 NFC 
loans
? The factors driving changes in credit standards provide a better understanding 
of the reasons behind changes in banks™ loan approval criteria.
 Euro area banks 
also report the underlying factors which contribute to 
changes in
 credit standards
. The 
importance of these factors 
evolves
 over time, depending on the state of the economy
 (see Chart 
2). 
They 
help 
us gain additional insight into 
alterations in 
bank lending 
conditions
 and to differentiate between changes in bank loan growth that have be
en driven mainly by changes originating in the banking system, such as in banks™ funding 
cost or risk tolerance, and changes in the general economic environment that have an 
impact on bank loan supply owing to changes in borrowers™ credit risk or collatera
l, but 
which do not reflect pure loan supply effects
.72 Risk perceptions regarding the economic outlook 
are
 the most important factor 
for explaining the 
changes in
 credit standards
 and are closely related to real 
economic developments
. When looking at the f
actors 
that 
contribut
e to the 
changes 
in credit standards 
from the
 banks
™ perspective
, two main observations 
emerge
 (see 
Chart 
2). First, 
and in 
keeping
 with the 
changes in
 credit standards 
for
 NFC loans, the 
tightening impact of the
se factors has been 
gre
ater
 than the easing impact. Second, 
risk perceptions 
have been 
the 
most important
 factor for 
explaining 
the 
changes in
 credit standards 
over
 time
 (contributing an average net tightening of 13% since 2003). 
The high correlation with credit standards applies in particular to
 tightening 
periods, 
but risk perceptions also play an important role when banks ease their credit 
standards
. 
They are closely r
elated to the development of real economic and business 
sentiment indicators (see Chart 3). Therefore, risk perceptions signal the impact of 
changes in the economic outlook on credit standards, over and above the changes 
that originate in the banking syste
m itself.

  73 constraints
 contributed to a tightening of credit standards, particularly during the 
financial crisis, against the background of banks™ losses and associate
d deleveraging 
pressure as well as an increase in banks™ funding cost. As regards the relationship 
between the driving factors, a tightening contribution of risk perceptions 
has often 
been connected with a parallel tightening contribution of banks™ cost of
 funds and 
balance sheet situation
. This is because a worsening of
 the economic outlook
 tends to 
lead to a deterioration in
 borrowers™ creditworthiness
 and increased credit risk, with 
negative implications for banks™ balance sheets
. By contrast
, 
competitive pressure
, mainly from other banks,
 is the most 
important factor for explaining an easing of credit standards.
 Specifically
, the net 
easing of credit standards on NFC loans since 2014
 has, to a large e
xtent,
 been related 
to competitive pressures
. Lastly
, banks™ risk tolerance has overall had a broadly neutral and, in some 
periods, small tightening impact on credit standards for NFC loans since 2015
. This
 signals
 that, 
according to the banks
, they have not reacted to 
low or negative 
interest rates
 by increasing their risk
-taking
.74 2.3
 Why has the net easing of credit standards since 2014 been 
rather moderate?
 Banks™ overall easing of credit standards on corporate loans 
since 2014 
appears moderate
 compared with the previous tightening 
(see Chart 
4). When 
summing up the net percentage changes, 
the 
cumulated
 net easing 
of credit 
standards over the past five years, compared 
with
 the 
cumulated
 net tightening of 
credit standards 
for
 loans to euro area NFCs during the financial crisis, appears 
moderate
 despite the 
extended
 net easing period.
 Banks indicated the strongest net 
easing of their credit standards in the first quarter of 2015 (
-10%), when the ECB 
introduced its asset purchase programme, close to the values reached before the 
onset of the financial
 crisis (with a negative peak of 
-13% in the second quarter of 
2005).
                                                                     74  The factor ﬁbanks™ risk toleranceﬂ was introduced in the first quarter of 2015.

  74 Chart 
4 Credit standards on NFC loans
 (net percentages and percentages of banks
)  Source: ECB (BLS).
 Note
: See Chart 1
. The overall moderate net easing suggests
 that credit standards are currently 
tighter than the
y were before the crisis.
 Corroborating evidence is also provided by 
the BLS ad hoc question on the level of credit standards, which complements the 
quarterly question on changes in credit standards on a
n annual basis. According to the 
banks™ responses, the level of banks™ credit standards for euro area NFC loans in the 
first quarter of 2019 was still tighter than the historical range of credit standards since 
2003.75 Several reasons may be 
behind
 the limi
ted net easing
 of banks™ loan approval 
criteria
. First
, generous lending conditions before the financial crisis have probably 
contributed to higher risk awareness of banks in their lending 
decisions since
 the crisis.
 Among the driving factors behind credit
 standards mentioned above, 
banks™ risk perceptions and willingness to take on credit risk matter considerably. They 
may contribute to explaining why banks have eased their credit standards only 
moderately since the financial crisis. In fact, while lax cre
dit standards may have 
contributed to fuelling high NFC loan growth before the onset of the financial crisis, 
there are currently no indications of a heightened risk tolerance of euro area banks 
(see Section 2.2 above).
                                                                     75  See the ECB
™s website on the 
euro area bank lending survey
. At the same time, it should be 
acknowledged that an assessment of the current level of credit standards compared with the long
-term 
range since 2003 may be difficult for the banks and therefore needs to be viewed with some caution.

 Second
, banks™ need to fulfil additional supervisory and regulatory 
requirements

financial crisis has 
had 
a tightening impact on 
their
 credit standards.
 Euro area banks have stated that new regulatory and 
supervisory requirements have
 had, on average since 2011 (when the question was 
introduced), 
a tightening impact on their credit standards (see Chart 
5). During the net 
easing period of NFC credit standards since 2014, the regulatory and supervisory 
impact
 on credit standards
 was neutral on average, suggesting that the previous 
tightening impact w
as not reversed
. 
This is consistent with the broadly neutral impact 
of banks™ capital positions on banks™ credit standards for NFC loans during the net 
easing of credit standards since 2014.
 Third
, 
in 
relat
ion
 to banks™ need to clean
 up their balance sheet
s, 
non-performing loan (NPL) 
ratios 
have also had 
a tightening impact on banks™ 
credit standards.
 The
 tightening impact was particularly relevant in the period from 
2014 to 2017 according to euro area banks,
76 in line with the level of actual NPL ratios 
of 
banks, but NPLs have also more recently continued to exert a tightening impact on 
banks™ credit standards (see Chart 6). 
Overall, banks
 have strengthened their
 balance 
sheets
 and, specifically, reduced their NPL ratios since 2014, supported by 
the ECB
™s 
unconventional monetary policy
 measures
. This has improved 
banks™ resilience
. While 
this 
should contribute to favourable lending conditions in the medium term
,77 banks™ 
efforts to increase their resilience
 help to explain why the net easing of banks™ credit 
standards was not 
greater

 2.4
 Credit 
terms and conditions
 for
 loans to euro area firms
 Banks™ credit terms and conditions 
for
 new loans point to a considerable easing 
of the actual agreed lending conditions
 for NFC loans, which is 
more marked 
than for credit standard
s. While credit standards are defined as banks™ in
ternal 
guidelines or loan approval criteria, banks™ terms and conditions are defined as the 
actual terms and conditions applied to a new loan, as agreed in the loan contract. 
The 
analysis of banks™ terms and 
conditions 
therefore complements the analysis of
 credit 
standards to provide an overall view on bank lending conditions
.78 Following a strong 
net widening of banks™ margins on loans
 of average credit risk
 (defined as the spread 
of bank lending rates over a relevant market reference rate)
 during the finan
cial and 
sovereign debt crises, margins have narrowed since the second quarter of 2013 (see 
Chart 
7). This 
trend
 has become more 
acute
 since the second quarter of 2014 in 
light
 of the 
new wave of 
ECB 
unconventional measures (
see Chart
 8 below), signalling 
an improved pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending rates
. 
According 
to reporting banks
, margins on average NFC loans narrowed continuously 
from
 2014 until the first quarter of 2019. 
In the second 
and third 
quarter
s of 2019, banks™ overall 
terms and conditions
 tightened somewhat. S
pecifically
, their margins on riskier NFC 
loans widened
, while margins 
on average NFC loans
 in total broadly stabilised.
                                                                     78  Given th

 on bank lending conditions

  Source: ECB (BLS).
 Notes
: The horizontal axis refers to the BLS rounds in which the respective questions were inclu
ded. 
The ad hoc question on the 
TLTRO
-II was included until July 2017.
 *Use of TLTRO liquidity for granting loans. Use of 
increased
 liquidity
 arising from the ECB™s asset purchase programme (APP)
 for 
granting loans out of sales of marketable assets and inc
reased customer deposits until October 2017
. Net impact of APP on lending 
volumes from April 2018. Net impact of 
the ECB™s negative deposit facility rate (
DFR
) on lending volumes.
 **The TLTRO question asks for the easing impact only. Net easing impact for 
APP and DFR. Net easing is defined as easing minus 
tightening impact. Loan margins instead of overall terms and conditions for DFR
. In
 contrast 
to margins on average 
NFC 
loans, margins on riskier loans 
have 
narrowed only 
a little in net terms since 2014
 (see Chart 7)
. The more cautious 
attitude towards riskier loans may indicate that banks have not been willing to take on 
major risks when lending to firms in order to boost returns in a low interest rate 
environment. This is also consistent with banks™ limit
ed net easing of credit standards 
against a background of heightened regulatory requirements and, in some 
jurisdictions, still considerable levels of NPLs, as well as
 with the more modest risk 
tolerance of banks following the financial crisis
. Taking a lon
ger
-term perspective, b
anks™ 
margins on new loans
 to firms with an 
average risk profile 
have returned to 
levels 
not far 
off
 those prevailing 
around 
the beginning of the financial crisis, 
whereas previously
 they were lower
. The 
cumulation of the changes 
in loan margins
 (i.e.
 the spread of bank lending rates over a 
relevant market reference rate)
, as reported by BLS banks, can help 
when
 assess
ing
 the current state of bank lending conditions for firms. As shown in Chart 
9, the 
widening of margins on average 
NFC 
loans during the financial and sovereign debt 
crises has been broadly 
offset
 by the narrowing of loan margins since the second 
quarter of 2013. 
When computed on the basis of actual lending rates for NFC loans 
and money market interest rates, loan margin
s did not return to the very low levels that 
prevailed before the onset of the financial crisis, which possibly represented an 
underpricing of borrowers™ credit risk at that time.
 In
terestingly,
 cumulated 
changes in 
NFC loan margins have moved broadly in l
ine with actual bank lending rate spreads
, 
in 
keeping
 with the definition of loan margins (see Chart 
9). 
This evidence suggests that 
banks™ margins on new loans have returned to levels around those seen at the 
beginning of the financial crisis, whereas pre
viously they were lower.

 Notes
: Margins are defined as 
the spread of bank lending rat
es over a relevant market reference rate
. Net percentages for the margins 
on average loans have been cumulated from the first quarter of 2003 onwards. The spread is calculated as the difference betwe
en the 
cost of borrowing indicator for NFC loans and the 
three
-month overnight interest swap rate. It
 has been indexed 
at Q1 2003 = 0, 
corresponding to the cumulated change in the spread since Q1 2003.
 The cost of borrowing indicator for NFC loans is
 calculated by 
aggregating short
- and long
-term rates using a 24
-month moving average of new business volumes.
 3 Bank lending conditions 
across bank business models
 A new dataset on bank business models 
makes it possible to
 detect differences 
in bank loan supply conditions across differen
t types of bank business models 
for the BLS banks
.80 The analysis in this section is based on a confidential 
individual 
bank-level 
dataset 
covering
 13 euro area countries
. Individual bank data have been 
aggregated following the BLS methodology to report agg
regate changes in bank 
lending conditions at the euro area level across bank business models.
81 Universal 
banks are the dominant business model in this dataset both in terms of number of 
banks and main assets. In addition, global systemically important bank
s (G
-SIBs) are 
important in terms of their assets, while retail lenders play an important role in terms of 
their number, albeit less in terms of assets. By contrast, corporate wholesale banks 
and specialised lenders in particular play a limited role in thi
s dataset.
 Overall, 
while 
the direction of the movements 
in credit standards over time has 
been consistent across bank business models, 
there have been
 notable
 variations (
see Chart 1
0). Across all bank business models
, 
a pronounced tightening 
of credit st
andards for NFC loans during the period from 2007 to 2014 preceded a 
more recent period of moderate easing, reflecting changes at the euro area level (see 
                                                                    80  For a methodological explanation of the bank business model classification and

  80 Section 2.1). Universal banks and retail lenders on average tightened their bank 
lending conditions b
y more than other lenders during the crisis period. Both business 
models also widened their margins for NFC loans (see Chart 11 below) considerably, 
reflecting the increased credit risk faced by borrowers during the crisis. By contrast, 
from 2007 to 2014, 
the net tightening of credit standards on average was contained for 
specialised lenders owing to intense competitive pressures.
 Across all bank types, risk perceptions were the most important factor for 
changes in credit standards 
for NFC loans during
 the period from 2007
 to 
2014, 
reflecting borrowers™ heightened credit risk.
 While this factor has tended to 
contribute to an easing of credit standards since 2014 across most business models, it 
continued to contribute to a net tightening of credit standa
rds for corporate wholesale 
lenders. This may be linked to the specific business model of this bank type 
specialis
ed in financing large investment projects
 which tend to have a higher risk 
profile.
 For some bank types, especially universal banks and corpor
ate wholesale 
banks, funding cost
s and balance sheet constraints were an important factor 
for the tightening of their credit standards.
 The
 co-movement of this factor 
with risk 
perceptions
 signals the interlinking between borrowers™ heightened credit risk and 
banks™ balance sheet constraints, as weaker borrower quality translated into banks™ 
balance sheet
 fragility. W
hile risk perceptions have played a leading role 
in the
 tightening 
of cred
it standards
 for loans to firms 
across bank business models
, 
competition has been the 
biggest contributing 
factor 
over the net easing period since 
2014. 
Finally, 
banks™ risk tolerance 
had a rather
 small
 impact on changes in credit 
standards across bank bus

  81 Mimicking
 the 
net easing of bank lending conditions
 in the overall sample, 
margins on average loans have 
narrowed
 across all business models since 
2014, along with a para
llel decrease in bank funding costs, 
following the ECB™s 
credit easing package 
(see 
Chart 1
1). Following the widening of margins on NFC 
loans during the financial crisis, t
he largest 
net percentage of banks indicating a 
narrowing of their loan margins
 can be observed 
for
 universal banks and specialised 
lenders, 
passing on to their customers the 
significant decrease in their funding costs. 
Specialised lenders 
seem to have benefited 
particularly 
from squeezed bond yields, 
given their stronger dependence 
on funding through 
the issuance of 
debt securities. 
Importantly
, E
CB borrowing under 
attractive
 terms within the ECB™s TLTRO
-II 
operations 
has additionally benefited 
all bank types
. In the second 
and third 
quarter
s of 2019, 
G-SIBs tightened their credit st
andards on NFC loans and reported an 
increase in margins on average NFC loans, while developments were more mixed for 
other bank types.
 Differences
 in business models™ reliance on specific customer 
and market 
segments can be linked to 
the 
heterogeneity in 
the developments 
of 
loan 
supply as well as 
in funding conditions and overall profitability
. G-SIBs
 and retail 
lenders
 have shown
 the least 
variation
 in credit standards
 and average loan margins 
for NFC loans 
over time
 (measured based on the standard deviat
ion, see Chart 11)
. This is most probably 
due to the fact that banks 
following
 the former
 business model 
are in general more diversified and less prone to cyclical variations of macroeconomic 
variables (also implied by their asset
- and liability
-structure)
, and to the fact that 
lenders belonging to the latter bank group tend to maintain relatively long
-lasting 
relationships with their customers
. 
Retail lenders have also experienced the least 
variation with respect to their funding costs, resulting from thei
r larger dependence on 
retail funding and, therefore, their smaller exposure to prevailing market
-based 
financing conditions. In line with this rather stable funding structure, retail lenders 
tightened their credit standards for loans to firms more moderat
ely than more 
market
-dependent bank types as an immediate reaction to the Lehman Brothers 
collapse in the third quarter of 2008. The considerable tightening of credit standards 
by retail lenders on average from 2007 to 2014, mentioned above, may instead be
 explained by a continuous, but limited tightening of credit standards during the crisis 
period. By contrast
, 
corporate wholesale and specialised lenders
 have exhibited 
significant variability in terms of 
not only credit standards and average loan margins,
 but also funding costs 
across the 
timespan of the sample
, owing to their considerable 
dependence on the issuance of debt securities and, as a result, on the movement of 
bond yields. The opposite is true when taking a closer look at the developments in 
ret
urn on equity, with the retail lenders™ business model recording the strongest decline 
and widest variability during the crisis, largely reflecting their lower diversification and 
related considerable dependence on net interest income.

 4 Conclusions
 This article assesses bank loan supply conditions 
for euro area firms 
based on 
BLS indicators
 for
 cred
it standards
 and
 terms and conditions 
for
 new loans.
 While
 average margins for new loans to NFCs seem to have returned to conditions 
prevailing 
around the beginning of the
 financial crisis, banks™ loan approval criteria and 
margins on riskier loans have re
mained tighter
 overall, due to banks™ balance sheet 
cleaning, stricter regulatory and supervisory requirements and a cautious attitude 
towards risk. S
ince 2014
, b
ank lending conditions 
for
 firms in the euro area have 
eased considerably, supported by favour
able financing conditions to which the ECB™s 
non-standard monetary policy measures have contributed 
positively.
 In addition, the BLS 
provides
 information about the driving factors of 
bank 
loan 
supply
 developments
, which allows a deeper understanding of 
cha
nges
 in
 bank 
lending conditions.
 The importance of these driving factors varies over time. While 
risk perceptions have played a dominant role, mainly during tightening periods, 
competitive pressures have been predominant during easing periods.
 Finally, this article 
gives
 new insights into the 
changes in
 bank lending 
conditions and the contributing factors across bank business models.
 While the 
broad developments are in line with overall euro area developments across business 
models, the intensit
y of changes in credit standards and the relative importance of the 
driving factors vary across bank types. Interestingly, while the variation of bank lending 
conditions for NFC loans has been generally more moderate for retail lenders and

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  84 2 The 
effects of 
changes in the 
composition of 
employment 
on 
euro 
area 
wage 
growth
 Prepared by Omiros Kouvavas, Friderike Kuik, Gerrit Koest
er and 
Christiane Nickel
 1 Introduction
 Until recently, w
age growth in the euro area has been low and under
-predicted.
 Looking at the period 2013
-17, this weakness can be explained to a large extent by the 
factors traditionally captured in a Phillips curve
 analysis, such as economic slack and 
inflation expectations. Slack in the labour market can be measured by a broad range 
of different indicators, which include ﬁnarrowﬂ indicators (e.g. the unemployment rate) 
or more unconventional measures such as the br
oad unemployment rate. The latter 
also includes euro area working age population marginally attached to the labour force 
Œ i.e. those members of the labour force categorised as inactive but still competing, 
albeit less actively, in the labour market.
82 In g
eneral it seems that broader measures 
of labour underutilisation brought some marginal gains in explaining the subdued 
wage growth observed in the euro area over the period 2013
-17.83 However, the 
factors traditionally included in a Phillips curve analysis 
do not paint the full picture.
84 Could changes in the composition of employment 
also 
have contributed to low 
wage growth in the euro area?
 Wages differ, for example, across sectors and are 
affected by employees™ personal characteristics and contract types. 
These 
ﬁcompositional effectsﬂ can mean that changes in the composition of employment can 
affect average wage growth in an economy. They also
 depend on the degree to which 
the composition of employment 
changes and
 on the si
ze of differences in wages.
 In the
 euro area, 
significant changes in the composition of employment have 
taken place since the beginning of the crisis
. These include shifts in age and level 
of education, as well as in the prevalence of different contract types reflecting 
temporary and perma
nent employment.
85 The sectoral composition of employment 
has also changed because of 
shifts in employees working in higher and lower
-paying 
sectors of the economy.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  85 Shifts in the composition of employment can be driven by trend and cyclical 
developments.
 One case in point is the age structure of employees: this can be 
affected by trend developments, such as an ageing population, but also by cyclical 
developments, such as younger workers being at a higher risk of losing their job in a 
downturn.
 Based on the
 economic literature, compositional effects can have a substantial 
impact on wage growth.
 Early studies have shown that the impact of changes 
on the 
composition of 
employment
 can be sizeable
,86 and the results of 
more recent studies
 focusing on the period 
of the crisis are
 similar.
87 Can such compositional effects 
help us understand
 the 
development of wage 
growth over the cycle?
 They can do, for example, if compositional effects are heavily 
influenced by the cycle, pushing up wage growth in a downturn or depr
essing wage 
growth in an upturn. According to the literature, compositional changes in employment 
may indeed lead to such a countercyclical eff
ect on
 aggregate wages
.88 This article 
assesses how compositional effects have 
affected
 wage growth in 
the euro ar
ea and its member countries 
since 2007
.89 For 
our analysis we mainly 
rely on microdata from the EU 
Survey on
 Income and 
Living 
Conditions
 (EU
-SILC). 
The article also includes cross
-checks based on the 
EU 
Labour Force Survey 
(EU-LFS) and national accounts da
ta
. After a discussion of some conceptual 
foundations, we 
introduce the data used and illustrate recent changes in employment 
composition in the euro area. This is followed by an outline of our approach to 
assessing compositional effects and, finally, a di
scussion of evidence of the role of 
compositional effects for the euro area as a whole and the contribution of individual 
euro area countries.
90 This article finds 
that compositional effects have contributed to a subdued 
reaction 
of 
wages 
in the euro area 
over the business 
cycle 
Œ including
 in the 
period of 
low wage
 growth
. Compositional effects 
pushed up wage growth early in 
the crisis, but 
have since
 decreas
ed and turn
ed negative. This has contributed to a 
relatively muted response 
from
 aggregate wage gro
wth
, both to the strong downturn of 
the labour market early in the crisis and later to cyclical improvements 
during the years

 The effects of changes in the 
composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  86 after 
2013. The most important contributions to compositional effects seem to 
have 
been related to changes in the age and educatio
nal structure of 
employment,
 which 
have had
 both a long
-term and a cyclical impact. 
The countercyclical pattern of 
compositional effects resulted mainly from the group of young and comparatively 
low
-skilled workers with relatively low wages; this group was
 hit especially hard by job 
losses early in the crisis (pushing average wage growth up during the downturn) and 
only experienced higher re
-employment probability during the recovery period (with a 
downward effect on average wage growth). 
Looking at country
-specific
 evidence, the 
euro area aggregate results have been influenced
 by Spain and Italy in particular.
 Conceptually, it would be appealing to estimate a Phillips curve for wage 
growth net of compositional effects, but this seems to be very difficult to
 implement.
 With respect to data availability, such an approach is complicated by (i) 
the annual frequency of data needed to calculate compositional effects, (ii) the short 
length of the time series
, and (iii) the substantial time lags in publication of th
e data.
91 2 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on 
wage growth 
Œ conceptual foundations
 Differences in wages can be observed in various dimensions and can vary 
based on workers™ individual characteristics and across sectors.
 As labour 
productivity differs strongly across sectors, wages vary. They tend, for example, to be 
higher in the industrial sector of the economy than in the services sector. Another 
factor accounting for differences in pay is level of education, with higher levels of 
education being correlated with higher skills and thus higher wages. Contract type 
may also play a role, depending on whether individuals work part
-time or full
-time, and 
whether they are employed on a temporary or permanent basis.
92 Based on differences in
 wages
 across individuals and sectors
, changes in the 
composition of employment can affect 
both the 
average 
level and the
 growth 
rate of wages 
in an economy.
 Key indicators for wage
s in an economy are 
compensation per employee (CPE) or compensation per hou
r (CPH). 
CPE is the 
sum 
total of employees
™ compensation divided by the total number of employees
, and CPH 
is the sum total of employees™ compensation divided by the total number of hours 
worked in the economy. Employees™ compensation includes not only 
wages and 
salaries in cash
 but also 
wages and salaries
 in kind, as well as employers' social 
contributions.
 Sectoral shifts in employment composition 
in the industr
ial
 sector
, with 
its relatively high wages
, can
, for example
, cause
 CPE and CPH
 to increase
. In a 
                                                                    91  Additionally, parts of compositional effects are likely to affect average labour productivity developments, 
are partially captured in Phillips curve 
analysis by including a productivity parameter.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  87 similar vein, an increasing share of employees with high levels of education can also 
have a positive effect on average CPE and 
average 
CPH in an economy.
 Changes in the composition of employment can 
have 
imp
lic
ations for
 wage 
growth 
based 
not only 
on differences in wage levels
 but also 
on differences in 
wage growth
 among different types of workers
. One example is 
older workers
 tend
ing
 to have high
er wage levels but experienc
ing
 slower wage growth than younger 
workers. While both effects need to be ta
ken into account, the effects resulting from 
the 
difference in wage levels
, at least in the short run,
 seem to be dominating.
93 While compositional effects based on sectoral developments can
, to a certain 
extent,
 be analysed based on macrodata 
from 
national
 accounts, studying the 
impact of individual employees™ characteristics requires the use of microdata
. The effects of sectoral shifts in employment can
, to a certain 
level of 
sectoral 
granularity
, be analysed based on national accounts data 
for
 employment 
and compensation. However, comprehensive and consistent datasets
 for the euro area
, including data on employment composition based on individual employees™ 
characteristics and their wages
, are 
only available 
based on surveys (see Box 2 for a
 discussion of 
available data).
 Drivers of compositional effects may be of a cyclical or structural nature.
 Structural developments, such as ageing, are likely to have a slow
-moving 
compositional effect on wage growth, since older employees tend to have higher 
wages.
 Cyc
lical developments drive compositional effects, especially due to 
differences in the risk of losing or gaining employment.
 Employment risk over the 
business cycle is unequally distributed with respect to worker
s™ skills and 
characteristics. 
During downturn
s and upturns, job losses and gains have the greatest 
effect on lower
-skilled and younger workers. 
This is supported by research both 
in the 
United 
States
 and Europe.
94 Compositional effects can be countercyclical and may contribute to a muted 
reaction from
 wage growth to the business cycle.
 If lower
-skilled and younger 
workers, who are more likely to receive relatively low wages, are particularly likely to 
lose their jobs in a downturn, average wage growth 
(measured by 
CPE and CPH
, for 
example
) is pushed up
 mechanically. On the other hand, the reintegration of these 
workers into employment in an upturn depresses average wage growth. Such 
countercyclical compositional 
effect
s can partially mute the ﬁtrueﬂ cyclical reaction of 
wages to changes in the labour ma
rket.
 Empirical studies have indeed found a countercyclical pattern of compositional 
effects in the euro area and some EU countries.
95 Such countercyclical effects 
                                                                    93  See the box entitled ﬁ

99. Trend developments might have a pronounced impact on compositional effects 
but are unlikely to cancel out possible cyclical patterns.
 Overall, compositional 
effects are likely to 
reflect both trend and cyclical developments, the roles of which can 
vary over time depending on how pronounced a trend or cyclical development is. 
However, even if trend developments are very pronounced, they are unlikely to cancel 
out possible countercyc
lical patterns. This is because
 structural changes are 
usually 
uncorrelated with the business

 Box
 1  Effects of changes in the sectoral composition of employment on wage growth
 Prepared by Katalin Bodn
ár and Gerrit Koester
 As w
age levels differ acro
ss sectors in the economy, changes in the sectoral composition of 
employment can affect aggregate wage growth.
100 These differences are often linked to 
variations
 in 
labour productivity. The size of the effects on aggregate wage growth depends both on the ex
tent of 
sectoral shifts in employment 
and on the size of differences in pay. For example, a rise in the share of 
employment in sectors with low wage levels can dampen wage growth. These sectoral changes can 
be analysed on the basis of national accounts dat
a, which are
 available for ten main sectors (see 
Chart A).
 Sectoral shifts are driven both by trend and cyclical developments. For example, a long
-term 
reallocation of employment from industry to market and public services is observable (see Chart A). 
This
 longer
-term trend is in line with developments in terms of value added, but may also be related to 
increasing automation in industry and the limited scope for that in the services sector. In 
the 
public 
sector, one main structural driver 
of increas
ed emplo
yment is likely to be the demand for healthcare,
 which is
 related to 
the 
ageing of 
a society
 (among other
 things
). 
The business cycle
 also
 has an 
impact on the sectoral composition of employment
. This is 
most clearly visible in the concentration of 
the lab
our market adjustment during the crisis
, primarily in 
the 
industr
ial
 and construction
 sectors

 This box finds that shifts in the sectoral composition of employment do not seem to have had 
a major influence on wage growth. This could also be seen as an indication that microdata 
studies, l
ike the one pursued in the main text, can also shed some light on within
-sector 
shifts.
101  3 Developments in the composition of employment and wage 
differences across employee characteristics
 In the euro area, 
significant
 changes have taken place in the age
 and 
education
al structure of 
employment (see Chart 1).
102 This can be illustrated 
based on microdata from EU
-SILC, which are available up to and including 2016
103 (see Box 2 for details and a comparison of EU
-SILC data with alternative available 
datasets; see
 Box 4 for a cross
-check against data from the EU
-LFS). Most 
importantly, the share of older employees has increased, while the share of younger 
workers has decreased substantially. At the same time, the share of employees with a 
lower level of education h
as decreased, while the share of more highly educated 
employees has increased.
                                                                     101  This finding is in line with analyses

nited 
Kingdom

) but can be also related to cyclical developments in 
some countries
: younger and less educated/skilled workers were the first to lose 
their jobs during the crisis, further increasing the share of older and more highly 
educated employees. This cyclical pattern is also observed in the development of 
temporary contracts, the 
number of which declined early in the crisis in a number of 
countries but whose share increased during the recovery.

 The developments in the composition of 
employment
, together with 
considerable differences in 
the 
mean income of the different groups, motivate
s the assessment of compositional effects on wage growth.
 A compari
son of the 
euro area mean income of different age groups with the mean income of all employees 
(see Chart 2) shows that workers over the age of 44, in particular, earn considerably 
more than workers between the ages of 16 and 34, the wages of the latter be
ing, on 
average, less than 80% of the overall mean. The difference is even more notable when 
comparing employees across different levels of education: while less highly educated 
employees earn around 60% of the mean, more highly educated employees earn 
between 20% and 40% more than the mean (depending on the year). Similar 
differences can be observed when comparing employees™ occupations, skill levels, 
genders, contract types and nationalities.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  94 Table B
 Selected variables included in the different 
sets of 
microdata, includ
ing 
variables with p
otential 
relevance for compositional effects
  Compared 
with
 EU-LFS and SES data, the EU
-SILC data offer a range of advantages for an analysis 
of the contribution of compositional changes 
in the labour force to wage growth. Most importantly, the 
EU-LFS 
only
 provides information on income in the form of income deciles for a country as a whole, 
which does not allow for an analysis of the effects of individual characteristics on wages.
109 Still, i
t is 
a valuable data source that 
Œ unlike the
 EU-SILC 
Œ offers very timely statistics on labour market 
developments (see
 also Box 4
). The SES, on the other hand, includes rich and detailed information 
on the relationship between 
wages 
and workers™ 
individu
al 
characteristics, but is 
only 
conducted 
once 
every four years. This prevents analyses of changes in compositional effects from year to year. 
Furthermore
, the survey includes individuals in firms with at least 
ten
 employees for most countries 
(see 
Table 
A), and thus
 excludes
 an important share of individuals who would
 ideally 
be included in an 
analysis of compositional effects.
 Trends in aggregate hourly wage growth as calculated from
 the
 EU-SILC are broadly consistent with 
wage growth from national accou
nts.
 In some cases
, however
, differences exist.
110 Mismatches may 
relate to differences between the survey target population and national accounts, and small 
differences in variable definitions (e.g. hourly wages). For example, the survey might not fully cap
ture 
special (
i.e. 
temporary) working time adjustments or short
-term changes. Furthermore, the EU
-SILC 
target population is the resident population in private households of the survey country but excludes 
cross
-border workers and ﬁcollective householdsﬂ, e
.g. immigrants in temporary housing 
arrangements.

, more detailed income information
 is available from National Statistical Offices.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  95 4 Evidence of compositional effects in the euro area
 4.1
 Microdata evidence 
for
 compositional effects based on 
individual characteristics 
of the euro area
 Analysing the effects of changes in the compositio
n of employment on 
aggregate wage growth requires the effects from changes in the characteristics 
of employment 
to be disentangled
 from the changes in the individual returns.
 Disentanglement can be achieved using the ﬁ
Oaxaca
-Blinder 
decompositionﬂ 
techniqu
e, which is the general approach we have taken for our analysis
. The compositional effect calculated 
using
 the Oaxaca
-Blinder decomposition 
measures the mechanical differences in aggregate wages due 
only 
to the 
changed composition of employees.
 Box 3 descr
ibes the methodology in greater 
detail.
 The dependent variab
le in our analysis is hourly gross wage growth,
 while the 
independent variables in 
a ﬁbaseline
ﬂ configuration include 
the individual 
characteristics of 
age, education, gender and nationality
.111 Owing to the nature 
of the survey, the data represent annual averages. We weight all results with hours 
worked
112 during the decomposition.
113 Sectoral and firm
s™ characteristics are not included
 in the analysis, as they are 
part of the market structure and w
ould lead to an ﬁartificialﬂ inflation of the 
compositional effect.
 There are several arguments against including these 
characteristics: first, sectoral and firm characteristics may be correlated with individual 
characteristics, decreasing the impact of th
e individual characteristics. Furthermore, 
adding a covariate correlated to wages will increase the overall estimated composition 
effect, leading to overestimation.
114 Finally, as shown in Box 1, changes in sectoral 
composition do not seem to have had a deci
sive influence on wage growth in the euro 
area.

  96 wide array of topics
, from inequality to discrimination and demographics, in order to explain the 
chang
e in the means of an outcome variable between groups. This gap is decomposed into the part 
that is due to changes in the determinants of an outcome and the part that is due to changes in the 
effects of these determinants. In our case the outcome variable i
s the wage, and the determinants are 
worker skills and characteristics. The Oaxaca
-Blinder decomposition of aggregate wage growth 
disentangles effects owing to a change in the weighting of groups (composition change), a change in 
individual returns (return
s effect) and a simultaneous change of both (interaction term).
 The estimation of compositional effects requires the availability of individual
-level data containing 
wages and skill characteristics. In order to determine
, for example
, whether an increase 
in the 
average wage is due to 
a nominal increase in returns to skills or 
to 
a change 
in the 
skill distribution of 
employment, an accurate estimat
e of the returns to skills for each year is required. As 
shown
 in Chart 
A, if both the average skills (S) and th
e returns to skills
 (R)
 change
 at the same time
 (right
-hand figure),
 the observed wage growth
 ( (+1)() ) may
 be understated. Thus
, to accurately 
estimate the impact of the composition changes we first need to determine the returns to skills using 
individual
-level wages and characteristics.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  97 The first term on 
the right
-hand side
 of equation (3) is the compo
sitional effect
, measur
ing
 the 
differences in predicted wages due 
only 
to changes in the composition of the employed 
work
force. 
The second term is the coefficient effect, which measures the difference in wages (or the returns to 
the covariates) if the skillset of the 
workers
 is 
kept
 constant. 
The last term is the interaction effect, 
which 
accounts for the fact that differenc
es 
in skills and returns coexist.
 The interaction term captures changes in wages resulting indirectly from a change in the 
composition of the workforce.
 An example would be low
-skilled immigration lower
ing
 the average 
wage of domestic workers (
as a result 
of an increase
 in labour supply in this segment). 
In this article 
we exclude this term
, as it goes beyond the direct (mechanical) effects of changes in the composition 
of employment on wage growth and could also capture effects 
other than those
 related to 
changes in 
the composition of employment. 
This is because shocks 
that are happening at the same time as
 the 
change in comp
osition might
, to some exten
t,
 be captured by the interaction term. 
For example
, if 
a technology shock 
only 
hits low wage earners (i.e
. the specific group that experience
s the 
compositional change 
in a way 
different 
from
 the other groups) then 
the effects
 will be captured by the 
interaction term.
 Furthermore
, this term is usually small
116 and would change the results only 
marginally
. Never
theless,
 we 
choose
 not 
to 
include it in the compositional effect
, as it also captures an 
endogenous change in market conditions due to the composition change.
  4.2
 Evidence for the euro area
 Euro area aggregate
117 results suggest that compositional effects 
pushed up 
wage growth early in the crisis, 
but the effect has 
since decreased and turned 
negative,
 thereby contributing to a relatively muted response from aggregate 
wage growth to cyclical improvements (see Chart 3)
. According to the results from 
the ﬁbas
elineﬂ configuration (see panel a in Chart 3), the largest positive contribution of 
compositional effects can be observed between 2008 and 2012, with compositional 
effects contributing more than 1 percentage point, up to about 1.5 percentage points, 
to wag
e growth.
118 The effect has been declining steadily since then, turning negative 
in 2015 and 2016.
 The largest contribution to the overall effect comes from changes in the 
composition of the age and education structure.
 This is consistent with aggregate 
chan
ges in the composition of employment, as discussed in Section 3, with the 
changes in age and education structure being dominant.
 The declining and eventually negative impact of compositional effects is 
consistent with compositional effects having contribut
ed to subdued wage 
                                                                    116  On average 
an order 
of magnitude smaller than the other two terms.
 117  The results for euro area countries are weighted based on
 hours worked taken from the national 
accounts data.
 118  The lower two specifications are also included in Chart 15 of the paper by Nickel, C., Bobeica, E., 
Koester, G., Lis, E. and Porqueddu, M. (eds.), op. cit. The results presented in Chart 3 add an addi
tional 
year of data (2016). Furthermore, they are based on an improved weighting methodology that does not 
simply rely on survey weights but also uses hours worked for individual observations to determine the 
within
-country weights. This reflects within
-country weights more accurately, as differences in patterns of 
hours worked are accounted for. While the general pattern of the results is not affected, the improved 
approach leads to a slightly more negative effect for 2015 for all specifications.

 Hence
 compositional effects could have 
contribut
ed to 
the
 subdued reaction of wage growth to cyclical changes in the labour 
market 
Œ with compositional effects pushing up wage growth early in the 
crisis and the 
strong recovery of the l
abour market from 2013 onwards dampening this growth.
 Different specifications are used as robustness checks
 Œ including workers
™ skills
 Œ and different proxies for tenure as independent variables.
 As a first 
cross
-check, education is replaced by skill level based on the employee™s occupation
 (see panel c in Chart 3)
. This is useful in cases where a large 
proportion
 of employees 
work in occupations 
not commensurate with
 their 
level of 
education. The second

assesses the impact of adding proxy variables for tenure, including 
whether the individual has a permanent or temporary contract and whether the 
individual 
has 
changed job
s in 
the past year
 (see panels b and d in Chart 3).
 They are

 When replacing education with occupation as a proxy for skill level, the overall 
effect becomes more 
volatile and shows a less pronounced pattern for many 
countries.
 This
 indicates that the use of occupation as a proxy for skill level in the 
EU-SILC seems to be meaningful only to a limited extent. This can partly be attributed 
to data issues. Nevertheless
, the results are in line with the overall pattern of the sign 
and amplitude of the compositional effects.
 Adding variables 
that 
represent tenure 
has 
result
ed in more negative 
compositional effects in recent years.
 The effect is illustrated 
in the figures 
in 
panels b and d in 
Chart 3, and might be explained by new hires (potentially on 
temporary contracts) 
on lower salaries coming into employment after the crisis.

uro area wage growth
  100 Several additional checks were done but did not result in substantial changes 
to the results.
 We tested replacing ﬁcitizenshipﬂ with ﬁcountry of birthﬂ, as this seem
ed to be a better proxy for immigration. However, as changes in citizenship and country of 
birth in 
the 
EU-SILC largely 
follow 
the same trends, this did not impact the results 
either
 at the
 euro area
 aggregate level 
or for selected test countries.
119 4.3
 Microdata evidence for individual euro area countries
 On a
 country
-by-country
 basis, our analyses show
 a general trend 
in 
compositional effects that is 
similar 
to that
 for the euro area as a whole, but 
with 
some heterogeneity 
between
 countries concerning the sign and size of the 
effects in individual 
years (see Chart 4).
 In the configuration including proxy 
variables for tenure, compositional effects were positive in al
l countries in 2008 (see 
green shading in Chart 4), with effects 
decreasing 
between 2009 and 2013. This is in 
line with the findings for the euro area aggregate, which showed that, at the beginning 
of the crisis, compositional effects pushed up wage growth
 before later declining. For a 
large number of countries the results switched sign in 2014 and 2015 (see red shading 
in Chart 4). Large compositional effects were seen for some southern European 
countries in particular (e.g. Spain, Portugal and Italy), but
 the effect also decreased or 
even became negative in these countries in 2015 and 2016. Again, this sign switching 
is reflected in the euro area aggregate data and is driven to a significant extent by 
compositional changes in age and education.
 Spain and Italy seem to be 
the 
main contributors to the euro area aggregate 
compositional effect (
see Chart 5
). The contribution from Spain was particularly 
large in 2008 but then declined, while Italy™s contribution was relatively large in 2012. 
In 2015 a
nd 2016 Italy and Spain experienced very negative compositional effects; 
this can be explained by their respective increases in employment, which were 
concentrated at the lower end of the wage distribution. These results illustrate that 
compositional effec
ts seem to be driven mostly by effects in countries that have 
experienced the largest cyclical changes in employment.
120 In line with these results, 
Germany and France seem to have experienced less marked compositional effects 
(with regard to total employmen
t) throughout the cycle.
                                                                     119  It mus
t be noted that this immigration variable in our analysis only captures potential differences over and 
above what could already be captured by education, age and the other characteristics.
 120  The size of the employment changes experienced by these counties
 is affected by the high share of 
temporary contracts,
 among other things
 (Portugal and Spain have around 20%
-25%, in comparison with 
Germany, which has less than 15%), which allows for higher flows and more labour market flexibility.

 The effects of changes in 
the composition of employment on euro area wage growth
  103 The 
EU-LFS is a set of microdata providing detailed information on the composition of employment 
using several characteristics (see Box 2). It i
s a household survey that is conducted in all euro area 
countries
 in a harmonised way. A representative sample of individuals is regularly asked about their 
labour market status, personal characteristics 
and the characteristics of their employment (for tho
se 
who are employed). This dataset is regularly used to monitor the composition of employment growth 
in the euro area but does not provide information on wages in a harmonised way.
124 Given that the 
EU-LFS is representative of the labour force, 
a comparison 
of the composition of employment in this 
dataset with the EU
-SILC is an important robustness check for the results shown in the article.
125 As with
 the developments indicated by EU
-SILC data, 
EU-LFS data point to sizeable changes in the 
composition of the wo
rkforce in the euro area. The most striking change can be seen in terms of the 
age composition of employment. Driven by demographic developments 
and a significant rise in the 
labour force participation rate, older workers (i.e. those older than 55) account
 for an increasing share 
of employment. This age group™s share in the stock of employment in the euro area has increased 
from around 12% to 20% since 2006.
126 At the same time, the employment share of the more highly 
skilled has also increased considerably, 
by about 10 percentage points, while the share of those who 
are lower skilled has declined. The composition of employment by gender has become closer to 
equal, as the labour supply of women has risen considerably; however, most of this change 
happened befo
re 2013. The 
EU-LFS also points to an increase in the share of workers with 
citizenship of non
-euro area EU 
Member States
. According to the characteristics of the contracts and 
the tasks performed, there has been a moderate shift towards temporary position
s in the years to 
2018, and towards occupations requiring higher skill levels.

-SILC data. The two datasets provide ver
y similar pictures, both in 
the composition of employment according to individual characteristics and in terms of the changes to 
the time period for which both are available (
see 
Chart A). For example, although the 
EU-LFS points 
to a slightly higher share 
of workers with a high level of education than is reflected by the EU
-SILC, 
the change of this share over time is very similar in the two. Remaining differences between the two 
datasets might be attributable to differences in the definition of variables, d
ifferences in the samples 
and sampling methods
, and other data issues such as missing data. 
127                                                                     124  While the EU
-LFS is 
used for a detailed breakdown of employment
, it is not the primary source. National 
accounts are the main source for employment levels in th
e economy. 
While the dynamics of these two 
sets of statistics are similar, the resulting levels of employment and cumulative growth rates are 
somewhat different for methodological reasons.

 The effects of changes in the composition of employment on euro area wage growth

) Sources: 
Eurostat (

) and ECB staff calculations.
 Notes: Euro area aggregate weighted by hours worked; numbers not adding up to 100% indicate missing data. The decomposition a
ccording to contract type 
(permanent or temporary) refers to employees, w
hile the other decompositions apply to total employment (covering employees, those who are self
-employed 
and contributing family members). The first category, according to ages, covers people aged 15 to 34 in the EU
-LFS and 16 to 34 in the EU
-SILC.
 More recent data from the 
EU
-LFS indicate that some of the changes in the composition of 
employment have continued since 2016, for which EU
-SILC data are not yet available (see Chart
 A). 
For example, the share of older workers has continued to increase and
 the share of workers with 
lower levels of education and skill has continued to decrease. These were found to be the main 
drivers of compositional changes in terms of aggregate wage dynamics according to the microdata 
analysis used in this article. Thus, t
he continuation of these trends suggests that we may still find 
some compositional effects in wage dynamics from more recent years. However, in some respects (in 
terms of gender, for example) the composition of employment has not changed considerably in re
cent 
years. Overall, the more limited changes in the composition of employment 
Œ especially when 
compared 
with
 the early years of the crisis 
Œ seem to indicate that compositional effects on wage 
growth might have been relatively limited in 2017 and 2018 an
d are unlikely to have been a major 
driving force behind the relatively strong recovery of wage growth in the euro area in that period.

data has become availabl

  5 Conclusion
 In the euro area, 
sizeable
 changes in the composition of 
employment have 
taken place since 2007
. The share of older and more highly educated employees has 
increased, while the share of younger workers and those with a low
er level of 
education has decreased. These developments can partly be attributed to longer
-term 
trends (e.g. demographic changes, pension system reforms and the trend towards 
higher levels of education), but they can also be related to cyclical development
s in 
some countries: younger and less educated/skilled workers were the first to lose their 
jobs during the crisis, further increasing the share of older and more highly educated 
employees. These patterns are confirmed by both EU
-SILC and EU
-LFS data.
 Thes
e changes in the composition
 of employment
 seem to have pushed up 
wages during the crisis and contributed to subdued wage growth in recent 
years
. An Oaxaca
-Blinder decomposition applied to EU
-SILC microdata suggests that 
these compositional effects were st
rongest between 2008 and 2012, but turned 
negative in 2015 and 2016.
 A country
-by-country consideration of the compositional effects shows a 
general trend that is similar to the trend for the euro area as a whole but with 
some heterogeneity among countries
 concerning the size of the effects in 
individual years.
 Spain and Italy seem to be the main contributors to the euro area 
aggregate compositional effect, while contributions from Germany and France are 
small with regard to total employment.
 Overall, the results are robust across different specifications applied in the 
decomposition, and the changes in the composition of 
employment 
are also 
reflected in different 
sets of 
microdata.
 This indicates that the main developments 
in euro area composi
tional effects seem to be represented well, overall, by the 
analyses presented in this article.

 The performance of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections since the financial 
crisis
  106 3 The performance of the Eurosystem/ECB 
staff 
macroeconomic 
projections since the financial crisis
 Prepared by Kyriacos Lambrias and Adrian Page
 This article ev
aluates the performance of the Eurosystem/ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections for the euro area in the context of the elevated 
macroeconomic volatility and uncertainty that has prevailed since the financial 
crisis
. It finds that there has been considerable
 variability in 
projection
 errors over 
time
. With regard to 
real GDP growth 
projections
, errors that were substantial 
during
 the 
sovereign debt 
crisis have 
become
 more limited in recent years
. As for headline 
inflation, unexpected fluctuations in oil price
s Œ which in the staff macroeconomic 
projections are assumed to follow the path of oil price futures 
Œ played a dominant role 
in explaining the errors, as was the case during the pre
-crisis years
. On the other 
hand, HICP 
inflation 
excluding energy and food
 has been persistently overprojected 
since 2013. While the
se projection errors can 
also partly 
be attributed to errors 
in 
the 
conditioning 
technical 
assumptions
, 
other factors (such as modelling errors, changes 
in economic relationships or judgement) have 
also 
played a key role a
t different points 
in time. 
The forecast performance of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections has been broadly similar to that of other international institutions and of 
private sector forecasters
, suggesting that proje
ction errors have been mainly driven 
by common elements. These may include
 economic shocks unforeseeable to any 
forecaster and 
developments that have become more prominent since the financial 
crisis, including, 
among other things
, structural reforms, chang
es in the relationship 
between slack and prices, globalisation and digitalisation. The article is structured as 
follows: 
Section 1 
explains how
 the staff 
macroeconomic 
projections are 
constructed
/compiled
, 
Section 2 
provides
 an overview of the errors made in projecting 
real GDP and HICP inflation since 2010
,128 Section 3 reviews some of the sources of 
the errors
, and Section 4 provides a comparison
 with 
the forecasting performance of 
other institutions and private sector 
foreca
sters.
 1 Introduction
 Every quarter, the ECB publishes projections 
of 
real GDP growth, inflation and 
a range of other macroeconomic variables which serve as a key input 
in
to the 
monetary policy decision
-making
 process
.129 In March and September these 
staff 
macroeconomic projections
 are produced by ECB staff, while in June and December 
they are produced jointly 
by 
staff 
from
 the ECB and 
all 
of the 
Eurosystem national 
central banks
. Th
e projections are published for the current and the two subsequent 
                                                                    128  This article focuses on the 
post
-financial crisis period, starting in 2010. The staff macroeconomic 
projections for the year 2009, which was, 
as for most other forecasters
, a severe outlier in the forecasting 
record, have been analysed elsewhere in detail. See, for example, Kenny, G.
 and Morgan, J., ﬁ

130 and serve as 
a coherent reconciliation of all available information 
based on a wide range of econometric models and on conditioning 
technical 
assumptions 
(such as for oil pr
ices, exchange rates and interest rates), which 
can also 
be supplemented by staff judgement. 
It should be noted that 
the projections are 
neither endorsed by the Governing Council nor do they necessarily reflect the views of 
the Governing Council on the 
outlook for the euro area
. Instead, they reflect the views 
of Eurosystem/ECB staff
. Nevertheless, they 
serve as a key input 
into 
the 
monetary 
policy decision
-making process and
 it is important that they provide reliable indications 
of the most likely cours
e o
f future economic developments.
 Regular evaluations
131 of the performance of the projections serve two main 
purposes
. First, identifying patterns in projection errors and understanding the 
reasons why such errors 
were
 made can help to improve future proje
ctions. For 
example, persistent errors with the same sign 
may 
imply that the econometric models 
used to produce the projections are not capturing some 
of the 
structural changes in 
the economy and that the models or the tools used for the projections may re
quire 
some adjustments. Second, past projection errors can 
provide
 an indication of the 
degree of uncertainty surrounding the projections at various horizons ahead.
132 2 Overview of errors in projecting real GDP and HICP inflation
 GDP growth was strongly ove
rpredicted during the sovereign debt crisis, but 
the accuracy of projections has improved in recent years.
 Chart
 1 shows the 
projections of annual average real GDP growth in each of the quarterly staff 
macroeconomic projection exercises
 since 2010, togethe
r with their outcomes. For 
each year, twelve projections are shown, starting with the projection produced in the 
first quarter two years prior to the reference year and ending with the projection 
produced in the last quarter of the reference year. The proj
ections produced in the last 
quarter of the year preceding the reference year are indicated with a dot (e.g. the 
projections produced in the fourth quarter of 2014 for the year 2015). This is 
the last 
projection 
exercise for
 which no hard or soft indicator
s are 
available for the year being 
projected
.133 Since economic data, in particular GDP estimates, tend to be revised, 
Chart 1 shows two outturns: the vintage of the outturns available one year after their 
initial publication and the latest vintage. As would
 be expected, in most cases, the 
projections became successively more accurate as the projection horizon was 
                                                                    130  Since 2017 the projection horizon has been extended
 in the month of December so that the projections 
published in that month include the current year and the three subsequent calendar years.

 132  In addition to point estimates, the ECB publishes projection ranges for the outlook for real GDP growth 
and inflation. These ra
nges are constructed on the basis of past projection errors. For further details, see

are 
produced with increasing
 amounts of
 data on economic 
developments for the year in question (including short
-term indicators allowing the use of nowcasting 
tools and quarterly GDP informa
tion). As would be expected, the inclusion of more information typically 
help
s to improve 
considerably 
the accuracy of the projections.

 The performance of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic pr
ojections since the financial 
crisis
  108 reduced and as more information became available. An exception is 2010, for which 
the initial projections produced in 2008 were quite accurate, but
 were revised 
downwards heavily with the onset of the financial crisis in 2009 and then revised 
upwards again as the recovery took hold. The largest errors after 2010 came with
 the 
intensification of the sovereign debt crisis 
between
 2012 and 
2013, which l
ed 
to much 
weaker 
growth 
than expected. Over the subsequent years, although the accuracy of 
the growth projections 
has been 
much better, there 
has been 
a tendency to 
underpredict growth, 
particularly 
for 2017.
 This tendency was exacerbated by 
persistent up
ward revisions to
 official data 
(as illustrated in Chart 1 by the gap between 
the outturn one year after initial publication and the latest vintage).

 Eurosystem/ECB staff projections underpredicted HICP inflation in the early 
part of the sample and overpredicted it between 2013 and 2016, but HIC
P inflation projections were broadly accurate in more recent years.
 Chart
 2 shows 
the projections and outturns for HICP inflation since 2010. The projections made 
following the financial crisis significantly underestimated inflation, which was expected 
to 
fall more significantly in response to the additional economic slack during this 
period, a feature common across advanced economies at the time.
134 In the ensuing 
years, particularly between 2014 and 2016, inflation surprised persistently on the 
downside. In
 each year, initial projections were around 1.5%, but they were 
persistently revised downwards, in particular in the light of sharp declines in oil prices, 
which led to outturns of around 0.2% to 0.5% between 2014 and 2016. More recently, 
in 2017 and 2018,
 inflation outturns have been more in line with the projections.

 3 Sources of projection errors
 This section reviews some of the key factors behind the projection errors for 
growth and inflation.
 The Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections are 
conditioned on a number of technical assumptions w
hich can play an important role in 
explaining the errors that have occurred. The main assumptions are those related to 
commodity prices (such as oil prices) and financial assumptions (such as interest 
rates and equity prices), which are based on market exp
ectations, together with 
assumptions on exchange rates, which are held constant over the projection 
horizon.
135 Euro area projections are also dependent on the staff assessment of the 
outlook for the international environment, which can be an additional sour
ce of errors. 
For the purposes of this article, errors are defined as the outcome minus the 
projection, so a positive error indicates a higher than expected outcome (i.e. an 
underprediction), while a negative error indicates a lower than expected outcome (
i.e. 
an over
prediction
). Errors in the projections for international developments and the technical 
assumptions explain only a part of the projection errors made for real GDP 
growth.
 Chart 3 decomposes the projection errors in the March projections for the
 following calendar year. Since official GDP data are normally available up to the fourth 
quarter of the previous year, this corresponds to a two
-year projection horizon. Panel a 
uses elasticities from Eurosystem macroeconomic models 
to decompose the 
errors 
into what can be explained by (i) errors in the conditioning technical assumptions; (ii) 
errors in the outlook for the international environment; and (iii) all other factors. The 
                                                                    135  For further details on how the staff projections are constructed, see

 decomposition reveals that errors in technical assumptions played a li
mited role in 
explaining errors in the GDP growth projections, with the exception of 2015, when a 
sharp drop in oil prices gave an unexpected boost to growth, and 2018, when the 
appreciation of the euro exchange rate in the course of 2017 and early 2018 we
ighed 
on exports. Errors in international projections (i.e. euro area foreign demand) explain 
part of the underpredictions of growth for 2010 and 2017, which were years in which 
euro area exports grew strongly. Global trade was persistently weaker than exp
ected 
between 2012 and 2016, but the impact on the growth projections was partly offset by 
other errors with an opposite sign arising from the technical assumptions. The 
overprediction
s of 
global 
trade, 
particularly 
for emerging market economies
, was 
partl
y related to 
a structural shift in 
the 
trade intensity of 
global 
economic activity. Such 
structural shifts are difficult to anticipate in real time
, but projections since 2016 have 
been anchored around the view that 
Œ over the medium term 
Œ global imports 
will grow 
at 
broadly 
similar rates to global 
activity.
136 Since that year the projections for global 
trade have been more accurate. ﬁOther factorsﬂ in Chart 3 refers to all other sources of 
errors, including model misspecification, domestic factors, such as 
fiscal, structural 
and monetary policies (beyond the effects captured in the technical assumptions), and 
judgements introduced by staff. In most cases, the errors in the international 
projections move in the same direction as the other errors, which may re
flect indirect 
effects beyond direct trade channels. For example, shocks to the global outlook could 
also have had a negative impact on domestic confidence, leading to lower domestic 
demand.
                                                                     136  Trade
/income elasticity had fallen in the post
-crisis period, amid compositional ch
anges in trade patterns 
and a 
declining 
impetus 
from 
the longer
-term structural factors that previously drove the 
rapid 
expansion 
of global trade, such as trade liberalisation, the expansion of global value chains and reductions in tariffs 
and transportati
on costs
. See

. Notes: Errors are defined as the outturn, as available one year after the initial publication, minus the projection. Technica
l assumptions 
refer to the
 contribution of errors in the conditioning assumptions for oil prices, exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices to the
 total 
error. International projections refer to the contribution of errors in the ECB™s projections for euro area foreign demand 
to the total error. 
The contributions from errors in the technical assumptions and international environment are calculated using elasticities ta
ken from the 
macroeconometric models used to produce the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.
 Turning to
 the errors made in the projections for the expenditure components 
of GDP, there were broad
-based overpredictions during the sovereign debt 
crisis, while recent errors were concentrated in net exports.
 Panel b of Chart 3 
shows a decomposition based on the 
contributions of the projection errors in the 
expenditure components to the overall projection error for real GDP growth. In 2012 
and 2013 all domestic demand components turned out to be weaker than expected, 
while the negative surprise on imports was larg
er than the negative surprise on 
exports, leading to a more positive than expected contribution from net exports. In the 
subsequent years, domestic demand components were somewhat stronger than 
expected, supported by the oil price declines mentioned above 
and also by successive 
monetary policy packages which eased financing costs for households and firms. 
Most recently, the projection errors were dominated by the contribution from net 
exports, which surprised on the downside in 2016 and on the upside in 201
7 and (to a 
lesser extent) 2018.
137 As regards inflation, errors in the conditioning technical assumptions, 
particularly for oil and exchange rates, play a significant role.
 Chart 4 shows 
similar decompositions for the projection errors in inflation. As seen
 in panel a, in 
                                                                    137  Note
 that there is no direct correspondence between the contribution of the errors in the international 
projections in the model
-based decomposition and the contribution of errors in net exports. The former 
has an impact not only on net exports, but also on ot
her components, notably investment, while the latter 
is also affected by changes in export market shares and by developments in imports. In recent years, 
errors in euro area investment and import projections have been affected by partly offsetting 
developm
ents in Irish imports, which are related to the activities of multinational enterprises and 
complicate the interpretation of projection errors for these components of GDP.

 general, errors in assumptions explain a larger proportion of the errors in inflation 
projections than was the case for the growth projections. In particular, large 
unexpected swings in oil prices played a dominant role in the underpredicti
ons of HICP 
inflation in 2010
-11 and 2017
-18 and in the overpredictions in 2015 and 2016. 
Fluctuations in the exchange rate also contributed to the projection errors. In 
particular, a large depreciation of the euro in 2014
-15 offset part of the downward 
impact from the lower than expected oil prices in 2015. Apart from the contribution 
from the technical assumptions, there remains a contribution from other factors which, 
since 2013, has been persistently negative, albeit rather small over the past two years

 Outcomes of HICP inflation excluding food and energy have surprised 
persistently on the do
wnside since 2013.
 Panel b of Chart 4 shows the 
decomposition of errors in the inflation projections according to the main HICP 
sub
-components and shows that the volatile food and energy components explain the 
majority of these projection errors, largely d
riven by the errors in technical 
assumptions. The projection errors in HICP inflation excluding energy and food, 
although of a much lower magnitude than those for the volatile components, have 
shown a persistent negative bias (i.e. overprediction) over the
 past six years. Errors in 
technical assumptions may have played some part in generating these errors, such as 
indirect effects of unexpected declines in oil prices over recent years on non
-energy 
consumer goods and services as well as the appreciation of 
the euro in 2017 and early 
2018. Nevertheless, even 
after accounting 
for 
the errors in 
technical assumptions, 
there still remains a persistent overestimation.

 The performanc
e of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections since the financial 
crisis
  113
 A number of explanations have been put forward for the persistently and 
unexpectedly low underlyi
ng inflation over recent years.
138 There may have 
been an underestimation of the amount of slack in labour and product markets, which 
may have contributed to lower than expected wage growth and thus reduced cost 
pressures on prices. Another
 explanation is re
lated to ﬁpent
-up restraintsﬂ
, meaning 
that, 
while declines in prices and wages during the 
sovereign debt crisis 
were limited 
by 
downward nominal rigidities
 (contributing to the higher than expected inflation 
outturns during that period)
, in the 
subsequent
 years
, price and wage inflation may 
have been correspondingly subdued.
139 It may also have been the result of a 
strengthening of 
the relationship between slack and prices
, i.e. a given level of slack 
may have resulted in a stronger downward impact on price 
developments. This may, 
for example, be a reflection of 
the role and impact of structural reforms
 in some 
countries which were designed to 
lower nominal rigidities
. A further explanation relates 
to the role of
 global influences on domestic inflation
, which
 could 
extend beyond what 
is captured by 
the 
import and commodity prices 
typically considered in the staff 
macroeconomic projections. Low inflation
 might 
partly 
reflect increased trade flows, 
the integration of emerging economies into the world economy and
 the rise of global 
value chains shifting parts of production abroad
.140 Within the Eurosystem, a 
dedicated working group is tasked with improving the models used to produce 
the 
projections by looking at the latest advances in forecasting techniques, 
performing 
regular analyses of forecast errors and identifying and modelling structural breaks and 
non-linearities.
141 Eurosystem staff have also tried to address the large contribution of 
errors in technical assumptions by examining alternative ways of proj
ecting oil prices, 
rather than using oil futures prices. An approach using a combination of oil price 
models was found to perform relatively well 
over some sample periods
. H
owever
, so 
far no method has been found which can consistently outperform oil price
 futures over 
longer periods.
142  4 Comparisons with other forecasters
 The Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic projections for growth and inflation 
have performed similarly to those of private sector forecasters and other 
international institutions.

Œ in each 
case taking the forecasts produced in the second quarter of the year. Different 
institutions publish at different times during the second quarter

staff macroeconomic projections being the last to be published (in June), implying that 
the latter may have some comparative advantage due to the availability of more recent 
economic data. In order to adjust for this, the figures show

performance), but below that of the European Commission and the IMF and similar to 
that of th

 Nevertheless, as can be seen in Chart 6, all institutions and the private sector made 
inflation forecast errors consistently in the same direction over the period between 
2010 and 2018, albeit at different magnitudes. That is to say, all forecasters 
underp
redicted HICP inflation between 2010 and 2012 and in 2017 and 2018 (positive 
forecast errors), but inflation surprised everyone on the downside between 2013 and 
2016 (negative errors). This could suggest that the source of the error was common to 
all forec
asters, which could include fundamental economic shocks that were 
unforeseeable and/or changes in economic relationships, but is unlikely to be related 
to errors in judgement. Panel c of Chart 6 also shows that the persistent overprediction 
of HICP inflati
on excluding food and energy in Eurosystem/ECB staff projections over 
recent years was a feature they had in common with the forecasts produced by other 
institutions. The performance of the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections for GDP and inflati
on over a much longer sample was studied in a recent 
ECB 
working 
paper and the results are discussed in Box 1.

 Prepared b

 A recent ECB working paper
144 investigated more thoroughly the forecasting performance of 
Eurosystem/ECB staff since almost the start of monetary union. A long sample at a quarterly 
frequency allows for a more thorough evaluation of the f
orecasting performance, using tests and 
statistical criteria that are often employed in the literature of forecast evaluation. Such exercises have 
been performed by other institutions such as the European Commission, the IMF and the Bank of 
England.
 One of
 the main issues addressed in the working paper is whether the Eurosystem/ECB staff 
macroeconomic projections are biased, i.e. whether there is a persistent tendency to make errors in 
one direction. The paper concludes that Eurosystem/ECB staff inflation p
rojections are unbiased. 
This conclusion does not contradict the finding of persistent forecast errors in one direction discussed 
above when evaluating the more recent period. An analysis of a longer sample, with more information 
and using statistical tool
s, suggests that this more recent period of persistent overprediction is 
relatively limited. Interestingly, GDP growth projections appear to have been more biased than HICP 
inflation projections, and the authors conclude that this bias 
(overprediction) 
is persistent and 
significant at a two
-year horizon, such that one cannot conclude that GDP projections are unbiased. 
The authors also looked at the degree of bias in a time
-varying context. Chart A shows the estimated 
bias over rolling windows of 25 quarters
 at two different forecasting horizons, four quarters
-ahead (h=4) and eight quarters
-ahead (h=8), with the green and red lines representing confidence intervals 
around the estimates. Chart A shows a clear pattern in the HICP inflation projections: the bias
 has 
been steadily decreasing over time, from a persistent underprediction in the first few years of 
monetary union and up to the financial crisis to a persistent overprediction in more recent years. 
These ﬁcancel outﬂ when analysing the whole sample, ther
eby leading to the aforementioned 
conclusion of a general lack of bias. On the other hand, GDP projections appear to have been 
persistently biased in one direction (overprediction).

 145  Even though in a time
-varying context, as in Chart A, the bias does not appear to be s
tatistically 
significant, it is when examined over the entire sample.

 5 Conclusions
 Overall, the article suggests that the Eurosystem/ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections 
have performed well over recent years and in line with projections 
of other institutions
. At the same time, continuous efforts are needed to improve the 
projections by (i) exploring alternative methods that could increase the accuracy of the 
technical assumptions; (ii) ensuring that the economic models used for the projections 
follow the latest
 advances in forecasting techniques; and, importantly, (c) better 
evaluating or anticipating fundamental changes in economic relationships resulting, 
for example, from the impact of structural reforms, globalisation and digitalisation. In 
order to address 
these issues,
 a dedicated group 
of experts w
ithin the Eurosystem
 regularly reviews the performance of the staff projections and refines the tools used to 
produce the projections.
