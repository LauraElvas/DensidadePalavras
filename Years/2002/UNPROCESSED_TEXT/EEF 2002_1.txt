941OverviewAfter the decline in economic activity in the last quarter of last year, the
recovery in the euro area and the EU started in the first quarter of this year,

but failed to accelerate subsequently. Investment continued to contract and

private consumption was weak as uncertainty increased, preventing the

promising pick-up in international 
trade to spill over to domestic demand.
The recovery is much slower than anticipated and the average growth rate in
the euro area is estimated to be 0.8 % in 2002 and is forecast at only 1.8 % in
2003.  Only from the second half of that year is growth expected to gain
momentum, if confidence returns, oil prices ease and stock markets remain
stable.  Nevertheless, the rise in the unemployment rate is limited and

temporary, but the fall in the inflatio
n rate is slow.  Due to a deterioration in
the economic situation and an easing of budgetary policy, the general
government deficit is expected to widen to 2.3 % of GDP in 2002 in the euro
area (to 1.9% of GDP in the EU), with not much improvement expected in

the following year.
An uneven global
recovery
The policy induced recovery in the US is losing steam despite the effect of
the lowering of interest rates and of the fiscal stimulus in the aftermath of the
terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.  Corporate scandals and collapsing

stock markets have undermined confidence.  In consequence, growth in the
US has been revised downward to about 2.3 % in 2002 and 2003, with not
much of an acceleration before mid-2003.  Also, in Latin America growth

prospects have been scaled down.  In 2002, Argentina is in its fourth year of
recession which is so severe that it lead to
 a decline in GDP of the continent.
The recovery in other regions continued, notably in Asia and the transition
countries.  While still a very poor performer, Japan appears to be coming out
of recession.  Strong and accelerating growth rates are expected in the rest of

Asia.  With EU accession around the corner, also in the Candidate Countries
the expansion is on course with little or no impact from the growth slowdown
in the EU.  Russia is in similar situation.  Finally, some industrialised

countries, like Canada, Australia and New Zealand are expected to realise
strong growth rates.
All in all, world GDP growth is revised downwards to 2.6 % in 2002 and is
expected to accelerate to 4 % in 2004.  After a contraction in 2001, the first
in 20 years, international trade is expected to grow at about 2 % in 2002,

before accelerating to about 7 % in 2004.
No acceleration of
growth in the euro area
The pick-up in the euro area started promisingly in the first quarter of 2002.
Exports increased, inventories were adjusted and firms became more
optimistic about the future.  However, an acceleration of the expansion failed
EconomicForecasts,Autumn20022to materialise in the remainder of the year leaving the estimated average
growth rate in the euro area at a meagre 0.8 %.  What went wrong ?  Two

reasons can be given.
First, the cycle is not dead and it takes time before excess demand or supply
unwind. The present cycle seems to be driven by supply factors.  The
information and communication technology (ICT) hype led to over-
investment and over-capacity, even if not of the same size as in the US, while

the increase of food and oil prices eroded purchasing power with a shortage
of demand as a consequence.  The adjustment could have been faster if the
EU economy was less rigid and more competitive allowing for more flexible
wage and price responses.
The second reason emphasises special factors at the present juncture.  Stock
markets collapsed and geo-political tensions in the Middle East heightened
uncertainty so that investor’s confidence deteriorated and the household

savings rate increased. This prevented exports to ignite domestic production,
income generation and spending.
Domestic demand
remained weak
As a result, private consumption in the euro area is estimated to increase by
only 0.6 % in 2002 and investment is expected to contract for another year.

One half of the growth contribution comes from net exports.
Investment is expected to contract in almost all Member States, but in
Germany and Italy private consumption is also set to shrink in 2002, making

them the worst performers this year.  Also in the Netherlands, Austria and

Portugal growth is particularly low, while France remains above average, but

below expectations.

y.A turn for the better
delayed by one year
Confidence declined, industrial production is still lower than one year ago
and retail trade is weak, suggesting th
at growth is expected to remain
sluggish for another quarter or two, although a contraction of GDP is not

projected. The adjustment of inventories is coming to an end, there are no

major imbalances and confidence is expected to return. In consequence, the
Overview3euro area economy should gain momentum by mid-2003 benefiting from an
improved international environment and favourable monetary conditions.
Average euro area GDP growth next year is expected to reach only 1.8 %,
which represents a downward revision of 1.1 percentage point compared to

the Commission Spring Forecasts.  As employment and real income growth
is subdued, the increase in private consumption remains limited to 1.7 % in
2003.  Investment growth resumes, but pressures on profit margins and

sufficient capacity limit its expansion to 2 %.
Sound fundamentals
clouded by uncertainty
Uncertainty increased and the EU appears particularly vulnerable because
remaining rigidities in product, labour and capital markets make it difficult to
deal with shocks.  This general uncertainty stems from the threat of a military
conflict and the collapse of stock markets with a negative impact on

consumer and investor confidence. (i) Oil prices increased to close to USD
30 per barrel in the third quarter of 2002 because of the threat of war against
Iraq (but fell in October and early November).  Underlying the Commission

Forecasts is a decline to USD 21 in the second half of 2003, resulting in an
annual average of about USD 24.1.  If this decrease does not happen, but oil
prices stay some USD 10 higher, about ¼ percentage point has to be shaved
off from growth next year and inflation could be ¾ percentage point higher.
(ii) The fall in stock markets affects the cost and availability of capital and

reduces the financial wealth of households.  It also weighs on the financial

structure of insurance companies and pension funds, making households

worried about the level of their future pensions and firms more concerned

with cleaning up their balance sheets than with planning new investments. A
difficult business climate and corporate governance issues increased the risk
premium on loans, making credit more expensive than what the favourable
monetary conditions may suggest.
However, when these uncertainties dissipate, the sound fundamentals of the
EU economy should permit to realise above potential growth from the second
half of next year leading to an average growth rate of 2.7 % in 2004.  The
savings rate of households is high and the current account is in surplus.

Corporate balance sheets have been strengthened in the nineties and are

fundamentally sound. The larger part of household wealth is not held in

shares but in real estate which increased in value (except in Germany) and

for which mortgage payments declined thanks to low interest rates.  Finally,
the macroeconomic policy framework 
is oriented towards stability and
growth.
Resilient labour market
in 2002, not much
improvement in 2003
Despite the pronounced slowdown, employment creation is estimated to
continue, albeit at a weak pace, and the rise of the unemployment rate is
likely to remain limited in 2002, partially due to a slower increase in the
labour force.  Only in Germany and Austria is employment reduced this year.
The overall development in the euro area is in stark contrast to the US, which

is likely to show two years (2001 and 2002) of employment decline.  Past

structural reforms have increased the job content of growth in the EU, but

there also appears to be some labour hoarding, taking its toll next year.  The
forecast euro area unemployment rate at 8.3 % in 2003 is only marginally
higher than the previous year, but in several Member States (notably in the

Netherlands and Portugal) the unemployment rate continues to increase more

sharply.
EconomicForecasts,Autumn20024During 2002 – 2003 about 1 million jobs are expected to be created in net
terms, but when growth accelerates in the euro area more than that number

could be realised in 2004 alone.
Two years of low labour
productivity growth
The other side of the relatively resilient labour market is that productivity
gains are expected to remain low for another year in 2003 with as a
consequence an increase in unit labour costs.  To some extent this is a normal

cyclical reaction as employment lags the activity slowdown, but it
nevertheless puts additional strains on corporate profitability and weighs on
the resumption of investment.  The fall in productivity could be lower if
labour markets were more flexible.
Inflation is slow to
decline
Stubbornly high core inflation, increased service prices, a rise in unit labour
costs and continuing high oil prices, makes inflation to decline only slowly.

Inflation differentials were wide in 2002 and several countries increased
indirect taxes.  The HICP inflation rate in the euro area is not forecast to fall
below 2 % in 2003 on average from an estimated 2.3 % this year, but in 2004
HICP inflation could be 1.8 %.
Considerable
deterioration of public

finances in the euro
area as a whole,…
Mainly due to adverse cyclical developments the general government deficit
for the euro area as a whole widens to 2.3 % of GDP in 2002 and narrows
marginally to 2.1 % the following year.  For both years this represents an
increase of almost 1 % of GDP compared to initial deficit projections in the
Commission Spring Forecasts.  In 2002, apart from the deterioration in the

economic situation, other elements contributed to the widening of the deficit:

the worse outturn for 2001 provided for a lower starting position, but there

were also overruns. As announced in the budgetary plans currently under

discussion at national level, some measures are taken in 2003 to reduce the
deficit.  Only budgetary measures adopted or known in sufficient detail are
taken into account in the forecast for 2003. For 2004, the projection is based
on the normal assumption of no change in policy and the deficit at 1.8 % of

GDP would remain wide.
…but the situation
varies widely among
euro area Member
States.
In 2002, four euro area countries (Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, Finland) are
estimated to have cyclically adjusted balances close to equilibrium or in

surplus. In the Netherlands, the actual deficit is rising, but the cyclically

adjusted deficit remains limited and is corrected. Greece, has not been in

such a position according to revised data and its public debt is very high.

Also Ireland and Austria were in such a position, but with tax cuts in the
former and flood related expenditures in the latter government accounts
deteriorate.  In Italy, the debt increases to above 110 % of GDP and the
actual deficit at 2.4 % of GDP is worrying, but is expected to decline
marginally in 2003.  The French deficit, on the other hand, is expected to

increase from 2.7 % in 2002 to 2.9 % of GDP in 2003.  Two countries may

have deficits in excess of 3 % of GDP for two consecutive years although
both are considering additional measures 
to avoid the second year: Portugal
(in 2001 and 2002) and Germany (in 2002 and 2003).  Of the four countries

which breached the 3 % ceiling or are approaching it, only Germany and
Portugal make a structural effort of 0.5 % of GDP in 2003 to reduce their

deficit.
Chapter 1World economy
71.Global recovery hampered by uncertainty
The global recovery has disappointed: quarterly growth
in the OECD fell back to 0.4% in the second quarter of
2002, after having jumped to 0.7% in the first – just
below the average reached in the second half of the

nineties. Moreover, leading indicators, as calculated by

the OECD, have started to reverse their course in recent
months, suggesting weak growth going forward.

Graph 1.1:
OECD: GDP growth and leading indicator
At the start of 2002, vigorous global growth was
expected, following significant policy stimulus after 11

September. There had been a widespread loosening of

monetary policy. Moreover, US fiscal policy became
very accommodating, as reflected in the forecast
government deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2002, from only

0.5% in 2001.
The policy stimulus in the US was partially responsible
for a recovery in international trade in the first half of
2002, which may have raised business expectations to
an unrealistic level all over the world. Expectations

were subsequently corrected during summer, which

contributed to the weakening of equity markets.
Uncertainty is the culprit“Uncertainty” seems to summarise the interrelated
factors that explain the weakness of the recovery. The
present uncertainty relates to three factors:
•the evolution of equity markets;
•geopolitical tensions leading to high oil prices;
•uncertainty about the true state of the economy and
the corporate sector.
The factors are interrelated as the geopolitical tensions
and the uncertainty about the true state of the economy
contributed to the slide in equity markets. The equity

market slide, in turn, played a role in increasing the
uncertainty about the true state of the corporate sector.
Weak equity markets cut firms off from previously

available easy equity financing, accelerating the
recognition of the corporate sector problems. The
correction in business and consumer sentiment is also

entangled with the uncertainty factors.

The effects of the equity market decline
The effect of equity market wealth on private
consumption can be important, but differs among

economies according to the relative size of the stock
market capitalisation and to differences in financial
structure. Similarly, the effect on investment is

expected to vary by sector, as the technology sector

relies more heavily on financing through the equity
EconomicForecasts,Autumn20028market. Finally, there is evidence that real economy
developments are often preceded by similar equity

market developments. Indeed, the equity market decline

partially reflects lower earnings and output

expectations.
War risk fuels oil prices
Economic sentiment has been heavily influenced by the
risk of a war against Iraq, which has led to high oil

prices. It is very difficult to assess the global economic
consequences of a war against Iraq as the political and
military uncertainties surrounding the event are high.
The dimension and duration of the conflict are both
unknown. It makes a difference whether the

involvement is limited to a couple of countries or more

widespread, whether the war is confined to Iraq or
spreads to other regions and whether the conflict is
short-lived or protracted. The continuing changes in the

probability of a war against Iraq create additional

uncertainty.

(monthly

The Brent oil price stood above $23/bl for most of 2002
and topped even $29/bl at the end of September. This
was mainly due to the “war premium”, that reflects
fears of an oil supply disruption that could arise with

war in Iraq. The eventual disappearance of the war

premium combined with the lack of strength of the

global recovery could lead to substantially lower oil

prices. The forecast assumes continued political risk
into the first quarter of 2003 and an easing of tension
thereafter. Despite volatility in monthly prices, the
annual average Brent oil price would remain fairly
stable at USD 25.5/bl in 2002 
and USD 24.1/bl in 2003
before dropping to USD 22.5/bl in 2004.
Assessment of recent economic and financial
developments revised
Investors have lost confidence in the reliability of the
accounts of certain parts of the corporate sector in the
US. As investors from all over the world invested
heavily in the US during the nineties, the effects of the
US corporate governance issue on investor sentiment in

the rest of the world are significant.
Other elements of uncertainty about economic
developments are the big revisions recently made to the
national accounts of the two biggest economies of the

world. The downward revision of US growth in 2000

and 2001 nourishes doubts about the magnitude of the

permanent increase in US trend productivity growth. In

the case of Japan, the revision was due to a substantial
methodology change. Revisions in public finance data
in some European countries contributed to uncertainty

as well.
Finally, economic agents were misled by the strength of
the recovery in the first quarter of 2002, which proved
to be an aberration.
International trade faces slow recovery
International trade was on a bumpy road in 2002: trade
values fell back from May onwards, after a strong rise
during the first four months. The forecast assumes some
dynamism in the second half of 2002, leading to an

increase of about 2% in trade volumes in 2002. When
the global recovery gathers steam, trade would recover,

with volume growth of about 6% and 7% in
respectively 2003 and 2004.

Potential growth of around 3% will only be reached in

the course of 2004. Relatively slow growth in Europe
and Japan, combined with a strong dollar would
nevertheless lead to a record current account deficit of
5.7% of GDP in 2004. The strong dollar during the
forecast period comes from the assumption of constant

real exchange rates for non-EU currencies.

Notwithstanding recent developments, the 2002 Q3

Another fast growing industrialised economy is
Australia
, where growth is forecast to pick up to around
5% in 2002, supported by buoyant consumer spending,
a recovery in business investment and the rebuilding of

inventories. Growth would slow only moderately to
 4 ¾%  in 2003 and 3 ¾% in 2004.
Emerging markets: so far no contagion beyond
Latin America
Among 
emerging markets
, there is a wide divergence
between the fortunes of the Latin American economy,

which would shrink in 2002 and recover only modestly

afterwards, and the others. The contagion emanating
from Argentina remains so far restricted to Latin
America.
The economies of 
non-Japan Asia
 have remained
surprisingly buoyant, despite the volatility of equity

markets, the slowdown in the US and in other export
markets, and the problems emerging from Latin

America. 
China
, in particular, has shown considerable
economic strength, due to public sector investment and
export growth. 
Korea
 and 
Malaysia
 are also expected to
show strong growth during the forecast period.
Growth in the 
candidate countries 
remains fairly
robust, considering the weakness of growth in the EU,
the main trading partner of these countries, and some
exceptional domestic problems such as the floods in the
Czech Republic. Domestic demand, rising exports to

Russia and the former states of Yugoslavia, and

significant FDI inflows have provided support to these

economies and have off-set the decline in growth of

exports resulting from the slowdown in the EU.
Given high projected oil prices, and continuation of
structural reforms, 
Russia
's economy is expected to
show growth of around 4% in 2003.
Argentinean crisis affects other Latin American
economies more tha

Argentina
 has spread
to other countries in Latin America since last spring.
The crisis has adversely affected the economy and the

banking systems of 
Uruguay
 and 
Paraguay
 and, in
combination with political factors, has produced serious
financial turmoil in 
Brazil
. Moreover, Latin America’s
economic outlook is negatively affected by the

weakness of the international environment and by

specific economic and political problems in certain

countries (e.g. 
Venezuela

Monthly averages, Jan 2001 
As a result, a decline in Latin America’s GDP of about
1% is projected for 2002, the first negative number
recorded by the region since the debt crisis of 1982-83.
The region’s GDP is expected to recover only

moderately in 2003, partly reflecting the structural
nature of the problems experienced by some countries.
Growth would accelerate in 2004, supported by the

recovery in the world economy and the positive impact

on net exports of the improved competitiveness.
Mexico and 
Chile
 have shown impressive resilience to
the Argentinean crisis, which reflects in the case of

Mexico its increasing links with the US economy as

well as, in both Mexico and Chile, prudent
macroeconomic management. The Mexican recovery is

being weak due to the lack of strength of the US
economy.
Impact of Latin American crisis on EU economy
limited
The share of Latin America in the international trade
and financial links of the EU seems to be rather small,
specifically when compared to the links with the

countries that in 1997-1998 were most affected by the
Asian crisis (Table 1.2). Only the share of foreign direct
investment is high: one eighth of extra-EU outflows
went to Latin America over the period 1992-2000.
The impact of Latin America depends, however,
critically on the developments in the individual

countries. The two biggest economies of the region,

Brazil and Mexico, which together account for 57% of
its GDP, are also the main counterparts of EU trade,

investment and banking links. The exception is foreign
direct investment, for which Argentina has been far
more important than Mexico.
The figures seem to suggest that, provided that the
relative resilience of the economies of Brazil and
Mexico continues, the EU would be shielded from most

of the fall-out of the Latin American crisis, as a result

of the small weight of the crisis-stricken economies
(Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela).
Finally, the limits of the approach of quantifying the
international EU links should be clearly stressed. The
effects of a crisis in specific emerging markets are not

only dependent on the intensity of its links with the EU.
The effects will crucially depend on the overall health
of the EU economy, specifically the health of the

corporate and financial sector, and the strength of

domestic demand and external demand outside the

crisis-stricken emerging markets.

Chapter 2The economy of the euro area
151.Slow recovery in 2002
1.1. Growth acceleration delayed
The economic recovery in the euro area started in the
first quarter of 2002 after last year’s slight and short-

lived contraction of GDP. However in the second

quarter of 2002, the recovery did not gain momentum.

The quarterly growth rate was +0.4% for each of the
two first quarters of this year. After an initial boost,
foreign demand brought little support to the recovery.
Consumption was sluggish in the first half of this year.
Inventories and investment posted their sixth negative

quarterly change in a row.
A tentative pick-up in exports
Growth was driven by net exportsin the beginning of
the first half of the year (each quarter 0.2% contribution
to qoq change in GDP). In the first quarter, this was
partly due to very weak imports, reflecting the poor

state of domestic demand. In the second quarter,
exports grew by 1.8%, after several quarters of
contraction.  However, the latest trade data at the world

level (chart 1.4), point to some stabilisation.
Private consumption subdued by low confidence
Private consumption has remained sluggish for the four
last quarters and even declined in the first quarter of

2002 by -0.2% on a quarterly basis. Stubborn inflation

had eroded the purchasing power of households.

Furthermore, inflation has been perceived by

households as stronger than it actually was in the
context of the changeover to the euro.  Evidence can be
found in consumer surveys which indicate that

households had the feeling that inflation in the last 12

months went up whereas HICP actually decreased until
August.

Consumer confidence failed to recover decisively and
has hovered since the end of 2001 just above the long
run average. Increasing uncertainties about labour
market developments, stock markets and international
relations have led to relative pessimism which

accentuated the impact of dented real disposable

income and shrinking financial wealth.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn200216Contracting inventoriesIn the second quarter of 2002, stocks were depleted for
the sixth quarter in a row. Inventories are reduced either
if actual demand is stronger than previously expected or
if firms anticipate a decline of future demand which
cannot be accommodated by a reduction in production
because it takes time to adjust production processes. In
the 1995/96 or 1998/99 slowdowns, de-stocking started

only after the trough because the upturn in consumption

was stronger than anticipated. However, the pattern of
inventories in the current cycle is similar to the 1991/93
recession. In this cycle, inventories have been depleted

during the downturn before the trough, because firms

have expected very low demand since the end of last

year, and not because demand is stronger than

previously expected. As in 1991/93, the pattern of
inventories points to a shortage in final demand.
Investment on hold
Capital spending fell by about -0.7% in each of the last
five quarters.  Profit margins have been under pressure
and profit expectations have been muted, but more
fundamentally slack demand does not create incentives

to initiate investments.  Moreover, any pick up in

demand would be met by an increased use of existing

capacity. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing

industry stabilised in the third quarter of 2002 at
80.7 %, below the average level of the last ten years (at
81.8 %) but much above the trough of the 1993

recession.
Generalised weakness across sectors
In the last four quarters, the economic slowdown was
most noticeable in the industrial and retail sectors.  The

industrial sector was recovering from the contraction in

the last quarter of 2001, but was losing steam over the
summer. The situation in the construction sector
worsened in the first half of 2002. The financial sector
recovered in the second quarter of this year, but activity
remains low.
1.2. Behind the lack of momentum
Two reasons can be given for the interruption of the
recovery.  First, the pick-up in the first quarter of 2002

could be seen as a false start in the light of historical

experience suggesting that a slowdown lasts longer.
Second, something went wrong in the transmission of
the promising pick-up in exports to the other demand
components probably due to increased uncertainty
related to the collapse in stock markets and a war threat.
Frustrated expectations
The recovery started promisingly in the first quarter of
this year with a boost coming from exports. This,
together with the easing of international political

tensions after the quick end to the hostilities in

Afghanistan, bolstered confidence as reflected in survey
sentiment indicators which are capturing expectations.
As a consequence, growth was expected to accelerate
and to be above potential by the end of the year.
The overall profile of the current recovery is in line
with historical experience. It generally takes more than
3 or 4 quarters before imbalances between demand and
supply are absorbed. The 2001 downturn was more
pronounced than in 1995 or 1998, but milder than 1993.

Growth subdued due to increased uncertainty
The economic policy boost in the US petered out and
the pick-up in international trade was losing steam over
the summer, but trade remained sustained.  Apparently
something went wrong in Europe with the transmission
of the pick-up in foreign demand to domestic demand.

The increase in exports, even if moderate, failed to

stimulate private consumption and investment, despite a
turn of expectations for the better. Underlying
economic conditions were also conducive to an
acceleration of growth.  As far as private consumption
is concerned, employment held up quite well during the

slowdown and there was still some real income growth.

Monetary policy has been eased and this should have
stabilised investment, instead 
of the deterioration which
was observed.
Increased uncertainty, stemming from volatility in stock
markets and a war threat on Iraq, seems to be

responsible for the failed transmission.  The gap
between household expectations about future
developments and the assessment of current economic

circumstances widened until mid-2002, increasing the

risk that expectations were unrealistic.  Eventually, the

gap may narrow by an adjustment of expectations and
not by an improvement of the economy.
Similarly in the corporate sector, uncertainty led to
increased risk aversion and investments were
reconsidered. Corporate bond spreads over long-term
government yields increased reflecting a risk premium
lenders asked and financing conditions became more
severe than at first sight suggested by the low interest

rates.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn200218Box 2.1:External assumptions and budgetary conventions
Exchange rates
Constant nominal exchange rate in the ERM2 (DKK/EUR
rates) and constant real rates (nominal rates adjusted for

changes in GDP deflators) for Sweden, the UK and non-EU
currencies are assumed. The period considered for the
stability assumption is the fourth quarter of 2002, with
historical values up to 4 November and the average of the

two weeks period between 21 October and 4 November used
for the remainder of the quarter. The average USD/EUR rate
for that period was 0.98 and the JPY/EUR rate 121.4.  This
leads to average USD/EUR rates of 0.94 in 2002, 0.98 in

2003 and 2004 and JPY/EUR rates of 118.6, 118.5 and 115.4
respectively.
Interest rates
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the
objective of monetary policy with respect to price stability.
Long-term interest rate assumptions are based on
developments in short-term rates and an assessment of

economic conditions.  Attention is paid to international
financial linkages, market expectations and budgetary
developments.
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are forecast taking into account market
conditions, where initial conditions receive relatively more
weight. Prices for Brent oil are forecast at 25.5 USD/bl on
average in 2002, 24.1 USD/bl in 2003 and 22.5 USD/bl in

2004.
Prices of non-fuel commodities are thought to have bottomed
out and are expected to increase as economic activity in the

world picks up. Prices of primary commodities, excluding

fuels, are assumed to increase by 0.3 % in 2002, 4.3 % in
2003 and to rise by a further 4.5% in 2004.  Prices of metals,
food and raw materials are all expected to firm during the
forecast horizon as demand picks up in line with global

economic recovery.
Budgetary data
Estimates for 2001 are based on the Excessive Deficit
Procedure notification, submitted by the Member States in

September 2002. Eurostat reported on 30 September (press

release 116/2002) that it could not certify figures for Greece,
as some information was still pending or incomplete. Since
then, the outstanding accounting issues have been settled by
Eurostat, in co-operation with the Greek authorities, and
Greece has submitted a revised reporting at the beginning of
November 2002. The Commission forecasts already take into
account these revised data.
For 2002, information on the execution of the budgets is
taken into account. For 2003 budgets adopted or presented to
parliaments and all other measures known in sufficient detail

are taken into consideration. For 2004, the “no-policy
change” assumption used in the forecasts implies that
presently known measures (if not one-offs) and trends are
extrapolated.
The government balances reported in the notification may be
different from those in a national accounts context, following
an amendment to ESA95. Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on
the reclassification of settlements under swaps agreements

and forward rate agreements implies there are two relevant
definitions of government deficit/surplus. According to this
Regulation, interest flows under swaps have been reclassified
from income property to financ
ial account, while 
stating the
need for a specific treatment of these flows for data
transmitted under the Excessive deficit Procedure. Therefore,
according to ESA95, swap settlements are excluded from the
calculation of general government balances, while for the
purposes of the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability

and Growth Pact balances do include swaps.
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output gaps
Year 2004 is a leap year. The mere addition of one extra
working day implies that output increases, other things being
equal, by about 0.4 of a percentage point.  Annual GDP

figures are not adjusted for the number of working days,
while quarterly national accounts figures of most countries
are adjusted for the number of working days in each quarter.
This implies that the simple addition of the four quarters of a

single year may not add up to the annual figure. Moreover,
the calculation of potential GDP from which the output gap is
derived does not make any adjustment on the basis of the
number of working days in the leap year because this is

considered as a temporary shock and should not affect the
cyclically adjusted balances, which are calculated using these
output gaps. Hence, for 2004 the apparent declining output
gap is to a certain extent due to this calendar phenomenon.
192.A gradual growth acceleration
2.1. Potential growth at the end of 2003
Slow growth in the second half of 2002
Following last year’s small contraction of GDP in the
fourth quarter, most indicators improved in the first half

of 2002, slightly eased in the Summer and did not

significantly improve afterwards. This suggests that the
recovery is on hold.
Industrial production in the euro area grew moderately
in August, but remained below its level one year ago. A

slightly more positive reading is suggested by retail

data which slightly expanded in July, after a significant
contraction in the second quarter of 2002.
GDP is expected to grow by 0.8% in 2002, of which net
exports (due to weak imports) contribute one half.

Private consumption growth falls below 1 % and

investment contracts.
Growth accelerating in 2003 and stabilising in 2004
Driven by consumption, growth is expected to rise
gradually in the course of 2003 and is forecast to reach
an average growth rate of 2%. The output gap on a

quarterly basis would be closed at the end of 2003.

Private consumption growth is close to 2 % and after
two years of contraction, investment is expanding
again. With a substantial carry-over from 2003, the

growth rate for 2004 should reach 2¾%.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn200220Private consumption holds the key
After two years of subdued growth, euro area 
exports
are expected to increase at about 5% in 2003 and
continue to expand in line with the improved
international environment.  The euro area will lose
some market share as emerging markets increasingly

participate in the global economy, but also as a result of

the strengthening of the euro.
Consumption
 was sluggish even before the trough,
compared to other cycles in the nineties. However, most
effects that contributed to inhibit consumption in
2001/02 are expected to unwind at the beginning of

2003:-Nominal wages, though increasing somewhat less
fast in the forecast horizon are expected to result in
higher real wages thanks to a deceleration in

inflation; moreover, the gap between perceived

inflation and actual inflation that might have

weighed on consumption in 2002 is expected to

narrow as households will be better aware of the

new prices in euro;
-Household income is expected to be further
supported by an increase in employment;
-After 8 quarters in a row of weak consumption,
there may be some pent-up demand which is
released when conditions improve;
-Consumer confidence which remained around the
long-term average should improve and the savings

rate which increased significantly in 2002 to more

than 15 % of disposable income is expected to

decline.

Weak expectations of a recovery should contribute to
further deplete 
inventories
, like after 
the 1993 trough,and lead to a low level of stocks at the end of 2002.

With the strengthening final demand, firms are

expected to adjust their inventory levels and a

significant upward effect on industrial production
should stem from stock rebuilding.
Capacity utilisation at this moment is fairly close to its
long-term average in contrast to the 1993 recession.
This would suggest that the remaining capital overhang
could be eliminated when production picks up leading

to a quick recovery of 
investment
 after the sharp
contraction in 2002 (-1.8 %).  However, total
investment is expected to grow moderately at 2.3 % in
2003 and 4.1 % in 2004 hampered by pressures on both
the cost of capital and return on capital.
The decline in real benchmark interest rates has not
translated into a lower cost of capital for many firms.
Underlying factors are: the rise in corporate bond
spreads over government yields, a hike in bank lending
rates and possibly tighter bank lending.  Furthermore,

stock markets fell steeply so that raising equity capital

became more expensive.
With respect to the return on capital, profitability has
deteriorated as producer prices are subdued and unit

labour costs have been rising because of declining

growth is labour productivity. The recent oil price jump

added to this upward pressure on costs.
2.2. Larger downward revisions in Member
States with budget problems
The growth take off has been postponed in the euro
area, which has affected euro area countries differently.
Member States with sound public finances can let the

automatic stabilisers operate more freely to reinforce

domestic demand and resist better the slowdown.
Countries with already relatively large deficits saw a
further deterioration in their fiscal situation in 2002,
but, nevertheless, have been subject to more
pronounced forecast revisions on real growth.
In Germany, Portugal, Netherlands, and Italy slow
growth continues in 2003. Both the German and Italian

EconomicForecasts,Autumn200222economy suffer from faltering domestic demand, and
growth is upheld by net exports, while keeping

government finances under control is difficult. The

Portuguese economy faces structural imbalances, and

the reduction of the government deficit to below 3% is

felt. The economic performance in the Netherlands is
affected by low productivity gains and relatively high
wage increases, which continues to lower

competitiveness.
Growth is also low in Austria, Belgium, France and
Luxembourg. The widening of the deficit in Austria
during 2002 and the heavy debt of Belgium prevent

these countries making full use of the automatic

stabilisers. In France, public finances are further

deteriorating in 2003 stimulating domestic demand, but

nevertheless, growth remains disappointing. Finland, on
the other hand, has a budget surplus and could use the
automatic stabilisers so that growth is stronger despite
the impact of the decline in stock markets and

production in the ICT sector.
Among the countries that have better resisted the
slowdown, Spain, Ireland and Greece, the acceleration
in the recovery is also postponed. Spain is expected to

realise a growth rate of 2.6% in 2003, while the other

three show growth rates of around 3%, or above. In
Ireland, growth remains the second highest in the EU
after Greece, but it should be noted that the Irish

government surplus completely dwindled and became a

deficit far from balance.
The countries outside the euro area are performing
better than the euro area average. Private consumption
is holding up well in the UK, partly due to rises in

housing prices, offsetting falls in equity wealth, though

this is partly offset by a contraction in fixed investment.
The Danish economy has already seen a small recovery

in 2002, with a shift from investment to consumption
driven growth. The Swedish economy is still weak due
to the slump in the ICT sector, but as public finances
firmly are in surplus, there has been room for fiscal
expansion, which also happened to a smaller degree in
Denmark.
2.3. Issues at the present juncture
The collapse in stock markets
Since the beginning of this year stock markets lost
about 40 % of their value in Europe and volatility was

very high adding to the uncertainty.  While difficult to

quantify, this has effects on the economy.  It is
estimated that a 20 % correction in stock markets could
shave 0.4 percentage point of euro area GDP growth

after one year.  This impact is based on a permanent

change in equity prices, the persistence of the negative

confidence effects and no policy response.
Furthermore, equity is not the only asset of households,
whose balance sheet has four main components.  On the
asset side there are (i) equities, (ii) other securities

(mainly fixed-income), and (iii) real estate; (iv)

mortgage loans are the most important liability. In the

iSource: OECD Economic Outlook 
While the fall in stock markets prices since 2001 has
shrunk at least by half household financial wealth in
equities, other components of household wealth have

been notably resilient in the downturn.  This is mostly

due to the fall in real interest rates down to historical

lows.  The decline in long interest rates increased the

market value of bond holdings and mortgages can be
refinanced at more attractive interest rates in the EU. It
increased also the value of household wealth through

the acquisition of more expensive property with the
same instalments.  Finally, real estate prices have
generally increased in spite of the slowdown, but are

they sustainable ?

Annual inflation-adjusted house prices

The rise in house prices
Real estate prices have been increasing since the second
half of the nineties in some major euro area countries

following the elimination of the overhang of the late

eighties/early nineties.  House prices have risen
continuously in the Netherlands. The major exception
to this trend of increasing prices is Germany, where

house prices have been declining since the construction

boom related to re-unification in 1990.
While a bubble with an inevitable burst cannot be ruled
out, compared to the late eighties, the situation seems

more stable.  First, nominal housing prices have hardly

exceeded the levels reached in the early 90s in most
euro area countries. Second, the outburst of the real
estate bubble in 1991 spread from commercial real
estate to the whole housing market, fuelled by rising
prices rather than scarcity of capacity. Nominal

commercial property prices are below the early 90s

level and the development of this type of speculative

activity seems less likely.
Favourable monetary conditions, but uncertainty
prevents to take full advantage
Following the latest interest rate cut of the ECB in
November 2001, interest rate levels are conducive to

growth. Interest rates, both short and long,  increased
somewhat in the beginning of this year as an inflation
risk premium developed, given the sudden spike in

inflation at that moment. Subsequently, interest rates

Monetary conditions in the euro area
However, the appreciation of the euro and the widening
of corporate interest rates spreads have mitigated the

loosening of monetary conditions since the second

quarter of 2002, shedding another light on the low level

of actual interest rates. The euro exchange rate against

the US dollar rose steeply in the second quarter and
seems to have stabilised since the third quarter around
parity. The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro

has appreciated by about 10% since the end of 2000, its

low point. A stronger euro is nevertheless welcome, as

it will contribute to curb inflation in the euro area. It

should not hamper the recovery to the extent that it
corrected earlier weakness in the exchange rate and it
contributes to the shift from external demand to

domestic demand.
Of more concern is the development of a risk premium
which makes borrowing more expensive than what the

favourable monetary stance suggests.  Evidence for this

can be found in the widening of BBB bond spreads over

government yields in the wake of the Enron crisis

which affected also EU companies.  Worries about
potential accounting fraud which prevents as the
assessment of the true state of balance sheets and

general economic uncertainty increased risk aversion,

requiring a compensation in the form of a risk premium.
Net borrowing and financing of corporations during

Over the period 1996-2001 total saving and investment
in the euro area as a share of GDP remained broadly

stable. Gross saving (includ
ing net capital transfers)
averaged about 22% of GDP and gross capital
formation (including net acquisition of valuables)
averaged about 20-21% of GDP. As a result, the net
lending position of the whole economy as measured by

the difference between saving and investment in the
capital account, moved in the range between 0.5% and
2% of GDP.

25small net lending position recorded in 2000 partly due
to the windfall revenues from UMTS.
Borrowing by non-financial corporations widened from
0.2% of GDP in 1996 to 3.4% in 2000, and narrowed
again to 2.1% in 2001. The greater deterioration in 2000

reflects the one-off investment expenditure in UMTS

licenses.  The rise in borrowing needs by corporations

should not be problematic in the context of the

favourable investment conditions that prevailed
between 1996 and 2000, supported by the decline of
interest rates as inflation and government finances

improved, increasing profitability, and the relatively
strong economic growth.  From a balance sheet

perspective, it is reassuring to note that the worsening
of the economic climate led to an improvement in the
corporate net-borrowing positions between 2000 and
2001, but corporate borrowing is today bigger than five

years ago.
Corporate borrowing can be measured also from the
financial account as it is the difference between net
acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of

liabilities. The balancing items in the capital and

financial accounts should correspond except for
differences in statistical sources. The financial account
confirms that euro area corporations increased

borrowing significantly and that, despite the

improvement in 2001, total indebtedness rose

substantially, from 4.9% of GDP in 1996 to 10.5% in
2001. This makes more difficult to finance capital
spending and may delay the rebound of investments.
Looking at the structure of financing, loans account for
more than 50% of total net liabilities. The relative share

of bank loans and equity as a source of finance has

declined since 2000, while the issuance of securities

gained in importance during the downturn.  It reflects
the difficulty to raise capital on the stock market and a
more cautious stance of banks to grant credit, which is
not marketable.  In these conditions the issuance of
bonds increased in importance.
Overall, the change in the pattern of financing corporate
borrowing needs during the slowdown suggests a
deterioration of balance sheets with increased concerns
for riskier debt instruments on the part of potential

suppliers of capital.

263.Resilient labour market
3.1. Continued job creation despite slowgrowth
Employment reacts with a lag to the downswing
After several years of strong improvements (10 million
jobs were created between 1996 and 2001),
employment growth started decelerating in the second
half of 2001 following with some lag, the continued

weakening of economic activity. The annual growth

rate of employment came down to 1.1% in the third

quarter of 2001 compared to 2.1% in the same quarter

of 2000 and continued to decelerate in the first half of
this year to stand at 0.5% in the second quarter of 2002.
However, employment growth has remained positive.
In 2002 employment growth is estimated to be limited
to 0.4% in the euro area. In absolute terms, this

translates into 0.5 millions new jobs only, significantly
less than in recent years. Employment developments are
expected to differ across Member States. A pace of net
job creation above the euro area average is anticipated
for Luxembourg (2.8%), Spain and Ireland (1.3%), Italy
(1.0%), Portugal and the UK (0.7%), France (0.6%),
while employment is forecast to be stagnant in
Belgium, Denmark, Austria and Sweden and to contract
in Germany (-0.5%).
The projected  increase in employment in 2003 is 0.4%,
the same as in the previous year. More positive
developments are envisaged for Spain (1.8%), Ireland
(1.4%), Luxembourg (1.2%), and to a lesser extent also
for Greece (0.8%), the UK (0.7%) and Belgium (0.6%).
Employment is estimated to remain unchanged in

Germany, Finland and Sweden, to growth below the
euro area average in Portugal (0.2%) and Denmark
(0.3%)  and to decline in the Netherlands (-0.5%).
Employment is forecast to pick-up by 1.0% in 2004
thanks to the rebound of economic activity. Among the

larger Member States, the strongest employment gain is

estimated for Spain (2.3%) with France (1.2%) and
Italy (1.0%) maintaining about the euro area pace of
growth while Germany (0.5%) is lagging behind.
In absolute terms, it is estimated that in 2004 net job
creation in the euro area will amount to about 1.3
million which is less than in recent years but more than
in the two previous years taken together. As working-

age population is expected to post only marginal

increases, the overall employment rate is forecast to rise
moderately from 61.3% in  2002 to 61.9% in 2004.
The slowdown of employment growth during 2001 and
2002 applies to all sectors but was more pronounced in

agriculture and manufacturing. Employment in

agriculture continued to decline both for structural
reasons and because the sector is still suffering from the
loss of consumer confidence following recent food
crisis. Employment in industry reversed its positive

pattern in the second quarter of 2001 and decelerated

rapidly in the following quarters as industrial

production was severely hit by the economic downturn.
 The service sector proved to be the most dynamic
sector for employment during the economic downturn.

Employment continued to rise even though the annual

growth rate has been falling continuously since the

beginning of 2001 to stand at 1.3% in the second

quarter of 2002 compared to an average growth rate of
2.9% in 2000 and 1.9% in 2001. Within services, the

of 2001 was exacerbated by the negative employment
impact on aviation and stock markets following the

terrorist attack in the US.
Limited increase in unemployment
A consequence of the small albeit positive pace of
employment growth, particularly this year and the next,

is the limited deterioration of the unemployment rate.

The harmonised unemployment rate, which has been
falling since the spring of 1997, has not risen
significantly in reaction to the marked economic
downturn. Only a minor increase of 0.3 pp was

registered over the last twelve months, from 8.0% in

September 2001 to 8.3% in September 2002. For the

year 2002 as a whole, the number of unemployed is

estimated at 8.2% of the labour force, compared to
8.0% in 2001, and to increase marginally to 8.3% in
2003. The slowdown of labour supply growth from

1.0% in 2001 to 0.6% in 2003 contributes to limit the

deterioration of the unemployment rate this year and the
next. In 2004, on the back of stronger activity, the
unemployment rate is forecast to decline to reach an
annual average of 8.0%. Unemployment rates are

expected to remain quite dispersed in Member States

and above the euro area average in Greece, Spain,
France, Italy and Finland.
3.2. Employment performance has been
supported by structural reforms
Over the period 1996-2001 the euro area labour market
performed extremely well. Employment grew at the

respectable pace of 1.4% on average each year,

significantly higher than the rate of growth of the

population in working age. As a result, the employment
rate rose to 61.2% in 2001 making further progress
towards reaching the intermediate Lisbon target of 67%
in 2005. About 10 millions new jobs were created

between 1996 and 2001 while  the number of people

without a job declined by 3.2 million. As a result the

unemployment rate fell from 10.8% to 8.0%.
Flexible labour contractual arrangements, reduction of
the tax burden on labour income, promotion of active
labour market policies and reform of the tax-benefit
system have paved the way for a decline of structural
unemployment in the euro area. Moreover, social
partners have pursued more employment-friendly wage
arrangements which contributed to the improved job-

performance. The EMU provided a macro-economic
framework within which the benefits of nominal wage
restraints are more visible.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn200228Unemployment) came down from 9.8% in 1996 to
8.7% in 2001 which means that structural factors

contributed to the improvement in actual

unemployment over the last five years. Thanks to

labour market reforms the employment content of

growth increased over the past few years. That is, a
larger share of growth is translated into employment
creation.
Over the forecasting horizon, the structural component
of the unemployment is projected to decline further to
8.1% in 2004 thanks to continued wage moderation. It
helps explain the limited increase in unemployment.
3.3. Labour market rigidities remain
Despite the progress made in recent years, structural
unemployment remains very high in the euro area
which means that employment and labour market

participation do not fluctuate much over the business

cycle. Additional evidence of the relative rigidity of the

labour market in the euro area is provided by the high
share of long-term unemployment which still accounts
for approximately 50% of total unemployment.
The remarkable resilience of the euro area labour
market helped avoiding a greater deterioration of

overall consumer confidence and household spending.
The other side of the coin is that labour productivity
experienced a sharp deceleration since mid-2000 and in
the last quarter of 2001 even declined in absolute terms
as employment continued to rise despite the marked
deceleration of economic activity. Annual growth in
output per worker averaged to only 0.2% in 2001 in the
euro area, down from 1.4% in 2000 and is forecast to be
only 0.4% in 2002. Growth in GDP per occupied person

is estimated to resume again in 2003 at 1.4% and to
post a marginal increase the following year to reach
1.6%. While a decline in labour productivity is normal

during downturns, this time the slowdown is significant.
Compensation per head stabilised at 2.9% in 2000 and
2001 and is estimated to grow at about the same annual
pace over the forecasting horizon. As a result, unit
labour costs accelerated by 2.8% in 2001, the highest
increase since 1993 and markedly above the average
growth rate of the last five years. In 2002, unit labour

costs are estimated to rise by a further 2.5% before
coming down to a more normal pattern in the following
two years. The strong increase in unit labour costs over
the last two years left little room for an improvement of

corporate profit margins and weighs on the rebound of

business investment.

294.Inflation prospects improve
4.1. Inflation outlook
Inflation expected to fall below 2% in the first half
of 2003
The upward pressure coming from higher food prices at
the beginning of the year, the upsurge of oil prices since
the second quarter of 2002 related to geopolitical
tensions outside the euro area and the persistent
stickiness of core inflation,
 translate into an estimated
HICP inflation rate (Harmonized Index of Consumer

Prices) of 2.3% in 2002. This inflation rate is higher

than that forecast by the Commission in Spring and

above the ECB’ medium term objective of price
stability.
Barring additional tensions in the Middle East and,
therefore, on oil, annual inflation is forecast to fall to
2.1% in the first quarter of 2003. Also core inflation
(HICP inflation excluding the volatile energy and
unprocessed food component) is forecast to resume a
downward trend at the beginning of next year. Over the
forecasting period, the average inflation rate is
projected at 2.0% on average in 2003 and to slow down

further to 1.8% in the following year.
Cyclical and structural factors should dampen
inflationSeveral short-term elements point to lower price
inflation: the unwinding of past increases in energy and
food prices, low pressure from producer prices, subdued

inflation expectations, favourable effects from the

recent appreciation of the euro.
Looking at the major determinants of inflation in the
medium-term, the deceleration of HICP inflation over
the forecasting horizon is supported by the pick up of

labour productivity which, contingent to an appropriate

wage behaviour, will dampen the rise of unit labour

costs and contribute to reduce overall inflation.

Increased competition among firms accompanied by
low pressure from the demand side and continuous
deregulation in the service sector stemming from

implementing further EU legislation are also expected

to have a dis-inflationary impact.
Inflation differentials remain wide
Inflation rates among euro area participants remain
however quite dispersed. In 2002 the lowest inflation
rate is forecast for Germany (1.4%) but HICP inflation
is estimated to fall below the 2.0% ceiling also in

Belgium (1.6%), France, Austria, Finland and

Luxembourg (1.9%). By contrast, the highest price

increases are anticipated for Ireland (4.8%), the

Netherlands (3.9%), Greece (3.8%), Spain (3.6%) and
Portugal (3.5%). In 2003, the inflation rate is forecast to
decline in all Member States except for Germany

(1.5%) with Belgium (1.4%) and Ireland (3.8%) at the

Forecast
The low inflation rate in some countries prompted fears
of deflation. This appears unjustified. Deflation is not

simply lower inflation but it is a prolonged period of
decline in the overall price level, which leads to a
continuous postponing of household and business

expenditure and thus triggers a downward spiral in

economic activity. Although demand is weak in some

countries with very low inflation, this kind of

development is not observed.
4.2. Recent inflation developments
Only in 1999, the first year of EMU, euro area inflation

was below 2%. Three reasons can be given for the

relatively high inflation in the recent past: (i) a series of

price shocks, (ii) rising service prices and (iii) an
increase in unit labour costs.
Nevertheless, a comparison of inflation rates in
Member States over the last two decades reveals that

inflation is now significantly lower. And for the euro

area as a whole, the inflation rate is currently well
below the long-term average (1960-1998) in Germany
before the beginning of EMU (3.2%).
HICP inflation pushed up by special factors
Since mid 2001 headlineHICP inflation in the euro area
was on a distinct downward trend and was expected to
continue on that path in 2002. However, the beginning

of 2002 witnessed a marked increase in annual inflation

(to 2.7% in January) which remained stubbornly high

during the first months of 2002. A gradual resumption
to a downward trend lead in June to an inflation rate of
1.8%, the lowest rate since December 1999. After this

dip, HICP inflation increased again to 2.1% in

September.
A combination of special factors are behind the still
surprisingly high level of inflation. At the beginning of
the year, inflation was pushed upwards by surges in
prices of fresh food owing to unusually cold weather,
increases in indirect taxes in some Member States,

traditional increases of tariffs of some public sector

goods and services and a limited impact from the euro
cash changeover as firms have rounded up prices
particularly in some services (cafes and restaurants,

repairs) and for small manufactured items bought

regularly. More recently, international tensions have led

to a rise in oil prices and there has been a further spike

in fresh food prices as a consequence of crop losses due
to the recent flooding. While these elements may
explain why inflation is slow to fall, they are of a

temporary nature and thus their effects are expected to

unwind quite rapidly.
Chapter2The economy of the euro area
31Core inflation driven by servicesOf more concern is the stickiness of core inflation. Core
inflation was particularly resilient in 2002. It was 2.6%

in January 2002 and has not yet shown clear signs of a
trend reversal. Since February 2002 core inflation has
always been above HICP inflation. In the first three

quarters of 2002, core inflation averaged at 2.6%

compared to 1.9% in the same period of the preceding
year.
The decomposition of core inflation into its three main
components - non-energy industrial goods, processed

food and services - reveals that the upward trend in core
inflation during 2002 is mainly driven by service

inflation. Non-energy industrial prices while still

affected by previous hikes in oil prices are decelerating.

They moved down from 1.9% in February to 1.4% in

September. Processed food inflation peaked at 3.8% in
January but it has declined steadily since then to reach
2.7% in September as the pass-through effects of
previous price shocks in unprocessed food are fading

away.
By contrast, inflation in services rose to 3% in January
2002 and has been steadily above that level since then,
peaking at 3.3% in September, the highest level since

February 1996. The average inflation rate in services

during the first three quarters of this year has been 3.2%

compared to 2.4% in the same period of 2001.
Considering that the weight of services is the HICP
basket is close to 40%, the rising inflation trend in
services puts a strong upward pressure on overall

inflation.
Several reasons can be pointed at for the increase in
service inflation. First, the pass-through of price
increases from the international environment is easier as

the service sector is more protected from overall

competitive pressures. Second, the existence of

productivity differentials between the goods and the

service sector with broadly similar wage developments
imply higher cost pressure in the sector with lower
productivity gains, which is generally thought to be the
service sector (Samuelson-Balassa effect). Third,
consumption expenditure patterns are shifting from

goods to services implying higher weights in the euro

area HICP basket and making the impact of the increase

in service prices larger on overall inflation. Finally, the

service sector is characterised by a stronger intervention

of public authorities through administrative prices.

Components of core inflation in the euro      
area
Rising unit labour costs
A further element for the hiccup in core inflation is
related to the rise of unit labour costs. Owing to a
combination of steady compensation per employee and
a sharp slowdown in productivity growth, unit labour
costs have picked up considerably during 2001 and

2002. However, while unit labour costs have certainly

risen, firms are unlikely to fully pass them on to prices

as this would lead to a loss of market share given the
current economic context of subdued growth. Partially,
the increase in unit labour costs will be also reflected on

lower profit margins. In 2003 and 2004, growth in unit

labour costs is expected to decelerate as labour

productivity benefits from the cyclical upswing. The
pressure on profit margins would then ease.
325.Public finances: overall deterioration butuneven developments across Member States
General government deficits widen
For 
2002
 the general government balance is expected to
reach a deficit of 2.3 % of GDP in the euro area,
compared to 1.5 % in 2001. This also marks a large
upward revision compared to a deficit forecast of 1.4 %
of GDP according to the Commission Spring Forecasts.

The revisions in the general government positions
compared to the Commission Spring Forecast are
particularly important in the case of Austria (upward

revision of 1.7 percentage point), Greece and Ireland

(both up by 1.6 percentage point), Italy (1.1 percentage

point) and Germany (up by one percentage point).
In 
2003 only a small improvement is expected for the
euro area with the general government deficit falling
marginally to 2.1 % of GDP. In 
2004, the deficit of the
euro area is expected to fall slightly more to reach

1.8 % of GDP. This is the result of the expected

acceleration in GDP growth because the forecast for
2004 is done on the basis of the « no policy change »
assumption.
The effect of the cycle and the policy reaction
The economic slowdown is the main factor responsible
for the deterioration of public finances in 2002, but not

the only one. Fiscal policy has been eased, there have

been slippages and the budgetary outcome for 2001 was

worse than expected providing for a weaker starting

base.
The change in the actual balance for the euro area in
2002 shows a deterioration of 0.8 of a percentage point
of GDP, compared to 2001. The cyclical component

accounts for 0.6 of a percentage point.  It reflects the

working of the automatic stabilisers which should
soften the impact of the deterioration in the economic
situation.  There is also a nega
tive contribution to the
change in the actual balance from discretionary

measures or slippages (-0.3 of a percentage point),

partially compensated by a reduction in interest
expenditure (+0.2 of a percentage point). In 2003, the
contribution of the cycle to the expected marginal

improvement in the actual balance is again negative but
only by 0.2 % point.  In 2004, as actual output may rise
somewhat faster than potential, the cyclical effect on

the budget balance should be neutral.

Budgetary policy in the euro area loosened in 2002, as
measured by the change in the cyclically adjusted

primary balance (CAPB), which declined by 0.3 of a

percentage point, but there are considerable differences

at the country level.  Most Member States start
correcting the deficits in 2003 and the overall budgetary
stance in the euro area is tightened next year.
The most important revision in deficit estimates for
2001 with obvious carry-over effects in 2002 concerns
Portugal, Italy and Greece. In Portugal the 2001 deficit
of 4.1 % of GDP was much higher than expected. The
main reasons behind this upward revision for 2001

relate to new information on government sub-sectors

and amendments in order to be in line with Eurostat
Chapter2The economy of the euro area
33rules. For Italy it is mainly the application of the
decision by Eurostat on secu
ritisation that led to the
revision of the 2001 deficit. For Greece, the recent
review of the general government accounts by Eurostat,
implied a revision of the balances for 2000 and 2001 by
close to one percentage point of GDP.
Composition of government accounts
Total revenues as a percent of GDP are expected to
keep decreasing in the euro area over the forecast
period. From 46.7 % of GDP in 2001, revenues are

forecast to decline to 46.3 % of GDP in 2002 and to
decrease further to 46.2 % of GDP and 46.0 % of GDP

in 2003 and 2004 respectively. This is a generalised
movement across Member States. Total expenditure of
general government is expected to decline from 48.6 %

of GDP in 2002 to 47.8 % of GDP in 2004. This is due

to lower interest expenditure and lower unemployment-

related expenditure as the slowdown in economic
activity is not expected to cause a drastic increase in the
unemployment rate.
Over the forecast period, budget balances will benefit
from lower interest expenditure. Interest spending will

fall from 3.8 % of GDP in 2002 to 3.7 % of GDP in
both 2003 and 2004 in the euro area. Interest
expenditure contribute slightly positively to the change
in actual balances or have a neutral contribution during

the forecast years.
The debt situation
Several Member States see their debt to GDP ratio
increase with the consequence that for the euro area as a
whole the debt ratio is expected to increase, albeit by a

very small amount, for the first time in many years in

2002. This is mainly the result of increases in the debt
ratio in Germany (by 1.4 percentage point) bringing the
debt to GDP ratio to 60.9 %, in France (by 1.3

percentage point increase) but the ratio staying below

60 % of GDP, and in Portugal, where the increase

compared to 2001 is almost two percentage points,
bringing the ratio to 57.4 % of GDP.
For Greece the debt to GDP ratio increased in 2000 and
2001. In 2002 it is expected to resume declining, but at

105.8 % the Greek debt ratio remain among the highest

in the EU.  In Italy, the downward trend of the
debt/GDP ratio is expected to be temporarily reversed
in 2002. Although the deterioration is only marginal,

the situation is preoccupying in the light of the very

high level of the debt at 110.3 % of GDP in 2002.

ds.EconomicForecasts,Autumn200234Excessive deficits in Portugal and Germany, risks in
France and Italy
These countries entered EMU with relatively high
deficits, like most other countries in the euro area, but

failed to advance the consolidation towards the
medium-term objective of close-to-balance or in
surplus, in particular during periods of strong

expansion. They were not successful in reducing
rapidly their deficit, so as to allow for a safety margin

in cyclical downturns.  In consequence, deficits are very
high in 2002 and remain so in 2003.  Only Germany
and Portugal intend to make a structural effort of at

least 0.5 % of GDP in 2003 with a view to achieve

government accounts close to balance or in surplus in

2006 at the latest.
In 
Portugal
, the excessive deficit procedure was
launched in late July as previously undisclosed

information led to a large revision of the deficit for

2001 to 4.1% of GDP. In line with the calendar

imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, the decision

on the existence of an excessive deficit and
recommendation for its correction was adopted by the
Ecofin Council on 5 November. According to the

Commission Forecasts, the deficit is clearly reduced

from the previous year but could still be 3.4 % of GDP

in 2002. The economy is growing less than expected

and some measures have not been implemented or are
yielding less than planned.  In 2003, the deficit is
expected to be just below 3 % of GDP thanks to a

significant tightening of policy as not much help can

come from the economy which remains weak.
In 
Germany
, continued tax revenue shortfalls, some
expenditure overruns and the impact of floods mean
that this year’s deficit exceeds the 3% of GDP

threshold, according to the Commission Forecasts.  A

considerable effort is made to reduce the deficit in

2003, but on the basis of the measures clearly identified

in early November, the deficit remains at 3.1 % of GDP
compared to 3.8 % in 2002.
In 
France
, this year’s deficit is estimated at 2.7% of
GDP and is expected to increase further to 2.9 % in

2003. The cyclically adjusted deficit remains at 2.7 %

of GDP, according to the Commission calculations.

The safety margin for dealing with negative surprises
without breaching the 3% of GDP deficit threshold is
virtually absent.
In 
Italy, breaching the 3 % ceiling does not seem an
immediate risk, but the concern is the continuous

overruns leading in 2002 to a deficit of 2.4 % of GDP,
as well as the quality of budgetary adjustment to reduce
the deficit to 2.2 % of GDP in 2003.  Furthermore, the
reduction in the debt/GDP has come to halt, with the

debt ratio rising to 110.3% of GDP in 2002.
Strong deterioration in actual balances in Greece,
the United Kingdom, Austria, the Netherlands and
Ireland, but in the latter two countries the cyclically
adjusted deficit is reversed
With the exception of Greece, these countries had
actual balances in equilibrium or in surplus in 2001.  In
Greece, the deficit widens marginally, while the other
see their general government balances worsen

significantly in 2002 to between 0.8 % of GDP (the

Netherlands) and 1.8 % of GDP (Austria) in response to

the adverse cyclical circumstances.  Deficits remain

wide in 2003, but in the case of Ireland and the
Netherlands the cyclically adjusted deficit is improving
rapidly.
Luxembourg
 remains in surplus in 2002 but experiences
a deficit in 2003 (compared to a surplus of 6.1 % of

GDP in 2001). However, its debt to GDP ratio remains
very low.
Due to a recent review by Eurostat of general
government accounts in 
Greece
, the deficit has been
revised by close to one percentage point of GDP in
2000 and 2001, so that the actual balance was not
around equilibrium in 2001 as previously thought, but a
deficit (1.2 % of GDP) was recorded which marginally

widens to 1.3 % of GDP in 2002 and remains high in

the following year (1.1 % of GDP).  The cyclically

adjusted deficit continues to be significant at around
2 %.
In 
Ireland
, a fast deterioration is observed since 2000 in
the financial balance of the general government. From a

surplus of 4.4 % of GDP in 2000, a surplus of “only”

1.5 % of GDP was recorded in 2001, mainly as a result
of a significant undershooting of tax revenues. In 2002,
a deficit will be recorded for the first time in Ireland

since 1996, of 1 % of GDP. This is due to both the

effect of the cycle, as GDP growth decelerates, but also

to discretionary measures.  In 2003 and 2004, according

to the forecasts, deficits of about the same size in terms
of GDP as that of 2002 are expected.
In the 
Netherlands
, from a comfortable surplus of 2.2 %
of GDP in 2000, a 0.1 % surplus was recorded in 2001,
while in 2002 the forecast deficit amounts to 0.8 % of
GDP. This development reflects to a certain extent the

operation of automatic stabilisers in an environment of
Chapter2The economy of the euro area
35weakening economic activity. For the forecast years,
deficits of about 1 % of GDP are expected. Slow

economic growth and increases in the unemployment
rate will counterbalance efforts of the government,

through discretionary measures, such as tax increases
and reduction in government expenditure. The
cyclically adjusted deficit in the Netherlands is
expected to decrease substantially already in 2002

(down by ¾ of a percentage point), while in 2003 a

cyclically adjusted surplus is forecast.
Austria
, after running deficits in the late 1990’s and in
2000, managed to record a zero balance in 2001.
However, the expected deficit in 2002 could reach
1.8 % of GDP, explained by the economic slowdown

and increased government expenditure in order to repair
the damage caused by the summer floods. The situation
will only marginally improve in 2003.
In the 
United Kingdom
 from a 0.7 % of GDP surplus in
2001, a deficit of 1.1 % of GDP is expected in 2002 and

1.3 % of GDP in 2003. This deterioration in the public

finances for the UK is partially due to weaker revenues,

as a result of slower GDP growth, but also to important
discretionary expenditure for both current consumption
and investment.
EconomicForecasts,Autumn200236Box 2.2:How the cyclically adjusted general government balances are calculated
Following the ECOFIN Council meeting of 12 July, the
production function (PF) approach for the estimation of
output gaps
1, now constitutes the reference method when
assessing the stability and convergence programmes, starting

with the 2002 set of programmes.  During a "short" transition
period, during which the PF method will be periodically
reviewed and amended if necessary, the Hodrick-Prescott
(HP) filter will be used as a backup method. For Spain the

HP filter method will be used to assess the 2002 stability
programme. Also Germany and Austria expressed the view
that some time was needed before estimates using the
production function are considered as sufficiently reliable in

deriving policy assessments.
The output gaps are calculated according to both met
hodsand are presented in the Statistical Annex in tables 13 and 14,

according to the PF approach and the HP filter respectively.
Tables 40 and 41 of the Statistical Annex present the
cyclically adjusted balances (CAB) and primary balances
(CAPB) according to the production function approach. For

Spain, Germany and Austria an exception is made in Tables
40 and 41 and the cyclically adjusted balances for these three
countries are calculated on the basis of output gaps estimated
according to the HP filter.
If the PF or HP filter method is used the CAB and CAPB are
broadly the same for the euro area. For 2002, the CAB accor-
ding to the PF is higher than that calculated with the HP filter
by 0.2 of a point for the euro area. Positive difference of 0.2
means that the cyclically adjusted deficit according to the PF
method is lower than that calculated according to the HP
filter. For 2003 and 2004 the difference between the two

measures remains at 0.2 of a point. For the three countries
which have expressed objections or reservations in using the
PF approach the table shows that differences between the two
measures  are  negligible or  zero for  Austria  and  Germany.
1See for details: European Eonomy, Economic Paper N° 176,
“Production function approach to calculating growth and output
gaps” September 2002.
For Spain differences are slightly more significant. The
calculation based on the output gap obtained on the basis of
the production function is higher than that obtained through
the use of the HP filter by 0.4 in 2002, 0.5 in 2003 and 0.7 in
2004.
Relatively larger differences exist
 for some other individual
countries. For Ireland, Portugal, and the Netherlands the
difference is above half of a point, while for the remaining
countries the difference is less.

Several uncertainties surround the projections.  They
come both from inside and outside the EU and most of

them represent negative risks.  Over-pessimism is,

however, not justified as the level of uncertainty now

does not appear to be larger than in the months

following the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.
Furthermore, the fundamentals of the EU economy
remain sound.
Uncertainty in perspectiveIn a two year projection window (see chart) it can be
expected that under normal circumstances forecast

uncertainty declines over time, as the prediction horizon

shortens and more information becomes available.  A

departure from this path would indicate abnormal
uncertainty.

St. dev.
After the terrorist attack on 11 September uncertainty
increased considerably as measured by the standard
deviation around the mean GDP forecast for 2002 and

2003 provided by a representative sample of analysts.

Fiscal and monetary policies were eased, especially in

the US, and the quick resolve of the Afghan war
fostered a return of confidence.
Nevertheless, growth has been revised downward, but
forecast uncertainty surrounding the current year, which

is nearing its end, has been reduced to normal levels.

For 2003, uncertainty remains wide as illustrated by the

high standard deviation compared to the normal level

15 months before the end of the year to be forecast (see
chart). However, at this moment the uncertainty not
explained by the forecast horizon is not larger than in

the aftermath of 11 September.
External and domestic risks weigh on the outlook
Several risks are present, but two deserve particular
attention in the light of the disappointing resistance of

the EU economy.  First, oil prices are high but are

expected to decline when the war premium related to
military tensions around Iraq disappear.  If this does not
happen or, worse, oil prices increase even further, then

the inflation outlook is at risk and confidence remains

undermined with negative consequences for

consumption and investment.  Second, although equity
markets recovered somewhat in October, the collapse in
stock markets contributed to the deterioration of

balance sheets of corporate and financial institutions,

has lowered confidence and affected negatively

consumption through an increase in the savings rate.
The impact of these shocks is exacerbated by the
fragility of domestic demand and the lack of flexibility

of the EU economy.  Rigidities in labour, product and

financial markets accentuate downward pressures on

profit margins, upward pressures on wages and prices
due to insufficient competition and lead eventually to
subdued real income growth.
Fundamentals remain sound
The very short-term prospects are not bright, but the EU
economy remains free of major imbalances.  Despite

the recent deterioration of some sectoral accounts, the

balance sheets of financial and non-financial firms,
households and the government remain solid.  There is
also a surplus on the current account.  When

uncertainties dissipate and the shocks unwind, the

recovery should take hold, further supported by stability

oriented policies.
Chapter 3Member States
411.Belgium
Economic activity to gain momentum in 2003 and peak in 2004
The situation in 2002 and prospects
The recovery in economic activity in the first quarter of
2002 - real GDP growing by 0.6% as against the
previous quarter, which followed a negative real GDP
growth rate in the last quarter of 2001 - did not gain

momentum in the second quarter, according to available

data. Furthermore, recent statistical evidence and

survey indicators suggest that economic activity was

probably modest also in the third quarter. The synthetic

indicator of the National Bank of Belgium - which has

proved to be a good early indicator of turning points in

the business cycle with a lead of one quarter - stabilised

in October, after a deterioration in the three preceding

months, while the consumer confidence indicator

followed a similar movement. These developments

suggest that economic activity should remain weak in

2002, real GDP growth being estimated at 0.7%
compared with 0.8% in 2001.
The scenario of an acceleration in economic activity
assumed in the Spring forecasts is still in place, only

delayed by two to three quarters: economic recovery

would be progressive, gaining momentum in the first

quarters of 2003. The Belgian economy is expected to

expand by 2% in 2003 and by a more robust 2.8% in

2004, on the basis of stronger growth in international

trade, higher investment spending and sustained private

consumption. The observed delay in economic recovery

may be partly attributed to the lagged effects of weak

economic activity on employment: job creation, which

remained relatively strong in 2001 despite the economic

slowdown, could be zero in 2002; this development will

partly offset the effects on real GDP growth of the
expected recovery in external demand.
GDP components
After two years of very weak to negative growth rates,
both export and import volumes are expected to

increase by healthy rates in 2003, and further in 2004.

Exports should grow by about 5 to 6 percent each year
as global economic activity and international trade are
expected to improve and Belgium export markets to

grow accordingly. Imports should grow at similar rates

supported by increased consumption and investment

demand. Private consumption is expected to rise by

about 2% in 2003 and faster in 2004 supported by

improvement in employment and real personal incomes.

The saving rate should fall marginally in 2003 and

further in 2004 after having risen in 2002 due to

increased uncertainty about economic developments

and deteriorating labour markets. Private investment is

expected to rise by 2.5% in 2003 and by a higher rate in

2004 after an estimated negative growth rate this year;

improved economic prospects, notably concerning

export markets and, to some extent, corporate

profitability should sustain investment demand in the

coming two years. Investment in housing should also

rise from a low growth rate in 2001-02; public
investment should be higher in 2003 and in 2004, after
having declined in 2001 and risen very modestly this
year.
Labour market, cost and prices
Job creation is expected to come to a standstill in 2002
as the adverse effects of the prolonged economic

slowdown are being felt, with a lag, by the labour

market. Employment should rise again in 2003 although
at a rather modest rate and faster in 2004 supported by

robust economic growth. Unemployment should rise
somewhat this year and resume its falling trend from
2003.Inflation, measured by the HICP, is estimated at 1.7%
this year, clearly below the 2.3% rate recorded in 2001.

Lower import prices, notably oil prices, despite a rise in
recent months, and ad hoc factors - the abolition of the
radio and TV licence fee in Flanders and Brussels

Regions - is expected to contribute to this trend.

Inflation is expected to fall further in 2003 in a context

of still modest economic activity and contained

production costs and rise somewhat in 2004, remaining
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Belgium
42however below 2% as economic recovery is expected to
be more robust and labour market tighter.
Nominal wage increases are expected to remain
moderate, contributing to the deceleration in unit labour

costs in the coming two years. A new framework wage

agreement for the period 2003-2004, expected to be

concluded by the end of this year, will determine to a

large extent developments regarding wages and price

competitiveness. Concerns expressed about loss of

competitiveness by the Belgian economy vis-à-vis its

main trading partners in recent years should encourage

moderate wage agreements; still weak economic

activity and labour markets should support such a

tendency. Nominal wage increases may be somewhat

higher in 2004, but are expected to remain relatively

contained in view also of expected moderate wage
developments in Belgium’s main trading partners,
notably Germany.
Public financesDespite the deterioration in 
economic developments
compared with the projections of the 2002 budget, the
general government accounts should be practically in
balance in 2002, as a 0.1% of GDP deficit is projected

for this year. Strengthened control of primary

expenditures, including social security spending,

decided during the budgetary control exercise last

Spring and confirmed in June are contributing

positively to fiscal developments. A balanced general

government position is forecast for 2003, turning into a

surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2004. Public finance

projections assume that, broadly, the budgetary strategy

43of the 2001 update of the stability programme of
Belgium will be followed, taking also account of the

impact of the cycle; this implies, in particular, sizeable

primary surpluses of the order of 6% in 2002, and

somewhat lower in 2003 and 2004, realised mainly

through control of primary expenditures. The decline in

interest payments as percent of GDP resulting from the

decline in the debt ratio, will contribute to the projected

budgetary outcome. According to the forecast, the

government revenue to GDP
 ratio is expected to decline
in 2002 and in 2003 and rise somewhat in 2004, while

the expenditure ratio is projected to decline by
0.6 percentage point in the three years to 2004. The

cyclically adjusted primary surplus is expected to
remain slightly above 6% of GDP in 2003, after an

estimated 6.4% in 2002 and 6.2% in 2001, suggesting a
broadly  neutral fiscal  stance,  and  decline  to  5.6 % of
GDP in 2004.
The 2003 draft budget confirmed the continuation of
the tax reform - the main component of which is a

reduction in the personal income tax - decided in 2001

and planned to be implemented over the period

2002-2006. The budget, based on an assumption of a

2.1% real GDP growth, is targeting a balance in the

general government accounts for 2003. A corporate tax

reform announced last March will be implemented from
2003 and is assumed to be broadly budgetary-neutral.
The government debt ratio should continue its falling
trend over the period of the forecast and decline by

3 percentage points of GDP in 2002 and by a further

8.8 points over the next two years to 96.8% of GDP in

Growth sustained by domestic demand
The economy in 2002
After the deceleration of GDP in 2001 to growth at just
1.0%, the economy picked up again in the first half of
2002. The second quarter proved particularly strong

when the quarter on quarter GDP growth rate was 1.1%.

So far in 2002 growth has been driven solely by
domestic demand. The expected acceleration in private
consumption finally seems to have set in, primarily

driven by large increases in car purchases by

households, but retail sales have also increased at

stronger rates. Investment is still growing robustly, but

the composition is somewhat surprising as especially

equipment investment has continued to rise despite the

slowdown in economic growth in the second half of

2001, whereas residential investment continues to
decrease despite the high level of house prices.
Exports have so far held up well despite the
international slowdown and exports of goods grew by
3.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2002. The

resilience of Danish exports is most likely linked to the

composition of goods exported, as their high content of

agricultural and pharmaceutical products tends to

shelter the economy against external cyclical

developments. This results in a tendency for Danish

export to gain market shares in international slowdowns

and lose market shares in upturns. Imports have

increased slightly faster than exports resulting in a

small negative contribution from net exports in the first
half of 2002.
Inflation fell in the first half of the year, but has
increased again in recent months and is now back at the
same level as in the beginning of the year.
Prospects
Indicators released for the third quarter so far point to a
less buoyant development than in the second quarter.
Both industry production and orders are falling and the

increase in car sales has been slowing down. Therefore

real GDP is expected to increase more slowly during

the second half of 2002, resulting in an overall growth
rate for the year of 1.7%. In 2003 real GDP is expected
to grow by 2.1% increasing to 2.4% in 2004. In both

years domestic demand is again expected to be driving

growth, as net exports are expected to have a small
negative impact.
Currently the Danish economy seems well balanced.
The private sector’s net borrowing requirement is close
to zero, and the public sector is running large surpluses.

However, the labour market is expected to be very tight

in all three years and especially in 2004 risks of

overheating may emerge. Public finances are expected

to remain sound and show healthy surpluses over the
forecast horizon.
GDP components
The expectation of a weaker second half in 2002 and
increasing growth rates again during 2003 is reflected
in all components of GDP. Private consumption should

become weaker in the second half of 2002 as car sales

and retail sales are showing signs of moderating.
However, for the three forecast years to 2004, growth
rates of above 2% every year are expected in line with

increases in real disposable incomes. The weaker

outlook for production in the third quarter and the

general uncertainty induced by the recent stock market

fall is foreseen to bring the current growth in fixed

investment to a halt. An acceleration is set to happen in
the course of 2003, especially as housing investment is
expected to increase from the current low level. This

increase is partly policy-induced as different measures
have been taken to increase housing investments.
Exports of goods are predicted to grow more slowly
than external demand in coming years as the persistent
high wage increases and the strong 
krone 
implies loss
of competitiveness. Furthermore, export growth might

also be limited by capacity constraints, especially in

2004. Imports of goods are expected to be stronger than
a “normal” relationship to final demand would predict
as investment, which is one of the main growth

components in all three years, tends to have a high
Chapter3Member States, Denmark
45import content. However, the current account is
expected to show surpluses of  2% of GDP or above
every year.
Costs and prices
HICP increases should slow in 2003 as the effects of
slow increases in import prices and falling oil prices
pass through and the tax freeze is fully implemented.

Furthermore, the budget bill for 2003 includes a
lowering of excise duties by October 1, 2003.
However, the larger part of the effect of the lower
excise duties will first be visible in 2004, where it will
help curb the tendency for rising inflation, as the effect

of the small increases in import prices disappear. All

through the forecast period inflation is sustained by

relative high increases in prices of services as a result of

high wage increases. This leaves it difficult currently to
get inflation permanently below 2%.
Labour market
The labour market has continued to remain tight despite
the slowdown in economic growth last year.
Unemployment has been largely unchanged and wage

increases are still lingering around 4%. The lack of

easing on the labour market in the downturn resulted in

a fall in productivity rates last year, as some labour

hoarding took place. This year productivity rates are

expected to return to more normal levels, thereby

implying only a limited increase in employment despite

the larger growth rate. Unemployment is expected to

decline slightly over the next two years and thereby

continue to remain close to the estimated structural

level. Employment creation is expected to pick up again
next year and grow by a fairly unchanged rate in 2004.
Annual wage increases are set to remain high and even
rise in 2004 as no extra reductions in hours worked

The general government balance showed a surplus of
2.8% of GDP in 2001 (excluding UMTS of 0.2% of
GDP). This year it is expected to decrease to 2.0% of

GDP primarily as a result of a pension scheme, “the

special pension contribution”, being changed from a

public pension scheme to a private scheme as the
redistributive   effects   in    the   pension   scheme    are
eliminated and declining corporate tax revenues from
the extraordinary high level in 2001
A surplus of 2.0% is also expected in 2003 where
increased revenues as a result of higher GDP growth is
offset by lower corporate taxes. In 2004, the surplus is

expected to increase to 2.5% as the pension yield tax

probably will start generating revenues again after three

years of hardly any revenue due to the size of the stock
market fall.

Crawling along
The economy in 2002
After contracting in the second half of 2001, activity
picked up again in the first half of 2002, rising in both
Q1 and Q2 at a quarterly rate of 0.3%. Nevertheless,

economic performance remained disappointing, as it

failed to set the stage for the expected upturn in the
second half of 2002. Business expectations, which rose
strongly in spring, have started to fall again.
Growth was exclusively due to decelerating inventory
depletion and a rising foreign contribution. The latter
was, however, not so much the result of rising exports
than of falling imports, which reflected a decline in

final domestic demand by about ½% in each quarter. In

particular, equipment investment continued to fall

strongly for the seventh quarter in a row, adding to the

long-lasting drag from construction activity. Private

consumption also fell, while public consumption rose
only slightly.
The crawling pace of the economy can be expected to
continue during the second half of 2002 and into early
2003. No GDP component will provide major stimulus.

However, there are tentative signs that the negative

domestic trends are bottoming out. Private

consumption, which fell noticeably in the first quarter

of the year, has started to pick up moderately. Despite

capacity utilisation still being relatively low, slightly

rising order volumes suggest a modest recovery also in

equipment investment, which is 15% below its last

peak. Reconstruction activities in the aftermath of the

Summer floods should give a temporary boost to the

economy around the end of the year, as buildings,

productive equipment, and household durables are
replaced.A further small growth impulse is likely to come from a
slowdown in de-stocking. By contrast, no net impulse is
expected from foreign trade, as the sharp decline in
imports is likely to start reverting.
With an estimated overall growth rate of barely 0.4%
for 2002, unemployment has been on the rise, reaching
a seasonally adjusted 4.1 million in the third quarter,
which is unlikely to fall rapidly. High unemployment

continues to weigh on consumer spending and public
finances.
On the positive side, the 2002 wage round was clearly
not as disruptive as might have been feared, leading to
only moderate effective wage increases. Due to a

substantial negative wage drift, nominal tariff wage

rises by over 3% were actually accompanied by an

economy-wide slowdown in effective wage increases in

the first half of the year to 1.5%. Therefore, and due to

falling import prices and subdued growth, inflation in

Germany is very low. Consumer prices in October were

only 1.2% above the level of a year ago, suggesting an

inflation rate of 1.4% for the whole of 2002. Clearly,

earlier fears of euro-induced price hikes have proved

largely unwarranted but probably contributed to lower
growth as a result of consumers’ spending restraint.
Prospects
While sputtering on into early 2003, activity is expected
to speed up moderately around the middle of the year,

leading to an estimated annual GDP growth around

1.4%. In the first quarter of the year, reconstruction in

the flood areas is likely to play a role, especially for the

construction sector. A subsequent decline in building

activity should be partially compensated by a slight

acceleration in equipment investment. Furthermore,

consumer spending is likely to pick up, as the savings

rate reverts to a lower level following an increase in

both 2001 and 2002. High unemployment and the

substantial further fall in stock market values will,
however, dampen consumption growth somewhat.
The slight acceleration in growth by the middle of 2003
is likely to be accompanied by a modest increase in
effective wages. Despite only small gains in labour

productivity, international competitiveness will thus be

broadly maintained. Nevertheless, the external

contribution will not provide a substantial growth

impulse, because the rise in domestic demand is likely
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Germany
48to be accompanied by higher imports, thereby offsetting
the import decline in 2002. Overall, expected GDP

growth in 2003 is therefore mostly driven by rising final

domestic demand. A small positive impact is also likely

to come from stocks, as inventory depletion comes to
an end.
Growth in 2004 is expected to reach 2.3%, thereby
reducing the output gap by two thirds. With the trends
identified for 2003 continuing, domestic demand will

be the main driver of growth. However, the higher

figures for 2004 are largely due to a calendar effect

rather than to an acceleration in the underlying forces of

growth. Due to an extra calendar day (29 February) and

because of an additional holiday falling on a weekend,

raw GDP figures for 2004 will be around 0.6% higher
than calendar-adjusted figures.
Employment, costs and prices
As a result of slow overall growth unemployment is
unlikely to decline substantially and is expected to
remain above 4 million in 2003 and to fall only slightly
in 2004. Consumer price inflation in 2003 is likely to

remain steady compared with 2002, as low labour cost

pressures and falling import prices balance out with

increases in indirect taxes and a temporary rise in oil

prices. As these latter two effects subside, inflation is
likely to moderate gradually in 2004.
Public finances
Following a revised 2001 outcome of 2.8% of GDP, the
general government deficit is projected to reach 3.8% of
GDP in the current year. This rise is mostly due to a

clear shortfall in tax revenues compared with the

official May tax estimate, and a widening gap in social
security finances. Not surprisingly, the debt ratio is also
forecast to breach the Treaty’s reference value by rising
above 60% of GDP.
The deficit forecast for 2003 is based on the following

Chapter3            Member States, Germany
49assumptions: contribution rates to the pension system
are likely to rise from 19.1% of gross income in 2002 to

19.5% in 2003; no rise in contribution rates to health

insurance is assumed. Out of the consolidation package

agreed upon by the coalition partners in October, an

overall volume of around 0.2 percentage points of GDP

has been incorporated. With many specific measures

only to be decided after the forecast’s cut-off date, the

‘no-policy-change’ assumption implies that they could

not be taken into account. On the other hand, the 2003

forecast assumes that some savings will become

effective in the health sector.  If all policy decisions

included in the coalition agreement are translated in

specific policy measures and if growth in 2003 reaches

at least 1.4%, the deficit would fall below 3% of GDP
next year.
Furthermore, additional public investment on account
of the flood damages was incorporated, as was the

postponement of the next step of tax reform from 2003

to 2004. On the basis of these assumptions, the 2003

general government deficit would reach 3.1% of GDP,

with the debt level rising above 61% of GDP.
In 2004, accelerating growth conducive to employment
creation should make for a further fall in the deficit, in

spite of the implementation of the next step of income

tax reform.  Part of the improvement is due to

additional savings out of the consolidation programme

presented in October 2002.  The debt ratio, however,

would stay above the Treaty’s reference value.

Economic growth is easing but activity continues at a strong pace
The economy in 2002
Despite a deceleration due to weak export markets, real
GDP still rose at a strong pace in 2002, exceeding the
EU and the euro area average; activity was mainly

supported by domestic demand. Lower interest rates

and consumer credit expansion, combined with lower
tax uncertainty, sustained private consumption. On the
other hand, increased financial flows from the EU

Structural Funds and the preparation for the Olympic

Games of 2004 boosted investment, which increased

much faster than real GDP. On the external side, the

slowdown in world demand reduced the rate of increase

in exports, while imports recovered under the impulse

of domestic demand; as a result, the external balance
made a negative contribution to real GDP growth.
The situation in the labour market improved but at a
slow pace. Total employment is estimated to have risen
by 0.3% in 2002. On the other hand, the unemployment

rate fell below 10% in the first half of 2002 but should

still remain at a high level. A two-year wage agreement

in the private sector, signed on 15 April 2002, provides

for an increase in the minimum wage in two steps: 3.6%

on 1 January 2002 (including the adjustment for

inflation in 2001 equal to 1.1%) and 1.8% on 1 July

2002. For 2003, the agreement provides for a 3.9%

increase in the minimum wage on 1 January 2003. On

average, the benchmark wage will increase by 5.4% in

2002 and 4.8% in 2003. An adjustment for inflation

exceeding 3.3% in 2002 and not exceeding 1% will be
incorporated on 1 January 2003.
Consumer price inflation accelerated in the first months
of 2002, as a result of temporary shocks like high food
prices due to bad weather. Its rate of increase has been

stabilising since the Summer months but remains high

and above the EU and the euro zone average. In

addition, underlying inflation that remained below the
headline rate in the first quarter moved above this rate
in the following months, implying the persistence of

some inflationary pressures. In 2002, consumer
inflation should accelerate further for a second
consecutive year.
Prospects in 2003 and 2004
Economic activity prospects continue to be good and
will improve in line with external recovery in 2003.
Real GDP growth is expected to continue to rise above

potential, averaging around 4% in 2003. Nonetheless, a

deceleration in investment in the second half of 2004

should result in a somewhat slower GDP growth in
2004, at around 3.7% on average.
Consumer spending is expected to remain sustained and
might also accelerate as a result of the 2002 tax reform
which should increase disposable income. Activity in

the construction sector will be buoyant as a number of

infrastructure plans need to be finished before the

Olympic Games of 2004, but this factor will cease to

exert a positive effect on GDP growth as from mid-

2004. Nonetheless, public investment growth,

supported by large inflows from EU Structural Funds

until 2006, and lower interest rates will assist private

investment in the period after the end of the Olympic
Games. In addition, strong tourist flows are expected

for the year of the Olympic Games, implying that at the
end of the forecasting period, the negative contribution

of the external balance to real output growth should be
much lower than in previous years.
Price developments are influenced by a number of
factors that point to opposite directions. Taking into
account the underlying assumptions for world primary

commodities price increases, oil prices and the

exchange rate of the euro, inflation should decelerate in
coming quarters. On the domestic side, some
acceleration in wages should be implied from the

application of the compensation clause for the higher

than expected inflation rate in 2001; nonetheless, the

content of the April agreement on wage increases in the

private sector should imply that cost-pressures might be

resumed as from 2004 as there is no compensation for

inflation exceeding a specific rate in 2003. Nonetheless,
Chapter3Member States, Greece
51despite some weakening, the economy is expected to
continue growing above potential. On the basis of the

above, there may be a deceleration in the rate of

inflation until 2004 but consumer price increases are
forecast to average above 3% in 2003 and 2004.
Public finances
A significant methodological revision in the statistical
treatment of a number of operations took place in the
course of 2002, following the recommendations of

Eurostat. As a result, in 2001, the general government

accounts remained in deficit (at 1.2% of GDP from
1.8% of GDP in 2000) as compared with a surplus of
0.1% of GDP reported previously. However, excluding

non-budgeted receipts from the sale of mobile phone

licences (UMTS) which amounted to 0.5% of GDP, in

2001, the government accounts should post a 1.7% of

GDP deficit. The debt ratio increased also following the
recent revisions and reached 107% of GDP in 2001
from 99.7% of GDP estimated previously.
The State budget for 2002 and the 2001 updated
stability programme, based on the statistical methods
used before the recent revision, targeted a deficit for the

State Budget consistent with a surplus of 0.8% of GDP

for the general government. Underlying further

improvement in the budgetary position, there was the

continuing reduction in debt servicing costs which
follows the decline in interest rates and in the debt ratio.
After reaching 5.1% of GDP in 2001 (or 4.6% of GDP
when excluding receipts from UMTS licenses), the
primary surplus of the general government remained at
a high level in 2002 (at 4.4% of GDP). The general
government debt ratio which increased in 2000 and

EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Greece
52For 2003, the 2001 update of the stability programme
projected a surplus of 1% of GDP. In the draft State
budget for 2003, presented in early October 2002, the

projected surplus is revised downwards, to 0.5% of

GDP. This is mostly attributed to the estimated

budgetary outcome for 2002 but also to the impact of

the tax reform introduced in 2002. Following the recent

methodological changes, the improvement in the

budgetary position of the general government would be
reflected in a lower deficit rather than a higher surplus.
The budgetary strategy is based on further decline in the
interest burden for the general government, while the
projected fall in current primary expenditure should

partly compensate the impact of the tax package. The
primary surplus of the general government is projected
to decline gradually but to remain at a high level.

However, the projected cut in primary spending may be

difficult to implement given that the main components

of current spending are highly inelastic (mostly, wages

and grants). Thus, it is likely that the general
government accounts will remain in deficit of around
1.0% of GDP, in 2003 and 2004, under unchanged

policies. Furthermore, the primary balance should

continue to decline until the end of the forecasting

period. The debt ratio is expected to be put on a

downward trend, benefiting from the growth dividend,
and to fall below 100% of GDP at the end of 2004.

Economy to recover force in 2004
ActivityIn 2001 GDP decelerated significantly, recording 2.7%
growth for the whole year, in sharp contrast to 4.2%

growth in 2000, mainly due to weaker final domestic

demand. In 2002 a deceleration has continued, more

marked than foreseen in the spring, with estimated

growth of 1.9%. Weaker than expected private

consumption and investment have been the main

elements of such moderation. While exports and

imports are expected still to gain some momentum, the
external sector contribution to GDP growth should be
neutral for the whole year. With a better economic

climate and improved consumers’ confidence, an

upward profile is expected in 2003, with GDP growth

of 2.6%, rising in 2004 to around that of estimated

potential; the output gap, relative to trend, should be

close to zero throughout the forecast period.
GDP components
The slower growth experienced in 2001 was mainly due
to significant reductions in private consumption and
investment growth rates. Low growth of gross fixed

capital formation can mostly be attributed to investment

in equipment due to worsened business expectations.

On the external side, the moderate growth of exports

and imports contrasts with rises over 10% in 2000,

mirroring the downward trend observed in world
demand.
For 2002 as a whole deceleration is expected to
continue as a result of further moderation of the main

domestic demand components. Private consumption is

expected to slow as a consequence of moderation in

employment and the non-indexation of income tax
brackets, which will give rise a deceleration in gross
disposable income. The forecast shows a more

optimistic picture for 2003. Private consumption is

expected to gain some strength during the first half of

the year due to better economic prospects and

increasing employment growth, together with the
positive effects on disposable income stemming from
reform of the personal income tax. The latter is also

expected to lead to a significant rise in the household

saving rate. This trend is envisaged to continue in 2004,

with private consumption growing by around 3%.
Investment is expected to moderate further in 2002, due
to a sharp fall in equipment investment and a

moderation in construction. With business prospects

envisaged to improve in 2003, equipment investment

should gain force. On the other hand, given the strength
shown by construction in recent years and the brisk
increase in housing prices, a further moderation of this

component is expected, although it will not totally

offset the improvement in equipment behaviour. All in

all, gross fixed capital formation should accelerate in

2003. This trend should consolidate in 2004, with both
equipment and construction gaining momentum.
Exports and imports are expected to rise in the second
half of 2002, although still recording negative growth

rates in the year as a whole. Along with the recovery of

world demand, exports will accelerate in 2003. Imports

are also expected to increase substantially, in line with

the envisaged recovery of final demand. On balance the

contribution of the extern
al side to GDP growth is
expected to be neutral in 2002 and 2003, turning

slightly negative in 2004.
Labour market
The deceleration of activity has moderated employment

creation. Employment growth is expected to slow to

below 2% in 2002 but to rise towards 2½% by the end

of the forecast period. Despite less buoyant

employment growth, the increase in unemployment in

2002 is expected to be limited and short-lived, with the

average rate for the year half a point above that of 2001,

with the rate falling further in 2003 and 2004 to around

10% (Eurostat definition) by the end of the period. The

activity rate is expected to rise by two percentage points

over the period.
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Spain
54The increase in employee compensation per full-time
equivalent in 2002 is expected to accelerate slightly

despite a weaker labour market than in 2001, mainly

due to the effect of indexation clauses stemming from

higher than expected inflation. However, unit labour

costs are expected to remain unchanged due to a slight

increase in labour productivity, yielding a decline in re
al terms that would extend the trend observed in
previous years. Despite the recovery of employment

growth in 2003, a slight moderation of compensation

per employee in line with a deceleration in price

developments and improved productivity should

produce a further deceleration in unit labour costs; real

unit labour costs should continue to decline. These

trends are expected to remain in 2004, with

compensation per employee and unit labour costs

moderating further.
PricesThe HICP and national CPI inflation rates averaged

2.8% and 3.6% in 2001, respectively, while core HICP

inflation averaged 2.6% (3.5% for national CPI).

Despite the relatively moderate behaviour of wages in

2002, price developments have been worse than

expected, mainly due to unprocessed food and services.

While lower energy prices in the first half of the year

contributed to a fall in headline inflation rates, core
inflation has remained high. For 2002 as a whole the
HICP and CPI inflation rates are expected to exceed

3½% before easing to below 3% and 2½% in 2003 and

2004, respectively, provided wage moderation

continues. Core inflation is expected to show little

change in 2002 compared with 2001, though should

moderate in 2003 and 2004.

Chapter3Member States, Spain
55External sector
The current account deficit fell to 2.9% of GDP in
2001; growth of merchandise trade slumped. A

recovery of exports of goods is expected to begin in the

second half of 2002 as a result of somewhat stronger

world demand, along with a recovery of imports. The

upward trend is expected to continue in 2003 and 2004

for both exports and imports due to a better

international climate and stronger domestic activity.

The current account deficit is foreseen to narrow further

to below 2% as a result of gains in the terms of trade
and a growing services surplus in both 2003 and 2004.
Public finances
Despite the economic slowdown in 2002, the relatively
good behaviour of tax revenues, particularly the
corporate income tax, and the moderation of public

consumption have contributed to alleviate pressure on

the budget. Consequently, the general government

budget is foreseen to be in balance after a deficit of

0.1% of GDP in 2001. In 2003 the envisaged reform of

the personal income tax is expected to moderate tax

revenues. The forecast of a less optimistic framework

than that envisaged by the authorities in the budget

leads to a small deficit of 0.3% of GDP. Assuming no

policy changes, the budget is forecast to record a

marginal surplus in 2004, in line with the scenario

foreseen in the stability programme. The debt-to-GDP

ratio is expected to continue below 60% and on a

declining path throughout the forecast period.

Sustained domestic demand to remain the backbone of growth
The economy in the first half of 2002
Economic activity accelerated in the first half of 2002,
with real GDP growing at an annualised pace of 2%,

after stagnation observed in the second half of 2001.

The recovery was driven in the first few months of the

year by strong acceleration in exports, which supported

the improvement in industrialists’ output expectations.

As a consequence, the rapid fall in the stock-to-GDP

ratio, which had started twelve months earlier, came

gradually to an end. At the same time, public

consumption grew very rapidly and private

consumption, although decelerating, continued to
support real GDP growth.
This recovery was not strong enough to reverse the
deceleration in employment creation, already observed

since the Spring 2001. Thus, the unemployment rate

continued increasing and reached 9.0% of the labour

force in August. Private investment remained also very

sluggish, companies waiting for confirmation of
recovery in demand prospects before increasing
productive capacities in a context of low profitability.
Current situation and prospects
Several elements currently point to weaker real GDP
growth in the second half of 2002. Indeed, business

survey indices have been falling since April in most

sectors. In manufacturing, output expectations, a key

variable of the survey, stopped improving in May,

before starting to decrease to a level below long-term

average. This deterioration heralds a deceleration, or

even a decrease, in industrial production in the second

part of 2002. In the service sector, the latest business

surveys have shown relatively erratic fluctuations with

the main variables remaining close to the long-term

average. On the consumer side, fears of unemployment

have continued increasing and confidence has
deteriorated.From the beginning of 2003, the recovery in the world
economy is expected to trigger an acceleration in export
markets. This movement, together with still favourable

monetary conditions and a decline in inflation, should

favour a gradual rebound in economic activity. Real

GDP growth should resume to a rate close to potential

in the first half of 2003, before further accelerating in
the second part of next year and in 2004.
GDP components
The acceleration in export volumes from the beginning
of 2003 should support an upturn in demand
expectations, and create the conditions for a re-stocking
phase. After eighteen months of stagnation, productive

investment should gradually accelerate in the second

half of 2003, when the upgrading of demand prospects

are confirmed and capacity utilisation recovers. The

continued moderation in the cost of borrowing should
also contribute to the recovery in private investment.
Private consumption is expected to remain relatively
dynamic, although less than observed in the last three

years. Deceleration in real gross disposable income,

mainly due to the slowdown in employment creation

and to lower tax cuts, explains the relative moderation
in private consumption growth in 2003.
Labour market, costs and prices
The deterioration in economic conditions impacted on
the labour market in 2002: employment growth was
virtually nil in the second quarter, and the situation is
not expected to improve significantly before Summer

2003. The slowdown in employment growth also

reflects the gradual fading of the impact of active labour

market policies, the end of the reduction in working

time, and the necessity for companies to restore margins
after the strong diminution of the last two years. In this
context, the increase in the unemployment rate, which

began in May 2001 after three years of decline, should

continue until the re-acceleration in economic activity
induces a rebound in employment creation.
Chapter3Member States, France
-57Wage moderation is expected to continue in 2003 and
2004, even if a slight acceleration by the end of the
forecast period cannot be excluded. Indeed, in 2003 the

effects of the harmonisation of the different levels of

the minimum wage created by the working time

reduction laws will be counter-balanced by a cyclical

deceleration in wages. In a context of accelerating

apparent labour productivity, growth in unit labour
costs is projected to be moderate in 2003 and 2004,
especially compared to the relatively dynamic
increment observed in 2001 and 2002.
Against this background, underlying inflationary
pressures should remain limited. Moderation in prices

will also reflect the consequences of the appreciation of

the euro and the normalisation of energy and food

prices. After a temporary acceleration in the last few

months of 2002, the year-on-year rate of inflation

should decrease gradually during 2003. In line with
economic recovery, inflation is projected to
re-accelerate moderately in the course of 2004,
although remaining below 2%.
Public finances
In 2002 public finances deteriorated markedly. The
general government deficit is now forecast to reach
2.7% of GDP this year. This is to be compared to the
1.4% of GDP planned by the French authorities in the

Finance Law for 2002. The Commission forecast

assumes a tight control in public expenditures in the

second part of the year. The slippage in the 2002 deficit

is due to an overrun in expenditures, worth 0.6-

0.7 percentage point of GDP, and to a shortfall in

revenues reflecting unfavourable economic
developments.
The French authorities project a stabilisation in the
general government deficit in 2003 at the same level as

EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002France58in 2002, i.e. 2.6% of GDP according to the draft budget
for 2003, under the assumption of an acceleration in

real GDP growth to 2.5% in 2003. These plans reflect

the fact that the margins created by a slower-than-GDP

growth in expenditures (+1.5% in real terms) just

compensate the implementation of tax cuts (worth
0.2 percentage point of GDP).
A general government deficit of 2.9% of GDP is
projected for 2003. This projection makes the crucial

assumption that real expenditures in 2003 will be in line

with the target set in the draft budget bill for 2003,

except for unemployment benefits and for a slight

slippage in health expenditures. The largest part of the

difference with the official forecast stems from the

impact of lower growth on budgetary variables.
In 2004, the general government deficit is projected to
decrease to 2.5% of GDP. The crucial assumption

concerns real government expenditures, which are

projected to increase by 2% in real terms by the

Commission. This is to be compared with an

expenditure increase by 1.4% for 2004 in the multi-

annual budgetary projection associated with the 2003

budget. The embodied slippage in expenditures is

slightly lower than the average slippage observed since

the introduction of multi-annual plans exist. This
forecast takes into account the slowdown in the
dynamic of public payrolls planned for 2003 and the

full impact of measures on health expenditures. Should

developments on the spending side and tax cuts be in

line with the multi-annual programme, the 2004 general

government deficit could be 0.2 percentage point of
GDP lower than currently forecast by the Commission.

A sharp slowdown followed by recovery to sustainable growth
Output in 2001-2002
Irish real GDP growth fell to 5.7% in 2001, after 9.8%
on average over the period 1996-2000. While still
impressive by EU standards, Ireland experienced a
sharp downturn under the combined influence of

(labour) supply constraints and several exogenous

shocks (international slowdown, ICT retrenchment and

animal diseases): year-on-year growth declined from

12.3% in the first to 0.1% in the final quarter. For 2002,
preliminary quarterly national accounts indicate a year-
on-year expansion of 2.9% in the first quarter.

Industrial production grew 8.8% on the year in the first

eight months, compared to 10.2% for year 2001, but

this reflects a very strong performance of the chemicals

sector (+31.7%); excluding chemicals, industrial output

fell by 7.6%. For 2002 as a whole, real GDP growth of

just above 3% is expected, even more muted than the
previous year.
Demand components in 2002
As in earlier years, nominal disposable incomes are
being boosted by high growth in earnings per capita,

significant direct tax relief, a rise in employment and

very low to negative real interest rates. Nonetheless,

continuing high inflation and poor confidence levels

from job losses are depressing private spending growth,

especially when compared with the record levels of

1999-2000. Excluding car sales, retail sales volume in

the first eight months was 2.9% higher than in the same

period of 2001. Public consumption is also supporting

domestic demand, albeit on a reduced scale compared

with the previous year.
Housing completions, which achieved another record in
2001, benefited from budget changes and look set to

expand firmly; in the first six months of 2002,
completions rose 5.2% on the year. Growth in other
construction is forecast to be more subdued, partly

because the roll-out of the National Development Plan

is affected by high construction sector inflation.

Regarding investment in equipment, nominal imports of

producer capital goods for the first six months (n.s.a.)

were up 28% on the preceding half-year, but fell 11%

on the year. In line with this, the assumed gradual

recovery in overall equipment investment results in

negative annual growth, albeit less dramatically so than

in 2001.
Merchandise exports were very strong in the beginning
of the year mainly due to an impressive performance of

the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. In the first

seven months, exports expanded 2.2% in volume on the

year and, for 2002 as a whole, are expected to post very

modest growth by recent Irish standards. Merchandise

imports, which stagnated in 2001, rose by 2.6% in
volume in the first seven months and are forecast to
maintain positive growth, in line with the strengthening

of economic activity. Trade in services is forecast to be

much more buoyant, as was the case in 2001.
Growth in 2003-2004
As one of the most open economies of the EU, Ireland

is expected to benefit significantly from the
international pick-up in activity in 2003, leading to a
recovery of exports and investment. Reflecting

improved economic conditions, a modest fall in the

savings rate after two consecutive years of rises should

also support private consumption. While activity will

strengthen as the year progresses, 2003 will be another
year of below potential growth. For 2004, however, the
projections assume growth to rise towards that

commonly thought to be sustainable in the medium

term, of above 5%.
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Ireland
60Labour market
The steady fall in unemployment since 1996, when the
rat e was some 12%, finally came to a halt in early
2001, having reached a very low rate of below 4%.
Since then, unemployment has displayed a moderate

upward trend. Over the first nine months of 2002, the
rate averaged 4.4%. The economic slowdown is
expected to lead to employment growth below labour

force growth in both 2002 and 2003, entailing a rise in
unemployment. However, in 2004, this situation should
be reversed, so that unemployment starts to fall again,

to just under 5%. This forecast assumes falling net

immigration and slowing population growth.
Wage developments
Wage pressures have intensified in recent years in
response to high(er than expected) inflation and labour
shortages in a situation of virtually full employment. As

a result, compensation per capita gained 9.2% in 2001

after 8.8% in 2000. The available evidence for 2002
suggests a delayed response to the economic downturn:
in the first six months, hourly industrial earnings rose

8.2% on the year, down from 10.3% in the preceding

half-year. While the forecast assumes a gradual easing

to 2004, growth in compensation per capita is expected

to remain relatively high because of a continued tight

labour market and sticky inflation expectations.

Regarding 2002, the forecast thus assumes a

61continuation of significant drift above the pay terms of
the current national agreement, which for the year

amounted to a rise in basic pay of 4.8% and 5.6% in the

private and public sector respectively and a one-off

lump-sum of 1% of basic pay. With the current

agreement expiring at the end of the year, negotiations

for a possible successor started at the end of October
2002.Inflation
The budget for 2002 introduced a package of indirect
tax rate hikes which, accordi
ng to the Irish authorities,
added almost 1 percentage point to the 2002 inflation

rate (CPI measure). This, together with far higher rates

of underlying inflation than in 2001, has produced a

marked rise in inflation in spite of the economic

slowdown. Compared to 4.0% in year 2001, the HICP

rate averaged 4.8% over the first nine months of 2002

and a similar rate is expected for the year as a whole. In

2003 and 2004, inflation should fall in response to

lower earnings growth and easing excess demand

pressures, leading to a narrowing differential with the
euro area average.
Public finances
General government data for 2001 are not yet fully
available and have been partly estimated. In 2002, as in
2001,   the   implementation   of   the   budget  has  been
marked by a significant tax undershoot. In the first ten
months, taxes grew just 2.3% on the year, compared to
a budget target of 8.6%. Furthermore, discretionary

("voted") spending rose 19.6%, compared to a budgeted

rise of 14.4% for the year as a whole. The general

government balance is forecast to post a deficit (the first

since 1996) of some 1% of GDP, far below the budget-

day target of a surplus of 0.4% of GDP (adjusted for the

exclusion of a one-off transfer from the Central Bank

and including UMTS receipts). As the budget for 2003

will be unveiled only on 4 December, the forecasts for

2003-2004 are pre-budget. Given the non-indexed tax

and social benefits system, the no-policy change

assumption is made operational by freezing average tax

rates and adjusting social transfer payments by the

forecast CPI inflation rate (with a top-up of 1

percentage point). The projections take account of the

cut in the corporation tax rate to 12.5% from 1 January

2003 and, for expenditure, envisage further

implementation of the National Development Plan.

However, no contingency provisions are included and

no allocation has been made for “benchmarking” (pay
increases for public sector workers recommended in
July 2002), because of uncertainties regarding its

degree and timing of implementation (the Irish

authorities estimate that full implementation would cost

close to 1% of GDP). On these assumptions, the general

government balance remains in deficit, while the value

of general government debt broadly stabilises at around
35% of nominal GDP over the forecast horizon.

Weak domestic demand weighs on the pace of economic recovery
Growth
In 2002 real GDP growth is forecast to average around
½ percent, down from 1.8% in 2002. Economic

performance was lacklustre in the first half, staying well

behind what had been expected in spring. It was also

considerably weaker than in the rest of the euro area.

Total output edged up only marginally in the first two

quarters, leaving an overhang of merely 0.2% compared

with the euro area average of 0.5%. The lack of
momentum was due to a delayed revival of export
demand coupled with very weak final domestic

demand, from which the contribution to growth failed

to move into positive territo
ry. Private consumption
expenditure remained subdued, showing little to no

response to sluggish but nevertheless tangible signs of

economic recovery. In the second quarter private

consumption was still below the level of a year earlier,

despite ongoing job creation and a sizeable increase in

real disposable income.
For the second half of 2002, estimates of industrial
production point to a temporary acceleration in

economic activity in the third quarter, helped by a

favourable working days effect. Thereafter, leading

indicators as well as the likely impact of strikes suggest

a return to a more measured but nevertheless positive

upward trend. Only investment is expected to

experience a brief and more substantial upturn towards

the end of the year, as firms take advantage of the so-

called “Tremonti” law, a tax incentive scheme due to

expire at the end of December. However, this will only

partly off-set the negative performance earlier in the

year.
In 2003, the sluggish pace of recovery is expected to
continue, with economic growth strengthening only

gradually. A more sizeable acceleration is forecast from
around mid-year, along with an improved economic
situation in the euro area as a whole. The revival is

assumed to be largely driven by stronger domestic

demand, benefiting from a favourable set of
fundamentals. In particular, private consumption should
rise on account of easing inflationary pressure and

further increases in disposable income backed by

planned income tax cuts. The stronger effective

exchange rate with respect to the 2002 average and

Italy’s trade weighting towards foreign markets

expanding less than total world trade are expected to

dampen merchandise export growth. The external

contribution to growth is likely to remain slightly

negative. Nevertheless, total output growth is forecast

to approach 3% in annualised terms in the second half

of the year, averaging 1.8% in 2003 as a whole. For

2004, taking into account the carry-over effect from

2003 and assuming that economic activity expands

towards its potential rate over the course of the year,

real GDP growth is likely to average around 2.4%.
Prices and wages
In 2002, in spite of a sizeably negative output gap and a
decree law freezing controlled prices up until the end of
November, inflationary pressure has remained high.

Annual average CPI inflation, which measures price

increases gross of subsidies, might be around 2.5%,
slightly lower than that of the HICP as household
medical cost contributions were increased over the

course of the year. Inflation is forecast to ease early in

2003 as the negative output gap persists essentially

unchanged and import prices benefit from a stronger

euro. Unit labour costs are also assumed to contribute to

lower inflation, mainly through an increase in
productivity. Wage increases are forecast to stay
moderate.
Employment and unemployment
In clear contrast with most euro area economies,
employment continued to increase in Italy up until July

2002, although at a slowing rate. The rate of

unemployment fell to 9.0%, a ten-year low. By regions,

however, employment started to decline in the northern

part of the country, signalling that the positive trend in

the country as a whole is likely to come to a halt.
Chapter3Member States, Italy
63Moreover, planned layoffs at FIAT and the ensuing
effects on suppliers can be expected to have a

measurable impact on total employment. Consequently,

job creation is forecast to turn negative in late 2002 and

to recover gradually over the course of the following

two years. The declining trend in the rate of

unemployment is expected to stop in 2003 and to

resume in 2004.
Public finances
After a deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 2001, general

government net borrowing in 2002 is estimated at 2.4%
of GDP, decreasing marginally in 2003 also as a result
of sizeable one-off measures (1.2% of GDP, compared

to 0.7% in 2002). In 2004 the “no-policy-change”

deficit is estimated at around 3% of GDP. Reflecting a

large and largely unexplained discrepancy between

government accounts in accrual and cash terms (see

chart 3.16), the government debt ratio in 2002 is
expected to slightly increase compared to 2001 and to
decline very gradually in 2003-2004. Developments in

the debt ratio over the forecast period do not take into

account an announced financial operation which could

lower the debt ratio at the end of 2002 below the 2001

level and slightly accelerate the projected pace of

reduction in subsequent years.
The forecast takes into account the effects of the decree
laws of 8 July (which blocks tax credits for recruitment

and investment in disadvantaged areas and curbs

increases in healthcare expenditure) and of 24

September (urgent measures to increase tax receipts).

Despite these measures, sales of real assets amounting

to some 0.6% of GDP and receipts from a tax amnesty

for assets held abroad totalling another 0.1% of GDP,

the primary surplus drops markedly in 2002 compared

to 2001, partly offset by the large decline in interest

payments. Current tax receipts decrease slightly relative

64to GDP, also due to the lesser effect of some transitory
revenue-boosting taxes in 2001. Moreover, there are

uncertainties as to the expected yields of other taxes,

notably the tax on the re-evaluation of assets introduced
in the Budget Law for 2002. The strong increase in
primary expenditure in percentage of GDP compared to

2001 is due to higher outlays for healthcare, wages and

pensions.
The draft Budget Law for 2003, 
unveiled on 30
September, introduces a reduction in the personal
income tax estimated at 0.3% of GDP, as well as a

sizeable tax settlement operation, estimated to improve

the budget balance by 0.4% of GDP, and a new tax

amnesty for assets held abroad, expected to yield a

further 0.2% of GDP. The Commission forecast fully

includes the estimated effects of these measures, all of

which have essentially transitory effects. Planned

savings in government purchases of goods and services

on the part of the central and decentralised

administrations and in subsidies to enterprises are

estimated in the forecast to total 0.6% of GDP. It should

be  noted  that the  government’s  amendment to
the Budget Law, presented to Parliament on 31
October, has not been assessed and its effects are not
included in the Commission forecast. The

Commission’s budgetary estimate also hinges on

planned sales of real assets of 0.6% of GDP, which

carry a degree of uncertainty, as they concern not yet

fully identified state property.
The forecast for 2004 is based on legislation currently
in force. Tax and social security contributions receipts
are consistent with the macroeconomic framework and

with the estimated effects of the measures in the Budget
Law for 2003. Other revenues and non-interest
expenditures are forecast on the basis of the trends

underlying the updated official projections for 2003-
2006 released in September. The rate of increase of
compensation of employees has been adjusted for the

assumption on inflation. Gross fixed capital formation
reflects much lower sales of real assets. Capital receipts
reflect the expiration of one-off revenue measures.

Significant slowdown as services exports weaken, but recovery
expected
The situation in 2002
In 2001 economic growth in Luxembourg slowed down
sharply to 1.0%, following many years in which real
GDP growth clearly exceeded the EU average. In view

of the very open character of the Luxembourg

economy, the slowdown was primarily due to weak
export growth of 1.6%, in line with the cyclical
downturn in world trade, while import growth at 5.0%

remained strong, sustained by still buoyant domestic

demand. The deceleration in exports was primarily due

to a 0.4% decrease in services exports, probably largely

accounted for by weakness in financial services exports
in response to the turmoil on global financial markets.
The deterioration of the external balance continued into
the first half year of 2002, mainly due to a contraction

in the value of exports. In general, exposed sectors of
the economy, notably financial services and

telecommunications as well as manufacturing, showed
signs of further weakening, along with the general
slowdown of economic activity in the EU. However,
the performance of sheltered sectors has been more
positive during the first part of 2002. Retail trade

remained rather buoyant, probably due to the dynamism

in private consumption, boosted by strong (albeit
decelerating) job creation and an acceleration in wage
increases. By contrast, construction output was quite

strong in the first half of 2002, in particular public
construction investment. Strong growth in economic
activity in recent years resulted in a very fast increase in
employment, which rose by 5.6% in 2001. This strong
job creation slowed down in the first eight months of

2002, and was even negative in manufacturing.

Consumer price inflation decelerated between January
and August 2002, largely due to base effects, despite
some upward impact of the cash changeover to the euro

concentrated at the beginning of the year.
Prospects
Real GDP growth is expected to slow down further in

2002 to a mere 0.1%, well below the EU average. The
stagnation of economic growth not only stems from a
drag from the external sector but also from a marked

slowdown in domestic demand, despite strong increases
in real government consumption, as private
consumption growth is expected to moderate and gross

fixed capital formation, particularly in machinery, will

be adversely affected by the economic slowdown.

Private consumption would decelerate to 2.3% in 2002,
due to lower increases in real wages, decelerating
employment and increased uncertainty on the part of

consumers which will likely lead to higher savings. For

2002, it is expected that a major drag on activity still
stems from adverse developments in the financial

sector, which will impact negatively on services
exports. Given the size of the negative external shock to
the financial sector that affected the Luxembourg

economy already last year, a (somewhat delayed)
negative impact on overall employment and on activity
in a broader range of business services sectors is

expected. Overall economic prospects are somewhat
more favourable over the remainder of the forecast
horizon; a pickup in real GDP growth to 2.0% is

foreseen in 2003 as a result of a more favourable

external environment which would help exports and
private investment to gradually recover from the
adverse impact of the global cyclical downturn. In
2004, real GDP is expected to grow by 5.6% largely as
a result of a recovery of domestic demand.
Employment and unemployment
Employment growth should decelerate in the course of
2003, reflecting the slowdown in economic activity
with a lag. Total employment growth is forecast to

decrease to slightly over 1% in 2003, before picking up
to 1.6% in 2003 in line with the upturn in economic
activity. As job creation in recent years had mostly

benefited non-residents, the slowdown in employment

growth will result in a particularly sharp slowdown in

the number of frontier workers. However, it should also

lead to a rise in the number of resident unemployed
even if a significant part of this increase is likely to be
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Luxembourg
66cushioned by the specific measures for the unemployed
already implemented by the authorities. Consequently,

the rise in registered unemployment is likely to be

cushioned.
Costs and prices
HICP inflation is predicted to fall to 1.9% this year,
from 2.4% in 2001, due to lower energy prices, a
weakening of unit labour costs and to a cyclical

contraction in profit margins. Harmonised inflation
should subsequently slightly decelerate further to 1.8%

in 2003 and remain at this rate in 2004, as the

moderating impact of decelerating unit labour costs
would be compensated for mainly by the unwinding of
the negative contribution of energy prices and by a

recovery in profit margins. Decelerating inflation would

allow wages increases to slow down gradually over the

forecast horizon while remaining probably faster than in
neighbouring countries. The expected moderation in
unit labour costs is largely due to a cyclical pick up in

labour productivity growth.
Public finance
Strong domestic activity boosted government revenues
in 2001. Hence, despite a round of tax cuts and rather

strong government expenditure, the general government

surplus amounted to 6.1% of GDP, compared to 5.6%

in 2000. Substantial surpluses were recorded both in the

central government and with the social security funds.

In 2002 the general government surplus should decrease

significantly. This outcome is attributable both to the

decrease in the revenue-to-GDP ratio and to the marked

increase in spending caused by slower economic

growth. The broad tax reform implemented in 2001 and

2002 will negatively affect receipts of both corporate

Government expenditure will continue to grow fast

mainly owing to an increase in social payments and the

sustained growth in government expenditure and public

investment in infrastructures. Consequently, the
expenditure to GDP ratio is 
considerably, to 45.2% of
GDP  in  2004.    The  general  government  surplus   is
expected to turn projected to increase into a deficit of
1.8 and 1.9% of GDP in 2003 and 2004 respectively,

due to continued strong growth in expenditure, the

revenues from taxes and social contributions, as well as

the effects of the tax reform. Public debt is expected to
reach 5.4% by 2004.

6810.The Netherlands
Economic growth stalls as high labour costs lead to competitiveness
problems
The situation in 2002
Following a number of years in which real GDP growth
exceeded the EU average, the Dutch economy is

experiencing a sharp slowdown. Real GDP growth is

expected to reach a mere 0.2% in 2002. In the second

quarter of 2002, economic growth hovered around zero

in quarter-on-quarter terms for the fourth consecutive

quarter. As elsewhere in the EU, the slowdown in

activity was to a large extent due to the deceleration in

international trade. The decline in exports was

accentuated by the deterioration in external

competitiveness and the consequent losses in export

market share. The recent appreciation of the euro has

been an additional factor dampening Dutch export

growth. In addition, domestic demand and in particular

private consumption has also weakened considerably
for a number of reasons. Private consumption growth
has been lacklustre on the back of the significant

declines in consumer confidence, signs of a reversal on

the labour market as the unemployment rate started to

rise, and the negative impact of high inflation on

household real disposable income. Moreover, the slump

on equity markets and the moderation on the housing

market led to the fading out of wealth effects that had

boosted private consumption between the mid-1990s

and the year 2000. The household saving ratio sharply

increased in 2001 and likely will remain high in 2002,

despite substantial gains in household disposable

income due to the 2001 tax reform, as households
appear reluctant to spend in response to the economic

downturn, volatility on financial markets, and
heightened concern about economic prospects. A

deterioration in profits and slow growth put downward

pressure on investment. Investment growth was

strongly negative in the first two quarters of 2002

reflecting weak business confidence, lower than

expected corporate profits, uncertainty partly resulting

from the turmoil in financial markets, losses in external
competitiveness, and sluggish housing investment.
Prospects: slow recovery in the course of 2003
A recovery in exports and some rebound in domestic
demand would lead to a modest upturn, starting from
the second half of 2002 onwards. This will result in real
GDP growth reaching 0.9% in 2003 and 2.2% in 2004.

In 2003, consumer demand will remain sluggish despite

a drop in inflation, reflecting uncertainty on the part of

consumers and a worsening labour market. In 2004, the

expected further fall in inflation and a recovery in

employment growth would underpin real disposable

household income. Hence, private consumption growth

is expected to increase to 1.5% in 2004. Private non-

residential capital formation is 
expected to recover
gradually in the course of 2003 and 2004, in line with

the upturn in domestic and external demand, with total

investment growth reaching 2.2% by 2004. On the
external side, export growth is expected to recover to
4.1% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2004 in line with

developments in world demand. However, over the

forecast horizon, the recovery of net exports is expected

to be relatively muted comp
ared to previous cyclical
upswings, as losses in competitiveness not only dampen

the recovery of exports, but also lead to a gradual

increase in import penetration. Restraints on

government spending put in place by the new

government would limit the growth rate of real

government consumption to 0.3% next year and 1.2%

in 2004. The contribution of inventories to real GDP

growth is expected to turn slightly positive in 2003,
following the drag on growth put in 2002 during the
downward phase of the inventory cycle.
A risk to the forecast concerns the impact of the decline
in equity prices on pension fund reserves. For around

300 pension funds out of a total of some 900, reserves

have fallen below the statutory minimum coverage
Chapter3Member States, The Netherlands
69ratio, according to the Pension and Insurance Chamber.
Covering even part of the shortfall by raising pension

premiums over the forecast horizon (for the largest part

borne by companies) would have significant adverse

macro-economic effects. For 2003, under the relatively

cautious assumption of a rise in private pension

premiums paid by 1.3% of the wage bill and a rise of

2.3 percentage point in public pension premiums, real

GDP growth would decrease by 0.1%, the general

government balance would deteriorate by 0.2% of GDP

and private sector wage costs would increase by

0.9 percentage point.
Employment and unemployment
Employment is forecast to decrease by 0.5% in 2003

and then to gradually pick up again, reaching 0.2% in

2004, following the cyclical recovery of output with a
lag. As a consequence, the unemployment rate is
expected to rise substantially and to stand at 4.5% on

average in 2004, reflecting the lagged response of the

labour market to the economic slowdown and Cabinet

plans to cut down the number of civil servants. The lag

with which employment growth responds to the
slowdown in activity should be longer than usual, due
to ‘labour hoarding’ in a labour market, which has been

very tight in recent years. It is envisaged that labour

supply will grow at lower rates than witnessed in the

second half of the 1990s, partly because of

demographic factors.
Costs and prices
HICP inflation would gradually decrease over the
forecast horizon, to 2.8% in 2003 and 2.4% in 2004.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002The Netherlands
70The drop in inflation mainly reflects an easing of unit
labour costs due to a slight moderation of wages and a

rebound in labour productivity growth (from a historical

low of–0.7% in 2001 - largely due to labour hoarding -

to around 2% by 2004), despite some recovery of profit

margins.
The drop in import prices in 2002 and 2003 is
another factor contributing to lower inflation. The

upward impact of the euro cash changeover, which De

Nederlandsche Bank estimated at around 0.6 percentage

point in the first six months of 2002, is expected to

fade. Despite the expected easing of the labour market,

continued shortages in certain segments and a relatively

high inflation rate are expected to keep wage increases

relatively high, with compensation per employee

projected to ease only gradually from slightly above 5%
in 2002 to 3.8% in 2004. This would allow for a
recovery in profit margins. On the other hand, increases

in pension premiums are expected to counterbalance

part of the beneficial effect of easing wage increases on
labour costs.
Public finance
In the 2003 budget, the new Dutch government

introduced expenditure cuts and tax increases to
improve the budgetary situation. However, deficits
would  continue  to  persist   over  the  forecast
horizonpartly because of sluggish economic growth.

The small 2001 budget surplus (0.1% of GDP) is

projected to deteriorate to -0.8% in 2002 and -1.2% in

2003, before improving somewhat to -0.9% of GDP in

2004. This pattern partly reflects the operation of

automatic stabilisers in a weak economic environment.

In 2003 and 2004, significant tax increases and
expenditure cuts are planned to avoid a further
deterioration in budget balances. Tax increases will

mainly take the form of an elimination of personal and

corporate income tax deductions.  Expenditure cuts

relate to the number of civil servants and the flow of

income from the central government to the regional and

local authorities. In addition, benefits for the

unemployed and disabled are to be reduced. The

deteriorating economic environment, however, implies

that the goal of avoiding ex-ante deficits will not be

achieved over the forecast horizon. That said, in

cyclically adjusted terms the general government

balance is forecast to improve from a slight deficit in

2002 to an estimated surplus of 0.6% of GDP by 2004.
The pace of debt reduction will be relatively slow,
resulting in a gross government debt ratio of 48.8% of
GDP in 2004.

Domestic demand to recover after nose-dive in 2002
Developments in 2002
Having contracted in the second and third quarter of
2001, the Austrian economy resumed growth up to mid-
2002. Nevertheless, economic performance during the

first half of the year was disappointing, because of a

sharper than anticipated fall in domestic demand

growth, owing to sluggish household demand and
falling investment.
Private consumption is set to grow at only about half
the rate of 2001, with disposable income of households
being squeezed by weak employment growth, rising

unemployment and higher than anticipated inflation.

Investment took a dive in the first half-year, with

construction suffering from excess supply and

budgetary restraint, while equipment investment

plunged owing to deteriorating demand expectations.

For the second half of 2002, little improvement is in

sight from either the domestic side or external trade due

to the delay in the international economic upswing. The
only exception is construction demand, which is
expected to benefit from the recent flood disaster

already in the fourth quarter and also in 2003. Although

the rise in exports is forecast to decelerate sharply, the

growth contribution of the external sector should

increase, reflecting a slump in import growth. Overall,

at some ¾% output growth is expected to remain
unchanged compared with the previous year.
Notwithstanding a temporary acceleration in August,
inflation declined in the first three quarters and is
expected to continue its downward trend. Weak output

growth led to a sharp increase in unemployment, with

the unemployment rate staying nonetheless significantly
below the EU15-average.
Prospects
The economic recovery should gain momentum in
2003, thanks to strengthening domestic demand and the
expected upswing in world economic growth. Private

consumption should pick up as a result of higher
disposable income growth and rising employment
levels, while public consumption is expected to be

curbed. After a dive in 2002,  investment should

rebound, reflecting the improved outlook for exports.

As a result, real GDP growth in 2003 is expected to

accelerate to some 1¾%. Domestic demand, being the
mainstay of growth already in 2003, is projected to gain
momentum in 2004 and, combined with higher export

growth, bring overall GDP growth close to a rate of
2¼%.
Demand components
Having contracted in 2002, household real disposable
income should expand again in 2003, if moderately,
thanks to decelerating inflation and rising employment.

As a result, private consumption is expected to recover

quite vigorously in 2003 and more strongly in 2004.

Public consumption is forecast to remain subdued

throughout the projection period, assuming that the new

government, to be formed after general elections in late

November, will make efforts to control budgetary

spending. Construction investment, in particular civil

engineering but also housing construction, is projected

to benefit from the flood disaster, with a turnaround of
the downward trend expected as of 2003. Equipment
investment is expected to pick up by mid-2003

reflecting the improvement in demand prospects.

Exports are expected to gain momentum, coming in full

swing in 2003. With imports also surging, reflecting the

expected pick-up in domestic demand, the contribution
of net exports to GDP growth should decline in 2003
and turn negative in 2004.
Prices and Wages
Consumer price inflation is likely to abate somewhat in
2003 as falling import prices and decelerating unit
labour costs should more than offset a temporary
increase in oil prices, and remain unchanged in 2004.
Sluggish growth in 2002 is expected to lead to
relatively moderate private sector wage agreements for
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Austria
722003, with nominal increases in contractual wages
somewhat below those of 2002. In 2004, despite wage

moderation in the private sector expected to continue,

the cyclical upswing should lead to somewhat higher

wage settlements than in 2003. In the public sector,

however, given that the wage increase for 2001-02 was

very moderate and entailed significant losses in real

terms, an additional pay-rise to partly compensate for

purchasing power losses, is expected for 2003. In sum,

wage growth in 2003 should be below that of 2002 and
increase somewhat in 2004.
Labour market
In 2002, sl
uggish output growth has an adverse impact
on the labour market. Total employment is expected to
fall, with dependent labour nevertheless expanding
slightly. With overall output growth gaining
momentum, a more sustained pick-up in the labour
market should be expected as of mid-2003. With the

number of self-employed almost stagnating over the

forecast period, total employment growth is thus

expected to resume in 2003. As of 2003, labour supply

is forecast to change in line with the business cycle,
contrary to the recent counter-cyclical expansion.

Reflecting the projected tendencies of labour demand
and supply, the sharp rise in unemployment in 2002 is

expected to come to a halt in 2003 before turning
around in 2004.
Current accountIn 2002, the current account deficit is expected to
almost halve due to weak domestic demand. The slump

Chapter3Member States, Austria
73in import growth, will yield an exceptional – but
transitory - trade surplus in 2002, and a widening of the

services balance surplus. Owing to a negative incomes

balance, however, the current account should register a

deficit. As of 2003, with domestic demand recovering,

merchandise imports are projected to accelerate,

outpacing the expansion of goods exports, and thus the
trade balance should turn negative again.
Public finances
In 2001, general government finances improved from a
deficit of 1.6% of GDP in 2000 (excluding UMTS
proceeds) to budgetary balance (figures in ESA 95

definition, i.e. disregarding Swap operations). As this

was achieved against low output growth, the

improvement in the cyclically-adjusted position was
even stronger. The favourable outcome in 2001 was due
mainly to a strong rise in tax revenues, exceeding

expectations, and resulting in a sharp increase in the tax
burden to almost 46% of GDP.
In 2002, however, the budgetary position is projected to
weaken substantially to a deficit of 1.8%, thereby
deviating significantly from the stability programme
target of a balanced budget.
The expected deterioration is largely due to revenue
shortfalls compared with earlier official estimates: a
negative “echo-effect” related to the tax regime shift in

2001  and   the  economic  slowdown,  in  particular  the

weakness of domestic components,  are all bearing
down tax revenues.
Expenditure growth is difficult to be reined in, despite
the continued exonerating effects of the pension and the
administrative reform. Apart from an emergency aid
package related to the recent flood disaster, totalling

some 0.6% of GDP, of which some ¼ percentage point

affects the year 2002, social security spending increased
more strongly than the authorities had anticipated.
Moreover, the surplus at the Länder level is projected to
decline from 2001.
In 2003, no special factors – largely accounting for the
budgetary results in 2001 and 2002 – should affect the
budgetary outcome, apart from the flood disaster

emergency package. The tax intake should return to

normal patterns. Additional, partly flood related

spending should more than offset the continued impact

of expenditure restraint. Public sector employees may

be granted an additional pay rise, making up for past

purchasing power losses. In sum, the expected cyclical

upswing, conducive to employment creation, should
slightly lower the deficit in 2003 and 2004.
The forecast for 2003 is subject to great uncertainty.
The Austrian government had collapsed before the
budget for 2003 was passed. Early parliamentary

elections are scheduled for 24 November 2002 and the
budget for 2003 will be adopted only next year.

Further adjustment towards more sustainable levels of domestic
demand
The economy in 2002
Following a period of strong growth driven by buoyant
domestic demand, economic activity started to

decelerate in the second half of 1999. This slowdown

continued uninterrupted into 2002. The pace of growth

decreased from an average of 3½% per year in

1999-2000 to 1.7% in 2001, and is estimated at around

¾% in 2002. This basically reflects faltering domestic

demand (both private consumption and investment),

which was only partly offset by a rise in the

contribution to growth from the net foreign balance. In

particular, growth of private consumption has seen a

sharp deceleration, with purchases of durable goods

receding in the first half of the year, while investment is

expected to fall by nearly 3½% in 2002, reflecting a

marginal decline in residential construction and a more
marked contraction in equipment investment. Public
investment is estimated to recede on account of an

electoral cycle that ended in 2001, and due to the

impact of the saving measures adopted in the 2002

rectifying budget, especially the planned sale of assets

which are to be recorded as negative investment.

Merchandise exports should rise by about 3% in 2002,

exceeding the pace of foreign demand growth.

Therefore, the Portuguese economy is assumed to gain

market shares in 2002, further to the gains recorded in

2001. At the same time, weakening domestic demand

brought about a strong deceleration in merchandise

import growth from 1% in 2001 to about ¼% in 2002.
All considered, the contribu
tion of total net exports to
output growth rose to about  ¾ pp of GDP.
Outlook
In the first three quarters of 2002, and according to the

coincident indicator on current economic activity

published by the Bank of Portugal, economic activity

decelerated to an annualised growth rate of  ½% (as

against 1.7% for the whole of 2001). Judging by the
most recent indicators, domestic demand waned further
in the third quarter. Output growth is expected to

continue to decelerate until the beginning of 2003. For

the whole of 2002, GDP growth is expected at around

¾%. A moderate pick-up in economic activity is
forecast to take place in 2003, brought about by
favourable developments abroad, which is expected to

strengthen the current process of substituting the major

source of growth towards the export sector and away

from domestic demand. However, in view of the

negative overhang in economic growth at the end of

2002, GDP growth is expected to reach only about
1¼% in 2003 before accelerating to an annual rate of
some 2½% in 2004. Although gaining momentum,

domestic demand is forecast to expand at an annual

average of just over 1% in 2003-04. This is mainly due

to continued efforts by private sector agents to redress

their balance sheets, following the sharp rise in

indebtedness in recent years. The balance of payments

deficit (the sum of the current and capital balances) is

therefore expected to nearly halve between 2001 and

2004, declining to a value close to 4% of GDP in 2004.
GDP components
Private consumption is expected to remain subdued

throughout the forecast period. Consumer confidence is

currently at historically low levels, and households are

expected to use a substantial part of the growth in real

disposable income to reduce their debt-to-income ratios.
Total investment is forecast to decline further in 2003
as the adjustment of private capital spending to more

sustainable levels continues, and public investment not
co-financed by EU funds is reduced in nominal terms
due to budgetary constraints. Growth in total

investment is only expected to turn positive in 2004.
Export market growth is estimated to accelerate sharply
from ½% in 2002 to approximately 6½% on average in

the 2003-04 period. The strong rebound in foreign
Chapter3Member States, Portugal
75demand is expected to lead to a strong rise in exports as
market shares are projected to remain broadly

unchanged in 2003-04 after the gains registered in

2001-02. The total import elasticity of final demand is
estimated to decline in 2002, because of the marked
slowdown in demand for durables which have a high

import content. With the revival of investment and

exports, the import elasticity should edge up again at

the end of the forecast period. Overall, the contribution

of total net exports to GDP growth is forecast to be
close to ¾ pp over the forecast period.
External Balance
The external deficit, as measured by the sum of the
current and capital balances, is projected to nearly halve
between 2001 and 2004, declining to a ratio close to 4%
of GDP. The narrowing of the external imbalance

reflects the slowdown in the growth of domestic
demand combined with the expected normalisation in
capital transfers resulting from the implementation of a

new Community Support Framework, which should

more than offset the projected deterioration in the

incomes balance.
PricesDespite a 2 pp rise in the standard VAT rate to 19% as

from July 2002, HICP inflation has only slightly

increased since, suggesting that producers have only

partly passed through to consumers the VAT rise,

thereby reducing profit margins. Moderate import price

inflation, low wage increases, and subdued domestic

demand throughout the forecast period are all expected

to contribute to dampen inflation from about 3½% in

2002 to a projected 2½% in 2004.

EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Portugal
76Labour Market
Employment should still grow in 2002, in particular in
the construction and services sectors, while the

unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4¾%. The

slowdown in economic activity will have a more

marked impact on labour market outcomes in 2003.

Employment is projected to nearly stagnate, reflecting

both the economic slowdown together with the freeze in

public sector hiring. The unemployment rate is

expected to reach some 5½% in 2003. However, the

easing in labour market conditions combined with

possible spill-over effects from the planned lower pay

rises in the public sector are expected to bring about

lower wage increases in the private sector of the

economy. Total wage gains per employee are expected

to decelerate from about 4¾ % in 2002 to 3½% in 2004.
Public finances
Public finance data for Portugal were revised

significantly after the Spring forecast, resulting in

higher government deficits. These revisions were

reported in the September EDP notification, and

basically follow the conclusions reached by an ad-hoc

commission, which had been entrusted by the

Portuguese government to review general government

accounts for 2001. Since taking office in April 2002,
the Portuguese government introduced a rectifying
budget which included saving measures totalling about

½% of GDP.
The deficit target for 2002 is 2.8% of GDP. However,
and  according  to  the  latest   information,   the   actual
deficit outturn for 2002 is currently estimated at around
3½% of GDP. The higher figure reflects a number of

factors, notably: lower growth than projected in the

rectifying budget (¾% as against 1¼%), which is

depressing tax revenue below target; less favourable

developments as regards health care and local

authorities expenditure; and a likely shortfall in the

revenue intake from the planned sale of real assets,

which were expected to bring in a total of about ¾% of

GDP; in particular the current estimate does not include

the announced sale of the fixed telephone network.
The forecast for 2003 is based on the draft budget for
that year. Among the most significant measures

included in the budget are: i) personal income tax
brackets are indexed below inflation; ii) half-year
minimum payments on account of final corporate taxes

are raised substantially; iii) the average inflation rate in

the EU will be used as the benchmark in all future wage

negotiations in the public sector; iv) a vast programme

of privatisation is planned to bring in € 1500 million in

revenue of which 40% is to be used to repay public
debt; v) government transfers will continue to grow

above nominal GDP, partly due to the decision to

progressively raise the minimum pension towards the

minimum wage. The resulting forecast is a deficit

slightly below 3% of GDP, which however is above the

budgetary target of 2.4%. The difference mainly

reflects: lower growth than assumed in the budget

forecast (1¼% as against 1¾%); and the carry over

effect from the deficit slippage estimated for 2002.

Overcoming the drag from external weakness and de-stocking
Economy in 2002
Finland was severely hit by the slump in international
trade last year. As a consequence, following growth of

0.7% in 2001, the economy slipped into a technical

recession by the turn of the year. Apart from foreign

demand, this was also due to a substantial stock

correction. Final domestic demand slackened, too. The

rebound in the second quarter of 2002 was remarkably

strong, with real GDP increasing by 2.1% quarter-on-
quarter. The driving force behind this hike was external
demand leading to exports soaring by 4.4% on the

quarter. Furthermore, final domestic demand resumed

its rising trend. Both private and public consumption as

well as equipment investment recorded an acceleration

in the course of the Spring. However, construction

activity eased on the back of weaker demand prospects.
Inventories were further adjusted downwards, owing to
relatively large de-stocking in manufacturing but

especially due to ship deliveries.
Although activity has been subdued, net employment
creation remained on a rising path recording a

cumulative growth of 0.4% year-on-year in the first
nine months of 2002. This implies of some labour
hoarding, reflecting healthy financial balances and

relatively strong confidence in the corporate sector.

Nevertheless, as labour supply continues to grow, the

downward trend in unemployment has stopped. From

an average rate of 9.1% in 2001, unemployment edged

up to 9.2% (s.a.) between January and September 2002.
Inflation (HICP) eased quickly from an average of 2.7%

in 2001 to 1.4% in September 2002. This was mainly
due to the fading of shocks from higher prices of food

and housing. However, prices of services, in particular

of health care and recreation, continue to exert upward

pressure.
Prospects
Leading indicators point to a somewhat mixed outlook

for the last months of 2002. Therefore, activity is set to
advance at a moderate pace in the second half of 2002,
resulting in an average growth of about 1½% in 2002.

Against the background of an assumed recovery in
foreign demand and continued healthy domestic
demand, a pick-up in activity is expected by the second

half of 2003, accelerating the annual rate of GDP

growth to 2¾% in 2003 and further to 3½% in 2004.
Following from the projected profile of activity, job
creation is expected to come to a halt in the last months
of 2002, implying employment remaining flat for the
year as a whole. As a consequence, a small rise in

unemployment is forecast for 2002. For the future, the

delayed recovery and spare capacity in the corporate

sector is expected to hold back job creation. Therefore,

employment is projected to hover around current levels

throughout 2003. Nevertheless, hiring should not face

major supply constraints, given the continued decline in

the NAIRU and the fact that the level of unemployment

is expected to remain above the EU average throughout

the forecast period.
GDP components
Owing to a relatively high export share of close to 40%

of GDP, Finland has suffered significantly from the

weakness in external demand. In spite of high price

competitiveness of Finnish firms, external demand is

not expected to give a major boost to growth before the

second half of 2003. In 2004, net exports should raise

GDP by over 1 percentage point owing particularly to

lively foreign demand for Finnish telecommunication

and forest products. Easing inflation together with

expected sizeable nominal wage rises in 2003-04 should

help consumer spending to maintain its leading role as

the driver of the economy. However, the tax cuts of the

recent past seem to have come to an end and some rises

of social security contributions have already been
introduced. Furthermore, the expected increase in
unemployment may dampen private consumption.

Owing to low capacity utilisation rates and weak export

demand, business investment is expected to stay
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Finland
78subdued up to the second half of 2003. In 2004,
improving demand prospects should boost investment

activity. Rising vacancy rates for business premises are
pr ojected to weigh on business construction throughout
the forecast period. On the other hand, favourable

financing conditions together with the ongoing

migration towards the  growth centres of the country are

expected to stimulate hous
ing construction which was
sluggish in 2001-02.
Costs and prices
Although activity is expected to gradually pick up,

lower food and housing prices are estimated to reduce
price pressures, bringing HICP inflation down by about
¾ percentage points to just below 2% in 2002. In 2003,

the base effect is estimated to pave the way for slightly
lower average inflation. In 2004, projected pick-up in
activity imply  a soft acceleration in price inflation. In

December 2000, a centralised two-year wage agreement
provided for a general wage rise of 2.3% in 2002. Due
to a positive wage drift, per-capita wages appear to

increase by about 3¼% in 2002. However, nearly flat

employment in 2002-03 appears to curb the rise in unit

labour costs due to a rise in overall productivity. As for

wages in 2003-04, a new round of centralised wage

negotiation started in mid-October. Initial wage claims

are for an  increase close to 4% for 2003 and about 3½

% for 2004. Even allowing for the fact that actual

settlements will turnout significantly lower than initial

claims, upward pressure on labour costs appears to be

building up, assuming also unabated wage drift of about

1 percentage point.

79-Public finances
Although the general government financial surplus is
expected to decrease by about 1¼ percentage points to

some 3½ % of GDP in 2002, it is projected to exceed

the estimate of the Spring forecast. This results from an

improved overall revenue intake, and particularly from

higher social contributions due to lower-than-expected

unemployment. However, central government

expenditure is also projected to grow beyond the rate

agreed in the government’s medium-term spending

guidelines of Spring 2002. This goes in particular for

expenditure on social transfers. In addition, the

financial position of local governments appears to slip

further into deficit, due partly to reforms in the financial

burden sharing between the state and the municipalities
but more importantly to additional expenditure on
welfare services and local government wages.

Consequently, the general government surplus is

estimated to edge down further to some 3% of GDP in
2003 while the stronger economic activity is expected
to bring it back to around 3½ % in 2004.
In 2003 and 2004, the trend of a mildly rising nominal
government debt is expected to continue. This is due to

a decline in the primary surplus in 2003 and to the

ongoing reduction in the holdings of domestic

government bonds by social security funds. As a

consequence of the expected acceleration of GDP

growth, the debt ratio is an
ticipated to fall gradually to
just above 41% of GDP by the end of the forecast

period.

Private consumption contributes to stronger growth in 2002
The economy in 2002
Swedish economic growth has shown resilience so far
in 2002, with GDP growth of 1.5% year-on-year in the
first half of 2002 compared with 1.2% in the year 2001.
Despite the fact that exports have remained weak, the

contribution to growth from net exports was highly

positive, due to very low imports. The prolonged global

slump in the telecom sector has weighed heavily on

Swedish exports and in particular on manufacturing. On

the domestic side, economic activity has been mixed.

Private consumption accelerated in Q2 and was up by

1% on the quarter, aided by an increase in disposable

incomes. Lower taxes, a resilient labour market and

relatively strong consumer confidence has contributed

to this. On the other hand, share prices have continued

to fall substantially in 2002. This led households to

increase the saving rate. Investment has been poor,

influenced by uncertain business prospects. De-stocking

continued in the first half of 2002. By contrast, public

consumption has risen strongly. With some acceleration

in GDP and at the same time almost flat employment

growth, productivity growth per person has risen
sharply.
Prospects
Recent indicators point to the economy being in the
middle of a very hesitant recovery. Both business and
consumer confidence indicators suggest that one cannot
expect much in the way of acceleration in the very

short-term. Indications of a recovery in the world

economy also appear to be uncertain. These prospects,

both domestically and externally, are expected to result

in relatively stable growth in the second half of 2002. A
further recovery is expected in 2003, with some rise in
private consumption and a turnaround in investment.

External demand growth should pick up in 2003,

resulting in stronger exports. In 2004, economic growth

is expected to be close to potential. Overall, GDP is
expected to grow by 1.6% in 2002, 2.2% in 2003 and
2.4% in 2004.
Inflation is expected to remain stable over the forecast
period, close to the Riksbank’s inflation target of 2%.

On balance, upside risks from, possibly, higher wage

increases are countered by downside risks stemming

from the turbulence in asset prices. The labour market
is fairly tight and is expected to be stable in 2002-04.
GDP components
The substantial tax cuts in 2002 raises disposable
incomes markedly, actually the biggest increase in real

terms in more than 30 years, and should result in much

stronger private consumption growth, of 1.4%, after

having grown be a mere 0.2% in 2001. Despite this

acceleration in consumption, the prolonged fall in

equity prices, in fact larger between 2000 and 2002 than

during the depression in 1929-32, results in negative
wealth effects, despite continued, slight rises in house
prices. This should lead to an increase in the savings

rate of almost 3 percentage points in 2002. These

negative wealth effects are expected to subdue

somewhat in 2003 and further in 2004, suggesting some

increase in private consumption. Investment growth is

expected to be negative in 2002, as business prospects
are very uncertain. In 2003, investment is expected to
be subdued too, although investment in housing and 3G

telecom networks should contribute to positive

investment growth overall. A further rise in investment

is foreseen for 2004, as economic activity gathers

momentum. Stocks are expected to contribute

negatively to growth again in 2002, but should turn
around in 2003 and give a positive contribution in 2003.
As external demand growth has improved in 2002,

Swedish exports, comprising more than ICT equipment,

are set to turn positive, after having fallen in 2001. In

2003 and 2004, a further recovery in exports is

expected, in line with world markets. Imports too
Chapter3Member States, Sweden
81should pickup, although remaining negative in 2002, as
final demand recovers in 2003 and 2004.
Costs and prices
Inflation has eased considerably since the beginning of
this year and has been around 2% in recent months, in
an environment of relatively subdued economic
activity. Existing wage agreements suggest increases

below 4%. However, due to a relatively tight labour
market, some wage drift and some, possible, upward
pressure on wages resulting from re-negotiations for

certain sectors, wages are expected to be around 4% in
2002-2004. As productivity growth is expected to be
close to 2% over the forecast period, wage increases of

around 4% should be compatible with inflation close to
the Riksbank’s 2% target. Inflation is expected to be
slightly above 2% over the forecast period.
Labour market
Employment growth has eased during 2002 and is
expected to be marginally positive for the year. Some

evidence suggests that there has been an element of

labour hoarding this year. The gradual recovery in

economic activity is therefore not expected to result in

any additional employment growth in 2003. The labour

force is expected to expand moderately in 2003, which

will result in a slight increase in the unemployment rate.

In 2004, some employment growth is expected, as
economic activity gains momentum.
Public finances
Swedish public finances have been in surplus each year
since 1998 and an increase in the surplus was posted in

2001, to 4.8% of GDP. The fiscal policy framework has

82contributed to the strong fiscal position. In 2002, the
surplus in public finances is expected to be much lower.

Relatively subdued economic growth and additional tax

cuts of the order of 1.1% of GDP contributes to this.

Moreover, the absence of positive carry-over effects on

tax revenue in the National Accounts system, resulting

from lower corporate and capital gain taxes being

recorded in 2002, has an effect on the large decline in

the budget balance this year. On the expenditure side,

the government remains committed to the previously set

expenditure ceilings on central government, as

announced in the Budget Bill for 2003. However, the

budgetary margins within the expenditure ceilings are

very small and expenditure in some expenditure areas,
such as sick insurance expenditure, could be higher than
planned. In addition, the high inflation rate in June 2001
increases indexed transfer payments in 2002.
Despite the very narrow margins in the central
government expenditure plans over the forecast period,
the use of ceilings remains a very important tool for

medium-term budgetary planning. This helps keeping

the public finances in good shape and budget surpluses

of close to 1.5% of GDP are expected over the forecast

period. Gross debt was 56.6% of GDP in 2001. The

debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall over the forecast

period and reach around 50% of GDP in 2004, as the
budget surpluses described above take effect.

Back to trend growth by 2003, as investment and net exports revive
The economy in 2002
The British economy is weathering the recent global
economic downturn rather well. Although performance

was weak in the latter half of 2001, with two

consecutive quarters of near-stagnant growth in 2001Q4

and 2002Q1, recent data reveals that the economy is

growing again as household consumption has remained

especially strong. The UK is benefiting from monetary

loosening in the shape of a 2% cumulative cut in the
repo rate since the beginning of 2001, and a fiscal
stimulus in the form of planned rises in general

government spending.
It should be noted that the celebrations of the Queen’s
Jubilee affected a variety of indicators for May and

June, and thus Q2 as a whole, though preliminary data

for Q3 suggests respectable growth for the two quarters

taken as a whole.
Although household expenditure was subdued early in
2002, it has since picked up so that, together with net

exports, it was the biggest contributor to GDP growth in

Q2. Fixed investment, already declining throughout

2001, flattened out in 2002Q2. This was the first time in

5 quarters that fixed investment did not contribute

negatively to GDP growth. General government

consumption was the second-largest drag on growth in

Q2 after having been the largest contributor to GDP

growth in Q1. De-stocking accelerated during Q2 and

proved to be the largest negative contributor to growth.

Net exports of goods and services improved during the

first half of this year, due to a rebound in export growth

in Q2 while import growth declined. Net exports thus

contributed 0.9%-points to GDP growth in Q2, the first

time they had contributed positively since 2001Q1.
On the output side, services output became more
subdued in the first half of 2002, construction grew
strongly, but manufacturing output continued to fall,

despite rising exports. The labour market has stayed
strong but productivity growth was low. Inflationary
pressures remain low - on the HICP measure, inflation

is at 1.0%, around the lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation

has remained below the 2½ % target since January.
Prospects
Growth for 2002 on average should be around 1.6%,

with the rate rising to 2.7%, around trend, in 2004. The
pickup in external factors this year, which began in Q2,
is expected to continue boosting exports. The

contribution of the net external balance to annual

growth is expected to be less negative from 2003

onwards than in previous years. Meanwhile, domestic

demand is expected to remain strong, in part as a result
of macro-economic policy. With growth below trend in
2002, a small negative output gap will emerge so

supply constraints, overall, should not constrain growth.

Unemployment is expected to fall slightly by 2004.

Although a slight pick-up in wage increases is expected,

a pick up in productivity growth is expected, so rises in

unit labour costs will be subdued.
GDP components
Growth in household consumption is expected to be

maintained over the forecast period, albeit below the

rapid rates observed in 2001 and the first half of 2002.

Real wage earnings are expected to grow moderately

and disposable incomes continue to benefit from low

interest rates. The rise in house prices, currently racing

along at over 20% per year, is offsetting the negative

impact the recent falls in equity markets may have on
consumption out of wealth. Nevertheless, the falls in
financial wealth associated with equity market

weakness, combined with the rise in gross debt

associated with the strength in the housing market are

expected to affect the savings rate, raising it by the end

of the forecast period. 2003 will see a reversal in the

current decline of fixed investment, benefiting from

strong planned boosts to general government
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002United Kingdom
84investment and an end to the fall in business investment
in line with a revival in business expectations and a b

etter financial position of companies. Government

consumption will continue to be an important

contributor to demand growth, as planned. Export
growth is expected to recover steadily during the

forecast period. Import growth will be a little weaker
than export growth, reflecting the lower growth in

domestic demand compared to 2001.
Labour Market
The labour market has remained strong despite the

global slowdown, with the unemployment rate hitting a
twenty seven year low this year. Rises in wage earnings
continue to be moderate. Employment has grown

moderately, and in the three months to August rose by
0.7% on the year. This trend is expected to continue,
leading to a slight decline in unemployment by 2004.

This year, productivity growth is expected to start
recovering from its low rate observed in 2001, given the
stronger expected GDP growth, and an expected tighter

labour market. Unit labour costs rises are expected to be

moderate and sustainable over the forecast period.
External balance
The current account deficit is expected to shrink

throughout the forecast period to around 1.6% of GDP
by 2004. The negative contribution of net exports of

goods and services to GDP growth in 2002 is expected
to decline over the forecast period as UK overseas

markets show good growth.

85PricesHICP inflation is low at around 1.0 % - around the
lowest in the EU. RPIX inflation is expected to

continue to meet the government’s 2 ½ % target.

Benign developments in unit labour costs should

continue in the face of an economy operating around
potential and with unemployment close to the NAIRU.
Public finances
The general government finances are expected to move

into small deficit over the period. The surplus of 0.7 %
of GDP in 2001 will fall to a deficit of around 1.1 % of
GDP in 2002 as growth is slower in the year as a whole;

some tax revenues, notably corporation tax, are weak,

while discretionary expenditure growth rises strongly as

planned. The deficit is expected to rise gently to 1.4 %

by 2004, as strong planned rises in expenditure in those

years will be broadly offset by rises in social

contributions. The ratio of gross debt to GDP will fall to

under 38 % by the end of 2004.

Chapter 4Non-EU countries891.United States
A subdued recovery with much downside risk
The economy in 2002
Since the end of the relatively mild recession in 2001
the US economy has advanced at an uneven pace,

averaging 3% growth in the twelve months to end-

September. However, the recent developments of key

indicators point to a weakening of the recovery in the

fourth quarter. Industrial production, retail sales,

durable goods orders and shipments are all stagnating

or declining following gains in the early phase of the
recovery. Consumer confidence and purchasing
managers indices are trending downward. Business

investment has not yet decisively turned upward.
So far the recovery has not led to much employment
growth and the unemployment rate has been hovering

between 5.6% and 6.0%. Inflation as measured by the
12-month change in the CPI had fallen to 1.5% by
September. US imports have surged back to levels seen

before the recession, but exports are recovering much

more slowly. The continued decline in net exports is

subtracting substantially from overall GDP growth and

is pushing the current account deficit to a new low. In
spite of some depreciation against the euro and the yen,
the dollar has remained virtually unchanged over the

first ten months of the year in both nominal and real

effective terms.
Last year’s stimulative fiscal and monetary policy
measures clearly helped to set the recovery on track.

Macroeconomic policy has continued its accomodative

stance in the current year. An additional fiscal stimulus

package was adopted in March. The Federal Reserve,

after keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at 1.75%

for eleven months, lowered it to 1.25% in early

November.
Unusually for the early phase of a recovery, equity
prices continued their downward trend in a fairly

dramatic way into the autumn. However, in terms of the
wealth effect on households, lower share prices have
been counterbalanced by continuing price gains in the

housing market.
Prospects for the economy going forward
The chances of a continued recovery are being
determined by both positive and negative factors which
have to be weighed against each other. On the positive

side, the following are of reference:
The step-up in trend productivity growth since 1995 has
not been broken by last year’s recession, although the
estimated average annual increase in labour

productivity in the 1995-2001 period has been lowered

to 2¼ % for the non-farm business sector. In the first

three quarters of 2002 productivity has increased

strongly.
Monetary policy is expected to remain very
accommodating, as long as the recovery is not firmly
established, since inflation and inflationary expectations

are well contained.
The phased cuts in personal taxation introduced last
year will release more purchasing power within the
forecast period. More generous depreciation rules will

provide an incentive for business investment starting

this autumn. Generally, the fiscal stance of the federal
government will remain supportive of the recovery.
On the other hand, there are also a number of
constraining factors:
The negative wealth effect from the decline in equity
prices over the past 2½ years has not yet taken its full
effect in the economy.
The household sector’s high level of indebtedness and
debt-service burden will also restrain growth in
personal consumption expenditure.
EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002United States
90The upturn in business fixed investment is being held
back by a considerable degree of unused capacity in the
manufacturing sector.
The international competitiveness of US goods and
services has deteriorated due to the dollar’s appreciation
since 1995. Assuming unchanged real exchange rates,

external trade will make a significant negative
contribution to output growth.
A subdued recovery
Taking both the positive and negative conditions into
account, the forecast expects the recovery to proceed at
a subdued pace. GDP growth is projected to recede to

about 1½ % annualised in the final quarter of 2002,

primarily on the basis of a slowdown in consumer

spending. This would result in an annual growth rate of
2.3% for 2002.
The development in personal consumption expenditure
will be the key factor in determining the strength of the
recovery going forward. It is projected that growth in

consumer spending will not exceed 2% in annual terms

in the first half of 2003 which would imply a small

improvement in household balance sheets.

Subsequently, a gradual pick-up in consumer spending

to around 3% in 2004 is expected. Business investment

in equipment and software should continue its slow

recovery based on improved corporate profitability, but

remain far below the double-digit growth rates of the

late 1990s. The sizeable contribution to growth from the

inventory turnaround will gradually diminish over the
forecast period. Residential investment stayed on a high
level during the recession and has therefore little

potential to add strength to the recovery. Investment in

non-residential structures is likely to remain weak for

another year. Growth in government consumption

91expenditure is projected to continue on a relatively
strong note from the current year. Finally, the continued

decline in net exports will subtract about two thirds of a

percentage point from annual GDP growth over the

forecast period.
Overall, real GDP is expected to increase by 2.3% in
2003 and  by 2.8% in 2004 when quarterly growth rates

would reach 3% which is the estimated rate of long-

term potential output growth. In such a scenario,

unemployment will remain around 6% while inflation

will remain below 2%.
Downside risks dominate
While subdued growth in the near term, turning into

moderate growth in the second half of next year, is the
most likely scenario, there are both downside and
upside risks to such an outcome. Considering the

relative weakness of household balance sheets, an

abrupt fall in household demand is the predominant

risk. This could happen if house prices do not continue

to rise. The projected development of consumer

spending in the forecast does not allow for a rise in the

household saving rate beyond 4½ %. If households

were to move towards their 7-8% long-term average

saving rate, the economy would fall into another

recession. On the upside, it cannot be ruled out that the

considerable impetus put in place by monetary and

fiscal policy could lead to somewhat stronger demand
growth. Furthermore, there is a  possibility  that  further
tax cuts will be adopted and that government spending,
for instance on defence, will advance more quickly than
anticipated.
The return of the twin deficits
US public finances improved strongly up to 2000, but
during last year’s recession there was a dramatic

turnaround in the fiscal position (see graph 4.1). The

automatic budgetary effect of the economic slowdown

and the discretionary fiscal measures resulted in a

deficit of 0.5% of GDP. The Bush Administration’s tax

cuts and spending measures will show their full

budgetary effect from this year onwards. At the same

time, the fiscal situation of state and local governments

has turned out more negative than previously estimated.
The budget deficit of general government is likely to
exceed 3% of GDP in 2002 and is projected to worsen
in the following two years.
The current account deficit is projected to deteriorate to
4.6% of GDP this year, mainly as a result of the

worsening trade performance. The deficit will widen to
5.2% next year and even to 5.8% in 2004. This
deterioration will continue the trend that began in the

1990s and will set new negative records for the external

account of the United States (see graph 4.2). It will

undoubtedly intensify the concerns about the

sustainability of the deficit and its negative impact on
domestic growth and employment.

922.Japan
Modest recovery ahead
Current situation and prospects
Following the longest slump in a decade, the Japanese
economy seems to have emerged from recession in the

second quarter of this year. Preliminary data indicate

that growth in the second quarter was 0.6% on the

quarter (2.6% on an annualised basis). However, the

recovery is largely driven by external demand,

underlining the large dependence on US and East-Asian

growth prospects.
Cautious quarterly growth rates for the remainder of the
year imply a fall in GDP for 2002 as a whole by 0.6%,

before rising to some 1.2% in 2003 and expanding

slightly further to around 1.4% in 2004. The Japanese

economy is thus likely to see a modest recovery, helped

by external demand. The fairly strong upward revision

in comparison to the spring forecast should be seen in
the context of substantially revised data – calculated
according to a new method with more emphasis on

supply-side statistics.
GDP components
Domestic demand is likely to remain lack-lustre over

the forecast horizon. Private consumption is, however,

showing some resilience despite falling real wages, a

very high unemployment rate by Japanese standards,

and a continued fall in prices of equity and housing.

Gross fixed capital formation continued to fall in the

first half of the year across all components of

investment. Investment in non-residential construction

and equipment is expected to continue to fall up to the

end of next year as capacity utilisation remains at a

fairly low level and corporate profits have been

squeezed. Destocking of inventories accelerated during

the first six months of 2002 and inventories have now

come down to the lowest level in a decade. As a result,
assuming a gradual deceleration of the destocking, the
change in inventories is likely to give a substantial

contribution to growth in 2003.
The external sector was the main engine of growth in
the first half of the year. As export market growth is

likely to pick up further in 2003 and remain at a high

level in 2004, this would support healthy export growth,

albeit somewhat negatively affected by the appreciation

of the yen (vs the dollar) that took place in spring this

year. Import growth, which is expected to be negative

in the current year, should take off in 2003 and 2004 –

in line with the strong elasticity to domestic demand.

Overall, the growth contribution of net exports is

forecast to remain positive, but decline somewhat in

2003 and remain at this level in 2004.
Labour market
The situation in the labour market remains difficult with

job losses being particularly pronounced in the

manufacturing and the wholesale/retail sales sectors.

Nevertheless, employment has recovered somewhat

since the autumn and into the spring. On an annual

basis, employment is expected to fall by more than 1%

in 2002, drop slightly further in 2003 and reverse

direction in 2004. The unemployment rate has been on
a cautious upward trend since the beginning of the year
and is forecast to edge up slightly next year and remain

at this level in 2004.
Costs and prices
Nominal wages have been declining since the beginning

of last year and are likely to fall by some 1.6% on an
annual basis for 2002 as a whole. Given the difficult
situation of many companies, employees seem to have

accepted a lowering of their salaries. Wages are

expected to continue to fall slightly in 2003 and

thereafter to rise modestly in 2004.
The year-on-year fall in consumer prices has
decelerated somewhat since the start of the year
although core inflation (excluding fresh food and

energy) has remained fairly constant over the period,

easing only marginally to a year-on-year fall of 0.8% in
Chapter4Non EU countries, Japan
93the month of September. Deflation is expected to
continue during the remainder of the forecast period

since the growth scenario would be strong enough to

reverse the price fall, and monetary policy does not

seem able to affect prices.
Public finances
In 2001, the general government deficit reached 7.2%

of GDP and the gross debt amounted to 132.6% of
GDP. For FY 2002 (fiscal year, running from April
2002 to March 2003), a ceiling of 30 trillion yen on the

issuance of government bonds was initiated. In the

budget preparations for FY 2003, Prime Minister

Koizumi indicated that he would be ready to abandon

this cap in order to commence the intended tax reform.

The government has also indicated that taxes would be
lowered by some 1 trillion yen, to the benefit of both
companies and households. For calendar year 2002, the

fiscal deficit is estimated to be 8.0% of GDP, rising

slightly throughout the forecast period; the gross debt is

expected to increase to just above 158% of GDP at the

end of 2004.
Policy measures
The recently appointed Minister for Financial Services,

Mr Takenaka, has stated that he would like to see a

much more aggressive disposal of the massive amount

of non-performing loans (NPLs) burdening the financial

sector. In his initial plan to tackle the NPLs, which was

leaked to the press, Mr Takenaka wanted to make the

rules for deferred tax assets much more stringent. This

would probably have caused most major banks to

EconomicForecasts,Autumn2002Japan94become undercapitalised in
 relation to the BIS
requirements. Banks would then have had to be subject

to public injections conditional upon changing

management or even the risk of being nationalised.

Following harsh political resistance within the Liberal

Democratic Party, the final outcome presented by the

government on 30 October 2002 is a much more

cautious package.
The government’s policy measures for the financial
sector are summarised in the “Programme for Financial

Revival”. The government aims to half the ratio of

NPLs to total loans - in major banks - by March 2005, a

target which is, in fact, even less ambitious than the

government’s previous intentions. The programme
embraces measures which will make stricter
assessments of banks’ assets, enhancing capital

adequacy and strengthening governance. If a financial

institution becomes undercapitalised, financial support

measures would be provided and the management of

such an institution would need to be reformed.
A work programme with a time-frame for implementing
these measures is to be presented by the FSA later in

November. Given the general nature and uncertainty of

the scope and timing of the measures, it has not been
possible to incorporate these policy measures into the
current forecast.
