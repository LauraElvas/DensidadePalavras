 2002
2In many ways, 2002 was another historicyear in the process of European integration.The first major event was the successfulintroduction of the euro banknotes and coins
on 1 January, which was the final step towardscompleting Economic and Monetary Union(EMU). As the euro cash changeover was a
complex, ambitious and unprecedentedundertaking, a smooth and rapid changeovercould only be achieved through systematic
preparation and the co-ordination of allparties concerned. It was essential, therefore,to closely involve the banking sector, security
carriers, retailers and the cash-operatedmachine industry Œ as well as institutions of
the European Union (EU), the Eurosystem
and national authorities 
Œ from an early stage.
The changeover also required substantialorganisational, logistical, technical and
economic efforts by everyone involved in theuse and handling of banknotes and coins.Above all, however, the success of the euro

cash changeover depended on the favourableattitude of and swift acceptance by all citizens.And now, the 300 million citizens of the euro

area have fully embraced their new currency,thereby endorsing the idea of a moreintegrated Europe.The second key event of 2002 was thedecision of the EU Heads of State orGovernment in December to allow ten new
countries to join the EU in 2004, although
this decision still needs to be ratified. Thehistoric dimension of this enlargement is

threefold. First, it clearly marks the end ofpost-war rifts within Europe and is thereforeof deep political significance. Second, this
wave of enlargement is the largest everundertaken by the EU. Finally, as most ofthe prospective Member States are still in

transition to fully-fledged market economies,the disparities are much greater than inprevious enlargements. This therefore poses

a major challenge for both current and future
Member States.How quickly the new Member States adoptthe euro Œ once they have joined the EU 
Œwill depend on how quickly they fulfil the
convergence criteria for entry into the euroarea. Differences in economic developmentbetween the new Member States may mean
that not all countries adopt the euro at the
same time. Nonetheless, one of theEurosystem™s key priorities is to have thetechnical and institutional infrastructure foran enlarged European System of CentralBanks (ESCB) in place from 2004, in line with

the timetable for EU enlargement. As part ofthe preparations for enlargement, theGoverning Council of the European Central
Bank (ECB) has also issued a recommendationon the adjustment of its voting modalities in
line with the relevant provisions of the Nice

Treaty. Furthermore, the Eurosystem alreadyenjoys close contacts with the central banksof the acceding countries and will increasingly
monitor economic, financial, institutional andlegal developments in these countries. ThisAnnual Report therefore includes a special
chapter on the enlargement process.
The conduct of monetary policy in 2002 wascharacterised by a high degree of uncertaintywith regard to the economic outlook.Average inflation, measured in terms of
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP), was 2.2%, slightly lower than in 2001(2.4%), but still slightly above levels consistent3ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
with the ECB™s definition of price stability.The average annual growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3 increased to above
7%, from around 5½% in 2001, considerablyexceeding the reference value of 4½%. Thisdevelopment was the result of high volatility

in financial markets, and largely reflected
investors™ preferences for short-term liquid
and less risky financial assets. It also reflected
the relatively low interest rates in the euroarea in 2002. Strong monetary growth hasseen more liquidity accumulate in the euro
area than is needed to finance sustainablenon-inflationary growth over the longer term.Overall, however, in view of the relatively
subdued pace of economic activity and giventhat some of the portfolio shifts into M3
were likely to be only of a temporary nature,

monetary developments in 2002 were not
seen as pointing to risks to price stability.This assessment was confirmed by the
relatively moderate growth of credit in 2002.To our disappointment, economic growth inthe euro area was lower than expectedin 2002, leading to relatively low, butstill positive, real GDP growth of 0.8%,
compared with 1.4% in 2001. Weak economicconditions prevailed as a number of factorscontributed to an unusually high level of
uncertainty: geopolitical tensions and theirimpact on oil prices and confidence, adversefinancial market developments (which did not,
however, threaten financial stability in theeuro area) and the persistence of globalimbalances. In this context, and given the
gradual strengthening of the euro in 2002and early 2003, upward pressures on inflation
abated, particularly in the second half of this
period. This led the Governing Council to
cut the key ECB interest rates by 50 basispoints in December 2002, and by another
25 basis points in March 2003.Despite these subdued economic conditions,the inflation rate in the euro area remainedrelatively high. However, prices were pushedup in 2002 by a number of temporary or
one-off factors: base effects, increases in
indirect taxation and adverse weatherconditions. Furthermore, real wage growth
remained strong despite the rise inunemployment, a factor pointing to persistentstructural rigidities in the labour markets.It is acknowledged that some of the price
increases last year in some euro area
countries were associated with the euro cashchangeover. However, the perceived impactof the euro cash changeover on inflation

was much greater than the actual impact.Consumers tend to notice increases in theprice of goods and services purchased on a
frequent basis more than the relativelymoderate increases, or even decreases, inthe price of infrequently purchased items,

which account for a larger share of a
household™s budget. Moreover, coincident butindependent upward pressures on prices,
such as those resulting from adverse weatherconditions in the winter of 2001/02, were
erroneously associated with the euro cash

changeover. The very modest overall effectof the cash changeover on price increases islikely to be temporary. Indeed, it is expected
that the introduction of the euro will help tokeep price increases low in the medium term,
as the new currency has increased cross-
border price transparency in the euro area,
thereby intensifying competition.In early 2003, the prospects for price stabilityin the medium term look rather favourable,
provided that wage developments remain
moderate. Moreover, one of the mainmessages of 2002 still applies, namely thatthe pace of structural reforms should be
stepped up. This is because more flexiblelabour and product markets lead to fasterprice adjustments (thereby facilitating the
work of monetary policy-makers) and, moregenerally, to lower price increases.Despite the difficult circumstances for theformulation of monetary policy, the low levelof long-term inflation expectations and risk
premia currently prevailing in bond marketswould seem to suggest that economic actorshave confidence in the ECB™s ability tomaintain price stability in the mediumterm. Given the economic uncertainty, theECB™s monetary policy strategy continued to4provide a very useful frame of reference forboth the Governing Council (in takingappropriate monetary policy decisions) and
financial markets and economic actors (inguiding their expectations regarding monetarypolicy actions).The uncertainties surrounding economicdevelopments in 2002 underlined the
importance of a stability-orientedmacroeconomic policy framework as abeacon for economic actors. In the field of
monetary policy, the stability-orientedframework assigns to the ECB the primaryobjective of maintaining price stability,
independently from third parties. In fiscalpolicy, the Treaty establishing the EuropeanCommunity and the Stability and Growth Pact
serve as the anchor for economic actors™expectations. This conceptual frameworkhas also been confirmed by the European
Convention, which is drafting a ﬁTreatyestablishing a Constitution for Europeﬂin preparation for the forthcoming
Intergovernmental Conference. The adoptionof such a Constitution would be an importantstep for Europe, and it would further
strengthen the framework for EMU.Fiscal developments in the euro area weregenerally disappointing in 2002. The averagebudget deficit increased to 2.2% of GDP,from 1.6% in 2001. Most countries failed to
comply with the fiscal targets set in theirstability programmes. The ECOFIN Councildeclared, in November 2002 and January 2003
respectively, that Portugal and Germany hadexcessive deficits. ECOFIN also adopted arecommendation in January 2003 giving an
early warning to France to try to preventthe occurrence of an excessive deficit. In 2002France™s budget deficit exceeded the 3%
reference value for the deficit-to-GDP ratioas laid down in the Treaty.Contrary to what is often claimed, theStability and Growth Pact is not a straitjacketcommitting countries to pursue pro-cyclical
budgetary policies. Instead, provided thatcountries achieve a medium-term budgetaryposition close to balance or in surplus, thePact provides flexibility for the full functioningof automatic stabilisers. Countries that arenow struggling to put their fiscal house in
order did not reduce their budget deficitssufficiently in previous years when economicconditions were relatively favourable.
Countries that did adhere to the rules of theStability and Growth Pact are nowexperiencing fewer budgetary difficulties and
are benefiting from the smooth operation ofautomatic stabilisers. To remedy the currentfiscal imbalances, countries with a deficit close
to or exceeding 3% of GDP should embarkon growth-fostering fiscal consolidationmeasures to bring their budgetary position
into line with the requirements of the Stabilityand Growth Pact.This Annual Report summarises the activitiesof the ECB, the Eurosystem and the ESCB in2002 and provides an overview of monetary,
economic and financial developments in theeuro area in 2002 and early 2003. The ECBhad 1,105 staff members at the end of 2002,
compared with 1,043 in 2001. The number ofstaff is expected to increase in 2003 to1,263.5, in particular to meet the demands
of ESCB enlargement. In 2002 the ECBconcluded an agreement with the City ofFrankfurt to acquire a site on which to
build its own premises; it has subsequentlylaunched an international architecturalcompetition to develop what will be the
ECB™s final site. When completed, it willenable the ECB to house its entire staff undera single roof rather than in separate rented
office blocks, as is currently the case.This will be the last foreword of an ECBAnnual Report to bear my signature. I amvery proud to have been the ECB™s firstPresident, and to have had the privilege and
honour of overseeing the formative years ofthe ECB and the Eurosystem, including suchhistoric events as the start of the third stage
of EMU and the introduction of the eurobanknotes and coins. I would like to thank allmy colleagues on the Executive Board, the
Governing Council and the General Councilfor their fruitful collaboration over the pastfive years. I am also very grateful to the5ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Members of the European Parliament, and inparticular its Committee on Economic andMonetary Affairs, the European Council, the
ECOFIN Council and the EuropeanCommission. And by no means last, I wouldlike to thank the staff of the ECB and the
Eurosystem national central banks for theircontinuous support and commitment tomaking the introduction of the euro and the
functioning of Monetary Union a success. I
am immensely proud to have had the
opportunity to work with them on this

unique, historic project. But above all I wouldlike to thank the citizens of Europe for putting
their trust in the euro and its guardian. I can
assure you that, both now and in the future,the ECB will endeavour to live up to theexpectations of European citizens, and willcontinue to maintain the purchasing power
of our currency, to the benefit of all.Frankfurt am Main, March 2003

 2002
81Overview: monetary policy decisions in 2002
The environment in which monetary policyoperated in 2002 was one of considerableuncertainty. Signals regarding medium-terminflationary pressures were at times mixed and
subject to change. Following the slowdown ineconomic activity throughout 2001, which wasfurther aggravated by the negative shocks to
confidence in connection with the terroristattacks in the United States in September ofthat year, the beginning of 2002 saw a moderate
recovery of real GDP growth in the euroarea. However, as the year progressed, therecovery lost momentum, affected by the
renewed turbulence in financial markets andgeopolitical tensions which had consequencesfor oil prices and confidence. Overall, annual
real GDP growth in the euro area is estimatedat 0.8% in 2002, having been 1.4% in 2001.Despite the subdued pace of economicrecovery, HICP inflation slowed down onlymoderately, from 2.4% on average in 2001 to

2.2% in 2002, thus remaining slightly above theupper limit of the ECB™s definition of pricestability. In the first half of the year, temporary
factors Œ such as unfavourable weatherconditions affecting food prices Œ contributedto the higher inflation rates, and other elements,such as monetary and wage developments, gaverise to concerns regarding the maintenance of
price stability in the euro area over the mediumterm. Later on in the year, a significant increasein oil prices introduced some upward pressure
on consumer prices, but other factors helpedto dampen inflationary risks. These related tothe protracted subdued pace of economic
growth as well as to the significant appreciationof the euro.Given these counterbalancing factors, duringmost of 2002 the Governing Council kept theminimum bid rate on its main refinancing
operation unchanged at 3.25%. However, asthe weakness in economic activity did notdissipate amid persistent geopolitical tensions,
and given the sustained appreciation of theeuro, inflationary pressures were seen as havingdiminished. As a consequence, the Governing
Council decided to reduce the key ECB interestrates by 50 basis points in December 2002 andagain by 25 basis points in March 2003 (see

The monetary policy decisions taken in 2002and at the beginning of 2003 should also
be seen in the light of the significant reduction
in the key ECB interest rates (by a totalof 150 basis points, with the rate on themain refinancing operations being lowered
to 3.25% on 8 November 2001) decidedby the Governing Council in 2001. In 2001, andnotably after the terrorist attacks in September
of that year, the evidence available indicatedthat the slowdown in economic activity in theeuro area was likely to last longer and be more
pronounced than previously expected, therebycontributing to containing upward pricepressures. At the same time, the impact of
previous upward shocks to prices Œ stemmingfrom oil price increases, the depreciation ofthe euro in 1999 and 2000 and the food
price increases in early 2001 Œ was graduallyfading. Overall, these factors pointed to lowerinflationary pressures over the medium term
and, together with the slowdown in economicactivity, were expected to support wagemoderation. This assessment was not
contradicted by the analysis of monetary data.Monetary growth strengthened in the secondhalf of 2001, in particular after the terrorist
attacks, but this largely reflected shifts in privateinvestors™ portfolios from shares and otherlonger-term financial assets towards more
liquid, relatively safe short-term assets includedin M3. Furthermore, the annual growth of creditto the private sector continued to decline.In the first few months of 2002, and startingwith the analysis under the first pillar of the
ECB™s monetary policy strategy, M3 growthmoderated somewhat, following the largeportfolio shifts witnessed in autumn 2001.
However, this moderation proceeded at a veryslow pace and then came to a halt in the secondquarter of 2002, when there was a notable
strengthening in the demand for M1. In additionto the persistence of uncertainty in the stockmarkets, the low opportunity cost of holding
money seemed to be driving monetaryexpansion during this period. Also in early2002, the growth rate of loans to the private
sector continued to decline, although itappeared to stabilise in the second quarter ofthe year. At this time, the fact that there was
significantly more liquidity available in the euroarea than may have been needed to financesustainable, non-inflationary economic growth
was increasingly becoming a matter of concern.Turning to the analysis under the second pillarin the first half of 2002, the incominginformation in early 2002 confirmed the
Governing Council™s earlier expectations with
regard to the economic outlook for the euroarea. The evidence available in the first fewmonths of the year started to indicate that the
trough in economic activity may have beenattained in late 2001 and that a recovery waslikely to take place in the course of 2002.
Uncertainty vis-à-vis the global environmentseemed to decrease somewhat. In the euroarea, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth

turned positive in the first quarter of the year,and survey data started to indicate that a firmingof economic activity could be taking hold. The
expectation of an economic recovery wassupported by the absence of any majormacroeconomic imbalances in the euro area
which could require a lengthy adjustmentprocess. In this environment, the low interestrates and the beneficial effects on real
disposable income from the expected declinesin inflation were considered to underpin growthin domestic demand.Projections by the Eurosystem™s staff, as well asforecasts by international organisations and
private institutions, painted a broadly similarpicture in the spring of 2002. The generalexpectation was that euro area real GDP
growth would again be in line with trend
potential growth later in the year and stabiliseat those levels in 2003. The expectation of a
relatively smooth economic recovery was alsoin line with the expectations of financialmarkets, as embedded in bond yields. Despite
this expectation, the precise pattern of theeconomic upswing remained uncertain, notleast in the context of substantially increasing
oil prices and the macroeconomic imbalanceselsewhere in the world.With regard to consumer price inflation, annualinflation rates at the beginning of 2002 wererelatively high, starting from a level of 2.7% inECB  Annual Report 
 2002
10January. The HICP inflation rate was alsosomewhat erratic in early 2002, mainly owingto exceptional and short-lived factors: adverse
weather conditions which led to higher food
prices, higher indirect taxes and adverse baseeffects from developments in energy prices in
early 2001. The overall impact of the euro cashchangeover on the price level was deemed tobe small, despite some upward impact on prices,
in particular for certain services. The annualgrowth rates of the HICP gradually declinedafter the first couple of months of the year,

mainly on account of base effects. However,this decline took place at a relatively slow pace,partly owing to the oil price increases that had
occurred in early 2002. At the same time, itwas of concern that inflation excluding themore volatile energy and unprocessed food
components was persistently high, reflectingdevelopments in services prices in particular.Furthermore, wage trends were not reassuring.
Overall, developments in inflation weretherefore somewhat less favourable thanforeseen at the end of 2001.Against this background, in the first few monthsof 2002 the Governing Council became
increasingly concerned that monetarydevelopments, wage trends and the highpersistence of services price inflation could

imply upward risks to price stability in themedium term. However, the appreciation ofthe euro which started in the spring dampened
the upward risks to price stability. Furthermore,an important factor shaping the monetary policyassessment at that time was that the economic
outlook was still subject to uncertainty. Giventhat some factors pointed to increasinginflationary pressures, although there was still
uncertainty surrounding the fundamentalstrength of economic growth (which in turncould also fundamentally affect the outlook for
price stability), the Governing Council was ofthe view that the information available at thattime sent out inconclusive signals as regards
the balance of risks to price stability over themedium term.In the second half of 2002, concerns regardingthe economic outlook strengthened, asreflected in the negative performance offinancial markets. The renewed sharp falls inglobal stock market prices during the summerreinforced the downward trend in progress in
these markets since the record highs of early2000. Although the overvaluation of stocksis always difficult to assess precisely, the
stock market declines were partly a correctionof past excesses. They were caused byfactors such as increased market uncertainty
regarding the reliability of financial accountinginformation, weaker than expected corporateearnings and the gradual increase in geopolitical
tensions, also given their consequences for oil
prices. The evidence available suggests thatdespite the significant increase in equity holdings
by euro area households starting in the late1990s, the direct effects of stock marketchanges on consumer spending are typically
smaller in the euro area than in other majoreconomies. However, the fact that the stockmarket decline was of a global nature increased
the likelihood that the euro area economywould be affected by international linkages. Inaddition, turbulence in stock markets made it
more expensive for corporations to raise fundsin the equity markets. These declines werealso accompanied by an increase in the spread
on bond funding for euro area firms, especiallythe lower-rated companies. Apart from theuncertainty in financial markets, the persistence
of major macroeconomic imbalances outsidethe euro area also continued to weigh on theclimate of uncertainty prevailing in the euro
area and the world in general.These factors were reflected in forward-lookingindicators. Following a continued improvementup to mid-2002, confidence indicators andsurvey data suggested that a further
acceleration of economic activity was no longer
likely that year. Furthermore, geopoliticaltensions heightened in the second half of 2002,
leading to a sharp increase in oil prices. Theeconomic recovery in the euro area and theworld economy therefore seemed set to
progress more slowly in the second half of2002 than had been expected at the beginningof the year. In view of this, and in line with a
similar assessment by public and privateinstitutions as well as the Eurosystem staffprojections, the Governing Council gradually11ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
scaled down its expectations for economicgrowth during the remainder of the year andthe first few months of 2003. As a consequence,
an increase in real GDP growth rates wasexpected to occur only in the course of 2003.The data on economic activity which became
available in the second half of 2002 and early2003 confirmed that economic growth hadindeed remained very weak.As regards price developments, HICP inflationhovered around 2%, the upper limit of the
ECB™s definition of price stability, in the secondhalf of the year. Furthermore, HICP inflationexcluding the more volatile items of energy
and unprocessed food prices remainedrelatively high, at rates of around 2½%,reflecting in particular the strong dynamics in
services prices, which could, in turn, betraced Œ at least in part Œ to the upward trendin nominal wage increases that had persisted
until the beginning of 2002. All in all, the factthat consumer price inflation continued toremain at these levels suggested that the
structural rigidities present in the euro areamight have hampered an appropriateadjustment of wages and prices in the context
of weak economic growth.However, looking ahead, the subdued economicactivity was seen as a factor that wouldeventually limit the potential upward risks to
price stability. Although wage-related risks had
not disappeared, they were deemed less likelyto materialise as long as the economicenvironment did not change substantially. The
higher level of the euro in the second half of2002 and in the first few months of 2003compared with the first half of 2002 was also
expected to contribute further towardsreducing inflationary pressures.The assessment of the implications for pricestability of monetary developments was lessstraightforward in the second half of 2002.
While monetary growth remained strong afterthe summer, the factors underlying themonetary trends had to be assessed with
caution. On the one hand, the continuedstrength of monetary growth was, to a largeextent, triggered by the turbulence in stockmarkets, which increased the attraction ofinvestors to liquid and safe assets included inM3. On the other hand, it was a consequence
of the low opportunity cost of holding money,as the low level of interest rates prevailingin the euro area tended to stimulate
monetary expansion, reflected in particularin a significant increase in the narrowaggregate M1. Taking a long-term perspective,
the strong monetary growth in the euro areacontinued to be of concern, as more liquiditywas available than may have been needed to
finance sustainable non-inflationary growth.However, the Governing Council consideredthat the risk of this excess liquidity translating
into inflationary pressures was small in anenvironment of subdued economic growth.This assessment was supported by the
moderation in the annual growth of loans tothe private sector, particularly to non-financial corporations.Overall, reflecting weak economic growth andthe appreciation of the euro, the evidence
from the autumn of 2002 onwards graduallystarted to point to an easing of inflationarypressures. Although tensions in the oil markets
made it difficult to forecast short-terminflation developments, this analysis led to theassessment that there were improved prospects
for inflation to fall to below 2% in the course of2003 and remain in line with price stabilitythereafter. As a result, the Governing Council
decided to reduce the key ECB interest ratesby 50 basis points at its meeting on 5 December2002 and again by 25 basis points on 6 March
2003. The minimum bid rate on themain refinancing operations thereby reached2.50%, which was a very low level by historical
standards. The decisions to reduce the keyECB interest rates were expected to providesome counterweight to the various factors
having an adverse effect on economic activity,thereby contributing to the preservation ofprice stability over the medium term.At its meeting on 5 December the GoverningCouncil also reviewed the reference value for
monetary growth, which plays an importantrole under the first pillar of the ECB™s monetarypolicy strategy. It decided to leave the valueECB  Annual Report 
 2002
12unchanged at an annual growth rate of 4½%for the broad aggregate M3. This decision wasbased on the fact that the evidence continues
to support the assumptions which have formedthe basis for deriving the reference value sinceDecember 1998, namely those relating to trend
potential output growth of 2-2½% per annumand to a trend decline in M3 income velocity of½-1% per annum in the euro area. In December
2002 the Governing Council restated that thereference value is a medium-term conceptwhich needs to be borne in mind whencomparing ongoing developments in M3 withthe reference value. Indeed, the experience of
the last two years suggests that short-term
movements of M3 do not necessarily haveimplications for future price developments
and that deviations of M3 from the referencevalue must be analysed in conjunction withother real and financial indicators in order
for their implications for price stability to beunderstood.Box 1Experiences with the impact on money market volatility of the Governing Council™sdecision to switch to monthly assessments of the monetary policy stanceAt its meeting on 8 November 2001, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that it would henceforth, as arule, assess the monetary policy stance only at its first meeting of the month and normally take interest ratedecisions only at this meeting. One of the aims of this decision was to contribute to a stabilisation of financial
markets. Although the monetary policy decisions of the ECB have generally been predictable since the start of
Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union,1 market uncertainty sometimes surrounded the exact timing
and magnitude of such decisions. The high frequency of the meetings is likely to have contributed to thisuncertainty. In this respect, it was considered that switching to monthly monetary policy decisions would also
contribute to a stabilising of the bidding behaviour of counterparties in the regular refinancing operations.With fewer opportunities for markets to focus on interest rate changes, there would evidently be fewerincentives for speculative behaviour, and thus interest rates in the ECB™s tender operations would become less
volatile.Against this background, this box examines whether market interest rates have become more stable since thechange in the frequency of monetary policy meetings. It focuses on money market interest rates at very shortmaturities, since it is these which should mainly be affected by the reduction in the frequency of the monetary
policy meetings. However, such an analysis is not easy to conduct, as it is difficult to control for all the otherelements which may potentially affect the volatility of these money market rates, including the frequency ofchanges in the key ECB interest rates.In principle, it can be expected that the reduced frequency of monetary policy meetings would lower thevolatility of money market rates mainly at short-end maturities. At the same time, the switch to monthly

monetary policy meetings can hardly be expected to have any influence at the long end of the money marketcurve, which rather tends to signal the degree of macroeconomic uncertainty.The chart below shows the volatility pattern from daily to one-year money market interest rates between4 January 1999 and 8 November 2001 and from 9 November 2001 onwards. The volatility of the one-yearinterest rates after the change to monthly monetary policy meetings is similar to the volatility in the previous
period. This indicates that the general uncertainty did not change much in the period following the decision toswitch to monthly monetary policy meetings. However, the volatility in shorter-term interest rates was significantly

 2002
reduced after the change in the frequency of monetary policy meetings. While it is difficult to reach firmconclusions after only one year, the decline in volatility may indicate that uncertainty as regards the timing of
the monetary policy decisions has indeed been reduced in conjunction with the decision to hold monetarypolicy meetings less frequently.2Monetary and financial developments
2.1Monetary developments
M3 growth remained strong in the course of2002The average annual growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3 increased to 7.4%in 2002, from 5.5% in 2001. Following a

substantial strengthening in the second halfof 2001, annual M3 growth moderatedsomewhat in the first few months of 2002
to stabilise at around 7% thereafter (seeChart 2). While the three-month movingaverage of the annual growth rates of M3

also declined somewhat in the course of 2002,
it exceeded the reference value of 4
½%considerably over the course of the year.The strong monetary growth observed in2002 continued to reflect, to a large extent,

developments in financial markets. As wasalso the case in the second half of 2001, non-MFI investors demonstrated a pronounced
preference for safe and liquid assets inresponse to declining stock prices and highvolatility in financial markets. Following the
normalisation in global stock markets in late2001 and early 2002 Œ as indicated by the
slight recovery in stock prices and the sharp
fall in implied stock market volatility Œ the
short-term dynamics of M3 weakened
somewhat in the first few months of 2002.
Thereafter, however, against a background ofrenewed declines in stock prices andheightened stock market volatility, non-MFI

14investors once again showed a strongpreference for safe and liquid assets. While,
over the summer months, funds wereinvested both in M3 instruments and longer-
term interest-bearing assets at the expense
of equity, later on funds seemed to have againbeen mainly directed towards short-termassets included in M3, reflecting a flattening

of the yield curve and higher volatility in bondmarkets. In line with these developments, theshorter-term dynamics of M3 strengthened
considerably towards the end of the year.However, portfolio shifts were not the onlyfactor driving strong monetary dynamics in2002. It is likely that M3 growth was alsofuelled by the low level of short-term interest
rates and thus relatively low opportunitycosts of holding, in particular, the most liquidcomponents of M3. This is reflected in the
gradual rise in the annual growth rate of thenarrow monetary aggregate M1 to 8.8% inthe fourth quarter of 2002, from 5.5% in the
same quarter of 2001.
This protracted period of strong monetarygrowth has resulted in the accumulation of more
liquidity in the euro area than may be needed tofinance sustainable non-inflationary growth. Thisis illustrated by indicators of excess liquidity. In

Chart 3, the measure of the nominal money gapis defined as the difference between the actuallevel of M3 and the level of M3 implied by
continuous monetary growth in line with thereference value of 4½% since December 1998(taken as the base period). Furthermore, the
measure of the real money gap is defined as thedifference between the actual level of M3deflated by the HICP and the level of M3 in real
terms implied by nominal monetary growth inline with the reference value of 4½% and a levelof inflation in line with the ECB™s definition ofprice stability, again taking December 1998 asthe base period.1 Having declined slightly during
the first few months of 2002, both the nominal

and the real money gaps gradually increased,and by late 2002 they reached their highestlevel since the start of Stage Three of Economicand Monetary Union (EMU).These strong monetary dynamics in 2002were mainly driven by developments in M1
and marketable instruments (see Table 1).Within M1, there was a strong rebound inthe annual growth rate of currency in
circulation. After the level fell by nearly one-third in the run-up to the euro cashchangeover in 2001, economic agents rebuilt
their currency holdings relatively quickly in2002. This mainly reflected the reversal ofprevious shifts from currency to overnight
deposits and other short-term depositsincluded in M3, but also a revival in thedemand for euro banknotes by non-euro area
residents, as suggested by data from the euro
area balance of payments. Owing to the
reversal of previous shifts out of currency,
the annual growth rate of overnight depositsdeclined somewhat in the course of 2002,but remained relatively high. As noted above,developments in M1 as a whole seemed tomainly reflect the low opportunity costs of
holding currency and overnight deposits. Inaddition, the turbulence in financial markets

probably also led to an increase in the demand
for very liquid assets, particularly in thesecond half of the year.By contrast, the annual growth rate of short-term deposits other than overnight deposits

declined in 2002, to 4.9% in the last quarter,
from 5.9% in the same quarter of 2001. Thisdecline was mainly driven by developments in
short-term time deposits (i.e. deposits withan agreed maturity of up to two years) which
were partly compensated for by stronger
annual growth in short-term savings deposits(i.e. deposits redeemable at a period of noticeof up to three months). The comparatively
low level of the retail rate differentialbetween both types of short-term depositsseemingly made the holding of short-term
savings deposits relatively attractive. Thedecline in the annual growth rate of totalshort-term deposits other than overnight

remained relatively high and stood at 8.4% in
the last quarter of 2002. In addition, theshorter-term dynamics strengthened in the
second half of 2002, suggesting renewedportfolio shifts to M3 in the context of greatuncertainty in financial markets. Within
marketable instruments, growth in moneymarket fund shares and units was particularlystrong in 2002. These instruments are often
used to ﬁparkﬂ funds in times of financial
market turbulence.Monetary growth also remained strong inJanuary 2003, due to ongoing portfolio shifts
and the low level of short-term interest rates.

The three-month average of the annualgrowth rates of M3 increased to 7.1% in theperiod from November 2002 to January 2003,
from 6.9% in the period from October toDecember 2002.Continued slowdown in credit growth to the
private sectorChart 4 provides an overview of movementsin M3 and its counterparts in the consolidatedMFI balance sheet in 2002. Overall, the strong
growth in M3 was accompanied by declining
growth in total credit granted by MFIs toeuro area residents, increasing growth in the
longer-term financial liabilities (excludingcapital and reserves) of MFIs and higher netexternal assets of the euro area MFI sector.Looking at these developments in more detail,and beginning with credit developments, the
average annual growth rate of total credit
granted by MFIs to euro area residentsdeclined to 4.5% in 2002, from 5.4% in 2001.
This development was driven by a significantdecline in the annual growth rate of credit tothe private sector, while the annual growth
rate of credit to general government turnedpositive in 2002 (see Table 2).The decline in the annual rate of growth ofcredit to the private sector reflecteddevelopments in MFI loans, the annual growth

rate of which fell to 4.8% in the last quarterof 2002, from 6.5% in the same quarter of2001. In terms of sectoral developments, theannual rate of growth of MFI loans to non-

financial corporations fell significantly, partlyreflecting weaker merger and acquisitionactivity, while the annual growth rate of loans
to households rose somewhat. (For moredetails on developments in loans by sector,see the sub-section on developments in the
debt financing of the euro area non-financialsectors in Section 2.2.)Overall, in 2002 the average annual growthrate of loans to the private sector was, in
real terms, somewhat below its long-term
average since 1980. However, loan dynamicsdid not seem particularly weak given the
environment of subdued economic growth
and high economic uncertainty. Therefore,the data on growth in loans did not seemto point to any widespread credit constraints
in the euro area. At the same time, it cannotbe ruled out that in some countries MFIsmay have adopted a more cautious lendingapproach towards some sectors of theeconomy.Finally, the rise in the growth of credit togeneral government reflected the increasedfinancing needs of general government in the
euro area, partly on account of lower fiscal
revenues against a background of modesteconomic growth.Turning to the other counterparts of M3, theannual growth rate of longer-term financial
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) of
MFIs increased significantly in the first threequarters of 2002. Initially, this may have been
a reflection of the steepening of the yield

curve up to spring 2002, but subsequentlyalso of the renewed increase in uncertaintyin global stock markets. In the last quarter of
2002 the annual growth rate of longer-term
financial liabilities (excluding capital andreserves) of MFIs remained broadly stable,
suggesting that the fuelling impact of stockmarket developments had been compensatedfor by the effects of the fall in long-termChart 4Movements in M3 and its counterparts(annual flows, end of period; EUR billions; not adjusted for seasonal and calendar effects)Source: ECB.M3 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5M3 longer-term financialliabilities (excludingcapital and reserves)(4)credit to the privatesector(1)credit to generalgovernment(2)net external assets(3)other counterparts(including capital andreserves)(5)Q4 2001Q1 2002Q2 2002Q3 2002Q4 2002-200-1000100

18interest rates and possibly also by a rise inbond market volatility.Finally, the 12-month flows in net externalassets of the euro area MFI sector continuedto increase considerably during the course of2002. In the 12-month period up to
December 2002, net external assets of euroarea MFIs rose by 164 billion, while in the12-month period up to December 2001 their

net external assets remained broadly stable.This significant improvement in the netexternal asset position of euro area MFIs
reflected both a substantial improvement in
the euro area current account balance andnet inflows to the euro area of combined
direct and portfolio investment. The latter netinflows were related to, inter alia, subduedportfolio investment by euro area residents in
foreign equity and debt instruments.In summary, annual M3 growth remainedbuoyant in 2002, resulting in the accumulationof more liquidity than may be needed tofinance sustainable non-inflationary growth in
the euro area. While there were some
indications in the first few months of 2002 ofa slight moderation in monetary growth
related to a slow reversal of past portfolio
shifts, these developments were notconfirmed thereafter. On the contrary, lateron new portfolio shifts resulted in a further
increase in excess liquidity measures. Thishigh excess liquidity was considered apotential risk to price stability in the medium
term if it were not corrected over time.However, given the subdued economicgrowth in 2002, the risk of the accumulated
excess liquidity translating into inflationarypressures was considered to be 
small, a viewthat prevailed in the second half of 2002 in

particular. The continued moderation in theannual growth rate of loans to the private sectorsupported this assessment.2.2Financial markets
Declining growth in the issuance of debt
securitiesIn 2002 the market for debt securities issuedby euro area residents continued to grow,
although at a slower pace than in 2001. Theamount of debt securities outstanding increasedby 6.4% between end-2001 and end-2002,
compared with 7.1% in 2001. The annual growthof the amount of short-term securitiesoutstanding increased from 4.1% at the end of

the year. Meanwhile, there was a decrease in
the annual rate of growth of the amount oflong-term debt securities outstanding to 5.8%

in 2002, from 7.4% in the previous year.Issuance activity in 2002 saw a contrastbetween a decline in the private sector and arise in the general government sector,reflecting, among other factors, differences
in the financing needs of these sectors at atime of weak economic growth.
The annual growth of the total amountoutstanding of debt securities issued by thegeneral government increased from 3.4% at
the end of 2001 to 5.0% at the end of
2002, with both the central government andthe other government sub-sectors stepping
up the pace of their issuance activity (seeChart 5). The amount outstanding of debt
securities of the other government sub-
sector, which is primarily comprised of localand regional governments, grew by 27.4% in
2002, from 24.0% at the end of 2001, reflecting

less favourable budgetary developments and theresulting increased borrowing requirements bythese parts of government.Within the private sector, the annual growthof the total amount outstanding of debt
securities issued by MFIs decreased slightly
from 5.5% at the end of 2001 to 4.6% at theend of 2002. This decline in issuance activitymay have reflected lower funding needs

of MFIs due to subdued loan demand bythe private non-financial sector against abackground of sluggish economic activity,
combined with continued strong inflows ofdeposits to MFIs.For the private non-MFI sector, the annualgrowth rate of the amount outstanding
of euro-denominated debt securities issued
by non-financial corporations declinedconsiderably to 3.7% at the end of 2002, from
19.3% at the end of 2001. The amount
outstanding of debt securities issued by non-monetary financial corporations grew by
26.8% in 2002, compared with 45.1% at the

end of 2001. The continued strong growth inthe pace of issuance activity in this sectormay have reflected, in part, a shift from direct
issuance by the non-financial corporate sectorto indirect issuance via special purposevehicles (SPVs) located in the non-monetary
financial corporate sector. Increased issuance

20activity via this channel may reflect the factthat this source of structured financegenerally benefits from high credit ratings.

Nevertheless, the overall slower growth inthe amount outstanding of debt securitiesissued by the private non-MFI sector took
place in an environment of reduced needs forworking capital financing and rising investorconcerns about credit risk. The latter was
reflected in a deterioration of corporate
financing conditions as corporate bondspreads at the lower end of the credit quality
spectrum widened considerably, reaching
relatively high levels in the course of 2002 incomparison with previous years. During the

year, rating downgrades among investment-grade companies also tended to rise. Thismeant that the funding costs in the corporate
bond markets of those companies thatdescended through the quality spectrum Œwhich became ﬁfallen angelsﬂ after losing their
investment-grade status Œ rose by more than
the widening of spreads.
Even though the annual growth rate of the
amount outstanding of euro-denominateddebt securities declined considerably,
corporate financing conditions did notdeteriorate severely. Debt securities issuance
activity remained quite sustained. Moreover,
for investment-grade debt securities overallfunding costs improved, as the widening ofspreads over government bonds was more
than offset by the drops in long-term
government bond yields (see Chart 11(a)).Overall, the euro-denominated corporatebond market showed a substantial degree of

resilience.Underlying the weak issuance activity of theprivate sector was a notable decrease in thegrowth of the amounts outstanding of short-term debt securities. When faced with
widespread corporate credit ratingdowngrades, as mentioned above, someissuers found market conditions easier for
issuing long-term as opposed to short-termpaper, as some investors would not take upshort-term paper below certain credit ratings.Despite the fall in growth rates, the
proportion of debt securities outstanding
issued by both non-monetary financial andnon-financial corporations in total resident
issues was slightly up at the end of 2002 at
12.5%, compared with 11.6% at the end of2001 (see Table 3). Mirroring this smallchange, the shares of the MFI and the general
government sectors in the stock of euro-
denominated debt securities also remained
broadly unchanged at 36.1% and 51.4%
respectively at the end of 2002. In terms ofboth amounts outstanding and overallissuance, these two sectors together
continued to dominate the securities marketfor euro-denominated debt.The share of gross issuance by euro arearesidents of euro-denominated debtsecurities in their total gross issuance in all

currencies was stable at around 93% in 2002.Also, the annual growth of non-euro-denominated debt securities issued by euro
area residents remained broadly stable at11.3% in 2002. Since the start of Stage Threeof EMU, the increase in euro area residents
™issuance of foreign currency-denominateddebt securities has been systematicallystronger than their issuance in euro. This
may be linked to the growinginternationalisation of capital markets, whichhas encouraged increased currency
diversification by issuers of euro area debtsecurities (see Box 2 entitled ﬁRecentimprovements in securities issues statisticsﬂTable 3Sectoral shares of amounts outstandingof euro-denominated debt securitiesissued by euro area residents(as percentages; end of period)19981999200020012002

growth rate of debt financing of the euro
area non-financial sectors declined in thecourse of 2002 to around 4¼% in the fourthquarter, down from 5.4% in the last quarterof 2001 (see Table 4). This slightly downwardtrend reflected a continued fall in the annual
growth of debt financing of non-financialcorporations, while the annual growth ratesof debt financing of households and general
government increased somewhat comparedwith the last quarter of 2001 (see Chart 6).After a protracted decline between the thirdquarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 2002,the annual growth rate of debt financing of
households increased slightly, to around 6%in the fourth quarter of 2002. In particular,households™ long-term debt financing (i.e. with
an original maturity of over one year)continued to expand at a high pace, reflecting
to a large extent the strong growth of loans

for house purchase granted by euro area MFIs(see Table 5). This in turn was fuelled by

22continued strong increases in house prices insome euro area countries. As a consequenceof the robust growth of total debt financing

of households, the ratio of household debtto GDP rose slightly in 2002 and reachedaround 51% in the last quarter of the year(see Chart 7).The annual growth rate of debt financing ofnon-financial corporations declined to slightlybelow 4% in the fourth quarter of 2002, from

8.3% in the same quarter of 2001. In the firsthalf of 2002, this fall mainly reflected a strongdecline in the annual rate of change of short-
term borrowing (i.e. with an original maturityof up to one year). In particular, non-financialcorporations reduced their short-term loans

from euro area MFIs, which represent around75% of the amount outstanding of their short-
term debt. The annual growth rate of long-

term debt financing of non-financial
corporations remained rather strong in thisperiod. In the second half of 2002, by

contrast, the annual rate of growth of non-financial corporations™ long-term debt
financing also declined, to around 6
¾% in the
last quarter of 2002, compared with 10.0% inthe second quarter. This decrease was the
result of similar developments in both long-
term loans and long-term debt securitiesissuance. Overall, the ratio of non-financial
corporation debt to GDP broadly stabilised
at slightly above 62% in 2002 (see Chart 7).The moderation in the growth of debt financingof non-financial corporations mirroredsignificantly weaker merger and acquisition
activity and subdued real investment activity in
the context of weak aggregate demand and lowcorporate earnings. In addition, non-financialcorporations may have felt the need to improve
their balance sheet positions and reduce theirdebt levels. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that insome euro area countries MFIs took a
somewhat more cautious approach to granting
loans in reaction to the decline in corporate
profitability and decreases in the value of non-
financial corporations™ financial assets.
The annual growth rate of debt financing ofgeneral government fluctuated around 4% in2002, compared with 2.9% in the last quarterof 2001. This reflected increased fiscal
borrowing needs against the background ofpersistently subdued economic growth in theeuro area. The annual growth rate of short-Chart 6Debt financing of the euro areanon-financial sectors(annual percentage changes)Source: ECB.Note: For details, see Table 4.1999200020012002

term general government borrowingremained high, although declining somewhatin the second half of the year, while the annual
growth rate of long-term debt financingfluctuated around 3% only. This may indicatethat governments took advantage of the low
level of short-term interest rates to meettheir additional borrowing requirements.Stock prices declined further amid a high
level of uncertainty in 2002Continuing the correction that hadcommenced in March 2000, global stock
prices declined in the course of 2002, for thethird consecutive year. By the end of 2002,
stock prices had returned to levels that were
last seen in the aftermath of the financialcrisis of autumn 1998 (see Chart 8 (a)). Thefall in stock prices was accompanied by an
exceptionally high level of uncertainty, asmeasured by implied stock market volatility,notably in the period between mid-May and
early October (see Chart 8 (b) and Box 3).Overall, broad stock market indices in theUnited States, Japan and the euro areafollowed similar patterns in 2002, althoughJapanese stock prices were at times drivenprimarily by domestic factors. In early 2002,benchmark stock price indices were relativelystable and implied volatility stood at moderate
levels, as market participants generally
expected a gradual and steady economicrecovery. Between mid-May and late July,

however, stock prices came under significantdownward pressure, which was triggered inpart by mounting concerns about the
reliability of financial accounting informationdisclosed by corporations. This also pushedvolatility up to levels as high as in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks in theUnited States on 11 September 2001. Inaddition, weaker than expected corporate
earnings statements and a worsening of theglobal economic outlook contributed todepressing stock prices and raising volatility.In late July and throughout most of August,stock prices rebounded temporarily in the
United States and the euro area. This mainlyseemed to reflect relief among marketparticipants that accounting irregularities
might not, after all, have been as widespread
as earlier feared. In the course of September,however, fading optimism about the global
economic outlook, as well as an increase inprofit warnings, adversely affected stockprices, and all major indices saw sharp drops

24to year-lows in early October. In the fourthquarter of 2002, stock markets reboundedonce more. The rise in stock prices, which
was very strong in October and rather moretempered in November before being reversed
somewhat in December, took place against
a background of better than expected
corporate earnings statements and someimprovements in economic growth

expectations, especially in the United States.Overall, stock prices in the euro area, asmeasured by the broad Dow Jones EUROSTOXX index, dropped by 35% in 2002. Inthe United States, stock prices, as measured
by the Standard & Poor™s 500 index, declinedby 23% between end-2001 and end-2002,
while, in Japan, the Nikkei 225 index lost 19%
over the same period. During the second halfof the year implied stock market volatilityremained relatively high in the euro area
compared with the United States and Japan.The significant decline in euro area stockprices contributed to pushing price-earnings(P/E) ratios of euro area companies down to
levels close to historical averages. Bycontrast, in the United States, P/E ratiosremained somewhat above historical averages
in early 2003.In the United States, weaker than expectedcorporate earnings figures and a hesitant
recovery of economic activity sparked adownward trend in stock prices. In addition,
several cases of accounting irregularitiesraised concerns about the reliability of
corporate earnings data. In particular, in late
June, WorldCom, a telecommunications
company, disclosed the largest re-statement
of earnings in US corporate history,
prompting a sharp drop in stock prices and asimultaneous surge in market volatility. Thisinduced the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to order senior executives(a) Stock price indices in the euro area,the United States and Japan(1 January 1998 = 100; daily data)

of major US corporations to swear (for most
of them, before 14 August 2002) to theaccuracy of their financial statements with

the aim of abating the concerns aboutaccounting irregularities. As in the twoprevious years, the scale of the decline in US
stock prices in 2002 was particularlypronounced in the technology sector, withthe Nasdaq Composite index declining by 32%
overall in 2002.In Japan, stock prices rose during the firsthalf of the year, partly triggered by newmeasures introduced by the government totighten regulations on the short-selling of
equities. Later on, from the third quarteronwards, however, global factors took over,with high uncertainty leading to 
ﬁflight-to-safetyﬂ portfolio flows into the bond market
and pushing stock prices lower. Thedownward pressure continued towards the
end of the year, even though other majorstock markets rebounded, as domesticfactors, including mounting market concerns
about financial fragility and the resolution ofthe problem of non-performing bank loans,again weighed on Japanese stock prices. On
14 November, the Nikkei 225 index hit a19-year low.In the euro area, stock prices were stronglyinfluenced by the swings in US stock markets.However, the downward adjustment in the
euro area was more severe and took placeagainst a background of exceptionally highuncertainty, as measured by the implied
volatility derived from options on the DowJones EURO STOXX 50 index. While themain factors triggering the turbulence in
euro area stock markets appeared to havebeen spillovers prompted by the discoveryof accounting irregularities at large US
corporations and the continued uncertaintysurrounding the strength and timing of theglobal economic recovery, the stock price
decline in the euro area also reflecteda number of domestic factors. Amongthese was the relatively weak economic
performance of and the outlook for the euroarea economy vis-à-vis the US economy.
Second, the fact that long-term government
bond yields, which play a crucial role indetermining the discount factor for stocks,fell by more in the United States than in the
euro area during 2002, may have supportedthe US stock market to a larger degree.As regards the sectoral decomposition, thegeneral decline in euro area stock marketswas mainly driven by a significant decline
in stock prices in the technology,telecommunications and financial sectors,which fell by 52%, 36% and 36% respectively
in 2002. Taken together, these three sectorsaccounted for more than half of the totaldecline in the broad index in 2002. The
decrease in stock prices of technology-based corporations and telecommunicationsfirms seemed partly to reflect an ongoing
correction from the high levels of thelate 1990s as market participants continuedto revise their earnings expectations
downwards. Moreover, growing concernsabout the high level of indebtedness oftelecommunication corporations tended to

amplify the decline in stock prices in thissector. In the financial sector, the sharpdecline in equity markets in the course of the

second and third quarters had an adverseimpact both on the profitability of some banksand on the balance sheets of insurance

companies that were relatively heavilyexposed to changes in stock prices. Theinsurance sector was also adversely
influenced by losses resulting from naturaldisasters.The significant decline in stock prices in 2002,in addition to those seen in the previous twoyears, seemed to have had some negative
consequences for the euro area economy.There are basically four channels throughwhich the stock market can have a direct
impact on economic activity: wealth effectson private consumption, cost-of-capitaleffects on corporate investment, and balance
sheet and confidence effects on both
consumption and investment. However, theimportance of the precise impact of each

individual channel on economic activity is
hard to disentangle (see also Box 3 in theMonthly Bulletin of September 2002). ThisECB  Annual Report 
 2002
26notwithstanding, available empirical evidence,albeit scarce, suggests that the direct effects
of stock market developments on economic
activity in the euro area, though discernible,are significantly more limited than thoseobserved for the US economy where the
holding of equity is more widespread than inthe euro area. Nevertheless, the fact that the
stock market decline was of a global nature
increased the likelihood that the euro areaeconomy would be affected throughinternational economic linkages.In the period from end-2002 to 28 February2003 stock prices in the euro area, as
measured by the Dow Jones EURO STOXXindex, and in the United States, as measured
by the Standard and Poor™s 500 index,continued the declining trend of the three
previous years, dropping by 9% and 4%
respectively. At the same time, uncertainty,
as measured by implied stock marketvolatility, edged up in the first two months of
2003. Two factors seemed to account forthese conditions in equity markets. First, in
general, stock market developments seemed
mainly to reflect ongoing concerns aboutgeopolitical tensions. Second, signals fromeconomic data releases and corporate
earnings figures were rather mixed, leadingto uncertainties among market participantsabout the near-term prospects for corporate

earnings.Box 2Significant increase in stock market volatility in the euro area in 2002Stock prices in the euro area experienced sharp swings in the course of 2002. Apart from declining substantially,the daily changes in the broad stock price indices in 2002 were generally markedly higher, on average, than inprevious years (see Chart A). Although the average size of the absolute daily changes in the broad Dow Jones
EURO STOXX index has tended to rise in recent years, it reached an annual average of 1.5% in 2002, almostdouble that of around 0.8% over the period 1992-2002. This box identifies some of the global and euro area-specific factors that may help explain the pronounced turbulence in the stock markets, as reflected in the high
volatility of stock prices in the euro area in 2002.Chart A: Average annual size of the absolute daily change in the Dow Jones EURO STOXXindex, 1992-2002(%)0.00.2

Persistently high implied volatility in 2002The degree of turbulence in stock markets is often inferred from the implied volatility derived from options onstock price indices, which Œ to some extent 
Œ contains information on market participants
™ collective opinion
about the uncertainty surrounding the near-term outlook for stock prices. Viewed both from a euro areahistorical perspective and from a cross-country perspective, stock market uncertainty, as indicated by impliedvolatility in the euro area stock markets, was exceptionally high in 2002. It averaged 35%, compared with an
average of 27% since 1998, while it also surpassed the levels seen in both the United States and Japan in 2002(see Chart 8 (b)).Both global and domestic factors contributed to higher volatilityIn early 2002, conditions in global equity markets gradually became less volatile as markets settled down afterthe events of 11 September 2001. After mid-May, however, a series of adverse effects led to heighteneduncertainty about possible future trends in financial markets and caused volatility to surge in most major stock
markets. Some of the factors that gave rise to this development, such as concerns about accounting irregularitiesand the reliability of corporate earnings data, geopolitical risks and downward revisions to economic growthforecasts, were of a global nature.Other factors more specific to the euro area may partly explain why uncertainty was especially high in thisregion in 2002. First of all, stock market volatility often tends to be higher when stock prices are falling than
when they are rising (see Chart B). This is typically explained by a 
ﬁleverage effectﬂ, whereby Œ given that a
corporation™s debt level is fixed in the short term Œ a falling equity price tends to raise the debt/equity ratio offirms, i.e. the leverage.1 An increase in the leverage of a corporation reduces its capital buffer to fluctuations in
income and, hence, its future earnings tend to be more uncertain. As a result, the stock price becomes more
volatile. As the decline in stock prices in the euro area in 2002 was sharper than in other markets, the overalllevel of volatility in stock prices in the euro area was thus accentuated in comparison with other economic1)See, for example, Black, F.

Statistical Association.Chart B: Dow Jones EURO STOXX index and inverse implied stock market volatility,1998-200219981999200020012002

28regions. Moreover, the telecommunications sector had become heavily indebted in recent years, primarily as aresult of acquisitions of UMTS licences, thereby reinforcing the leverage effect.In addition, as a result of the large losses on their equity holdings, many European banks and insurancecompanies rebalanced their portfolios by adjusting their equity weightings downwards in the course of 2002.These considerable shifts of funds from the stock markets to other segments of the capital markets (e.g. the
bond markets) over a relatively short period of time are likely to have contributed to higher volatility in euroarea stock markets.Another explanatory factor behind the relatively high volatility in the euro area stock markets could be the factthat the stock price decline in 2002 was more broadly based than in other major markets, implying a higherpositive correlation across sectors. This may have given rise to a  higher volatility level of the general stock

market index.All in all, while global factors seemed to trigger a surge in euro area stock market volatility through theuncovering of some structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities specific to certain euro area sectors, the drop inglobal stock markets had a magnified impact in the euro area. As a result, the swings endured in euro areastock prices, particularly in the second half of 2002, were outside the bounds of recent historical experience.Overall decline in money market rates inthe course of 2002Money market rates increased in the first fivemonths of 2002, continuing the trend whichstarted in late 2001. In mid-May this trend
came to a halt, and money market rates
gradually decreased throughout the secondhalf of 2002. The evolution of money market
rates reflected market participants™expectations for future short-term moneymarket rates. In the first five months of 2002
market participants expected an increase infuture short-term interest rates. Theseexpectations gradually adjusted downwards
in line with expectations regarding theeconomic outlook and inflation, andeventually, in the last quarter of the year

market participants expected a decrease infuture short-term money market rates, largelyanticipating the 50 basis point reduction in
the key ECB interest rates decided at theGoverning Council meeting on 5 December
2002, the only change of the year. At the end
of 2002 the slope of the money market yieldcurve, as measured by the difference betweenthe twelve-month and one-month EURIBOR,
was slightly negative.Turning to a more detailed analysis, duringthe last few months of 2001 money marketrates declined significantly, especiallyChart 9Short-term interest rates in the euro areaand the slope of the money market yield

following the events of 11 September and thesubsequent reduction in the key ECB interestrates, as expectations of a decline in
inflationary pressures stemming from theworsened outlook for the global economy
became widespread. However, around the
turn of the year, this movement started to bereversed, as pessimism subsided and market
expectations gradually shifted towards an
economic recovery and an emergence ofupward risks to price stability. Between late2001 and mid-May 2002, therefore, money

market rates increased. The rise in moneymarket rates was most pronounced at thelonger maturities (see Chart 9).
Consequently, the slope of the money marketyield curve, which was virtually flat at thebeginning of 2002, increased substantially in
the first few months of the year and reachedaround 70 basis points in mid-May.The changes in the expected future path ofshort-term money market rates in this periodwere also evident in the evolution of the
implied three-month EURIBOR futures rateson contracts with delivery dates in 2002 andearly 2003, which increased by around 100
basis points between late 2001 and mid-May2002. In the same period the uncertaintymarket participants attached to future short-
term interest rates remained broadly stable
at relatively low levels, as measured by theimplied volatility derived from options on
three-month EURIBOR futures contracts (seeChart 10).The upward trend in money market ratesduring the first five months of 2002 reversedin late May, after which the rates gradually
decreased until the end of the year. Betweenthe end of May and the beginning ofSeptember the money market yield curve, as
measured by the difference between thetwelve-month and one-month EURIBOR,became virtually flat following a decline in

money market rates at the longer maturities.At the same time uncertainty in the market
rose significantly. In mid-September the
money market yield curve then invertedgradually, accompanied by a significantreduction in implied volatility, as market
expectations of a reduction in the key ECBinterest rates firmed.At the end of 2002 the one-month andtwelve-month EURIBOR stood at 2.90% and

2.75% respectively, 43 and 59 basis pointslower than at the end of 2001, and impliedvolatility had fallen back to previous low
levels. In the first two months of 2003 bothmoney market rates and EURIBOR futuresrates fell further.In the course of 2002 the level of theovernight interest rate, as measured by the
EONIA, reflected the pattern of the minimumbid rate in the main refinancing operations ofthe Eurosystem. Volatility in the EONIA was,

in general, low and confined to the end of thereserve maintenance periods, when theminimum reserve constraints on the banking

system became binding. In addition, theEONIA tended to increase somewhat on thelast trading day of each month, in response

to financial institutions™ desire to adjust their

30balance sheets at those times. As in previousyears, this occurred most markedly at theturn of the year. In early January 2002 the

EONIA remained somewhat higher than theminimum bid rate. This was due to relativelytight liquidity conditions caused by the euro
cash changeover, given stronger than
expected demand for euro banknotes andthe slower than expected return of national
banknotes via credit institutions to thenational central banks. In this situation, theEurosystem conducted two fine-tuning

operations in early January 2002 to providecounterparties with liquidity. Theseoperations helped to restore more normal
market conditions and the EONIA graduallydeclined again to stabilise at a level slightly
above the minimum bid rate.  A fine-tuning

operation was also conducted on18 December 2002 to provide counterparties
with liquidity following underbidding in
the main refinancing operation conducted on17 December and tight liquidity conditions(see Chapter 2).Long-term bond yields reached low levels in
2002, partly reflecting ﬁflight-to-safetyﬂ
portfolio shiftsAfter changing little in 2001, governmentbond yields in the euro area and the United

States declined in the course of 2002. Mostof the decline occurred between mid-Mayand early October and the main factor
influencing bond market developments during
this period appears to have been turbulencein stock markets which prompted flight-to-
safety portfolio shifts to bond markets. All inall, ten-year government bond yields in theeuro area and the United States declined by
90 and 130 basis points respectively in 2002and stood at around 4.3% and 3.8% at theend of the year (see Chart 11 (a)). The more
pronounced declines in US government bondyields brought the differential between US
and euro area ten-year bond yields into
negative territory for most of 2002, afterhovering around zero during 2001 (see
Chart 11(b)).Chart 11(b) Long-term government bond yielddifferential between the United Statesand the euro area(percentages per annum; daily data)(a) Long-term government bond yields

In the United States, government bond yieldsedged up slightly in the first few months of2002 as market participants became more
optimistic about growth prospects followingthe pessimism that had prevailed in the
aftermath of the events of 11 September
2001. Contributing to this reassessment werethe cuts in the federal funds rate, which was
down to 1.75% by the beginning of 2002, its
lowest level since 1961. Thereafter, as marketparticipants appeared to see brightereconomic growth prospects ahead, the yield
curve steepened, somewhat driven by long-term bond yields. There were also someindications in the first few months of the year
that market participants™ long-term inflation
expectations had risen. This was reflected,
for instance, in a rise in the break-even
inflation rate as measured by the differencebetween the yields on ten-year US nominalgovernment bonds and those on ten-year
index-linked bonds issued by the US Treasury.Optimistic growth expectations amongmarket participants subsequently waned aftermid-May, and bond yields fell when ﬁflight-to-safetyﬂ shifts from stock markets into
bond markets took place, partly triggered bythe discovery of a series of accountingirregularities among US corporations. Rising
tensions in the Middle East and weaker thanexpected economic data also contributed tothe decline in bond yields. Furthermore, the
hedging strategies of US housing agencies may
have amplified the downward trend thatbrought ten-year nominal bond yields in early
October down to the lowest levels seen since1958. After mid-October bond yields edgedup again as tensions in the equity market
abated and investors shifted funds back intothe stock market in an environment wheremacroeconomic and corporate earnings data
raised optimism about future growthprospects. The decision of the Federal OpenMarket Committee to lower the federal
funds rate by 50 basis points to 1.25% on6 November further fuelled this optimism.
In Japan, developments in long-termgovernment bond yields were, to a largeextent, decoupled from global developmentsin 2002. After remaining relatively stableduring the first half of 2002 at around 1.4%,ten-year bond yields declined more or less
continuously thereafter and stood at about0.9% at the end of 2002. Market concernsrelated to the economic outlook and the
domestic banking system as well as flight-to-
safety portfolio shifts from stock markets to
bond markets all contributed to bringing long-
term bond yields lower during the year.In the euro area, bond market developmentsmirrored, to a large extent, those in theUnited States during 2002, although theoverall decline in euro area bond yields was
less pronounced. As in the United States, inthe first few months of 2002 marketparticipants became gradually more optimistic
about growth prospects, pushing long-term
bond yields somewhat higher. At the sametime, long-term inflation expectations among

market participants increased. Reflecting this,the break-even inflation rate, calculated as
the differential between euro area ten-year
nominal bond yields and ten-year index-linkedbond yields (indexed on the euro area HICPexcluding tobacco), rose by around 30 basisChart 12Euro area real interest rate and

Later in the year, less favourablemacroeconomic data releases as well as fallingstock prices contributed to lower economic
growth expectations among market
participants. Renewed pessimism aboutgrowth prospects put downward pressure on
ten-year euro area bond yields between mid-May and October, leading to a flattening ofthe yield curve, while euro area ten-year

index-linked bond yields and the associatedbreak-even inflation rate also declined.Downward pressure on yields also came from
the US corporate accounting scandals, whichcaused market participants to questionunderlying profit performances in the euro
area. This raised the risk premia demandedby investors to hold stocks and promptedﬁflight-to-safetyﬂ shifts from stock markets
to the bond markets. At the same time,market participants™ uncertainty about future
movements in euro area bond yields also
rose, as reflected by increases in implied
bond market volatility. From October, bycontrast with developments in the United

States where bond yields rose, bond yields inthe euro area showed an unclear trend in anenvironment of mixed signals from economic
data releases.In the corporate bond markets of both theeuro area and the United States, thedifferentials between yields of long-termcorporate bonds issued by BBB-rated
corporations and yields on government bondswith comparable maturities were subject torelatively large swings in the course of 2002,
mirroring developments in implied stockmarket volatility. In particular, thedifferentials did not follow any clear trend
during the first few months of 2002, in anenvironment where optimism grew amongmarket participants about the economic
outlook facing both the euro area and theUnited States. Later on, however, corporatebond spreads widened when market
participants became concerned about thereliability of the financial disclosures made by
corporations, particularly in the United Statesbut also in the euro area. However, as theseconcerns seemed to wane in the last quarterof 2002, corporate bond spreads fell again in

the two economies close to the levels
prevailing at the start of the year, partly as a
result of some stabilisation in stock markets.In early 2003, long-term bond yields in theeuro area continued to decline overall, even
though bond yields changed little in theUnited States. Between the end of December
2002 and 28 February 2003, ten-year
government bond yields in the euro area fellby about 30 basis points to 4.0%, while yieldson ten-year US Treasuries declined only
slightly during the same period. As a result,
the differential between ten-year governmentbond yields in the United States and those
in the euro area narrowed by20 basis points to -20 basis points on28 February 2003.Retail bank interest rates declined overall in2002Short-term retail bank interest rates fell in
2002 in an environment where money marketrates showed limited fluctuations. Betweenend-2001 and end-2002 three-month money

market interest rates declined by 40 basispoints. Over the same period, the rates forovernight deposits and short-term savings
deposits (deposits redeemable at a period ofnotice of up to three months) declined byaround 10 basis points, while the rate on
deposits with an agreed maturity of up toone year declined by almost 30 basis points,in line with the typically weak pass-through
of market rates to these rates. As regardsshort-term lending rates, retail rates for loansto enterprises with maturities of up to one
year declined by almost the same amount asthree-month money market interest rates(see Chart 13).Long-term retail bank interest rates increasedsteadily until May 2002 and declined
thereafter, generally ending 2002 at levelslower than at the end of 2001 (see Chart 14).These patterns broadly mirrored the33ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
movements in market interest rates. The five-year government bond yield, to which some

long-term retail bank rates are the most
closely linked, first rose by almost 60 basispoints from end-2001 until May 2002 and
then declined by almost 130 basis points bythe end of 2002. By comparison, the rate for
long-term time deposits (deposits withmaturities of over two years) and the rate
for loans to households for house purchase
first rose by some 30 basis points beforedeclining by about 70 basis points over the
same period.

34Box 3The determination of bank lending rates in the euro areaSeveral factors may play a role in determining bank lending rates, for instance the administrative cost ofeffectively changing bank interest rates and bank-customer relationships. Bank-specific characteristics, such
as the interplay between bank profitability and refinancing conditions, may also play an important role in thedetermination of bank lending rates.1 This box focuses on three determinants of bank lending rates. First, bank
lending rates tend to be driven by developments in money and capital markets, either because banks have to
refinance themselves in these markets or because most of their deposit rates need to mirror trends in thesemarkets in order to attract funds. As a consequence, there is typically a close relationship between banklending and market interest rates with comparable maturities. For instance, the interest rate on loans to
households for house purchase has historically tended to move in tandem with five-year government bondyields (see Chart 14). The second determinant of bank lending rates considered here is the degree of prevailingcompetitive forces within different segments of the bank credit market. Banks need to set rates at competitive
levels in order to attract customers, and their power to influence rates depends very much on the availability ofalternative sources of funds for bank customers. The third factor considered is the (expected) exposure of abank to credit risk when it grants a loan.Sticky short-term adjustment of bank lending rates to market interest rate developmentsInterest rate movements in the money and other financial markets, which are the main market-based sources offunds for MFIs to subsequently grant loans, are a key determinant of bank lending rates. Past experience has
shown that euro area bank lending rates tend to react with a delay to market interest rate developments.2 The
proportion of a change in the market interest rate that is passed through within one month to bank lending ratesis often found to be less than 50%. In the long term, however, bank lending rates generally adjust one-to-one to
market interest rate developments. It is also of interest to note that the speed at which bank lending rates in theeuro area ultimately adjust to changes in market interest rates seems to have picked up since the launch of thesingle currency. The only exception to this probably relates to the adjustment speed of the interest rate on
consumer credit, for which the bank lending rate continues to react rather stickily to market developments.1M. A. Weth, (2002), ﬁThe pass-through from market interest rates to bank lending rates in Germanyﬂ, Discussion Paper 11/02,

eurozone: evidence on the emergence of a single retail banking marketﬂ, European Credit Research Institute, Research Report 2.usual lags in the pass-through process frommarket interest rates.In the period after May 2002 there was arather more sluggish adjustment of somelong-term bank lending rates, notably to
enterprises, in line with the declines in market
interest rates. This may have been linked togrowing concerns about creditworthiness in
an environment where bankruptcy rates rose.As Box 3 shows, rising credit risk, indicatedby a widening of corporate bond spreads, is
typically associated with higher spreads ofbank lending rates over market rates. In
particular, the differential between the
yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds andgovernment bonds with comparablematurities rose from about 190 basis pointsto around 220 basis points between May and
December, with a peak of about 260 basispoints in October.Following the reduction in the key ECB
interest rates in early December 2002 andsubsequent falls in money market interest
rates, short-term retail bank deposit interestrates declined slightly in January 2003,although short-term lending rates changed
little. Long-term retail bank interest ratescontinued the trend that started after May2002, declining further in January 2003.35ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
More competitive markets in recent years
Prevailing competitive forces in most segments of the bank credit market seem to have increased in recentyears, both from a supply and from a demand perspective. This tendency towards more intense competitionmay be one factor underlying the observed speeding-up of the adjustment of bank lending rates to changes in
market interest rates, which are a rough proxy for the marginal funding costs of bank loans, since 1999. Asregards the supply side, the ongoing restructuring of the banking sector seems to have promoted higherefficiency in the banking markets and more competitive pricing. In addition, notwithstanding the steady
decline in the number of credit institutions, new (foreign) players have become active in the retail bank creditmarket. Euro area banks also face more and more competition from other financial intermediaries such asinsurance companies and pension funds.3Turning to the demand side, there are also indications that competition has increased as bank customers have
become more sensitive to the interest rates on bank loans compared with those charged by other banks and by
financial markets. This may be related to the higher stability of nominal interest rates in an environment ofprice stability, which facilitates the comparison of prices across different suppliers, and to an increase in theavailability of alternative non-bank sources of finance, at least for some enterprises. For example, the
commercial paper and corporate bond markets in the euro area have become more deep and liquid in recent
years. Obviously, as indicated above, competition may differ considerably across different segments of thebank lending market. While competition seems to be relatively high for household mortgages, the
uncollateralised consumer credit market seems to be less competitive.

Average annual inflation in 2002 somewhatlower than in 2001The average annual HICP inflation rate in2002 was 2.2%, which is 0.2 percentage point
lower than in 2001 (see Table 6). Meanwhile,for the same period, the average increase inthe HICP excluding unprocessed food and
energy rose from 2.0% to 2.5%. Hence, thelower average rate of HICP inflation in 2002
is explained by lower annual increases in
the more volatile unprocessed food andenergy components. In January 2003, theyear-on-year rates of change in the HICP
and the HICP excluding unprocessed foodand energy declined to 2.2% and 2.0%respectively, which is 0.1 and 0.2 percentage
point lower than in December 2002.Developments in headline inflation in 2002mainly reflected short-term movements inunprocessed food and energy pricesOverall HICP inflation in the euro areawas rather erratic in 2002, mainly reflecting
short-term movements in its more volatilecomponents. After a sharp increase in January2002, HICP inflation declined until June, when
it started to increase again, reaching 2.3% inDecember 2002 (see Chart 15). The increasein inflation in January 2002 reflected a number
of factors, such as higher unprocessed foodand energy prices, base effects and increasesin indirect taxation and administered prices.In particular, unfavourable weather conditionsexerted upward pressure on vegetable and
fruit prices. By contrast, during the followinginterest rate on long-term loans to enterprises and a market interest rate with a comparable maturity has movedmore or less in tandem with the spread between yields on long-term BBB-rated corporate bonds andgovernment bonds with a comparable maturity. The latter spread can provide an indication of the degree of the
prevailing corporate credit risk as viewed by corporate bond market participants. The chart above alsosuggests that credit risk concerns rose in 2002, as illustrated by the increase in the spread between the interestrate on loans to enterprises over one year and the two-year government bond yield.The aforementioned determinants of bank lending rates all seem to have played some role in 2002. While banklending rates in the euro area adjusted in 2002 to market interest rate developments, among other factors, it is
clear that the speed and degree of pass-through has been affected by rising credit risk concerns in certain
segments of the credit market.Chart 15Contributions to euro area HICPinflation from sub-components(annual percentage point contributions; monthly data)Source: Eurostat.Q1Q2Q3Q4

months unprocessed food prices were themain contributor to the decline in theannual rate of inflation, as the weather-related
effects started to unwind. Furthermore,
inflationary pressures stemming from meatprices declined during this period, as the
upward price effects associated with the casesof animal diseases (foot-and-mouth diseaseand BSE) attenuated further.Energy prices also contributed slightly to thisdecline in inflation during the first half of

2002. In the second half of the year, however,energy prices were the main factor behindthe increase in overall inflation, reflecting not
only base effects but also some upwardpressure on world oil prices towards the endof the year.HICP inflation excluding its more volatilecomponents exhibited persistence in 2002
In spite of the relatively subdued demandconditions in the euro area, the decline inthe year-on-year rate of change in the HICP
excluding the more volatile unprocessed foodand energy components was rather limited inthe course of 2002. This was partly related
to the indirect effects of the past oil and foodprice shocks and to the earlier depreciationof the euro exchange rate. In addition,
for certain individual components (mainly
services) at the disaggregated level, priceincreases were observed which could be
associated with the introduction of theeuro banknotes and coins (see Box 4).

38the persistently high year-on-year rate ofchange, particularly for services prices, canalso be explained by more fundamental
factors such as developments in unit labour
costs.The year-on-year rate of change in services
prices stood at or above 2.9% throughoutthe year (see Chart 16), with an average
increase in 2002 of 3.1%, up from 2.7% in2001. The other main components of theHICP excluding its more volatile items,
processed food and non-energy industrialgoods prices, also increased on average at ahigher rate in 2002 than in 2001. However, in
contrast to services prices, the year-on-yearrates of increase in these componentsdeclined during 2002. Hence, the persistencein annual HICP inflation excludingunprocessed food and energy was mostlyexplained by services prices.Inflation differentials among euro areacountries broadly unchanged in 2002Inflation developments in individual euroarea countries varied somewhat in 2002reflecting, inter alia, the differing impact ofenergy and food price shocks, differences in
unit labour cost developments and changesin administered prices and indirect taxes.Overall, however, the dispersion was broadly

unchanged in 2002 compared with 2001.
Perceptions of past inflation rose, whileconsumers™ inflation expectations fell
Despite a decline in the actual rate of inflation
in the course of 2002, the general public™sperceptions of past inflation increased
throughout the year. For instance, theEuropean Commission™s indicator ofperceived inflation over the past 12 months
followed a steady upward trend (see Chart Cin Box 4). Consequently, the difference
between actual and perceived inflation
reached unprecedented levels. It appears thatthe high levels of perceived inflation are
associated to some extent with the price rises

for specific items, mainly services, partly as aresult of the introduction of the euro
banknotes and coins. (Box 4 presents the
effects of the euro cash changeover on pricesin more detail.)By contrast, consumers™ expectations of
inflation declined during most of 2002, whichsuggests that consumers expected that most
of the price increases that took place in thecourse of the year would be transitory. Thisis consistent with the view that the annual
inflation rate was affected by a number ofone-off factors Œ ranging from increases in
indirect taxation to base effects Œ throughout
2002. It is worth noting that, in February2003, the indicator of perceived inflationdeclined significantly. It is too early to assess,Chart 16Breakdown of HICP inflation in theeuro area by component(annual percentage changes; monthly data)Source: Eurostat.Note: For periods prior to 2001, HICP data do not include

however, whether this drop represents alasting break in the upward movement seenin this measure over the last year.Prices at earlier stages of the productionchain remained subdued in 2002The industrial producer price index (excludingconstruction) declined, on average, by 0.1%in 2002, compared with an increase of 2.2%
in 2001. This decline is mostly explained by

developments in the energy component, andto a lesser extent by developments in theintermediate and consumer goods
components (see Chart 17). The averageannual rate of increase in producer prices
excluding energy and construction was 0.6%,down from 1.8% in 2001. The subduedprice developments at the earlier stages of
the production chain partly reflect only small
import price increases as a result of the
appreciation of the euro in 2002. Moreover,demand conditions remained relatively weak
throughout the year, which in turn preventedindustrial firms from raising prices.The energy component of industrial producerprices declined by 2.4% in 2002 comparedwith an increase of 2.8% in 2001. Although
average oil prices in US dollars were broadlyunchanged in 2002 compared with the
previous year, measured in euro they declined

by some 5%. The fall in energy producerprices in 2002 was therefore almost entirelyexplained by the strengthening of the euro
against the US dollar. Lower annual rates of
change in intermediate and consumer goods
prices also contributed to the decrease in
overall producer price inflation. The decline
in consumer goods inflation reflected lower
price increases for both durables and non-
durables. The average annual increase in
capital goods prices in 2002 was 1.0%,unchanged from 2001.
Annual growth in compensation per
employee broadly unchanged in 2002,
despite labour market weaknessSince 1999 there has been a gradual upwardmovement in the rates of growth of almostall euro area-wide labour cost and wage
indicators. This upward movement continuedin 2001 and early 2002, despite the weakeningof economic activity and an increase in
unemployment.The annual growth rate of compensation peremployee averaged 2.8% during the first threequarters of 2002, slightly higher than in 2001(see Chart 18). In addition, the year-on-year
increases in both total hourly labour costsand gross monthly earnings were higherduring the first three quarters of 2002 than
in 2001. However, available country data donot signal a further acceleration in labourcosts towards the end of 2002, a view whichChart 17Breakdown of industrial producer pricesin the euro area(annual percentage changes; monthly data)Source: Eurostat.Note: Data refer to the Euro 12 (including periods prior to

40Box 4Effects of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on consumer pricesMore than a year has passed since, on 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins were introduced and allprices in the euro area were converted into euro. In many euro area countries, this changeover was perceivedby consumers to have led to sizeable price increases. This box summarises the evidence concerning the effectsof the euro changeover on prices and reviews the possible reasons why consumers have perceived the euro to
be a source of price pressure. It is argued that the effects will be mainly transitory and that, over a longerperiod of time, the greater cross-border price transparency should increase competition and contain pricepressures.Some prices seem to have been strongly affected by the cash changeover, but the overall impact hasbeen more limitedA number of different approaches have been taken when evaluating the effects of the transition of prices from
the legacy currencies to the euro: analyses of aggregated price developments, studies of a number of basicprice series for selected goods and services, and surveys on firms™ pricing strategies during the changeover.
The differences between these approaches make it difficult to compare the results. Moreover, the results
should be used only as a general indication of the overall effect, since it is very difficult to isolate pure cashchangeover effects from other sources of price pressure, such as an increase in indirect taxation, administeredprices, wages or import prices. In spite of this note of caution, most studies have drawn the same main
conclusion: the introduction of the euro did not lead to widespread price increases. To take an example, astudy by Eurostat, released in July 2002, based on six months of euro area HICP data, suggested that theimpact of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins on euro area inflation in the first half of 2002 most
likely fell within a range of 0.0 to 0.2 percentage point. The upward impact on prices could either be due to apass-through of cash changeover-related costs from companies to consumers or a bundling together of pricechanges. Moreover, companies may have rounded to new attractive prices in euro or attempted to increase
their profit margins.1The impact of the changeover may have varied across countries; for example in France, the effect on

the national CPI has been estimated at 0.2 percentage point, while in the Netherlands it possibly led to a0.6 percentage point increase in CPI inflation.2 The cross-country differences might be related to different
degrees of competition in local markets (also related to the relative importance of small versus large retailers),
and the variations in the demand situation in the respective countries.From the available data, it appears that the price effects were mainly concentrated in specific areas of the
services sector, which was also noted by many consumers. In particular, prices charged for services items,such as restaurant and café services, hairdressing and dry cleaning, seem to have risen noticeably in all euro
area countries following the introduction of euro cash. The price increases of a number of these HICP items
were exceptionally strong in the course of 2002, compared with average developments in previous years. InJanuary 2002, for example, the month-on-month increase in prices charged by restaurants and cafés in the euroarea, with a weight of 6.7% in the euro area HICP in 2002, was more than three times higher than the average
increase in the same month during the period 1996-2001 (see Chart A). Similar price movements were notedfor hairdressing (HICP weight of 1.1%, see Chart B) and other services items. For most of these items, priceincreases in the euro area were also rather high compared with those in non-euro area EU countries. While the

above-average price increases could theoretically also be due to reasons other than the changeover, it isdifficult to trace them to other factors.1For a further explanation of these price effects see Box 3 of the ECB™s Annual Report 2001.
2See ﬁThe short-term impact on prices of the euro cash changeoverﬂ, Banque de France Bulletin Digest, September 2002, and
ﬁGetting used to the euroﬂ, De Nederlandsche Bank Quarterly Bulletin, September 2002.41ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
With regard to goods prices, which account for close to 60% of private consumption expenditure in the euroarea, overall they do not seem to have been greatly affected by the changeover. However, the changeover mayhave led to price increases for some ﬁsmall ticket goodsﬂ across countries, which are frequently purchased byprivate households, such as bakery products and newspapers. Owing to their low price level, any roundingeffect can be rather strong in terms of percentage changes. By contrast, for higher-value goods, particularlydurable consumer goods, there seems to have been a tendency towards the downward rounding of prices
related to technical progress and rather strong competition in these markets.While the price dynamics of the items apparently affected by the cash changeover continued to be strong forseveral months in 2002, they appear to have mostly normalised or even become weaker in recent months. Thissuggests that the effect on inflation will only be temporary, although there may still be some further effects asthe adjustment to new attractive euro prices does not yet seem to have finished.3 In addition, some persistence
may be expected in countries where forms of wage indexation are still in place. In the long term, there shouldnot be any permanent effects once consumption behaviour has adapted to the new price structure. On thecontrary, the euro is expected to have a constraining effect on price increases, since it will bring greater price
transparency and competition in the euro area. Moreover, these benefits will be of a permanent nature.Increases in consumers™ perception of inflation
The empirical findings on changeover effects are in stark contrast to the overall impression of euro areaconsumers. According to the European Commission™s November 2002 Eurobarometer, more than 80% ofeuro area consumers think that the conversion of prices into euro was associated with significant priceincreases. This is reflected in a significant increase in the European Commission™s indicator of perceivedinflation, starting in January 2002 and continuing throughout the year (see Chart C). This development, which
was common across most euro area countries, differed starkly from actual HICP inflation, which declined over
the same period, leading to an increasing gap between perceived and actual inflation.One explanation for the gap between perceived and actual developments could be that consumers attach greatimportance to price developments in the specific goods and services that they buy more frequently, while theyare less aware of price developments of ﬁbig ticket itemsﬂ, such as durable goods, which are purchased lessfrequently. There is evidence that, in some cases, the transition from national to euro prices was indeedconnected with high price increases, something which was the focus of media and consumer attention.

While factors other than the cash changeover, such as bad weather conditions, largelyexplain these price increases, the public also seems to have associated these price increases with the cash
changeover. Although  the annual rates of change in many of these items started to decline in the secondquarter of 2002, the indicator of perceived inflation continued to increase.The question therefore remains as to how to explain the persistence of the gap between perceived and actualinflation. One possible factor seems to be the unfamiliarity of consumers with euro prices. Rule-of-thumbcalculations when comparing new euro prices with old national currency prices may also be relevant for
understanding inflation perceptions in some countries. Moreover, there is evidence that the diversity of pricesfor a single product significantly increased following the euro cash changeover. This increased number ofdifferent prices may have generated some confusion among consumers, who possibly need more time to adjust
to the new pricing patterns.4 Overall, while many factors can serve to explain the continued high rate ofperceived inflation, most of them would suggest that this is only a temporary phenomenon, which is also
indicated by the significant decline in inflation expectations during most of 2002 (see also Chart C).On the whole, while consumers have pointed out extreme price increases in the context of the euro cashchangeover, these appear to have mainly been outliers of a very limited overall importance. In this regard,
consumers play an important role in signalling their unwillingness to pay for some specific goods for whichthere have clearly been unjustified price increases. Moreover, the goods and services affected by the changeoveronly represent a relatively small share of the overall basket of goods and services of the HICP index.
Consequently, only a rather limited part of HICP inflation in the euro area could possibly be attributed tothe euro cash changeover in 2002. These effects on HICP inflation will be mainly transitory and the greatercross-border price transparency arising from the changeover to the euro should, over a longer period of time,
increase competition and contain price pressures.4See, for example, ﬁThe adaptation of prices to the changeover to the euroﬂ, Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de
Belgique, www.nbb.be.Chart C: Perceived, expected and overall HICP inflation(percentage balance and annual percentage changes; monthly data)Sources: European Commission Business and Consumers Surveys and Eurostat.Notes: The European Commission™s indicators of perceived and expected inflation take the form of balance statistics, and cannot

is confirmed by developments in the annualgrowth rate of negotiated wages, whichdeclined during the second half of 2002.Compared with the previous year, the annualincrease in labour productivity was slightly
higher, on average, during the first threequarters of 2002, although it remained at alow level. Reflecting cyclical movements,
labour productivity growth recovered in the
second and third quarters of 2002, after two
quarters of negative annual growth. As a
result, unit labour cost growth for the wholeeuro area economy fell from 3.5% year onyear in the first quarter to 2.4% in the second

and 2.0% in the third. Profit mark-updevelopments, as proxied by the gap betweenthe annual rates of growth in the GDP
deflator and unit labour costs, indicate thatthe slowdown in activity had some negativeimpact on profits. However, the cyclical
pick-up in productivity growth observed inthe course of 2002 has reduced unit labourcost growth and, consequently, downward

pressures on mark-ups.Chart 18Unit labour costs, compensation peremployee and labour productivity in theeuro area(annual percentage changes; quarterly data)Sources: Eurostat.Note: Data refer to the Euro 12 (including periods prior to

Subdued economic activity in 2002Despite positive signs at the beginning of theyear, weak economic conditions continued
to prevail in 2002. The incipient recovery atthe start of 2002 failed to gather momentumand quarterly real GDP growth rates

remained throughout the year at levels belowthose consistent with euro area potentialgrowth. In the last quarter of the year,
renewed signs of weakness emerged, asquarterly real GDP growth decreased to
a low level. Overall, average annual real
GDP growth decreased to 0.8% in 2002,from 1.4% in 2001, reflecting the negativecarry-over effect from 2001, combined with
moderate quarterly growth rates in thecourse of 2002 (see Table 7).In a context of protracted slow growth sincethe end of 2000, which contributed to a
sizeable contraction in capital formation,spare capacity remained modest in 2002.
The rate of capacity utilisation in themanufacturing sector in 2002 was, on average,close to its long-term mean, while the
unemployment rate only increased modestlyand remained below the level recorded in
2000.Low economic growth in 2002 resultedfrom a clustering of adverse shocks which

contributed towards an increase in
uncertainty and reduced expectations of arapid recovery. Geopolitical tensions, which

resilience of global imbalances contributed to
attenuating the strength of economic activityin the course of the year.In a weak economic environment, the
implementation of the planned structural
reforms is important, as it should raiseconfidence in future economic and employmentgrowth. In this regard, Box 5 reviews the
progress made with the EU
™s reform agenda.Weaker contribution from domesticdemand accounted for a further slowdownof annual real GDP growth in 2002Compared with 2001, lower annual averagereal GDP growth in 2002 was accounted for
by a weaker contribution from domesticdemand to economic activity. Subdued
domestic demand was caused by a significant

retrenchment of capital spending, onlypartially offset by moderate growth in privateconsumption.Gross fixed capital formation decreased by2.5% on average in 2002, contracting for the

second consecutive year (see Table 7). Thedecline in investment could be associated witha number of factors. First, the prospects for
a robust recovery in the euro area diminishedin the course of the year, leading firms to
adjust their investment plans downwards.

Second, the profitability of the corporatesector has been adversely affected by theeconomic slowdown. Pricing behaviour

targeted at preserving export market shareswhile the euro was appreciating may also
have exerted downward pressure on
corporate profits. Third, the sharp declinesin equity prices in 2002 implied higher costsof raising new equity capital, which in turn
may have negatively affected investmentspending. Fourth, increasing corporate bondspreads and long-term retail lending rate
spreads might also have implied tighterfinancing conditions despite low interest rates
(see Box 3). Finally, lower real household
income growth and higher uncertainty have
also had a negative impact on housinginvestment. Housing investment is estimated
to have decreased by around 2% in 2002.In 2002 private consumption was negativelyaffected by weak economic conditions and
high uncertainty. Overall, private consumptiongrew by 0.6% on average for the year (seeTable 7). More specifically, household real

disposable income is estimated to haveincreased less significantly in 2002 than in2001, mainly as a result of lower employment
growth. The impact on income of loweremployment growth was partially offset by aslight increase in real wage growth in 2002,
resulting essentially from somewhat lowerinflation. The contribution of net publictransfers, taxes and social contributions to
household income growth is estimated tohave remained relatively unchanged from2001 to 2002.The household saving ratio is estimated tohave increased in 2002. At the start of 2002

the higher saving ratio was associated withthe events of 11 September 2001 and, to aChart 19Contributions to quarterly real GDPgrowth in the euro area(quarterly percentage point contributions; seasonally adjusted)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.1)Percentage change compared with the previous quarter.

46lesser extent, with the euro cash changeoverwhich gave rise to an increase in consumers™perceived inflation (see Box 4) and a decreasein the willingness of households to makemajor purchases. Later in 2002, the sharp fall
in share prices exerted further upwardpressure on the saving ratio by reducing
household wealth and adversely affecting

confidence (see Chart 20). However, the
negative impact on households™ net worth
from lower share prices might have been
partially offset by increases in residentialproperty prices in some parts of theeuro area. Furthermore, high geopolitical

tensions and the gradual deterioration oflabour market conditions may also haveled households to increase precautionary
savings.Inventory changes did not contribute to realGDP growth in 2002, while net exports
contributed positivelyFollowing a strongly negative contributionfrom inventory changes in 2001, stocks didnot contribute, on average, to real GDPgrowth in 2002. An improvement in businessexpectations at the beginning of the year

brought an end to an extended period ofinventory depletion. However, in the secondhalf of the year, the disappointing pace of

economic activity led firms to adjust
downwards their desired levels of stocks,thereby preventing inventory changes from
making a significant contribution to real GDPgrowth.In 2002 annual average growth of both realimports and exports of goods and services(including intra-euro area trade) decreased
further, to -0.3% and 1.2% respectively. This
partly reflects the marked contraction intrade volumes in the second half of 2001,

which led to a significant negative carry-overeffect into 2002. However, an upturn in tradevolumes was observed around mid-year.
Exports gained momentum, supported by anincrease in world demand. Imports alsostrengthened around mid-2002. In the
final quarter of the year, both import and
export growth weakened, while the nettrade contribution turned negative. On
average in 2002, the net export contributionto economic activity was significant owing
to the contraction in import volumes.
Services sector remained the driving forcebehind economic activity in 2002Based on national accounts data, value addedin industry excluding construction increasedslightly in 2002, by 0.2%. Weak growth in
2002 stemmed mainly from the negative
carry-over effect from 2001, while activity inindustry recovered in the first half of theyear (see Table 7). According to industrial

production data, the recovery at thebeginning of the year was initiated byintermediate goods production (see Table 8),
in conjunction with the turnaround inthe inventory cycle and foreign demand(see Chart 21). In the second half of 2002

industrial activity lost some momentum,reflecting the deterioration of currentand prospective economic developments,Chart 20Confidence indicators in the euro area

although year-on-year growth rates continuedto increase owing to favourable base effectsstemming from low activity in the second halfof 2001. Construction output, as measuredby real value added, contracted by 1.5% in
2002. The weakness in construction activity
resulted largely from the continued adversedevelopments in Germany. The deteriorationin the overall economic climate in the euro
area and high uncertainty were also importantfactors.By contrast, value added in the services
sector continued to grow in 2002, albeitat a slower pace than in 2001. Activity in
market-related services increased by 1.3%(see Table 7), remaining the main drivingforce for overall economic growth in 2002.

48real GDP growth declined in all euro areacountries, except Finland. The weakness seenin 2002 implied low annual average real GDP
growth rates in several countries. Indeed, agroup of countries barely saw a rise in realGDP in 2002.Further slowdown of employment growth in2002The impact of the economic slowdowngradually fed through to labour markets in
2002 and quarter-on-quarter growth rates oftotal employment became negative in the
second half of the year. On the basis ofavailable national data, total employmentgrowth is estimated to have been 0.4% in
2002 against 1.4% in the previous year.Compared with past economic slowdowns inthe 1990s, employment growth in the euro

area continued to be relatively resilient for a
large part of 2002. This could be partlyexplained by the fact that, in early 2002, many

companies expected the slowdown to beshort-lived. However, as activity remainedweak, the situation in the labour market
weakened in the second half of the year (seeTable 9).With regard to sectoral developments in2002, year-on-year employment growthbecame negative in the industrial sectors
(i.e. both construction and industry excludingconstruction), while net job creationcontinued in the services sector. Employment
in the services sector nevertheless underwenta marked slowdown compared with 2001. Inparticular, in finance and business services,
the driving force of net job creation in servicesin recent years, employment growth in 2002was less than half that of 2001. Other market-
related services (i.e. trade, transport and
communications) also experienced a noticeable,albeit less pronounced, slowdown in
employment growth.Gradual increase in unemployment in 2002In line with the slowdown in employmentgrowth, the euro area standardised rate ofunemployment gradually increased throughout2002 to an average of 8.3% for the year as a

whole, i.e. 0.3 percentage point higher thanin 2001 (see Chart 22). After four consecutive
years of decline, the number of unemployed
in the euro area increased to an average of11.4 million in 2002.

All age and gender groups appear to have

2001 to 7.3% in 2002. The unemploymentgap between the younger and the older age

continued to narrow gradually throughout theyear. This suggests that groups that aretraditionally more strongly affected by labour

market deterioration (namely the young andwomen) do not appear to have suffered
relatively more from this economic downturn,
particularly when compared with past
slowdowns in the 1990s. The increase inunemployment was common to most euro
area countries and the degree of dispersionacross euro area countries remained broadlyunchanged.Finally, the growth of the labour force
(i.e. the sum of all employed and unemployed
people) is estimated to have slowed slightly
in 2002. This reflects the protracted weakgrowth in activity and the increase in
unemployment which tended to discourage
entry into the labour force.In sum, although employment growth in the
euro area remained relatively resilient up tothe second half of 2002, there was a gradual
deterioration in labour markets, largelyreflecting the lagged impact of weakereconomic activity. These developments draw
particular attention to the need for continuedefforts in implementing labour marketreforms and gearing wage developments
towards supporting employment growth inorder to achieve better labour marketperformance and to better mitigate the effect
of cyclical downturns (see Box 5).ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
50Box 5Limited progress with structural reforms in euro area product and labour markets
Structural reforms in product and labour markets enhance the economic growth potential and facilitate theadjustment to economic change. In March 2000, the Lisbon European Council recognised the importance ofmodernising the regulatory framework and introduced an ambitious reform agenda aimed at making theEuropean Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. Since
then, the economic environment has weakened considerably. Determined action to implement the ﬁLisbonagendaﬂ has become all the more important to bolster economic confidence and to improve the framework
conditions for economic activity and employment growth. Against this background, this box briefly reviews
the progress made in implementing the EU™s reform agenda over recent years and, in particular, in 2002. Thisassessment is broadly in line with the European Commission™s view set out in its report on the implementationof the 2002 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs).The functioning of product markets is monitored and evaluated as part of the Cardiff process, whereas labourmarket reform is assessed within the Luxembourg process. Both processes rely on country examinations ofreforms and provide input into the BEPGs, which define overarching policy priorities for various fields ofeconomic policy. Policy recommendations for each EU Member State are derived based on these priorities
(see Chapter V).1In the field of labour markets, the 2002 BEPGs stress the need: (i) to adapt tax and benefit systems to make
work pay and to encourage the search for jobs; (ii) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of active labourmarket policies; (iii) to bring down obstacles to geographical mobility within and between Member States;(iv) to facilitate occupational mobility; (v) to promote more flexible organisation of work and review
employment contract regulations; and (vi) to remove barriers to female labour force participation.
Several countries have started or continued to implement measures to make work pay or to reduce employers™social security contributions. In addition, efforts to improve the job search process continued with the raisingof the efficiency of services provided by employment agencies and the implementation of stricter job searchrequirements. Several countries continued efforts to enhance the flexibility of work organisation. However,
many labour market reforms have hardly been tackled at all. In this regard, for example, comprehensivereforms of pension and early retirement systems aimed at increasing the labour force participation of olderworkers have not been fostered sufficiently, and reforms of employment protection regulations improving job
mobility have received only scant attention. Overall, the pace of labour market reform in 2002 seems to haveslowed down in most euro area countries compared with earlier years.
The structural reform agenda for product markets covers a wide range of areas, the following of which were
emphasised in the BEPGs for 2002: (i) to fully implement the Internal Market; (ii) to ensure effectivecompetition; and (iii) to accelerate reforms in the network industries. There are still some significant barriers
to the functioning of the Internal Market, particularly in services markets. Many of these barriers appear to bedue to national regulations, for example administrative procedures for setting up subsidiaries in other euroarea countries or the use of discretionary powers by local authorities. Following a decade of continuous
improvement, the decline in the percentage of EU Internal Market legislation which Member States have notyet transposed into national laws came to a halt in 2002. This ﬁtransposition deficitﬂ in the euro area countries
rose from 2.2% in October 2001 to 2.4% in October 2002.
As far as the reinforcement of competition is concerned, some euro area countries took steps to increase thepowers of their competition and regulatory authorities. Another instrument which could be used to diminish1Council Recommendation of 21 June 2002 on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the
Community.51distortions to competition is the reduction of state aid. Although the overall trend is towards a reduction instate aid, it still plays a significant role in certain sectors, such as rail and air transport. Regulatory reformscontinued to be implemented in network industries, albeit to varying degrees across countries and industries.
The effects of reforms in these previously sheltered sectors have become visible in price reductions in some ofthese sectors, notably telecommunications. This development continued in 2002, although at a slower pace.To sum up, some progress in reducing structural rigidities in labour and product markets was observed in2002. However, the approach adopted by many countries seems to have taken the form of partial steps ratherthan strengthened, comprehensive reform efforts. As it takes time for structural reforms to produce their full
benefits, the slow and partial approach of most Member States to structural reform will make it increasinglydifficult to achieve the strategic objectives set in the Lisbon agenda. Furthermore, a lack of determination toimplement comprehensive reforms may also be a reason for the low level of confidence in a quick economic
recovery. This makes greater efforts in the field of structural reform all the more important.5Fiscal developments
Deteriorating budget balances in 2002mainly due to economic slowdownFor the second consecutive year, fiscalbalances in the euro area deteriorated in
2002. The latest available data from Eurostatshow an average deficit of 2.2% of GDPagainst 1.6% in 2001 (see Table 10). The
marked deterioration, to an average level notseen since 1998, can mainly be attributed tothe weakness in economic activity which
affected budget results through automaticstabilisers, and to adverse revenuedevelopments in some countries. Furthermore,
significant statistical revisions of the 2001deficit figures, expenditure overruns and taxchanges had a negative impact on the 2002
fiscal balances in a number of countries.Nearly all countries failed to meet the budgetbalances targeted in the stability programmes
that were submitted at the end of 2001.These targets were missed by a substantial1.3% of GDP on average.Fiscal developments were especially adversein countries that already had significant fiscal
imbalances in 2001. Germany recorded adeficit well above the 3% of GDP referencevalue in 2002. Excluding UMTS receipts,
France registered a 3.2% deficit ratio, whilethe ratios in Italy and Portugal were not muchlower. In November 2002 the ECOFIN Council
decided on the existence of an excessive
deficit in Portugal in 2001, and in January
2003 decided on an excessive deficit inGermany in 2002. ECOFIN called formeasures to end this situation and, also in
January 2003, adopted an early warningrecommendation for France. In total, ninecountries recorded deficits in 2002, against
six in the previous year. Only Belgium,Luxembourg and Finland achieved balancedbudgets or surpluses.The euro area ratio of governmentexpenditure to GDP ceased to decline in
2002, for the first time since 1993. The ratioincreased by nearly 0.5 percentage point,reflecting, inter alia, higher unemployment
expenditure on account of the weakeconomic environment. Although someoverspending was evident in specific
categories such as healthcare, no generalisedslippage from expenditure targets wasdiscerned. Interest expenditure as a
percentage of GDP declined only slightly in2002. Slow tax revenue growth in 2002 couldmainly be accounted for by the weakness in
economic activity, since no major tax reformswere introduced. Other factors depressingtax revenue growth were the sizeable tax
cuts implemented in previous years andnegative effects related to profit and assetprice developments.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
52The euro area average debt ratio decreasedin 2002, by 0.1 percentage point to 69.1% of

GDP. Deficit-debt adjustments, which leavethe deficit unaffected but have an impact ongross government debt, decreased public
indebtedness by 0.2 percentage point of GDP.In Greece and Finland, this factor contributedsignificantly to slowing down the pace of
reduction of the debt ratio. In Belgium,
Greece and Italy, the government gross debtratio remained above 100% of GDP. The debt
ratio increased in three of the four countrieswith high deficits. In Italy, the decrease in thedebt ratio was mainly the result of a financialoperation producing a substantial one-offeffect.The fiscal stance in the euro area, as measuredby the change in the cyclically adjusted
primary surplus according to EuropeanCommission data, loosened somewhat in2002, as in 2001. The relaxation was evident
in the majority of countries. It was generallya result of revenue shortfalls, but in somecountries strong expenditure growth played
a prominent role. The fiscal stance wastightened only in Spain, the Netherlands and
Portugal.General government surplus (+) or deficit (-)1999200020012002

Sound budgetary positions must remain top
priorityAccording to the stability programmessubmitted at the end of 2002 and thebeginning of 2003, the euro area deficit will
decline by 0.4 percentage point in 2003 to1.8% of GDP. Only Austria had not submittedan updated stability programme by the end of

February 2003. The positive effects ofexpenditure restraint and the continued fallin interest payments will outweigh the
negative effects of modest economic growthrates and some planned tax cuts. In a fewcountries, the improvement in the budgetary
forecasts also stems from a projected strong
economic recovery in 2003. The deficits in
Germany, France and Portugal are anticipated
to decrease but stay close to 3% of GDP in
2003. Balanced budgets are projected for
Belgium and Spain, while in Finland a
continued fiscal surplus is expected. Othermember countries expect to post small tomoderate deficits in 2003. In 2004, the
average euro area budget deficit is projectedto decline, to 1.1% of GDP, aided by acontinued economic recovery and budgetaryconsolidation in 
the countries with highdeficits.The cyclically adjusted primary balance in theeuro area is forecast to improve by around0.5% of GDP in 2003, and by broadly the
same percentage in 2004, based on thecalculations of the stability programmes. Theeuro area average government expenditure

ratio is expected to return to its decliningpath, with announced tax reductionsmoderate for 2003. Risks to this budgetary
outlook come from a more unfavourablemacroeconomic environment, expenditureoverruns and further tax cuts.On 7 October 2002 the Eurogroup agreed
on a fiscal strategy for countries with
remaining fiscal imbalances. It concluded thatthese countries need to pursue a continuous
improvement of the underlying balance
(i.e. the balance net of cyclical effects and,considered on a case-by-case basis, one-offmeasures) by at least 0.5% of GDP per year.
Countries with excessive deficits are requiredto consolidate to a greater extent. Allministers but one agreed that this strategy

should already be implemented in the 2003budgets. Moreover, there was consensus thatthe adjustment path should be based on
realistic economic assumptions and well-specified measures.Of the countries with remaining deficitimbalances, Greece, France and Italy are notexpected to comply with the minimum
consolidation requirement in 2003. Germanyand Portugal, on the other hand, are expectedto reduce their underlying deficits by more
than 0.5% of GDP, as required in view of
the high level of their deficits, throughrevenue-raising measures and expenditure
containment. Austria showed a re-emergingfiscal imbalance in 2002.Countries that have already achieved soundbudgetary positions should ensure that no
new imbalances are introduced. The free
operation of automatic stabilisers isappropriate in both economic downturns andupturns. However, a few of these countries
saw the return of non-negligible deficits in
2002. This underlines the importance ofmaintaining budgetary safety margins,
especially in view of the sensitivity of fiscalpositions to a sudden change in the economicenvironment.Compliance with the fiscal rules of theStability and Growth Pact is conducive to
economic stability and as such is a necessary
complement of a monetary policy geared toprice stability. Furthermore, achieving and
preserving sound budgetary positionsprovides some scope for dealing with thefiscal challenges expected to be posed by
population ageing.Limited progress on structural reform ofpublic financesCurrent economic conditions again highlightthe need for structural reform of publicfinances. Although the full benefits of reform
ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
54can only be reaped over the medium term,
public finance reforms at the current juncturewould strengthen confidence, thus also
supporting economic growth in the shorter
run. This will especially be the case if they
form part of a comprehensive reform strategy
combining spending retrenchment with taxreductions and fiscal consolidation. Budgetarydiscipline not only supports confidence by
ensuring the sustainability of public finances,it also allows the automatic stabilisers to
work freely (see Box 6).Structural reforms on the expenditure sideare particularly urgent. Elements to be
examined include the provision of publicgoods and services needed to increasepotential output, and measures to decrease
disincentives to work generated by incomesupport schemes. Tax reforms also play akey role in improving the functioning of the
labour market. In view of the budgetary
implications of ageing populations, well-designed expenditure and tax reforms arecrucial to increase efficiency and promoteeconomic growth, reduce budget imbalances,ensure the sustainability of public finances in
the longer run and alleviate the implicit taxburden on future generations.No major reduction or restructuring ofexpenditure in a growth-supportive directionis taking place, tax reforms in 2002 were
limited compared with previous years,
and the tax reductions foreseen for thesubsequent years covered in the stability
programmes are gradual. With regard toageing populations, little headway has beenmade in implementing measures that
contribute to the sustainability of publicfinances in the longer run. Pension reforms havebeen partial at most. The introduction and
expansion of funded pension schemes alongsideand complementary to reform of the pay-as-you-go basic pension schemes is proceeding at
a very slow pace. Overall, progress with regard
to the growth-supporting role of public financeshas remained limited.Box 6Public finances and economic stabilisationPublic finances can support economic stability in several ways. First, sustainable public finances are key toensuring long-term stability, since unsustainable debt and deficit levels undermine growth and eventuallyforce countries to engage in disruptive large-scale adjustments. Second, fiscal policy can contribute to stability
in the short term by cushioning cyclical fluctuations. In the absence of any government action, the budgetreacts automatically to economic fluctuations, providing a stabilising influence. Compliance with the EUfiscal framework preserves both the stabilising role and the long-term sustainability of public finances.Automatic fiscal stabilisation via public expenditure and revenueAutomatic fiscal stabilisers stem from certain features of taxation and social transfers as well as the resilienceof major government spending components in the face of economic fluctuations. Tax receipts evolve more or
less in proportion to economic activity, buoyant in upturns and subdued in downturns. With the exception of
unemployment-related outlays, most government expenditure is pre-committed in annual budgets and isbroadly unaffected by cyclical fluctuations. Total demand, and thus economic activity, is supported during a
slowdown as weaker economic growth leads to lower taxes for households and enterprises. The full benefitsfrom the operation of automatic stabilisers can only be reaped if public finances are sustainable, sinceeconomic agents otherwise adjust their behaviour in anticipation of likely future fiscal measures.
Discretionary fiscal policy normally not suitable for short-term demand managementIn the past, attempts to manage aggregate demand through discretionary fiscal policy-making have beenwidespread but often counter-productive. Discretionary measures suffer from implementation lags and aredifficult to reverse, and thus often lead to pro-cyclical fiscal policies. By contrast, automatic stabilisers55ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
provide timely, symmetrical and foreseeable adjustments, since they are directly linked to the structure of theeconomy. Discretionary policies are mainly needed to pursue fiscal consolidation and changes in the structureof public finances.The EU fiscal framework: sustainability and stabilisationAchieving and preserving sustainable public finances and the stabilising role of fiscal policies are the mainobjectives of the EU fiscal framework. The provisions of the Treaty oblige Member States to avoid excessivegovernment deficits (Article 104) above a reference value of 3% of GDP for the deficit and 60% for the debt
ratio, unless specific conditions apply. The Stability and Growth Pact ensures the stabilising role of public
finances within this framework of fiscal discipline. Under the Pact, countries committed themselves tomaintaining a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term in order that budgetarybalances could fluctuate with the economic cycle without risking an excessive deficit. To avoid an inappropriate
pro-cyclical policy, the reference values may be breached without resulting in an excessive deficit procedure
in the event of a severe recession or exceptional circumstances beyond the control of government.6The global macroeconomic environment, exchange rates and
the balance of paymentsRecovery of world economy remainedmutedFollowing the deceleration in 2001, the world
economy began to recover at a moderatepace in early 2002. In annual terms, world

real GDP growth is estimated to haveincreased to 3.1% in 2002, from 2.3% in 2001.Economic performance worldwide variedgreatly. The main driving forces behind the
upswing were resilient household demand in
the United States, a recovery in non-JapanAsia, mainly driven by exports, and relativelysustained growth in the EU accession

countries. However, in the course of 2002
the world recovery lost momentum relativeto initial expectations, and its sustainability
became more uncertain. The global economicoutlook was particularly affected by thevolatility of financial markets, reflecting
further downward adjustments in stockmarket valuations as well as increasedgeopolitical tensions.The recovery in the United States was moremuted than anticipated, and imbalances

remained, notably in the household sectorand the current account. In Japan, anincipient modest expansion slowed down inthe second half of the year, against thebackground of weakening external demandgrowth. However, resilient domestic demand
in non-Japan Asia supported global growth in
the second half of 2002, partly offsetting
the impact of a somewhat less dynamic US
economy and sluggish activity in Japan.In the United States, GDP growth amountedto 2.4% in 2002. This compares with only0.3% in 2001, when the economy contractedin the first three quarters. In line with the

recovery, productivity in the non-farmbusiness sector grew rapidly in 2002. Theresilience of household spending, based on
robust growth in private consumption andresidential investment, was a key contributorto GDP growth in 2002. In annual terms
private consumption grew by a sizeable 3.1%in the year as a whole, although slowing inthe fourth quarter. Consumption of durable
goods Œ and in particular motor vehicles and
parts Œ made an especially large contribution
to GDP growth in the summer, spurred by

retail financing incentives. An important factorsupporting household spending was the effectof tax cuts, boosting growth of disposable
income to 5.9% in 2002. Another elementof support was a strong housing market,with residential investment benefiting from
ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
56historically low mortgage rates. This offset tosome extent the negative wealth effectsassociated with the cumulative decline in
equity prices. Despite the robustness inconsumption growth, there was an increasein the savings ratio in 2002, to 3.9% of
disposable income from 2.3% in 2001, whichcould reflect the heightened uncertainty
caused by the turbulence in financial markets
and the gradual worsening of the employmentoutlook.Business investment, on the other hand,contracted again in 2002, in line withrelatively low corporate profitability and

some concerns over corporate malfeasance.Growth in government consumption and
government investment remained strong
throughout 2002, while the inventorycontribution to growth was slightly positivefor the year as a whole. Concerning trade,
growth in import volumes outpaced that inexports considerably during most of 2002.Accordingly, the current account deficit
expanded to almost 5% of GDP for the year.
Against this background, some of thedomestic imbalances that arose in the United

States in the late 1990s still remained, while
the imbalance vis-à-vis the rest of the worldcontinued to deteriorate (see Box 7).
Consumer price inflation in the United Statesremained relatively quiescent in 2002, while
producer price inflation was negative for mostof the year. Despite a steady increase in oil
prices, domestic inflationary pressures
remained generally subdued in the course of2002 owing to low capacity utilisation ratesand strong productivity growth. Inflation, as
measured by the consumer and producerprice indices, fell to 1.6% and -1.3%respectively in 2002, down from 2.8% and

2.0% in 2001. Excluding food and energy,
consumer price inflation was 2.3% in 2002,
down from 2.7% in 2001, while producer

price inflation excluding food and energy fellto 0.1% in 2002 from 1.4% in 2001. Interestrates remained at historical lows in 2002.
The Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) of the Federal Reserve Systemreduced the target for the federal funds rateby 50 basis points in November 2002, to
1.25%, after a cumulative reduction of425 basis points in 2001. Following this move,
the FOMC changed its bias from ﬁweakeningﬂto ﬁbalancedﬂ. Fiscal policy was markedlyexpansionary in 2002, with the federal budget
balance moving to a deficit of 1.5% of GDP inthe  fiscal year 2002, from a surplus of 1.3%
of GDP in the fiscal year 2001. This resulted

most notably from discretionary budgetarymeasures Œ in particular an instalment of the
tax cuts legislated in mid-2001 and the
stimulus packages passed in March 2002 Œand, to a lesser extent, from the automaticresponse of the budget to the business cycle.In Japan, the economy experienced a mildrebound supported by external demand
during the first half of 2002. A robust increasein exports, notably to the emerging Asianeconomies, translated into a sizeable pick-up
in industrial production. The pace ofeconomic expansion slowed down, however,in the second half of the year, as external
demand growth moderated and geopoliticaluncertainties increased. As a consequence,export growth lost momentum and the
contribution of external trade to GDP growthturned negative in the third quarter,rebounding, however, in the fourth quarter.
Throughout the year, private investmentspending remained relatively weak, partly
reflecting continued balance sheet problems
and excess capacity in the corporate sectoras well as concerns about the economicoutlook. Overall the economy expanded by
0.3% in 2002.Deflationary pressures continued throughout2002, with the CPI declining on average by
0.9%. Against this background, the Bank ofJapan increased its target range for the

outstanding balance of the current accountsheld at the Bank of Japan by JPY 5 trillion toJPY 15-20 trillion. In addition, it raised the
amount of its monthly outright purchases oflong-term government bonds to JPY 1.2trillion. Furthermore, in order to facilitate

the resolution of the non-performing loan
problem and to secure financial stability, theBank of Japan published on 11 October a

Box 7Evolution of US imbalances
The accumulation of household and current account imbalances were a major feature accompanying the
sustained period of growth in the United States in the second half of the 1990s. Strong domestic demand,
which was the main driving force of the past cycle in the United States, developed at the cost of an increasedaccumulation of debt, both at a household and a national level. These imbalances were not corrected duringthe recession in 2001 and are therefore likely to become a burden on the upswing.In the past ten years, the extraordinary expansion of the US economy has been accompanied by an increasingdeficit in the current account (from 0.8% of GDP in 1992 to 3.9% in 2001 and about 5% in 2002). Contrary topast experience, the US current account did not significantly improve in the wake of the economic downturn in
2001. Indeed, it increased further in 2002, following a short period of small improvement during 2001. Thefinancing structure of the US current account deficit has changed significantly in recent years. While in 1999and 2000 the inflows were concentrated in the acquisition of private assets, notably equity, from 2001 investor
preferences shifted increasingly towards government bonds. This has implications for the sustainability of thecurrent account deficit, as Œ unlike equity 
Œ bond issuance generates repayment obligations. The net liabilities
in the international investment position stood at around 25% of GDP in 2001 (see Chart A).
The protracted current account deficit has also significantly increased the dependency of the United States onlarge continuous capital inflows. It is noteworthy that in the past two years the United States has become
almost entirely dependent on bond market inflows as net inflows in foreign direct investment (FDI) and equityportfolio investment have significantly decreased. The financing structure may also have an impact on thepace of a possible correction of the current deficit. Indeed, whereas bond financing generates a pre-determined
flow of repayments, income transfers associated with FDI depend to a large extent on economic developments.The increase in US external debt has been compounded by higher internal indebtedness, mainly related tohousehold debt. Between 1997 and 2001 annual household borrowing in the United States grew more stronglythan nominal GDP. It doubled from around USD 300 billion (3.6% of GDP) to USD 600 billion (5.7% of
GDP), thereby arriving at new record levels, also in real terms. While household borrowing played aChart A: US current account and netinternational investment position(as a percentage of GDP)Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis.Chart B: Household borrowing(as a percentage of consumption)Source: US Federal Government.19921994199619982000

58concrete outline of a stock-purchasingplan, involving the purchase of JPY 2 trillionworth of shares at market price from
commercial banks whose shareholdings
exceed their Tier 1 capital. At the end ofOctober a new government plan to tackle
the non-performing loan (NPL) problem was
announced. The plan aims to halve the
major banks™ NPL ratio by the end of the
fiscal year 2004. It also envisages tightening
the assessment of banks™ assets and examining
the need for a new framework for injectingpublic funds into financial institutions. In

addition, it foresees the creation of a new
institution with a mandate to revitalise viableborrowers. As to fiscal policy, at the
beginning of 2003 the Japanese parliamentpassed a supplementary budget for the fiscalyear 2002. Containing JPY 2.5 trillion ofadditional spending, it strengthens the safetynet for the unemployed and provides supportfor small and medium-sized enterprises.In non-Japan Asia, the economic recovery in2002 was stronger than initially anticipated.This reflected two fundamental factors. First,
foreign demand, including demand forinformation and communication technologyproducts, was more resilient than expected.
Moreover, output growth was stronger thanexpected in China, which fuelled increasing
absorption of regional exports. Second,
domestic demand recovered in varyingdegrees in the different countries of theregion. In general, more favourable labour
market conditions and increasing disposableincome reflecting positive spillovers from theexternal sector in combination with pent-upprominent role in the resilience of consumption, inparticular during 2001, its negative side was a sharpincrease in US household debt, to around 70% ofGDP in 2001 (see Charts B and C). The debt level
for an ﬁaverageﬂ US household is now close to its
annual disposable income, comprising around 75%mortgage debt and 25% consumer credit.Consequently, the household debt service burden,defined as the ratio of households™ required debt
payments (interest payments and debt redemption)to their disposable personal income, has risenconsiderably in recent years. It reached around 14%
in the third quarter of 2002, despite a strong declinein interest rates, returning to the previous cyclicalpeak it attained in the mid-1980s. Higher
borrowing Œ together with the decline in financial
asset prices Œ also contributed to the decline in
household net wealth (including both financial and
real estate assets) in terms of disposable income, which fell from a peak of more than 600% at the end of 1999to 365% in the third quarter of 2002.In conclusion, domestic and external imbalances have not been significantly reduced during the recentslowdown in the US economy. In particular, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP deteriorated in2002 by almost 1 percentage point relative to 2001. Moreover, the strong increase in household borrowing and
the decline in household net wealth in the United States during the past two years have raised concerns aboutthe strength and the robustness of the recovery. The extent of domestic and external indebtedness hassignificantly increased the vulnerability of the US economy to shocks, such as a decline in investor confidence
or a sudden worsening of growth prospects. Concerns about the sustainability of these imbalances have alsobeen heightened by the reappearance of a fiscal deficit since 2001.

household demand and supportive policymeasures helped to boost domestic demand.Within the region, China and South Koreaposted the highest annual GDP growth rates
in 2002, at 8% and around 6% respectively,
reflecting broadly based growth. At the otherend of the spectrum, Hong Kong SAR andSingapore, despite recovering from negative
growth rates in 2001, continued to postsluggish growth. They recorded 2.3% and 2.2%respectively in 2002, weighed down by lacklustre
private consumption. Deflationary pressurespersisted in China and Hong Kong SAR,reflecting, among other things, structural factors
in China and factor equalisation pressures inHong Kong SAR owing to integration withChina. Deflation in Singapore and Taiwan
reflected excess capacity, while showing signsof abating towards the end of 2002.In the EU accession countries, the decline in
growth in the course of 2002 was limited.While the impact of the global slowdown on
external demand was sizeable, domesticdemand and particularly private consumptionremained sustained in the majority of
countries. However, several countriesexperienced a general deterioration in theirfiscal position, which only partly reflected the

less favourable cyclical conditions. The
combination of negative output gaps, prudentmonetary policies and the appreciation of
most accession countries™ currencies
vis-à-vis the euro also contributed to a
deceleration of inflationary pressures (see
Chapter VI).In Turkey, output growth resumed in 2002,following the deep recession and the financialcrisis of the previous year. The recovery wasinitially driven by the external sector,
which benefited from the large gain incompetitiveness associated with the strongdepreciation of the lira, while private
consumption growth turned moderatelypositive starting from the second quarter of2002. The weakening of the lira, however,
was an important factor in the increase in theexternal debt ratio and in a temporaryoutburst of inflationary pressures, whichabated in the course of the year. On a year-on-year basis consumer price inflationdropped from 73% in January 2002 to 30% in

December, below the central bank
™s year-end inflation target of 35%.The Russian economy continued to grow at arelatively sustained pace for the thirdconsecutive year, with real GDP growth
weakening only slightly, from 5% in 2001 to4.3% in 2002. Consumption growth remained
buoyant and investment demand, sustained
by high oil prices, decelerated but remainedin positive territory. Inflationary pressureseased somewhat, falling from 18.6% in 2001

to about 15% last year. The current accountsurplus continued to decline in the course of2002, as the strong recovery in import
growth largely exceeded that in exports.In Latin America, positive output growth inthe two largest countries (Brazil and Mexico)contrasted with the deepening of theeconomic crisis in Argentina. Overall, the
latter proved to be considerably worse thaninitially expected, causing the region™s realoutput growth to turn negative. Argentina™sreal GDP experienced a double-digitcontraction amid significant constraints onfinancial flows, which weighed heavily on
domestic demand. These financing constraintsstemmed, on the domestic side, from a freeze
on bank deposits and, on the external side,
from the ongoing default on governmentbonds held by private investors which wasannounced in late December 2001. In Brazil,
the economy was subject to significantfinancial turbulence as a reaction to increasingpublic debt and market concerns relating to
the country™s political situation. However,the economy showed considerable resilienceto the financial turmoil. Mexico™s economyrecovered somewhat from the sharpslowdown experienced in 2001, helped bybroadly positive developments in the United

States, the continuation of high oil pricesand the weakening peso. The economicrecovery allowed labour market conditions

to stabilise, with the rate of unemploymentending the year below 3%.ECB  Annual Report

60Brent crude oil prices increased slightly froman average USD 24.4 per barrel in 2001 toUSD 25.0 in 2002. Substantial price increases
were recorded from December 2002 through
to February 2003, with the price reaching
USD 33.7 on 28 February 2003. The recent
increase was the result of several factors,including stronger world demand, tightinventories of crude and refining products,
and heightened geopolitical tensions. Non-oilcommodity prices also rose, particularly as aresult of food production cutbacks in reaction
to the previous year™s lower prices.Euro appreciated against major currenciesin 2002After a period of relative stability in the firstquarter of 2002, the euro recorded a sizeablenominal effective appreciation, reaching levels
significantly higher than its average in 2001
(see Chart 23). These developments took
place against a background of increased
uncertainty about growth prospects in theworld™s major economic areas as well as sharp
declines in global equity markets. Overall, at
the end of 2002, the nominal effectiveexchange rate of the euro was almost 6½%stronger than at the beginning of the year
and nearly 9% above its average level in 2001.On 28 February 2003, the cut-off date for
this Annual Report, the euro™s nominaleffective exchange rate had appreciated by8.3% compared with the average for 2002.
The real effective exchange rates of the euro,

which are adjusted for the price and labourcost differentials between the euro area andits partner countries, have tracked the
nominal index fairly closely (see Chart 23).The minor differences mainly reflect thediffering price and labour cost developments
between the euro area and some of its maintrading partners, particularly Japan.After remaining broadly stable against theeuro in late 2001 and early 2002, the USdollar depreciated quite sharply relative to
the single currency from April until end-July2002. The deteriorating growth outlook forthe US economy may have been a factor
behind the fairly broadly based decline inthe US dollar. The pressures on the dollarwere intensified by market concerns about
compliance with corporate accountingprinciples in the United States. After asubsequent period of relative stability at a

fairly high level, the dollar depreciated furtheragainst the euro towards the end of the year.
The latter development was associated with
a combination of factors: the widening ofnegative interest rate differentials vis-à-vis theeuro area, market concerns regarding the US
current account imbalance, the emergence ofa US fiscal deficit and uncertainty about US
economic growth prospects. Increasing
geopolitical tensions were also quoted bymarket analysts as weighing on the US
currency. At the end of 2002, the euro stood
at USD 1.05, which was 16% higher than atthe beginning of the year and slightly morethan 17% above the 2001 average. On

28 February 2003, the euro traded at
USD 1.08, which was 14% above its average
in 2002.

remained relatively stable for most of 2002.In the last quarter of that year it depreciated,partly reflecting the uncertainty about the
growth prospects in some of Japan
™s mainexport markets and because of marketconcerns about the resolution of the financial
sector problems in Japan. This, in turn,contributed to a downward revision ofthe Japanese authorities™ assessment of
the domestic economic outlook. On31 December, the euro stood at JPY 124.39,which was 4.1% stronger than at the beginning
of the year and 14½% above its average levelin 2001. On 28 February 2003, the euro was
quoted at JPY 127.32, i.e. 7.8% stronger than
the 2002 average.In late 2001, the Swiss franc appreciated
against all major currencies, including theeuro, following the terrorist attacks inthe United States on 11 September 2001.
Throughout the first three quarters of 2002,
the Swiss currency remained broadly stablerelative to the euro, while it appreciated quite
sharply vis-à-vis the US dollar. Towards theend of the year, the Swiss franc strengthenedfurther against all major currencies in the
face of renewed global risk aversion. At theend of 2002, the euro was quoted atCHF 1.45, 2.1% weaker than at the beginning
of the year and 3.9% below its average level
in 2001. On 28 February 2003, the euro stoodat CHF 1.46, almost unchanged relative to its
2002 average.Current account moved into surplusin 2002The current account of the euro area
recorded a surplus of 62.1 billion in 2002,
compared with a deficit of 13.8 billion in2001 (all data refer to the Euro 12). Asubstantial increase in the goods surplusfrom  75.8 to 
132.7 billion (see Chart 24)was the main factor behind this development.The income and current transfers deficitsremained broadly unchanged. The rise in

the goods surplus resulted mostly from asignificant decline in the value of importscombined with a small increase in exports.
The fall in the value of goods imports in 2002compared with a year earlier related to
developments in both import volumes andprices (see Charts 25 and 26). First, importprices were lower in 2002 mainly because
of the sizeable appreciation of the euro inthe course of the year. Second, importvolumes remained broadly flat and belowChart 25Extra-euro area trade volumes 1)

62their 2001 level throughout 2002, in responseto subdued euro area demand. Reducedexpenditure on some import-intensive
product categories, particularly capital goods,seems to have been the main factorcontributing to the latter development.
The small increase in the value of goods
exports between 2001 and 2002 was
associated with an increase in exportvolumes, in line with the recovery in foreigndemand in 2002. However, the rise in

volumes was not fully reflected in value termsas extra-euro area export prices fell (asmeasured by unit value indices). It cannot
be excluded that euro area exportersreduced their profit margins to offset thedecline in competitiveness resulting from the
appreciation of the euro.
Net inflows in combined net direct andportfolio investment in 2002
The combined net direct and portfolio
investment accounts shifted from net
outflows of 63.4 billion in 2001 tonet inflows of 29.4 billion in 2002 (seeChart 27). This shift was partly due to thesharp reduction in net outflows in direct
investment between 2001 (101.5 billion) and2002 (21.0 billion), which largely reflects asubstantial decline in mergers and acquisitions
activity (see Box 8 for a detailed review of
developments in mergers and acquisitionsactivity in recent years). Moreover, net
inflows in portfolio investment in the euroarea increased in 2002, amounting to50.4 billion, against a background ofsignificant declines in global stock marketvaluations and the associated large falls bothin euro area investment in foreign equity
securities and in foreign investment in euroarea securities. Euro area residents alsoreduced their investment in debt instruments
abroad, while flows into euro area debtinstruments resulting from purchases by non-residents increased sizeably.One of the salient features in the financial
account in 2002 was that overall changes in
portfolio flows are no longer primarily relatedto developments in equity flows, as was thecase for most of 2001 and early 2002, but
were increasingly determined by flows in debtinstruments. Among debt instruments, the
euro area experienced net inflows in bonds
and notes (21.0 billion) and small netoutflows in money market instruments(9.7 billion) in 2002. The global economicslowdown and sharp equity price declinesChart 26Extra-euro area trade unit value indices 1)

are likely to have contributed to thesedevelopments. It is worth noting thatcross-border investment in money market
instruments surged, possibly owing toheightened uncertainty in the globalcorporate sector. In particular, euro area
residents invested 55.6 billion in foreignmoney market instruments comparedwith 20.7 billion in 2001, while foreigninvestors invested 45.9 billion in euro areamoney market instruments compared with4.5 billion a year earlier.Overall in 2002, the euro area balanceof payments displayed a combination of acurrent account surplus and significant net
inflows in combined direct and portfolio
investment. A counterpart of these netinflows was short-term operations of euro
area MFIs (excluding the Eurosystem) withnet outflows of 159.4 billion. As a result,the net external position of euro area MFIs
(excluding the Eurosystem) exhibited a swingfrom net liabilities at end-2001 to a net assetposition at end-2002.Box 8Trends in international mergers and acquisitions activity from 1990 to 2002The late 1990s and the first few years of this decade saw a boom in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity,in particular among European and US firms. Although declining substantially since its peak in 2000-2001,M&A transactions have become a highly important feature of the US and European economies, with much of
the M&A activity in the technology and telecommunications sectors. The purpose of this box is to outline
some of the main characteristics of recent trends, and in particular to analyse the bilateral M&A activitybetween the euro area and the United States.Trends in size and direction of M&A deals
Gross M&A activity1 in the euro area and the United States rose from 281 billion in 1990 to a peak of morethan 2,900 billion in 2000, falling to 673 billion in 2002. By far the most active in M&A transactions wereUS companies, which in gross terms were involved in deals worth around 1,800 billion in 2000 alone (seeChart A). The rise of M&A in the euro area was also strong in the 1990s, but less impressive than that in theChart A: Total value of mergers andacquisitions transactions(EUR billions)Sources: Thomson Financial and ECB calculations.Chart B: Location of euro area and USmergers and acquisitions transactions(as a percentage of total)Sources: Thomson Financial and ECB calculations.1990199219941996199820002002

64United States and the United Kingdom. Over the peak M&A period between 1997 and 2002, euro area firmswere involved in M&A deals worth more than 3,000 billion, or 6.9% of euro area GDP. By contrast, US
companies registered M&A transactions of around 6,400 billion, or 11% of US GDP, and UK companiesregistered around 2,000 billion, or 22.5% of UK GDP.
Comparing the rise in the number with the rise in the value of M&A transactions shows that the latter hasaccelerated more strongly in recent years. This indicates that the average size of M&A deals has become
substantially larger. In fact, the average value of M&A deals involving euro area firms increased from20 million in the period from 1990 to 1996 to 
90 million between 1997 and 2002. Although the averagevalue of M&A deals involving US and UK companies rose as well and remained substantially larger than that
of the euro area, the percentage growth in the average value of M&A deals in the euro area surpassed that of
the United States and the United Kingdom.Analysing the direction of M&A flows reveals that the share of foreign M&A transactions in the totaltransaction value generally rose throughout the 1990s in the euro area and was stable in the United States. Onekey difference between the United States and the euro area was the much higher share of domestic as opposed
to cross-border M&A activity in the United States. By contrast, euro area firms were much more involved inM&A with foreign companies than US firms, both in absolute terms as well as in relative terms (see Chart B).Although there does seem to be some coincidence between the start of Stage Three of EMU and the increasein M&A activity within the euro area, it is difficult to disentangle this from other factors such as legalharmonisation, advances in information technology and the deregulation and liberalisation of some sectors
and markets.Bilateral M&A transactions between the euro area and the United States
Bilateral M&A flows between the euro area and theUnited States have shown some marked differences

in recent years. M&A investment by euro area firms
in the United States and that by US firms in the euroarea were at similar levels in the first half of the

1990s. As from 1996, M&A investment by euroarea firms in the United States increaseddramatically, rising more than fivefold between that
year and 2000, whereas M&A flows in the other
direction rose only modestly (see Chart C). Thisshows a clear asymmetry in M&A flows between
the euro area and the United States. The rapideconomic and productivity growth in the secondhalf of the 1990s in the United States and its booming
stock market, in particular in the technology sector,are likely to have contributed to the attractiveness ofUS firms.As to the sectoral composition, 58% of US M&A investment went into euro area manufacturing firms, a muchlarger share than the proportion of euro area M&A investment in the US manufacturing sector, 36% (see
Chart D). By contrast, euro area firms invested a much larger share in US financial sector firms (25%) than UScompanies did in euro area financial sector firms (10%). In the high-tech sector2 the dramatic rise in M&A

Between 1995 and 2000, M&Atransactions in this sector rose exponentially both in the United States and in the euro area. Euro area M&Aactivity in the high-tech sector increased from around 10% of total euro area M&A activity in the first half ofthe 1990s to 50% in 2000. As equity valuations in the technology sector have declined since 2000, this share
has fallen dramatically, reaching less than 10% of total transactions in the first nine months of 2002. Not onlyis total M&A activity by US firms substantiallyhigher than that of euro area firms, but also the share
of M&A transactions in the high-tech sector was formost of the period substantially larger in the United
States than in the euro area.Euro area firms invested heavily in the UStechnology sector in order to gain expertise and
market access. Chart E shows that euro area M&Ainvestment in US high-tech companies increasedsubstantially until 2000, whereas US M&A

investment in euro area high-tech companies roseonly modestly. Partly overlapping with the high-tech industry, the telecommunications sub-sector3experienced a particularly sharp increase in M&Aactivity in the late 1990s. In fact, the value of theoperations involving euro area firms rose from less
than 50 billion annually before 1998 to more than300 billion in 1999.4 One point to be stressed is

66the telecommunications sub-sector was much less sizeable for the United States, where telecommunicationsM&A transactions reached only around 20% of total activity in 1999.Overall, the analysis of the sectoral composition and of bilateral flows reveals that the M&A boom of the late1990s and in recent years was mainly driven by acquisitions of technology and telecommunications firms by
both European and US companies. Since its peak in 2000, M&A activity has declined substantially, returningto levels comparable to those of the mid-1990s. This decline has been particularly strong in the high-techsectors of both the euro area and the United States.67ECB  Annual Report

701Monetary policy implementation
1.1Overview
The operational framework for theimplementation of the single monetary policy
worked effectively in 2002. The mainelements of the operational framework Œ theopen market operations, standing facilities
and minimum reserve system, as well asthe decentralised execution and administrationof operations by the NCBs 
Œ remained
unchanged.1The weekly main refinancing operations
(MROs), which normally have a two-weekmaturity, provide the bulk of the refinancingto the banking sector and play a pivotal role
in steering liquidity conditions and signalling
the stance of monetary policy. TheEurosystem also carries out monthly longer-
term refinancing operations (LTROs) with athree-month maturity, which are not,however, used to signal the monetary

policy stance. In addition to these regular
open market operations, the Eurosystemconducted three fine-tuning operations in

2002 to deal with unexpected developments
in liquidity conditions.
The two standing facilities offered by theEurosystem, namely the marginal lendingfacility and the deposit facility, which provide
and absorb overnight liquidity, play a part in
signalling the monetary policy stance and setan upper and lower limit for the overnight
market interest rate.
Besides conducting open market operationsand offering the standing facilities, theEurosystem requires credit institutions tohold minimum reserves, which are equal to
2% of specified short-term liabilities. The
purpose of minimum reserves, which are
fully remunerated, is to stabilise short-term

money market interest rates and enlargethe structural liquidity deficit of thebanking system vis-à-vis the Eurosystem.The averaging provision, which allowscounterparties to fulfil their reserverequirements on average over a one-monthreserve maintenance period, helps stabilisethese short-term rates by dampening theimpact on them of temporary liquidity shocks.
Thus, the Eurosystem can normally limit its
open market operations to the regular MROsand LTROs.The Eurosystem™s monetary policy frameworkallows a broad range of counterparties toparticipate in monetary policy operations. All

credit institutions subject to minimumreserves have, in principle, access to thestanding facilities and to the open market
operations based on standard tenders. In thisregard, the E-money Directive,
2 which had to
be implemented by the Member States by
27 April 2002, has amended the definitionof credit institutions subject to minimumreserves such that it also includes electronic
money institutions.In addition to the general eligibility criteria,counterparties must also fulfil all operational
criteria specified in the contractual orregulatory arrangements applied by the euro
area NCBs to ensure the efficient conduct ofmonetary policy operations. At the end of2002, 3,245 of the 6,926 euro area credit
institutions subject to minimum reserves had
access to the deposit facility and 2,867 to the
marginal lending facility. While 2,320 credit
institutions were eligible to participate inopen market operations based on standard
tenders, only 763 actually submitted bids in
one or more MROs, and 400 in one or moreLTROs. A selected group of 141 creditinstitutions were eligible for fine-tuning
operations. Compared with the situation atthe end of 2001, the total number of creditinstitutions subject to minimum reserves
decreased by 293 as a result of the continuedconsolidation of the banking industry.1A detailed description of the operational framework can be
found in the ECB publication ﬁThe single monetary policy in theeuro area: General documentation on Eurosystem monetary
policy instruments and proceduresﬂ, April 2002.2Directive 2000/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 18 September 2000 on the taking up, pursuit of and
prudential supervision of the business of electronic money
institutions.71ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1.2Liquidity management
The Eurosystem™s liquidity managementplays an important role in the implementationof the single monetary policy. It relies onthe assessment of the banking system
™sliquidity needs, which arise from reserve
requirements, excess reserves (defined hereas average current account holdings during
the maintenance period minus reserverequirements) and autonomous factors. The
latter refer to the items on the central bank
balance sheet not under the central bank™sdirect control, e.g. banknotes in circulation,government deposits and net foreign assets.While the amounts of reserve requirementsand excess reserves are normally known with
a relatively high degree of precision,
autonomous factors are more volatile andmore difficult for counterparties to predict.Therefore, the ECB publishes, on a weekly
basis, a forecast of the average size of theautonomous factors, which aims to help
counterparties prepare their bids for open
market operations. In 2002 the averageSource: ECB.Chart 28Liquidity factors and the use of standing facilities in the euro area in 2002(EUR billions)current accountsautonomous factors

72absolute error of these forecasts relativeto outcomes was 1.8 billion. In 2001 thecorresponding figure was 1.9 billion.Overall in 2002 the most volatile and alsomost difficult to forecast autonomous factor
was again government deposits held with theNCBs. However, after the euro cashchangeover in January 2002, difficulties were
also experienced in forecasting banknotes in
circulation. Indeed, the demand for new eurobanknotes turned out to be stronger than
anticipated by the Eurosystem, while at theBox 9Public consultation on measures to improve the efficiency of the operational
framework for monetary policyOn 7 October 2002 the Eurosystem launched a public consultation of the euro area banking communityregarding technical measures designed to improve the efficiency of the operational framework for monetarypolicy.The three measures proposed in the public consultation were:(1)to change the timing of the reserve maintenance period so that it would always start on the settlement
day of the MRO following the Governing Council meeting at which the assessment of monetary policy ispre-scheduled. Furthermore, as a rule, possible changes to the standing facility rates would be aligned with
the start of a new reserve maintenance period;(2)to shorten the maturity of the MROs from two weeks to one week; and
(3)to suspend the LTROs.
The change in the timing of the reserve maintenance period is aimed at addressing two issues: first, to reducethe impact of interest rate expectations on counterparties™ bidding behaviour in the MROs and, second, to
reduce the likelihood that reserve maintenance periods start and end on days when TARGET is closed, whichcan create costs for banks in fine-tuning their liquidity management via standing facilities.The shortening of the MRO maturity is a complementary measure, which will prevent MROs from overlappingfrom one reserve maintenance period to the next and thus from being affected by interest rate expectations forfuture reserve maintenance periods.Suspending the LTROs was proposed in order to promote a lean implementation of monetary policy. Thedeclining interest in these operations had raised doubts as to whether they still fulfilled their originally
intended role.The responses to the public consultation came from a wide range of euro area credit institutions, in terms ofboth location and size. While they generally supported the first two proposals, they revealed that the LTROscontinue to serve the liquidity management needs of many Eurosystem counterparties. Hence, the majority ofthe responses were against the third proposal.
The Governing Council decided in January 2003 to change the timing of the reserve maintenance period andto shorten the maturity of the MROs in the first quarter of 2004. However, it decided not to suspend the LTROs.same time the old national banknotes werereturned somewhat more slowly thanexpected. As a consequence, in January 2002

the errors in the Eurosystem™s forecasts oftotal banknotes in circulation were aroundfour times higher than on average. In order
to meet the unexpected demand for liquiditythat resulted from the temporary increase inthe demand for banknotes, the Eurosystem
carried out two liquidity-providing fine-tuningoperations. In addition, the ECB exceptionallyprovided more frequent updates of the
published autonomous factor forecasts, in73ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
order to make market participants aware ofthe unusual developments in liquidityconditions. By March 2002, the forecast

errors for banknotes in circulation hadreturned to normal.Notwithstanding the generally positiveassessment of the functioning of itsoperational framework since the introduction
of the euro in 1999, in 
October 2002 the
Eurosystem launched a 
public consultationregarding technical measures designed to
improve the framework™s efficiency (see Box 9).1.3Open market operations
In 2002 the Eurosystem settled 53 MROs
with an average allotment size of 67 billion,supplying 71% of the total refinancing
volume. They were conducted as variable
rate tenders with a minimum bid rateand following the multiple rate (ﬁAmericanﬂ)auction procedure. According to this
procedure, bids above the marginal allotment
rate (the lowest accepted bid) are satisfied in
full and at the interest rate offered, while

bids at the marginal rate are allotted prorata. As a result of the variable rate tenderand multiple rate auction procedure, the
allotment rates (i.e. the marginal rate and theweighted average rate) are normally higher
than the minimum bid rate. Reflecting the

absence of strong expectations of interestrate increases in 2002, the average spreadbetween the marginal rate and the minimum
bid rate remained rather narrow at 4.8 basispoints. Furthermore, as in the previous yearthe average spread between the weighted
average rate and the marginal rate stood at1.4 basis points, confirming a continued high
degree of confidence and precision among
counterparties in forecasting the allotment
amounts and rates.The average number of counterparties
participating in the MROs declined in 2002by 25% to 307, although the total bid amount
remained on average almost twice as highas the allotted amounts. There are no signsthat the lower number of banks obtainingrefinancing directly from the Eurosystem hascaused problems for the euro area bankingsystem with regard to the allocation of

central bank liquidity among banks. Indeed,
competition for liquidity in the MROs aswell as in the overnight market remains at
a high level. The declining participation inMROs probably results from the ongoingconsolidation in the euro area banking
industry, the increased concentration oftreasury management activities within bankinggroups, and the greater efficiency of the
money market, which may have reduced thenumber of counterparties wishing to obtainliquidity directly from the Eurosystem.In addition to the MROs, the Eurosystemalso conducts LTROs on a regular basis.
These are liquidity-providing reversetransactions with a monthly frequency and amaturity of three months. On average over

the year, LTROs provided about 29% ofthe total refinancing volume. By contrast withthe MROs, the LTROs are not, as a rule,
conducted with the intention of steeringthe liquidity situation or signalling themonetary policy stance. Accordingly, they
are conducted as pure variable rate tenders
with a pre-announced allotment volumeand following the multiple rate (ﬁAmericanﬂ)auction procedure. Whilst the pre-announcedallotment volume was 20 billion in the first
half of 2002, the Governing Council decided
on 10 July 2002 to reduce it to 15 billionfor the second half of the year. The averagenumber of banks participating in the LTROs
fell to 186 in 2002, representing a decline of
17% compared with 2001, mainly for the samereasons as those previously mentioned for
the MROs.In the LTROs, the dispersion of bids was
generally greater than in the MROs, mainlyon account of the absence of a minimum bidrate and the longer maturity. On average
over the year, the weighted average rateexceeded the marginal rate by 1.9 basispoints, compared with 2.7 basis points in
2001. The bid cover ratio averaged 2.1
despite the fall in the number of participatingcounterparties.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
74As mentioned previously, the Eurosystemconducted two fine-tuning operations on4 and 10 January 2002 in order to meet the
higher than expected demand for liquiditycaused by the euro cash changeover. Theseovernight reverse operations were conducted
as variable rate tenders with the same 3.25%minimum bid rate as the preceding MROs.In the first operation, 25 billion wasallotted and 61 banks participated. In thesecond, 40 billion was allotted and 63 banksparticipated. The marginal and weighted

average rates were 3.30% and 3.32%
respectively in the first quick tender, decliningto 3.28% and 3.30% in the second.
In addition, a liquidity-providing fine-tuning
operation with a six-day maturity was
conducted on 18 December as a variable rate
tender with a minimum bid rate of 2.75%.
50 counterparties submitted bids in the
operation and 10 billion was allotted at amarginal rate of 2.80% and a weighted average
rate of 2.82%. The operation was aimed at
reducing the liquidity shortage that resultedfrom the fact that counterparties, in the last
MRO of the reserve maintenance period,
allotted a day before, bid less than was
needed to fulfil reserve requirements.However, the allotment amount, which did
not fully compensate the liquidity shortage,
also took into account the ECB™s aim topreserve incentives for counterparties to bid
sufficiently in MROs.
1.4Standing facilities
There are normally two reasons for creditinstitutions having recourse to the standingfacilities. First, if an aggregate liquidityimbalance materialises, the banking system as
a whole either has too little or too muchliquidity relative to the aggregate reserverequirement. If such liquidity shortages or
excesses emerge after the last MRO of themaintenance period has been allotted, theyneed to be offset by aggregate recourse to
the marginal lending facility or the deposit
facility. Note that these aggregate imbalancesexplain the spikes in the lower panel ofChart 28. Second, unexpected payment flowsbetween individual banks at the end of theday, when the money market is no longer

liquid, may trigger individual recourse to thestanding facilities. Such recourse can take
place at any time during the maintenance
period if the unexpected liquidity flowscannot, for some reason, be automatically
smoothed by the averaging provision of the
minimum reserve system.In 2002 there was a decline in both aggregateand individual use of standing facilities. Theuse of the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility was respectively 32% and 64%
lower than in 2001. The decline in theaggregate use of standing facilities can be
primarily attributed to the fact that there
was only one relatively minor instance ofunderbidding in 2002, but also to the
improved forecasting of liquidity needs by
the Eurosystem. The individual use of standing
facilities has been declining steadily sincethe beginning of 1999, reaching a daily average

of 0.1 billion in 2002. This developmentprobably reflects greater efficiency ofcounterparties™ liquidity management.
1.5The minimum reserve system
The average aggregate reserve requirement
for credit institutions in the euro area was
129.9 billion in 2002. Although this was a5.9 billion increase compared with 2001,the overall trend during the year was
downwards. The highest aggregate reserverequirement was 131.7 billion in the
maintenance period ending on 23 February
2002 and the lowest 127.7 billion in themaintenance period ending on 23 October.The average monthly reserve base subject to
the 2% reserve ratio increased by 3.5%relative to 2001, a significantly lower rate ofgrowth than that observed in previous years.Of the 6,926 credit institutions subject tominimum reserves at the end of 2002, 4,432
fulfilled their requirements directly, while the
others fulfilled them indirectly through an
intermediary. The current account holdings75ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
of banks fluctuated between 109.1 billionand 161.7 billion in the course of the year,indicating that a substantial buffer against

unexpected liquidity withdrawals was alwaysavailable (see the upper panel of Chart 28).
Mainly owing to the averaging provision of
the minimum reserve system, the volatility of
the EONIA (euro overnight index average)continued to be low in 2002. The standard
deviation of its daily changes was only12 basis points, which is rather low byinternational standards and taking into
account the very low frequency of fine-tuningoperations. In 2001 the corresponding figurewas 15 basis points. Consequently, the two
main functions of the minimum reservesystem, namely the stabilisation of money
market interest rates and the enlargement of
the structural liquidity deficit of the bankingsector, were successfully performed in 2002.During 2002, on average 28 cases of non-compliance with the obligation to holdminimum reserves were reported per reserve
maintenance period, corresponding to anaverage daily shortfall of 10.5 million. Halfof these cases were only for small amounts,
and penalties of below 500 were imposed.However, there were also several ratherlarge infringements and during the year
13 cases led to fines in excess of 10,000.Most of the non-compliant credit institutionsacknowledged the errors, while ten
institutions raised objections that required adecision by the Executive Board of the ECB.1.6Eligible assets
The Statute of the ESCB requires that allthe Eurosystem™s credit operations becovered by adequate collateral. The collateral
framework of the Eurosystem is designed to
protect the Eurosystem against incurring
losses in its monetary policy and payment
systems operations (see also Chapter III onrisk control measures), to ensure the equaltreatment of counterparties and to enhance
operational efficiency. Common eligibilitycriteria for collateral accepted for creditoperations conducted by the Eurosystem areapplied. At the same time, due regard is givento differences in central bank practices and
financial structures across the euro area
and to the need to ensure sufficientavailability of adequate collateral forEurosystem credit operations. Article 102
of the Treaty establishing the European
Community prohibits privileged access bypublic institutions to financial institutions;
therefore there can be no discriminationwithin the collateral framework on thegrounds of the public or private sector status
of the issuers.In order to take account of differencesin the financial structure of euro areacountries, assets eligible for Eurosystem
credit operations include a large number of
different instruments. A distinction is made
between two categories of eligible assets,referred to as ﬁtier oneﬂ and 
ﬁtier twoﬂ. Thisdistinction has no bearing on their eligibilityfor the various types of Eurosystem monetary
policy operations, except that tier two assets
are not normally expected to be used bythe Eurosystem in outright transactions (atpresent not conducted). Tier one consists of
marketable debt instruments fulfilling uniformeligibility criteria specified by the ECB. Tier
two consists of assets which are of particular
importance for national financial markets andbanking systems and for which eligibilitycriteria are established by the NCBs in
accordance with the minimum eligibility
criteria. The specific national eligibility criteriafor tier two assets are subject to approval by
the ECB. Tier two assets may be marketableor non-marketable debt instruments or theymay be equities.A substantial part of tier one assets (whichinclude debt instruments only) is made up of
general government securities, (i.e. assetsissued by central, state and local governmentsand social security funds) and of Pfandbrief-
style securities issued by credit institutions
and backed by residential mortgages or by
public sector debt. Together general
government and Pfandbrief-style securitiesform the most abundant source of eligible
assets (see Chart 29). Other types of assetsECB  Annual Report 
 2002
76included in tier one are securities issued by
international and supranational institutions,private sector securities (i.e. uncovered bondsissued by credit institutions, bonds issued by
corporations and asset-backed securitiesother than Pfandbrief-style securities). Inparticular, bonds issued by corporations have

registered a remarkable increase since 1999.Tier two assets consist of Œ in addition to
marketable assets Œ non-marketable debt
instruments such as bank loans, trade bills
and mortgage-backed promissory notes.The total amount of tier one assets eligible
as collateral for Eurosystem credit operationswas 6.9 trillion at the end of 2002,compared with 6.6 trillion at the end of2001. The total amount of marketable tier
two assets decreased from 340 million in2001 to 265 million in 2002, mainly as aconsequence of equity market developments.3Overall, tier one assets accounted for anincreasing proportion of eligible assets (96%at the end of 2002).The total amount of assets deposited bycounterparties as collateral for Eurosystemcredit operations was 700 billion at the endof 2002, compared with 720 billion at theend of 2001. Overall, the share of debtinstruments issued by credit institutions inthe total remained stable at 52%, as in 2001.

The same path, although at a lower level, was
observed for the share of corporate bonds,whereas the share of government issues
decreased. The share of non-marketable bankloans has been relatively stable at around 4%of all assets deposited during the past four

years.Eurosystem counterparties may use eligibleassets on a cross-border basis, i.e. they can
obtain funds from the NCB of the country inwhich they are established by making use of
assets located in another euro area country.To enable the cross-border use of collateralin all types of Eurosystem liquidity-providing3The outstanding amounts of debt instruments are reported in

operations, the correspondent centralbanking model (CCBM), as well as linksbetween securities settlement systems (SSSs)
that have been positively assessed againstEurosystem standards, are available. TheCCBM can be used for all eligible assets,
including non-marketable assets and tier twoassets with restricted liquidity and specialfeatures that cannot be transferred through
an SSS (see Chapter VII). The share of cross-border collateral in total collateral depositedfor Eurosystem credit operations has been

increasing substantially, from 9% in April
1999 to 33% at the end of 2002 (seeChart 30). This increase involves all types of
assets, but particularly those issued bycredit institutions and corporations. Themanagement and publication of the complete

list of assets eligible for Eurosystem credit
operations are handled centrally at the ECB,where an Eligible Assets Database is kept.
The NCBs submit information to the ECB on
eligible assets issued in their respectivenational markets. Assets are only consideredeligible for Eurosystem credit operationswhen they appear in the list published by the
ECB. Since June 2002, the ECB has on a daily
basis been collecting data and posting them
in the 
ﬁMFIs and Eligible assets
ﬂ section of its
website. Interested parties may also request

the updates or the full list of eligible assets
in electronic form. The new updating
procedure has increased the quality, efficiency
and reliability of the service provided toEurosystem counterparties.1.7Money market activity
The introduction of the euro led to the
creation of a large, liquid and integratedmoney market across the euro area,
particularly in the unsecured segment(e.g. unsecured lending and foreign exchangeswaps). In 2002 progress was also made in

the secured segment (e.g. repos and short-term securities), the money market segment
that has been lagging behind the most so far.Chart 30Use of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations

78The euro repo market has evolved in termsof both size and structure, becoming a soundalternative to unsecured lending or short-
term securities issuance. The use of repos toobtain funding has spread across a broadrange of financial market participants. Most
repo transactions are conducted on the basisof sovereign bonds, but a diversification ofthe type of collateral has taken place. There
is also an overall trend towards theacceptance of a wider basket of sovereignbonds in general collateral (GC) repos,
reinforced by the launch of the EUREPOindex in March 2002, which is the benchmark
for the euro GC repo market. However,
despite the considerable progress that hasbeen made, the integration of the nationalrepo markets into one unified market is still
a slow and complex process.In the short-term securities segment, which
is characterised by a lesser degree ofdevelopment and integration, an initiative hasbeen launched by ACI-STEP, the Short-term
European Paper Task Force set up byACI Œ The Financial Markets Association, to
improve the current situation. The taskforce has so far made a number ofrecommendations. On ACI™s behalf, the ECBhosted a public consultation on how theEuropean short-term securities markets couldbe further integrated, the results of which
will be made public in 2003.The third ESCB report on the structure andfunctioning of the euro money market,
4 based
on data collected from banks in 2001, showedthat overall growth in money market activity

continued, although at a lower rate than inprevious years. In the unsecured segment,the data did not indicate a clear trend in
turnover, but confirmed that activity isconcentrated in the overnight segment andmaturities of up to one month. In the secured
segment, growth in turnover continued in2001. In the OTC derivatives segments, the
most rapid growth was reported for interest
rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. Finally,
activity in euro-denominated interest rate
futures, options and short-term securities
increased significantly.4ﬁThe Euro Money Market Study 2001ﬂ, December 2002.2Foreign exchange operations and the management of the ECB
™sforeign reserves and own funds
2.1Foreign exchange operations
In 2002 the ECB did not conduct anyintervention of its own in the foreignexchange market. However, on 28 June the

ECB did conduct operations in the foreignexchange market on behalf of the Bank ofJapan under the agency agreement with the

latter, acting as an agent of the Japanese
Ministry of Finance.The standing arrangement between the ECBand the International Monetary Fund (IMF)to facilitate the initiation of special drawing
right (SDR) transactions by the IMF on behalfof the ECB with other SDR holders, wasactivated on one occasion in 2002.
2.2Foreign reserve management
The aim of the management of the ECB
™sforeign reserves is to ensure that, at anygiven point in time, the ECB has an adequate

amount of liquid resources at its disposal forany foreign exchange intervention, if andwhen the Governing Council decides that this
is necessary. Liquidity and security aretherefore the basic requirements for theinvestment of the ECB™s foreign reserves.Subject to these constraints, the ECB™sforeign reserves are managed in such a way
as to maximise their return.At the end of 2002 the ECB™s net foreignreserve assets amounted to 43.2 billion,compared with 46.8 billion at the end of79ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
2001. The change mainly reflects theappreciation of the euro seen in 2002. Thepossibility exists for the ECB to make further
calls on the euro area NCBs™ foreign reserve
assets under the conditions defined insecondary European Community legislation
(i.e. Council Regulation (EC) No. 1010/2000of 8 May 2000 concerning further calls offoreign reserve assets by the European
Central Bank).The ECB™s foreign reserves are managed in adecentralised manner by the euro areaNCBs on the basis of investment guidelines,a strategic benchmark approved by the
Governing Council and a tactical benchmarkdetermined by the Executive Board. Inaddition to the currency distribution, the
ECB defines four key parameters for theinvestment of its foreign reserves: first, a two-level investment benchmark (i.e. a strategic

benchmark and a tactical benchmark) for each
currency; second, permitted deviations from
these benchmarks in terms of the interest
rate risk; third, a list of eligible instrumentsand operations; and, fourth, limits for creditrisk exposures (see Chapter III). NCBs then
use the leeway given to them by the deviationbands and risk limits to maximise the returnon their portfolios relative to the tactical
benchmark, subject to monitoring by the ECB.When conducting the ECB™s investmentactivity, NCBs act on behalf of the ECB on a
disclosed agency basis, so that the ECB
™scounterparties can distinguish the operationscarried out by the NCBs on behalf of the

ECB from those carried out by the NCBs fortheir own account.The Governing Council has defined thecurrency distribution of the ECB™s foreignreserves, which mainly consist of US dollars

but also include Japanese yen, gold andSDRs. The currency distribution is based onoptimal currency allocation studies and
prospective operational needs, and the
Governing Council may change it if and whenit deems this appropriate. The ECB™s goldassets continue not to be managed actively,in line with the Central Bank Gold Agreementof 26 September 1999. This agreementstipulates, among other things, that thesignatories will not increase their activity ingold lending, futures and options markets.The NCBs manage the ECB™s foreign reservesin accordance with ECB Guidelines and
Instructions. In addition, they manage theirown foreign reserves as they see fit. Theiroperations in foreign currencies are subject,
above certain limits, to ECB notification or
approval, in order to ensure consistency withthe monetary policy of the ECB.Since its launch, this framework hasfunctioned satisfactorily, and work is
continuously undertaken to enhance portfolioand risk management techniques. Theintroduction of money market and bond
futures for managing the foreign exchangereserves Œ in line with the gradual extension
of the range of investment instruments
used and to improve the efficiency withwhich positions are taken Œ was successfully
completed in the first quarter of 2002.Data on international reserves and foreigncurrency liquidity are published monthly for

both the ECB and the Eurosystem on theECB™s website, with a one-month lag, in linewith the IMF
™s Special Data DisseminationStandard. This complements the information
provided by the consolidated financialstatement of the Eurosystem, which is

The principal purpose of the ECB™s capital isto provide the ECB with a reserve to meetpossible losses. Furthermore, in managing theECB™s own funds, the objective should be togenerate earnings in excess of the weightedaverage rate of allotment in the MROs over
the long term.At the end of 2002 the ECB
™s own fundsportfolio amounted to 5.6 billion, comparedwith 4.8 billion at the end of 2001. Thischange partly reflects the transfer of part ofthe ECB™s total operating profit for 2001 toECB  Annual Report 
 2002
80the general reserve fund, which forms a partof the own funds. Apart from the increase inthe general reserve fund, the change in the
size of the own funds portfolio during 2002also reflected the interest income earned andthe change in the market value of the assets
in the portfolio.The decision-making bodies of the ECBdetermine four key parameters for theinvestment of its own funds in the Europeanbond markets: first, a strategic investment
benchmark; second, a permitted deviationfrom this benchmark in terms of the interestrate risk; third, a list of eligible instruments
and operations; and, fourth, limits for creditrisk exposures. The ECB then uses the scopeprovided by the deviation bands and risk
limits to maximise the return on the ownfunds portfolio.In view of their purpose and the keyparameters outlined above, the own fundsare mainly invested in euro area government
bonds and some other highly ratedcollateralised bonds. Certain euro area bondfutures and direct securities lending
transactions were added to the eligibleinstruments in 1999, and an automaticsecurities lending programme for own funds

was implemented in 2001. In addition, the
ECB continued in 2002 to diversify its fixed-income investments towards high-quality non-
sovereign issuers, with the aim of improving
the risk/return profile of the own fundsportfolio.2.4Organisation of the ECB
™s foreignreserves and own fundsmanagementIn December 2001 the ECB™s portfoliomanagement activities were partially
reorganised by the Executive Board, with themeasures taking effect from 1 January 2002.The foreign reserve and own funds
management activities of the ECB were
brought together in a single Division, with a
view to both maximising the synergies
between these two areas and furtherstrengthening the Chinese wall betweenmonetary policy operations and investment

activities.Besides the strengthened Chinese wall,further arrangements have been put in place
to ensure that the ECB™s investment activitiesdo not interfere with the ECB™s monetarypolicy. First, there is no active foreigncurrency trading and, second, the ECB™s ownfunds are managed on a semi-passive
basis to avoid generating any signals thatcould be misconstrued as being monetarypolicy-related, especially if money market
transactions are involved.In addition to the above-mentionedrefinement of the organisational structure,work is under way to enhance the efficiencyof the ECB™s portfolio management activities,for example, via the introduction of electronictrading platforms. The functionalities of theportfolio management IT system have also
been further improved, particularly in thearea of collateral management.81ECB  Annual Report

Chapter IIIRisk managementECB  Annual Report 
 2002
841Overview
The ECB has a risk management frameworkto measure, monitor and report all risksresulting from the financial and policyoperations incurred by the ECB directly or
by the 12 NCBs of the Eurosystem on behalfof the ECB. The ECB risk managementfunction is responsible for the integration of
the entire process of policies, proceduresand systems that the ECB has in place tomanage these risks.The risk management framework of the ECBfocuses on two main areas: policy operations
and investment operations. The formerfocuses on the risk associated with theEurosystem™s monetary policy and paymentsystems operations (principally through the
provision of intraday liquidity via the TARGET
system). The latter focuses on the risksassociated with the management of foreignreserve assets and the ECB™s own capitalfunds.To avoid conflicts of interest, and in line withbest practices, the process of measuring,monitoring and reporting risk in the ECB is

coupled with a direct reporting line to theExecutive Board separate from the risk-takingfunctions.The risk management framework of the ECBoperated efficiently in 2002, continuing the

overall positive performance since thestart of Monetary Union. This successreflects the ECB™s commitment to buildingand maintaining a strong, proactive riskmanagement culture, which is essential to itsreputation and credibility in the long term.2Policy operations
In policy operations (i.e. monetary policy or
payment systems credit operations), the
Eurosystem incurs a risk when entering intoa transaction with a counterparty which maybe unable to meet its credit obligations. This
credit risk is mitigated by the requirement ofadequate collateral to guarantee the credit
provided. Although the collateralisation of the
credit minimises the risk of financial loss due
to the default of the counterparty, it doesnot completely eliminate it. Collateralisation
transforms credit risk into market andliquidity risks or, in other words, the risk ofrealising the collateral with a loss after an
adverse market movement or a liquidityevent. The risk control framework put inplace aims to manage effectively the potential

market and liquidity risks to which theEurosystem could be exposed when realisingthe collateral pledge by a counterparty which
defaults on a policy operation.The framework also places strong emphasison the credit quality assessment of thecollateral eligible for policy operations, as thisis essential to mitigate credit risk. All assetsused as eligible collateral in Eurosystem credit
operations have to fulfil certain common
criteria, as laid down in the collateralframework. An important criterion ofeligibility is that assets used as collateral in
Eurosystem credit operations must meet highcredit standards. The ECB risk managementfunction is responsible for assessing and
monitoring the different sources of creditrisk information used by the Eurosystem in
the assessment of the credit standards used

to grant eligibility to financial assets. Inaddition, it is responsible for advising on theminimum required level of credit quality of
new asset classes that from time to time are
proposed for inclusion in the eligible
collateral pool of the Eurosystem.Owing to the differences in the financial
structure from one Member State to another
and for purposes internal to the Eurosystem,a distinction is made between the twocategories of assets eligible for Eurosystem
credit operations. These two categories arereferred to as ﬁtier oneﬂ and 
ﬁtier twoﬂ (see
Chapter II).85ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
3Risk management framework of policy operations
The framework for managing the risksassociated with the Eurosystem™s policyoperations has three main components,namely the risk control of collateral, the
valuation principles and the credit riskassessment of collateral.Risk control of collateralTier one and tier two assets are both subjectto risk control measures. These are appliedto the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem
credit operations in order to protect theEurosystem against the risk of financial loss ifthe collateral has to be realised owing to the

default of a counterparty. By realising the
collateral, the Eurosystem recovers the
liquidity provided. It is in this situation that
the Eurosystem incurs market and liquidity risksassociated with the collateral. To control theserisks, the Eurosystem continued to have
initial margins, valuation haircuts, variationmargins, limits in relation to issuers/debtors orguarantors, as well as additional guarantees, at
its disposal in 2002, and made use of the first
three of these tools over the period.To obtain an adequate level of risk control,an evaluation, in line with best marketpractices, of parameters such as current and

potential price developments and relatedprice volatilities is performed. Value at Risk(VaR) measures are used to estimate the
valuation haircuts needed to reflect themaximum loss of market value which,
assuming historical conditions, could be
generated by the collateral with a given level
of statistical confidence over a given periodof time. Additional measures used to calibrate
the valuation haircuts include back testingand stress testing.The Eurosystem applies the valuation haircutsaccording to asset type, residual maturity andcoupon structure. The haircuts are applied
by deducting a certain percentage from themarket value of the asset. Initial margins areapplied to the credit amount. Symmetricmargin calls, or variation margins, are madewhenever the collateral does not match thecollateral value requirements. Margin calls canbe met either by supplying additional assets

or by means of cash payments.For tier one assets, three haircut groups were
once again used in 2002: fixed rate, floatingrate and inverse floating rate instruments.The valuation haircuts applied to tier two
assets reflect the specific risks associated withthese assets and are at least as stringent asthe haircuts applied to tier one assets. Initial
margins and margin calls are applied to tier
two assets in a similar fashion as to tier oneassets. Four different haircut groups exist for
tier two assets, reflecting differences in their
intrinsic characteristics and liquidity. In 2002work was under way to incorporate liquidity
risk in the valuation haircuts of tier oneassets.Valuation principlesThe assets used as collateral are subject toa daily valuation and NCBs calculate the
required value of underlying assets on a daily

basis, taking into account the valuationprinciples required by the Eurosystem.For marketable tier one and tier two assets,a single reference market is selected as the
price source. This defines the most
representative price on the reference market.
This reference price source is used tovalue the collateral in a marked-to-market
approach. If more than one price is quoted,the lowest of these prices is used. For non-marketable tier two assets or for those
marketable assets which are not normallytraded, so that marking to market is not
possible, a mark-to-model strategy, based on

present-value discounting of future cash
flows, has been implemented. The discounting
is based on an appropriate zero coupon
curve, and differences in credit risk betweenissuers are explicitly taken into accountthrough credit spreads. In 2002 workECB  Annual Report 
 2002
86commenced to enhance the valuationmethods in order to satisfy the need for daily
valuation of collateral using representative
valuations. In this future valuation scheme,special attention will be paid to theenhancement of theoretical valuation
methods and to checks to be performed toensure a representative valuation when usingmarket prices.
Credit risk assessmentAssets used as collateral in Eurosystemcredit operations must meet high credit
standards. High credit quality collateral isrequired to mitigate the credit risk of thecounterparty borrowing liquidity from the
Eurosystem. When the collateral consideredis default-risk-free (e.g. government bonds),collateralisation is a way to transform credit
risk into market risk (managed with riskcontrols as described above) as the default-risky counterparty provides a default-risk-free
asset to guarantee its position. Even whenthe collateral itself can be defaultable (as withcorporate bonds), the credit risk is strongly
mitigated if the credit quality of the bonds issufficiently high.In the assessment of the standard of debtinstruments, the ECB takes into account, inter
alia, available market agency ratings and theNCBs™ own credit assessment systems, as well
as certain institutional criteria which would
ensure particularly high protection of theholders, including guarantees. TheEurosystem does not accept as underlying
assets debt instruments issued or guaranteedby the counterparty, or by any other entitywith which the counterparty has close links.
The credit quality of the eligible assets isconstantly monitored to check that it isequivalent to at least the minimum level of

financial soundness specified by theEurosystem.The ECB acts as the assessor arm of theEurosystem in the analysis of eligibility ofrating companies that rate collateral. The ECB
applies a number of criteria in the assessmentprocess in which independence and credibilityare key elements. The ECB also monitors the
assessment provided by NCBs™ credit
assessment systems and, from time to time,by national rating companies which rate

national tier two assets. In 2002 the ECBcontinued its effort to improve thecomparability of the different sources of
credit assessment used to rate collateraland the analysis of new sources ofcredit assessment information, following the
foreseeable impact of the Basel Committee™sproposals on the new Basel Capital Accord.4Investment operations
The ECB has two kinds of investment: first, a
reserve portfolio consisting of foreigncurrency reserves, gold and special drawing
rights (SDRs) and, second, a euro investmentportfolio (the ECB™s ﬁown fundsﬂ). In theseinvestment activities, the ECB is exposed to
a range of risks. In investment operations the
ECB incurs market risks arising from adversemovements in interest rates, exchange rates

and other asset prices such as gold. Inaddition, the ECB is exposed to liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk is a major consideration for the
foreign reserve asset portfolio, a primaryobjective of which is the availability of highlyliquid assets for potential use in an
intervention in currency markets. Finally, theECB™s investments are exposed to credit risk.The risk control framework of the ECB for
investment operations lays down the policies,
systems and tools to manage these risks.The foreign currency reserves aredenominated in US dollars and Japanese yen
and are actively managed on behalf of the
ECB by the NCBs of the Eurosystem. Themain objective of holding this portfolio is itspotential use in an intervention in the
currency markets. Gold positions are notactively managed, in line with the CentralBank Gold Agreement of 26 September 1999.87ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
The ECB™s ﬁown fundsﬂ (i.e. the domestic
portfolio) is managed by a portfoliomanagement team at the ECB. These

investments are designed to provide the ECBwith a reserve to meet possible losses and togenerate earnings over the long term on the
funds invested, in excess of the average mainrefinancing rate of the ECB.The ECB™s financial health and reputation aredependent on the appropriate managementof the investment portfolio. A risk
management structure independent from
the ﬁrisk-takingﬂ unit is in place. The
independence of the risk management
function is built into the organisationalstructure of the ECB.
5Risk management framework for investment operations
The framework for managing the risks
associated with the ECB
™s investmentoperations has three interrelated
components, namely risk management
measures, the analysis of investmentperformance and the analytical framework for
asset allocation.Risk management measures and
complianceAs the ECB is exposed to market, credit andliquidity risk, the exposures to these risksand compliance with the risk parameters are
monitored daily. This independent monitoringis integral to the investment framework. The
main measures of market risk observed are

modified duration and Value at Risk.Compliance with a range of counterparty andasset class limits is part of the ECB™s creditrisk management system. All eligible
counterparties must meet minimum ratingcriteria and satisfy certain operational
constraints. The liquidity profile of theinvestments is also monitored daily. All
eligible assets must meet agreed liquidity

criteria. Clear procedures are in place forreporting and dealing with any breaches ofthe framework.In 2002 efforts continued on the creation ofa comprehensive IT platform to bring
together all the risk management applicationsand complement the current treasury system.Finally, as the investment universe has

widened for the ECB, and in line withdevelopments in the asset management
industry, work has commenced on the setting
and allocation of relative VaR limits toportfolio managers. Operationalisation of thisconcept will place new demands on both the
risk managers and the portfolio managers.
Analysis of investment performanceThe measurement and analysis ofperformance forms a large part of the riskmanagement work. Monthly performance is
calculated for all portfolios. In addition, more
detailed and analytical semi-annual and annualperformance reports are prepared andsubmitted to the Governing Council.The sources of performance relative to theinvestment benchmarks are also identified and
provide useful feedback to the portfoliomanagers. Aggregating these data over longerperiods allows more detailed conclusions to
be drawn. This analysis can also be useful forpolicy-makers in deciding on any modificationto the investment framework. The use of
various asset classes and differing creditpositions within portfolios is also analysed todeepen the understanding of performance.
Work is under way on further enhancementsand a refinement of the performanceattribution system. This will enrich the ex
post analysis of performance and allow policy-
makers to reflect on clear trends andpatterns.Analytical framework for asset allocationThis framework of asset allocation is the
cornerstone of the ECB investment process.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
88The primary focus is on an optimal currencydistribution of the foreign currency reservesand an optimal asset allocation for each

currency portfolio. All of the above are
reflected in strategic benchmarks which aredesigned to reflect the long-term risk return
preferences of the ECB. The benchmarks arecrucial to the investment performance of theECB as they are the main determinants of the
returns earned.The goal of asset allocation is to maximisethe return, subject to pre-agreed constraints.Considerable resources are devoted to the
development of the methodology used in theasset allocation process. For the 2002 review,a purpose-built econometric model was used
to derive the expected returns on assetclasses for use in the optimisation exercise.
Given the importance of the asset allocation
exercise to the ECB, the methodology issubject to periodic reviews and continuousimprovements are sought.89ECB  Annual Report

Chapter IVEconomic developmentsin the other countries of theEuropean UnionECB  Annual Report 
 2002
92The Eurosystem and the NCBs of the non-participating EU countries co-operate closelyin the context of the General Council of the
ECB, with a view to contributing to themaintenance of price stability in the EU as awhole. A regular review of macroeconomic
conditions as well as monetary and exchangerate policies is an integral part of the co-ordination exercise between the Eurosystem
and the three NCBs currently notparticipating in the single monetary policy.Although these NCBs conduct their monetary

policies within different institutional andoperational frameworks, the ultimate goal ofmonetary policy for all of them is to maintain

price stability.DenmarkThere was a moderate upturn in the Danisheconomy in 2002, with real GDP growing by1.6%, up from 1.4% in 2001 (see Table 11).Real GDP growth in 2002 was primarilydriven by domestic demand, most notablyprivate consumption, which rose in line withhigher real disposable income. The Whitsun

package of 1998, a tax reform package which
was mainly designed to increase privatesaving, became fully implemented in 2002.
Real house price developments had no majorimpact on private consumption, whereas thedecline in stock prices had a limited negative
wealth effect. Fixed investment, particularlyin transport and machinery, and publicconsumption also contributed to growth
during the year. Although the contribution of
net exports to real GDP growth moderatedin 2002, the continued buoyancy
of exports is noteworthy against the
background of sluggish world demand. Theunemployment rate remained low at 4.5%.Against the background of a tight labourmarket and higher energy prices, HICP
inflation remained at around 2.4% for most
of the year, apart from a peak in November
when it reached 2.8%. Average annual HICP1997199819992000200120022002200220022002

inflation stood above that in the euro area,mainly due to a rise in prices for educationand other services (see Chart 31). Raising
the labour supply continues to besignificant in helping to ease wage pressures,
although increases in unit labour costs

moderated compared with 2001, largely dueto the recovery in labour productivity.Developments in real effective exchange rates
indicate that Danish competitiveness relativeto the euro area remained broadly stable in2002.Public finances remained sound in 2002. Thegeneral government surplus stood at 1.9% of

GDP, 1 percentage point lower than in the
previous year. About half of this declinereflects an accounting effect of pension
reform. Moreover, corporate income taxreceipts fell moderately. Government debtcontinued to decline slightly, from 45.4% of

GDP in 2001 to 45.2% in 2002. The
supplement to the updated DanishConvergence Programme targets budgetary

surpluses of 1.9% and 2.4% of GDP in 2003
and 2004 respectively. The balance for 2003is 0.2 percentage point lower than envisaged
in the previous update, largely owing to
statistical revisions and higher unemployment.The gross debt ratio is expected to decline
to 42.1% of GDP in 2003 and 39.2% in 2004.
Denmark is currently the only countryparticipating in ERM II. It continues to pursue
a fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro,maintaining a narrow band of ±2.25% around

its ERM II central rate of DKK 7.46038 againstthe euro. Developments in key official andshort-term market interest rates should

primarily be seen against the background ofthe ECB™s interest rate decisions anddevelopments in the exchange rate of the
krone against the euro. The Danish kroneremained very close to central parity inERM II during 2002, holding a level marginally

stronger than its central rate (see Chart 32).
On 29 August the krone reached
DKK 7.424, its strongest level of the year
vis-à-vis the euro. Foreign exchange reservesincreased to their highest level in the thirdquarter of 2002, declining slightly towardsthe end of the year. One reason for therecent strength of the krone stems from thesale of foreign stocks by Danish pension funds
in order to reduce their overall risk levels in
the face of declines in global stock prices.In 2002, Danmarks Nationalbank reduced its
lending rate four times, resulting in a declineof the spread over the minimum bid rate on
the ECB™s main refinancing operations to20 basis points. In view of a substantial inflowof foreign capital, Danmarks Nationalbank

lowered its lending rate by 0.05 percentagepoint on 1 February, 9 August and 30 August,reducing the lending rate from 3.60% to
3.45%. On 5 December, the lending rate was
reduced by 0.5 percentage point, in line withthe key ECB interest rate reduction of the
same magnitude, to 2.95%. Short-terminterest rates in Denmark declined during2002, slightly more than in the euro area,

narrowing the spread between Danish andeuro area short-term market rates to around
10 basis points in December (see Chart 31).
Long-term bond yields fluctuated around anaverage of 5.1%, while the spread vis-à-visthe euro area increased to close to 20 basis
points later in the year.SwedenReal GDP growth in Sweden increased in2002 amid the global slowdown and the
weakness of financial markets (see Chart 31).Real GDP grew by 1.9%, compared with 1.1%
in 2001 (see Table 12). Real GDP growth wasmainly sustained by net exports in the firsthalf of 2002. Export growth, which
strengthened at the end of 2001 and at thebeginning of 2002, slowed down over theyear, reflecting the weak global recovery.
Nevertheless, on account of weaker importgrowth the contribution to growth from net
exports strengthened in the year as a whole.
In the second half of 2002 privateconsumption recovered well, despite thesizeable stock market decline in the summer.
This can mainly be explained by higher real
disposable income due to tax cuts, low
interest rates, rising house prices and lowECB  Annual Report

unemployment. Public consumption andpublic investment also increased considerably
in the second half of the year. Private
investment and industrial activity, however,generally remained subdued throughout the
year. Changes in inventories resulted in aslight negative contribution to real GDP
growth for 2002 as a whole. Employment
growth moderated significantly, although itremained relatively high in the constructionand public sectors. The total number of hours
worked declined, partly reflecting a rapidincrease in absence from work on account ofillness. The unemployment rate remained
close to 5% throughout the year.Annual inflation rates, as measured by the
HICP, the CPI and UND1X

moderate in 2002 (see Chart 31). Thisreflected both base effects associated with
price increases in 2001 and receding costpressures. Annual average HICP inflation was2.0% in 2002, down from 2.7% in 2001, whilethe CPI rose by 2.4%, compared with 2.6% in2001.2 Unit labour cost growth moderated
to 2.1%, compared with 5.8% in 2001, largelydue to the recovery in labour productivity.
The general government fiscal surplusdecreased drastically from 4.5% of GDP in
2001 to 1.2% of GDP in 2002. Tax cuts of

approximately 1% of GDP, some expenditureincreases and the fiscal effects of below-trendGDP growth contributed to this decline, as
did the absence of positive carry-over effectsfrom previous years, which had heavily
affected the budgetary outcome in 2001. The1UNDIX is defined as the CPI excluding interest expenditure and
direct effects of altered indirect taxes and subsidies. In Sweden,
headline CPI is the target variable of monetary policy. As transient
factors have had an impact on the forecast in recent years,
monetary policy decisions have in practice been based on an
assessment of UND1X.
2The reason behind the increased difference between CPI and
HICP in Sweden is the introduction of a ceiling price for child-
care, included in the HICP but not in the CPI, as of 1 January

2002, which reduces HICP inflation by around 0.4 percentage
point.97ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
debt-to-GDP ratio decreased from 54.4% in2001 to 52.4% in 2002. The updated SwedishConvergence Programme targets budget
surpluses of 1.5% and 1.6% of GDP in 2003
and 2004 respectively. This surplus is still inline with the Swedish fiscal rule to maintain a
surplus of around 2% over the business cycledue to higher surpluses in previous years.
However, the last stage of the income tax
reform has been deferred to avoid lowersurpluses. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to fall to 50.9% in 2003 and to 49.3% in 2004.Sveriges Riksbank operates under a flexibleexchange rate regime. The objective of

monetary policy is expressed as an explicitinflation target of a 2% increase in the CPIwith a tolerance margin of ±1 percentage
point. Sveriges Riksbank raised the repo rateby 0.25 percentage point on both 19 Marchand 26 April 2002, to 4.25%, against the
background of relatively high resourceutilisation and a favourable outlook for aglobal recovery, which increased the risk of
the inflation target of 2% being exceeded. Inthe autumn, however, following heavy stockmarket declines, increased uncertainty about
the global recovery and depressed industrialactivity, Sveriges Riksbank lowered the reporate by 0.25 percentage point on both

15 November and 5 December 2002 owing
to an increased risk that future inflationwould be below the target. Reflecting these

changes in the official interest rate, the spreadbetween short-term market interest rates in
Sweden and the euro area continued to widen
in the first half of 2002, to around 100 basis
points, while it remained broadly stable inthe second half of the year (see Chart 31).
Long-term interest rates were in line withdevelopments in the global bond markets
throughout the year and the differential with
the euro area widened slightly, to around
50 basis points at the end of 2002. The krona,
which fluctuated between around SEK 9 and

SEK 9.5 per euro in 2002, was periodicallyaffected by developments in the financialmarkets and speculation over Sweden™sadoption of the euro (see Chart 32). Thekrona ended the year around 1.5% stronger
against the euro than at the beginning of 2002.United KingdomIn the wake of a marked slowdown in theworld economy, average real GDP growth inthe United Kingdom slowed to 1.6% in 2002,compared with 2.0% in 2001 (see Table 13).

However, following a subdued growth rate atthe beginning of 2002, the UK economy grewat more significant rates during the rest of
the year, with private consumption and publicspending as key drivers.
Compared with the previous year, growth inreal household consumption remainedbroadly stable at 3.9% in 2002, despite a
slowdown in real disposable income growthand the decline in stock prices. Growth inprivate consumption remained buoyant owing
to accelerating gains in house prices,continued increases in employment and
vigorous credit expansion. Output growth
was also supported by an acceleration in
public consumption, from 2.3% in 2001 to
4.2% in 2002, broadly in line with the

Government™s spending targets. Gross fixedcapital formation fell by 4.5%, down from a0.8% increase in 2001. Fragile confidence in
the prospects for external demand and anincrease in the cost of capital associated withdeclines in global stock markets are likely
to have reduced corporate incentives toincrease capital spending. The fall in businessinvestment was partly compensated for by an
acceleration in government investment,reflecting plans to upgrade the public sector™scapital stock. For the seventh year in a row,
net exports made a negative contribution(1.0 percentage point) to real GDP growth in2002. Exports fell by 1.4% following an
increase of 0.9% in 2001. However, the
composition of aggregate demand growthcontinued to restrain import growth, which
slowed to 1.2% in 2002.
The overall labour market picture remained
broadly stable, with the unemployment rateedging up to 5.2% in 2002. Total employmentcontinued to rise at a rate similar to that in
2001, helped by a strong increase in the
number of jobs in the public sector. Thecyclical slowdown in 2001 and early 2002ECB  Annual Report

appears to have affected the labour marketthrough a reduction in the number of hours
worked and a slowdown in the growth ofcompensation per employee.RPIX inflation remained below theGovernment™s target of 2.5% for almost the
whole year, at an average rate of 2.2%, which
was broadly similar to the previous year.3However, RPIX inflation rose above the

target in November and December as a
consequence of increases in petrol prices andin the housing cost component. HICP
inflation, averaging 1.3% throughout the year,
was considerably lower than RPIX inflation,
partly due to the fact that the stronglyincreasing housing cost component of the
RPIX is not included in the HICP index. The
divergence between developments in services
and goods prices widened further in 2002.

Services price increases picked up whereasweak demand and strong competition in
global markets continued to exert downwardprice pressures on the more exposed goodssectors. At the same time, annual growth in
unit labour costs in the economy as a wholeremained broadly stable on average comparedwith the previous year. Overall, cost
pressures seem to have remained rathersubdued.Following the sizeable improvement in the
general government budget in previous years,the surplus began to decline, to 0.8% of GDP
in 2001, and fell further to a deficit of 1.4%of GDP in 2002. This decline was the result
of a significant increase in government
expenditure, contributing to an expansionaryfiscal stance and a strong fall in direct taxrevenues. Corporation tax revenues, in

particular, were lower than expected,especially for the financial services sector.The debt-to-GDP ratio fell slightly, from 39%3The RPIX is defined as the Retail Price Index excluding mortgage

in 2001 to 38.6% in 2002. The updatedConvergence Programme targets a budgetarydeficit of 1.8% and 2.2% of GDP in 2002/03
and 2003/04 respectively. The gross debtratio is expected to increase slightly from37.9% of GDP in 2002/03 to 38.8% in
2003/04.The Bank of England conducts monetarypolicy within a flexible exchange rate regimewith an explicit inflation target, set by theGovernment as an annual increase in the RPIX

of 2.5%. In 2002, the official repo rate
remained unchanged at 4.0%. In February
2003 it was reduced to 3.75%. The short-
term interest rate differential vis-
à-vis theeuro area fluctuated around 60 basis pointsthroughout 2002, increasing somewhat inDecember after the ECB cut its key interestrates (see Chart 31). Ten-year government
bond yields fluctuated around their level of
2001, and ended the year slightly above theeuro area level. The pound sterling exchange
rate depreciated slightly against the euroduring the year (see Chart 32). Sterling
™sinitial depreciation vis-à-vis the euro in Mayand June, possibly associated with speculationover the United Kingdom™s euro adoptionand a sharp appreciation of the euro against
the US dollar at that time, was partiallyreversed during the third quarter, although itdepreciated again in the last quarter of the
year.%ˆ

Chapter VEuropean and internationalco-operationECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1021European issues
In 2002 the ECB continued to maintain itsregular contact with Community institutionsand relevant bodies.1 ECB representatives
attended meetings of the ECOFIN Council
when matters relating to the tasks andobjectives of the ESCB were discussed. In
2002 such matters related to financial
stability, regulation and supervision, and theimplementation of the Stability and Growth
Pact (SGP). At the same time, the President
of the ECOFIN Council made use of his rightto participate in meetings of the GoverningCouncil on several occasions. In this context,

it should be noted that, during the secondhalf of 2002, when the EU Council Presidency
was held by a Member State with a derogation
(Denmark), the President of the Eurogroupattended Governing Council meetings onbehalf of the President of the ECOFIN
Council. A member of the EuropeanCommission also participated in meetings ofthe Governing Council.The President of the ECB and the governorsof the NCBs were also invited to the two
informal meetings of the ECOFIN Councilwhich took place in Oviedo (Spain) in Apriland in Copenhagen (Denmark) in September

2002. Both meetings involved discussionsconcerning European financial marketintegration, stability, regulation and
supervision. In addition, the meeting inOviedo provided the participants with anopportunity to exchange views on issues of
corporate governance and internationalfinancial matters. The informal ECOFINCouncil meeting in Copenhagen concentrated

on, inter alia, enlargement and internationalfinancial architecture issues.In line with past practice, the ECB continuedto attend meetings of the Eurogroup on a
regular basis. Participation in these meetings
provides an opportunity for the ECB toengage in an open and informal policy dialoguewith the finance ministers of the euro
area countries and the Commissioner forEconomic and Monetary Affairs. Discussions
within the Eurogroup concentrated on the1The ECB
™s relations with the European Parliament are dealt withseparately in Chapter XII.overall economic outlook for the euroarea and budgetary developments inindividual euro area countries. A furtherfocus, especially in the first half of 2002, was
the regular monitoring of the progress of thechangeover to the euro banknotes and coins.In addition, the Eurogroup continued to
discuss the progress in necessary structuralreforms.In addition to the relations at the politicallevel described above, the ECB continued its
participation in the meetings of the Economic
and Financial Committee (EFC) and the
Economic Policy Committee (EPC), whichwere also attended by NCBs. Through its
membership of both committees, whichprovide analysis and advice for the ECOFINCouncil and the Eurogroup, the ECB was
able to contribute its expertise to the variouseconomic policy procedures and multilateralsurveillance exercises. In this vein, the ECB
participated in, inter alia, the preparation ofthe Broad Economic Policy Guidelines(BEPGs) and the assessment of the Member
States™ stability and convergence programmes.
Moreover, the ECB contributed to the widerange of other activities of both committees,
including the refinement of analytical toolsand methods and the comprehensive countryreview exercise of the EPC. Since the focus

of the latter is mainly on structural reformand leads to the EPC™s annual report onstructural reform, contributing to this work
provides the ECB not only with a usefulinsight into the process of structural reform,
but also with the opportunity to share its
views with Member States.The ECB also continued to attend the
biannual meetings of the MacroeconomicDialogue, at both the technical and thepolitical level. In line with the mandate

provided by the Cologne European Council,representatives of the Member States, the
103ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
European Commission, the ECB, the non-euro
area central banks and the EU-level socialpartners discussed the economic outlook and
related policy challenges. The MacroeconomicDialogue thereby continued to allow fora confidential exchange of views and
confidence-building among the participants.Of the broad range of topics dealt with by
the European institutions and bodies withwhich the ECB maintains close relations, thefollowing are highlighted on account of their
economic and institutional importance.1.1Implementation of the Stability and
Growth PactAgainst a backdrop of worsening budgetarydevelopments and prospects, 2002 proved to
be a testing year for the implementation of
the SGP.In 2001 both Germany and Portugal missedby a wide margin their targets for the generalgovernment balance as set out in theirrespective stability programmes. Perceiving
a risk of excessive deficits in thesecountries, on 30 January 2002 theCommission issued Recommendations for
Council Recommendations with a view togiving early warnings to Germany andPortugal. In so doing, the Commission
initiated, for the first time, the early warningprocedure foreseen in Council Regulation(EC) No. 1466/97 on the strengthening of
the surveillance of budgetary positions andthe surveillance and co-ordination ofeconomic policies. In response, both

Germany and Portugal gave firm political
commitments to take the measures necessaryto avoid a breach of the 3% of GDP reference
value and to achieve close-to-balancebudgetary positions by 2004. In the light ofthese commitments, the ECOFIN Council, at

its meeting on 12 February, considered that
the German and Portuguese Governmentshad responded effectively to the concerns
expressed by the Commission in itsrecommendations and decided to close thetwo procedures.On 21 June 2002 the Council adopted itsRecommendation for the Broad EconomicPolicy Guidelines of the Economic Policies of
the Member States and the Community. Withregard to budgetary policies, the BEPGs calledon those Member States which had not yet
achieved budget positions close to balance orin surplus to achieve such positions by 2004at the latest. In line with normal practice, the
recommendations contained in the BEPGswere based on underlying assumptions forthe future development of the main economic
variables set out in the Commission™s springeconomic forecasts. However, in thefollowing months, economic developments
turned out to be significantly worse thanprojected. As a consequence, for MemberStates with remaining budgetary imbalances,
the attainment of budget positions close tobalance or in surplus by 2004 at the latestwas no longer realistic in view of the
prevailing policy stance and macroeconomicprojections. The euro area finance ministers,the President of the ECB, the President of
the Commission and the Commissioner forEconomic and Monetary Affairs discussed theimplications of this at the Eurogroup meeting
on 7 October. After this meeting they issueda Eurogroup statement on budgetarydevelopments in the euro area in which the
euro area finance ministers re-affirmed theircommitment to the Treaty obligation to avoidexcessive deficits, and to the SGP objective
to achieve and maintain budgetary positions
close to balance or in surplus over theeconomic cycle. Moreover, the Eurogroup
concurred with an initiative of theCommission that those countries which hadnot yet reached that objective needed
to pursue continuous adjustment of theunderlying budget balance by at least 0.5% ofGDP per year. All but one minister agreed
that this adjustment should start in 2003.The worsening of the fiscal outlook duringthe summer and early autumn also gave riseto an intensified public debate on the rules
and implementation of the SGP. Against this
background, on 24 October 2002, theGoverning Council issued a public statementon the SGP in which it stressed thatECB  Annual Report 
 2002
104budgetary difficulties in some Member Stateshad arisen not because of inflexible rules, butrather because of an unwillingness on the

part of those Member States to honour theircommitment to respect the rules and theirfailure to use the earlier favourable conditions
with higher growth to substantially improve
their fiscal positions. Moreover, theGoverning Council made clear its support
for the Commission™s initiative that allcountries with remaining budgetaryimbalances should commit themselves to
implementing a clear budgetary consolidationstrategy. This should include a credibleadjustment path with a continuous adjustment
of the underlying budget balance by at least0.5% of GDP each year.
During the summer it also emerged that thePortuguese public finances were considerablyworse than had been known either when the

Council discussed the early warning toPortugal or subsequently during thepreparation of the BEPGs. In the context of

the 1 September reporting of deficit and debtlevels, the Portuguese Government finallyreported a general Government deficit for
2001 of 4.1% of GDP, well in excess of the3% of GDP reference value. The Commissiontherefore launched an excessive deficit
procedure as provided for in Article 104 ofthe Treaty and further specified in Council
Regulation (EC) No. 1467/97. Following the

steps foreseen in this procedure, the ECOFINCouncil adopted a Decision on the existenceof an excessive deficit in Portugal and a
Recommendation to Portugal with a view tobringing to an end the situation of an
excessive government deficit. In the latter,
the Council recommended, inter alia, that
the Portuguese Government correct theexcessive deficit situation as rapidly as
possible. The Council established a deadlineof 31 December 2002 for the PortugueseGovernment to take all necessary measures
to bring the excessive deficit to an end.Moreover, the Council recommended thatthe Portuguese Government adopt and
implement the necessary budgetary measuresto ensure that the government deficit in 2003would be further reduced to well below 3%of GDP and that the government debt ratiobe kept below the 60% of GDP reference
value.On 13 November, the Commission published
its autumn 2002 economic forecasts which
foresaw a budget deficit of 3.8% of GDP forGermany in 2002 and of 2.7% for France,rising to 2.9% in 2003. Against this

background, on 19 November theCommission initiated an excessive deficitprocedure in accordance with Article 104
of the Treaty by publishing a reporton the budgetary situation in Germany.On the same day, the Commission also

issued a Recommendation for a CouncilRecommendation to France with a view to
giving an early warning to prevent the
occurrence of an excessive deficit.On 21 January 2003 the ECOFIN Counciladopted a Decision on the existence of anexcessive deficit in Germany and issued aRecommendation to Germany with a view to
bringing the situation of an excessive deficit
to an end. In the latter, the Councilrecommended, inter alia, that the German
Government put an end to the excessivedeficit situation as rapidly as possible. Tothis end, the German authorities should
implement the corrective measures foreseenin their budgetary plans for 2003. The Councilestablished a deadline of 21 May 2003
for these measures to be taken. On21 January, the ECOFIN Council also issueda Recommendation with a view to giving an
early warning to France in order to avoid theoccurrence of an excessive deficit.1.2Proposals to reinforce economic
policy co-ordination and streamline
policy co-ordination processesAt its meeting in Barcelona on 15 and16 March 2002, the European Council calledfor further progress in the co-ordination ofeconomic policies. To this end, the Heads of
State or Government invited the Commissionto present proposals to reinforce economicpolicy co-ordination in time for the 2003
105ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Spring European Council. Moreover, it urgedthe Council and the Commission tostreamline the relevant policy co-ordination
process, placing emphasis on action forimplementation, rather than on the annualelaboration of guidelines.On 3 September the Commission issued aCommunication presenting proposals to
streamline the annual economic andemployment policy co-ordination cycles. On3 December the Council adopted a report
which broadly endorsed the proposals of theCommission. The recommendations of theCommission and of the Council for
streamlining the economic and employmentpolicy co-ordination cycles include thefollowing. First, there should be a greater
focus on the medium term, with full reviews
of the BEPGs and the Employment Guidelinesand recommendations taking place only every

three years instead of each year as at present.Second, there should be a greater focus onannual monitoring of the implementation of
guidelines. Third, there should be a single
policy co-ordination cycle, according to whichthe Spring European Council will review
policy implementation and give generalpolitical orientations, following which aﬁGuidelines Packageﬂ will be prepared,
covering both the BEPGs and the EmploymentGuidelines and recommendations. Moreover,in future, the various reports submitted by
the Member States under the Luxembourgand Cardiff processes should be synchronisedwith a view to streamlining Member States™reporting obligations and avoiding overlapsand duplications. To this end, nationalimplementation reports will be submitted as
a package every autumn. However, MemberStates™ stability and convergence programmes
are to be kept separate because of their link
to national budget cycles.On 27 November the Commission respondedto the Barcelona European Council
™s requestfor proposals to reinforce economic policyco-ordination by issuing a Communication
to the Council and the European Parliamenton strengthening the co-ordination ofbudgetary policies. In its Communication, the
Commission presented the following fiveproposals for improving the interpretation ofthe SGP, all of which, in the view of the
Commission, could be implemented withinthe existing legal framework. First, budgetaryobjectives should be formulated in such a
way as to pay greater attention to the
economic cycle. To this end, the ﬁclose-to-balance or in-surplusﬂ requirement of the SGP
should be defined in terms of the underlyingbalance (defined by the Commission asmeaning the budget balance net of transitory
effects and particularly of the effects of
cyclical fluctuations). Observance of the 3%of GDP reference value would, however,

continue to be monitored in nominal terms.Second, Member States whose budgets arestill far from being close to balance or in
surplus would be required to achieve anannual improvement of the underlying budgetposition of at least 0.5% of GDP each year.
This proposal is in line with the Eurogroupstatement of 7 October (see above). Third,pro-cyclical budgetary policies should be
avoided during economic upturns. Fourth,under certain specific conditions, andprovided that the 3% of GDP reference value

is not endangered, a small deviation from theclose-to-balance or in-surplus requirementcould be permitted. The sole purpose of any

such deviation would be to allow a MemberState to finance structural reforms, which
would raise employment and growth
potential, and hence strengthen theunderlying budgetary position over themedium term. And, fifth, greater weight

should be attached to the assessment ofgovernment debt ratios in the budgetary
surveillance process. In addition to these
proposals, the Commission also outlined afour-point programme of measures to ensuretheir effective implementation. First, at the
forthcoming Spring European Council, theMember States should reaffirm their politicalcommitment to the SGP in a ﬁResolution toreinforce the co-ordination of budgetary
policiesﬂ. Second, with a view to improving
the quality and timeliness of government
finance statistics, the ECOFIN Council should
adopt a ﬁCode of best practices on thereporting of budgetary dataﬂ. Third, theECB  Annual Report 
 2002
106enforcement procedures of the SGP shouldbe made more effective, in particular byclarifying more precisely the circumstances
under which these procedures will beinitiated. And, fourth, openness andtransparency should improve the
communication of budgetary policies.In his statement following the GoverningCouncil meeting of 5 December, thePresident of the ECB stated that theCommission Communication on strengthening
the co-ordination of budgetary policies was agood starting-point for rebuilding confidencein the budgetary framework. Moreover, he
reiterated the Governing Council™s fullsupport for the Commission™s main objective,namely to improve the implementation of
the SGP within the existing framework ofrules.1.3The Convention on the future of
EuropeAt its meeting in Laeken in December 2001,the European Council adopted a ﬁDeclarationon the Future of the European Unionﬂ (also
known as ﬁthe Laeken Declarationﬂ) whichidentified the challenges for a Union standing
at ﬁa crossroads, a defining moment in itsexistenceﬂ. In the light of these challenges,and in order to pave the way for the next

Intergovernmental Conference ﬁas broadlyand openly as possibleﬂ, the European Councildecided to hold a Convention on the future
of Europe. It mandated the Convention toconsider the key issues arising for the EU™sfuture development, to try to identify possible
responses, and to simplify and reorganise theexisting treaties, thereby possibly progressingtowards a Constitution for European Citizens.The Convention, which started itsdeliberations in February 2002 and is
expected to finalise its work by summer 2003,
brings together representatives from nationalgovernments, national parliaments, the
European Parliament and the Commission.Accession countries are represented in thesame way as present Member States. At avery early stage of their deliberations, the
members of the Convention signalled theiragreement with Chairman Giscard d™Estaing™sproposal to prepare a ﬁTreaty establishinga Constitution of Europe
ﬂ. This text, the aimof which is to simplify, streamline and
strengthen the legal and constitutional basisof Europe, is to be presented for adoption to
the Intergovernmental Conference to be held
in 2003.
In May 2002, when accepting the InternationalCharlemagne Prize of Aachen for 2002 onbehalf of the euro, the ECB™s Presidentexpressed the view that if it succeeded, the
Convention would help to complement theexisting economic constitution with effectiveand transparent political structures and
processes.In June 2002, within the wider remit of theConvention, a Working Group on EconomicGovernance was established. The WorkingGroup discussed the general framework of
economic governance, monetary policy,economic policies and institutional issues.In September 2002 the ECB
™s Presidentattended a hearing of this Working Group,conveying his views on how monetary and
economic matters could be covered in the

future constitutional treaty. He expressed theview that the present framework foreconomic governance was sound and capable
of meeting the challenges of the future.
Moreover, he urged the Convention to
preserve the essence of this framework and
in particular the monetary principles of theTreaty, notably central bank independenceand the primary objective to maintain price
stability. These principles should, as thefounding pillars of the monetary constitutionof the EU, feature prominently in a future
constitutional treaty.In October 2002 the Working Group adoptedits report, in which it recommended that thecurrent structure of economic governancebe maintained, thereby affirming that
exclusive competence for monetary policywithin the euro area is exercised by the ECB.The report also expressed the view that the107ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
tasks, mandate and statute of the ECB shouldremain unchanged, and should not be affectedby any new treaty provisions. During the
discussion of the report in the ConventionPlenary on 7 November, an overwhelmingmajority of the members of the Convention
signalled their support for theserecommendations by the Working Group.The ECB is closely monitoring theConvention and considers that the adoptionof a ﬁConstitutional Treaty of Europeﬂ would
complement and further bolster the successof Economic and Monetary Union.1.4Financial market reform
In order to reap the full benefits of the singlecurrency, attention has increasingly beendevoted to removing the remaining obstacles
to the emergence of a truly single market forfinancial services. In 2002 further important
steps were taken in this direction at the EU

level: new pieces of legislation were adoptedand the procedures for drawing up andapplying regulations were thoroughly
discussed.The Barcelona European Council (March
2002) confirmed that full implementation by2005 of the Financial Services Action Plan(FSAP) was a priority in order to overcome
the remaining imperfections in the Europeanmarket for financial services. Launched in1999, the FSAP provides an orientation for
the necessary measures to be taken in thearea of financial markets. Progress is regularlyreviewed by the European Commission,
assisted by the Financial Services Policy
Group in which the ECB is represented.While emphasising that the Commission must
adopt measures in the FSAP by mid-2004if it is to achieve the 2005 deadline, the7th Progress Report on the implementation
of the FSAP, issued in December 2002, notesthat progress has been made. Of the 42
measures listed in the original Action Plan,31 had been adopted by the end of 2002.These include the Directives on collateral
and on distance marketing of financial services

as well as the Regulation on internationalaccounting standards (IAS). Only fourlegislative proposals remain to be made by
the Commission, such as the revision of thecapital adequacy framework for banks andinvestment firms. In response to wider market
developments since the FSAP was launched,five further measures have also beenprepared,  including the Communication on

Clearing and Settlement.Moreover, further progress was made in 2002with regard to providing the EU withstructures for financial regulation, supervisionand stability that are capable of meeting the

needs of a rapidly changing financialenvironment. To this end, on 3 December2002 the ECOFIN Council, following a

large-scale public consultation, endorsed areport containing a number of concreteproposals. The report suggested that the
interinstitutional ﬁLamfalussy framework
ﬂadopted in the area of securities should beextended to all financial sectors. It proposed
the establishment of three new regulatory(ﬁlevel 2ﬂ) committees for banking, financialconglomerates, and pensions and insurance,

and two new supervisory (ﬁlevel 3ﬂ)committees for banking and for pensions andinsurance. The report also suggested that a
reconfigured Financial Services Policy Groupunder Member State chairmanship wouldprovide policy advice on financial market
issues and also assist the EFC in preparingECOFIN Council discussions on financialstability issues. The ECOFIN Council invited
the Commission to establish the level 2 and 3committees as soon as possible. In thiscontext, pending an agreement with the
European Parliament on the delegation ofpowers to the level 2 committees for the
adoption of implementing measures, the latter
should initially be set up in an advisory
capacity only (see also Chapter IX for furtherdetails).ECB  Annual Report

In 2002 the ECB and the NCBs continued toparticipate in the monetary, financial andeconomic activities of internationalinstitutions and fora. The practical

arrangements for the ECB™s internationalrepresentation and co-operation, as describedin the ECB™s Annual Report 1999, remainedbroadly unchanged. Within the EU,co-ordination on international macroeconomicand financial issues was strengthened, inter
alia, in the context of the EFC
™s regularactivities, as well as through improvedinformation exchanges with the IMF Executive
Directors representing the Member Statesof the EU and with the ECB Observer.2.1Multilateral and bilateral
surveillance of macroeconomic
policiesThe ECB and the NCBs continued to
participate in regular peer reviews(multilateral surveillance) and reviews byinternational institutions (bilateral
surveillance) of monetary, economic andfinancial developments and policies.Multilateral surveillanceThe ECB exchanged information and viewswith other policy-makers in severalmultilateral institutions and fora. The
President of the ECB, together with the
Eurogroup President, represented the euroarea at the sessions of G7 finance ministers
and central bank governors™ meetings devoted
to surveillance and exchange rate issues. ThePresident of the ECB also participated in
discussions on the state of the worldeconomy in other informal fora, such as themeetings of the G10 governors, as well as
those of the ministers and governors ofthe G10 and the G20. The ECB Observerparticipated in the regular reviews by the IMF
Executive Board of world economic andmarket developments and in the discussionsby the IMF Executive Board of the worldeconomic outlook. Finally, the ECB and NCBsparticipated in the Economic PolicyCommittee (EPC) of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), which discussed the short-termglobal outlook and near-term policy
requirements, thereby contributing to thepreparation of the OECD™s EconomicOutlook. The ECB and NCBs also took part

in meetings of sub-committees and working
parties of the EPC.Bilateral surveillanceThe ECB contributed to bilateral reviews ofthe monetary, financial and economic policiesof the euro area by the IMF and the OECD.
In 2002 IMF staff prepared two Article IV
reports on the monetary and exchange
rate policies of the euro area, which

complemented the national consultations.These reports were based on, inter alia,discussions between an IMF staff mission and
the ECB. The first report was circulated for
information to the IMF Executive Board in
April 2002. The second report was discussed
by the IMF Executive Board and published inOctober 2002, together with a publicinformation notice summarising the IMF
Executive Board™s assessment and a statement
by the Executive Director representing thecountry currently holding the Presidency of

the EU Council, on behalf of the euro areaauthorities. The Executive Directors of theIMF congratulated the euro area authorities
for the successful and smooth euro cash
changeover. They noted that, in 2002, growth
had been weaker and inflation higher than
expected, as a result of both unanticipatedshocks and still high vulnerability to externaldevelopments, despite the fact that the euro
area as a whole was much less open than itsindividual member countries had been priorto Monetary Union. They expected that the
economic recovery would be gradual and thatsignificant downside risks would remain.109ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
The OECD published an Economic Survey ofthe Euro Area (July 2002), which drew on,
inter alia, the work of an OECD staff mission
to the ECB. The survey was finalised bythe Economic and Development ReviewCommittee of the OECD, in which the

Eurogroup President, the EuropeanCommission and the ECB jointly representedthe EU. The survey noted that the ongoing
economic recovery should gradually gathermomentum. As for monetary policy, thesurvey reviewed recent price developments
in the euro area and concluded that the fact
that the average inflation rate had been above2% since 2000 was attributable to a series of
adverse inflationary shocks. The persistenceof relatively high inflation in some euro areacountries was seen as a challenge that called
for more flexibility in labour and productmarkets and further integration of financialmarkets.2.2Monitoring of developments in
global financial marketsGlobal financial market stability
The ESCB continued to devote specialattention to the work of international
financial institutions and fora dealing withglobal financial market developments. Inparticular, the ECB and NCBs participated
in the regular monitoring of financialdevelopments by the Financial Stability Forum
(FSF), the BIS-based Committee on the Global
Financial System (CGFS), and the OECD™sCommittee on Financial Markets. The ECBObserver took part in the IMF Executive
Board discussions on the IMF™s quarterlyGlobal Financial Stability Reports, which
replaced the annual International Capital
Markets Reports and the quarterly reviewsof Emerging Market Financing. In preparingone of these reports, an IMF delegation

visited the ECB to discuss current conditionsin European financial markets anddevelopments towards the integration of
financial markets in the EU.Specific initiatives to enhance financialstabilityThe ECB took part in the work ofinternational institutions and fora on specificaspects of the functioning of international
financial markets. Several institutions andfora, including the FSF, reviewed the policyimplications of large corporate failures in
terms of disclosure, corporate governance,accounting and auditing practices, as well asfinancial market dynamics. The international
community also continued to review andimplement measures against money
laundering and against the financing of
terrorism. In that context, the IMF developeda methodology to assess the compliance ofindividual countries with internationally
agreed standards in these fields.The ECB participated in the work of the FSF,which reviewed, inter alia, the adoption ofinternational standards by offshore financialcentres, progress with regard to its
recommendations related to highly leveragedinstitutions, and transparency practices inthe reinsurance industry. The committees
operating under the auspices of the centralbank governors of the G10 countries alsodiscussed specific financial issues. The Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision pursuedits work on the revision of the capitaladequacy framework (a discussion of this
revision is provided in Chapter IX). The ECBparticipated in the review by the CGFS of the
financial implications of financing patterns
used for IT innovations, developments incredit risk transfer mechanisms, and incentivestructures in institutional asset management.

The ECB was also involved in the activities ofthe Committee on Payment and SettlementSystems (CPSS), which is chaired by a
member of the ECB™s Executive Board (adiscussion of these activities is provided inChapter VIII). Finally, the ECB took part in
the regular meetings of the MarketsCommittee, which replaces the Gold andForeign Exchange Committee.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1102.3Relations with the IMF and related
foraThe ESCB contributed to the ongoing reviewof the architecture of the internationaleconomic and financial system. These
contributions were made either throughwork at the European level, whereco-ordination on IMF issues was intensified,
in particular in the EFC, or through directparticipation in the relevant internationalinstitutions and fora.Soundness of domestic economic policiesThe ESCB has taken a strong interest in thework of the IMF on ways to promote the
stability of the global economic and financial
system. Specific attention was devoted to therole of IMF surveillance as a crisis prevention
tool. In the context of its biannual review of
surveillance, the IMF agreed on a number ofmeasures aimed at improving the focus and
quality of surveillance, enhancing the impactof its policy advice, and strengthening therole of surveillance in countries that are
under a financial programme with the IMF.
The IMF continued its efforts to promote the
stability of domestic financial systems and theimplementation of internationally agreedstandards and codes. In particular, the IMF Œtogether with the World Bank Œ continued
to prepare assessments of compliance withstandards and codes and of the soundness of
domestic financial systems in the context of
Reports on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSCs) and Financial Sector
Assessment Programmes (FSAPs). The ECBsupported these efforts by providing technicalexperts for FSAP missions.Management of financial crisesThe IMF also continued its work on ways topromote the orderly resolution of financial
crises. In discussing these issues, the ESCBcontinued to stress the need for clear ruleson the respective responsibilities of the
private and public sectors in the resolution
of crises.The IMF conducted a review of its accesspolicy, i.e. the framework for determiningthe level of financial assistance to a member
country that is experiencing balance ofpayments difficulties. The normal accesslimits, which are set in terms of member

countries™ quotas, were deemed to be
appropriate. Moreover, the IMF ExecutiveBoard is clarifying the conditions and
strengthening the procedures for accessabove the normal limits in exceptionalcircumstances. The ESCB is of the view that
adherence to a more clearly defined accesspolicy would facilitate co-ordination amongall parties concerned by better aligning the
incentives of sovereign debtors and privatecreditors with the international community™sability to resolve financial crises.The debate continued on proceduresintended to facilitate expeditious and orderly
sovereign debt restructurings. The ESCB tookthe view that further progress is desirable
with regard to three complementary

approaches to achieving an orderlyrestructuring process. The first approach,which is contractual, consists of introducing
into sovereign debt contracts what are knownas ﬁcollective action clausesﬂ, which can helpovercome creditor co-ordination problems.
The ECB took part in the work conductedunder the aegis of the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the G10 to
promote the development of suitable
contractual provisions, which were alsodiscussed with private sector representatives.
Moreover, the international community isreviewing measures to encourage theinclusion of such clauses in sovereign bond

contracts. In this regard, the EU MemberStates agreed to lead by example bycommitting themselves to include clauses in
bonds issued by EU central governmentsunder the law of foreign jurisdictions.The second approach, which is statutory,consists of creating an international legal
framework for the restructuring of sovereign111ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
debt, known as a ﬁSovereign DebtRestructuring Mechanismﬂ (SDRM). The
international community held a number of
discussions on the possible coverage andmodalities of such a framework. Theproposed framework would allow a sovereign
debtor and a qualified majority of its creditorsto agree on a restructuring agreement thatwould become binding on the holders of all
debt instruments covered by the framework.The third approach, which is non-statutory,and could be embedded in a code of goodconduct for debt restructuring, consists ofusing informal mechanisms to promote

orderly crisis resolution, including unilateralstandstills and the IMF™s lending into arrearspolicy. Specifically, debtor countries might
decide, in exceptional circumstances, totemporarily suspend payments to external
private creditors and therefore to run into

arrears with those creditors (unilateralstandstills). The IMF might grant financial
support to countries with such arrears, but
only if a number of well-defined criteria were
fulfilled (lending into arrears).2.4Co-operation with EU neighbouring
regionsThe ECB maintains relations with centralbanks in EU neighbouring regions and
monitors international monetary issues ofrelevance to the ECB arising in these regions.In addition to the 12 EU accession countries
covered in Chapter VI, these regionscomprise the European Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) including Russia,
Turkey (a candidate country which has notyet started negotiations for EU entry), theWestern Balkans, the Middle East and Africa.By contrast with relations with accession
country central banks, those with central
banks in other EU neighbouring regions have
not been developed in accordance with asingle framework but have taken different
forms, focusing on country-specific issues ofcommon interest. In this context it isimportant to note that, for most countries inthe regions, the institutional, trade and
financial links with the euro area are highlysignificant: virtually all of these countries are
associated with the EU through regionalagreements, which aim in particular toliberalise the movement of goods (and in
some cases capital and services) between theEU and the countries concerned. In a fewcases, the agreements also include specific
clauses with regard to the financial sector.Moreover, in economic terms the euro area
is the largest trade partner of most of these
countries as well as the main source ofinternational credit, foreign direct investment(including in the banking system) and official
development aid.Bilateral relations have developed inparticular with the Central Bank of Turkey,with which the ECB has established a high-level policy dialogue, including annual
meetings at Board level. Co-operation hasalso been enhanced with the Central Bank of
Russia in view of, among other things,
important reforms of its monetary policystrategy and tools. The ECB has developedits contacts with central banks of the
Western Balkan countries, the region outside
the euro area most directly affected by theeuro cash changeover, and with the central
banks of several Mediterranean countries
(Egypt, Israel, Morocco and Tunisia).Moreover, the ECB  participated in events

organised in the two CFA2 zones in Africa on
the occasions of the 40th anniversary of theBanque Centrale des Etats de l™Afrique del™Ouest (BCEAO) and the 30th anniversaryof the Banque des Etats de l™Afrique Centrale(BEAC). The ECB has developed relations
with the West African Monetary Institute inAccra, Ghana, a body created in early 2001by West African English-speaking countries
under the leadership of Ghana and Nigeria inorder to create a new monetary zonealongside the existing CFA franc zone. In
2002 the participant countries establisheda regional exchange rate mechanism. TheECB has also established contacts with the2ﬁCommunauté Financi
ère de l™Afriqueﬂ in Western Africa and
ﬁCoopération Financière Africaineﬂ in Central Africa.

112Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The sixcountries forming the GCC3 have declared
their intention to launch a single currency in
2010 and adopted a common peg at the endof 2002 as a first step towards monetaryunification. The Secretariat General of the
GCC and the ECB organised a joint seminaron monetary integration in the euro area andin the Gulf region in Riyadh in October 2002.
Finally, the ECB continued regular meetingswith the central banks of Iceland, Norwayand Switzerland.The use of the euro in the EU neighbouringregionsAlthough the use of the euro is notwidespread in the exchange ratearrangements of the area as a whole, and theECB is of the view that it should not actively
seek to influence the international role of theeuro, the euro plays an important role for
several countries. In the Western Balkans, in
particular, all countries but Albania anchortheir currency to the euro; indeed, Bosniaand Herzegovina pegs its domestic currency
to the euro under a currency boardarrangement, while Croatia, the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and

Yugoslavia manage their respective exchangerates vis-à-vis the euro. In the Mediterranean,Morocco and Tunisia give the euro an
important role in the conduct of theirexchange rate policies, although theauthorities are debating a transition to more
flexible exchange rate policies. In the twomonetary zones using the CFA franc, the eurohas replaced the French franc as the anchor
currency.In several neighbouring countries, privatehouseholds use the euro as a parallelcurrency, in the form of both cash andeuro-denominated bank deposits. Of the

25 billion shipped to destinations outsidethe euro area by August 2002, at least one-fifth is estimated to be circulating in the

Balkans, where euro banknotes are used as astore of value and as a means for large-valuepayments. The Balkan region also exhibits ahigh degree of asset substitution, with, for
instance, euro-denominated depositsaccounting for 80% of total deposits in
Yugoslavia, 70% in Croatia and 50% in Bosniaand Herzegovina at end-2001. The level ofcurrency and asset substitution remains high,
despite substantial progress in monetary and
financial stabilisation in the last few years.Kosovo and Montenegro are special cases in

terms of the use of euro cash: they are
officially euroised territories, i.e. politicalentities which have unilaterally adopted the
euro as their official currency.2.5Co-operation with Asia-Pacific and
Latin AmericaThe European experience with economic,
financial and monetary integration has also
aroused interest among Asian and Latin
American countries in recent years. In thiscontext, the ECB has frequently been askedto share its experience within the framework

of several initiatives aimed at fosteringregional co-operation in the two regions. TheECB has in turn been closely following
economic developments in these regions, andstrengthening its bilateral relations with localauthorities, especially central banks.
Regional co-operation in Asia and thePacificThe Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Œ a leading
forum for co-operation between the EU
Member States and ten East Asiancountries Œ has since 1996 provided a unique
context for exchanging information andfostering policy dialogue. On 5 and 6 July2002 the Vice-President of the ECB
participated in the Fourth ASEM FinanceMinisters™ Meeting in Copenhagen, where he
gave a presentation on the international role
of the euro, with particular focus on its use
in both East Asia and the EU neighbouringregions. In preparing this meeting, the ECB3Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates.113ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
organised a high-level seminar on ﬁRegionaleconomic, financial and monetary co-operation: the European and Asian

experiencesﬂ, which took place in Frankfurton 15 and 16 April 2002. At this seminar Œheld within the framework of the ASEM-based
Kobe Research Project, which promotescross-regional research activity Œ officials
from ASEM finance ministries, central banks,

government agencies and internationalfinancial organisations and academicsexchanged views on three general issues of
relevance to regional co-operation in Asia
and Europe. First, the seminar dealt withthe scope and sequence of, and basic
requirements for, regional economicco-operation. Particular emphasis was placedon trade and foreign direct investment.
Second, regional financial co-operation was
addressed, in particular the efficiency,soundness, liberalisation and integration of
Asian and European financial markets. In thiscontext, a more specific debate took placeon the initiatives to enhance financial

co-operation in Asia in the aftermath of the1997-98 crisis. Third, participants discussedpossible strategies for monetary and exchange
rate policy co-operation among countries thatare already pursuing regional co-operationefforts, with a focus on lessons to be drawn
from the European experience.Bilateral relations entailed, among otherthings, several visits to Asian countries. For
instance, in February 2002 an ECB delegation,including the President and an Executive
Board member, visited China. Following thisevent, in September 2002 the ECB concludeda Memorandum of Understanding with the
People™s Bank of China (PBC) designed to
foster bilateral co-operation between the twoinstitutions. In this context, the PBC decided
to establish a representative office inFrankfurt, the opening ceremony of whichtook place in December.
Regional co-operation in Latin America
In the context of a joint initiative of the ECB
and the Banco de España, a first high-level
seminar of the Eurosystem and LatinAmerican central banks took place in Madrid
on 23 and 24 May 2002. A preparatoryworkshop at expert level was held at theECB in Frankfurt on 21 and 22 March 2002.
The aim of the seminar was to improve policydialogue between the Eurosystem and LatinAmerican central banks and share views on
issues of common interest. The discussions
focused on three topics: regional integrationin Latin America and Europe, monetary and

exchange rate policies and financial sectorissues.The European integration process wasconsidered to be of policy relevance to LatinAmerican countries, although the EU
experience cannot provide a blueprint forfurther progress in regional co-operation,given the differences in initial conditions
between the two areas. Nevertheless, onelesson derived from the EU experience that
might be applicable relates to multilateral
regional surveillance as a means to promotestability-oriented macroeconomic policies,and best practices in other relevant policy
areas. On the second topic, discussion
focused on the conditions for successful,stability-oriented monetary policies, such as
sound fiscal and structural policies,institutional support and the need to takeexchange rate developments and expectations
into account. Finally, participants discussedpolicies and instruments for increasing thestability and soundness of domestic financial
systems in Latin American countries.

Chapter VIEnlargement of theEuropean UnionECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1161Introduction
The Copenhagen European Council of 12 and13 December 2002 concluded with a historicagreement on the enlargement of the EU.
Ten countries Œ the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta,Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia Œ were invited
to join the EU on 1 May 2004.  After the

Accession Treaty has been signed in spring
2003, it should be ratified by all EU MemberStates and the ten countries listed above,
which intend to hold national referendumson this issue. Two more countries Œ Bulgaria
and Romania Œ were given the prospect of
becoming members at the beginning of 2007.Upon accession, the countries will joinEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU) with

the status of ﬁcountries with a derogationﬂand their central banks will become part ofthe ESCB. Once the countries have achieved
sustainable convergence, assessed inaccordance with the procedure set up in the
Treaty on the basis of the Maastricht criteria,
they will also adopt the euro and their centralbanks will become part of the Eurosystem,
which comprises the ECB and the NCBs of
the euro area.While not being formally associated with theaccession negotiations, the Eurosystem isinvolved in the accession process in its areas
of competence. Its involvement has taken the
form of an ongoing dialogue, comprising both
policy and technical dimensions, to supportthe accession country central banks™preparations for membership of the ESCBand, at a later stage, the Eurosystem. Thedialogue covers economic, legal and
institutional policy issues that are of relevanceto central banks. Moreover, it involves
technical co-operation activities with
accession country central banks in areas such
as payment systems, legal issues and statistics.In addition, the Eurosystem has been involvedin the ﬁEconomic Dialogueﬂ between the EU
and the accession countries, established bythe European Council in December 2000 and
co-ordinated by the European Commission.The Economic Dialogue takes place twice ayear at ministerial and Economic and Financial
Committee (EFC) levels. This dialogue servestwo purposes: first, to support the accessionprocess through an exchange of views on

macroeconomic policy and financial stabilityissues in the pre-accession phase and, second,to familiarise accession countries with the
EU procedures of multilateral surveillance, towhich these countries will become subjectwhen they join the EU.In this context, the Eurosystem has been
closely monitoring economic, legal and
institutional policy issues in the accessioncountries, focusing particularly onmacroeconomic developments, monetary
policy and exchange rate strategies andfinancial sector developments. Furthermore,the ECB has started preparations to ensure
the orderly enlargement of the ESCB and, ata later stage, the Eurosystem. The latterincludes the ECB recommendation
concerning the adjustment of the voting
modalities in the Governing Council, and thelaunch of a Master Plan aimed at preparing

the ECB for enlargement. This chapter givesan overview of these issues. It should bestressed that the chapter should not be
regarded as prejudging the convergenceassessment that the ECB will have to prepare,in accordance with Article 122 (2) of the
Treaty, when the accession countries jointhe EU with a view to a possible adoption ofthe euro.2Key economic, legal and institutional policy issues
Most accession countries have made significant
progress over the past decade in their transitionto fully-fledged market economies and inentrenching macroeconomic stability. Morerecently, the EU accession process has itselfbeen a factor in anchoring policies and further117ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
fostering stability in the whole region. In this
regard, the most relevant issues for theEurosystem are as follows: (i) real convergence,

(ii) legal and institutional convergence, (iii)nominal convergence, (iv) monetary policy and
exchange rate strategies, and (v) financial sector
developments. These issues are briefly reviewedin this section.2.1Real convergence
Real GDP growth held up fairly well in mostaccession countries in 2002, despite aweakening international growth environment.
Although the pace of economic expansion
decelerated in some countries in central andeastern Europe, in part owing to weak
economic activity elsewhere, it remainedstrong in the Baltic States, partly supportedby the robust growth of the Russian economy.

As a result, the steady growth path observedin virtually all accession countries since 2000continued in 2002, and GDP growth is
estimated at around 2.3%, on average, for
the year (see Table 14). Overall, the accessioncountries™ resilience to the global economic
slowdown has been supported by strongdomestic demand, partly stimulated by looser
fiscal policies, and by increasing confidence in
the macroeconomic stabilisation alreadyaccomplished.BulgariaCyprusCzech R.EstoniaHungaryLatviaLithuania

Table 14Annual average real GDP growth rates(in percentages)However, the degree of real income
convergence with the euro area, i.e. thecatching-up of the per capita income levels,

has remained limited for the accessioncountries as a whole. There is still, therefore,a large gap between the average GDP per
capita of the accession countries and that ofthe euro area. On average, GDP per capita inthe accession countries is, in terms of
purchasing power parity, around 44% of that
of the euro area, while this figure is evenlower when current exchange rates are taken
into account. As a result, compared with thesize of their combined population (around35% of the euro area™s population), theeconomic weight of the accession countriesremains relatively small (around 7% of euroarea GDP). The size of the gap, combined
with the limited growth differentials, suggests
that the process of real convergence is likelyto continue far beyond EU accession.However, the concept of real convergence
relevant for integration into the Single Market
and, at a later stage, the euro area entails
more than the catching-up of income levels.In particular, it involves assessing whether
accession countries have adjusted theireconomic structures to bring them more into
line with those in the euro area and achieved
stronger economic integration with the euroarea. Encouragingly, accession countries haveECB  Annual Report

advanced significantly in this regard. Forinstance, in terms of the share in GDP of
agriculture, industry and services, theaccession countries™ economic structure is
becoming more similar to that of the euro

area. In particular, the agriculture sector hasshrunk to around 5% of GDP, compared witharound 2% in the euro area, while the
industrial sector represents 26% of GDP,slightly more than in the euro area (seeTable 15). Since the beginning of the transition,
accession countries have also re-directed tradetowards the euro area, which has now becometheir main trading partner. Indeed, most

accession countries display a share of tradewith the euro area that compares well with that
of the current EU Member States.Despite these developments, further progressin structural reforms is needed to complete

the transition and foster economic growthand convergence. In particular, the accessioncountries need to continue liberalising prices,
improving corporate governance and theinvestment climate, fostering sound businesspractices and entrenching financial stability.Furthermore, the increase in unemploymentthat has occurred in the past few years points
to the rationale for labour market reform insome countries. Finally, the fiscalconsolidation paths projected by some of the
countries will require sizeable fiscal measuresin the near future.2.2Legal and institutional convergence
Real convergence has to be accompanied bylegal and institutional reforms, as the latter
are key factors affecting the growth prospects
of accession countries in the medium term.
In particular, legal and institutional reformscall for the establishment of appropriate

institutions and the adoption of internationalbest practices and standards in a number ofareas (e.g. corporate governance, financial
law). Encouragingly, accession countries havealso made considerable progress in thisdirection. For instance, the transition
indicators provided by the European Bank ofReconstruction and Development (EBRD)show that accession countries have made
119ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
significant reforms in enterprise privatisationand restructuring, markets and trade systems,and financial institutions.Regarding legal and institutional convergence,the Eurosystem has a crucial interest in the

timely adoption and implementation of theacquis communautaire in accession countries
in its areas of competence. These areas cover,

in particular, central bank independence andother legislation in the financial field.Following the request by the governors of
the central banks of the prospective MemberStates, and in close co-operation with thelatter, the Eurosystem has carefully analysed
the annual level of compliance by the
accession countries with the requirementsset out in the Treaty.As regards central bank independence, thestatutes of the 12 accession countries have

been analysed on the basis of the criteriaestablished in the legal convergence reportsprepared by the EMI and the ECB Œ namely
institutional, personal, functional and financialindependence Œ and in the light of the
opinions adopted by the ECB, in instances
where the EMI and the ECB were consultedon draft national legislation in their field of
competence and, in particular, on draft
statutes of the NCBs of the EU MemberStates. These opinions have contributed tothe process whereby accession countries have
revised their central bank acts to meet therequirements set out in the Treaty, thus layingdown the foundations for independent
institutions.Central banks and credit institutions have tooperate in a sound legal environment. As the
acquis communautaire has a general impact onthe financial sector and on the central banks™activities, the new Member States mustcomply with it from the time of accession.This is why the Eurosystem has also focused

on legislation in the financial field Œ namely in
the areas of freedom of movement of capital,
regulation of the financial markets, collateral,
payment systems, insolvency and banknotes.
This overall analysis has been a valuableinstrument for the accession country centralbanks with regard to their role, at a national
level, in the accession process. Such analysis
has also fulfilled the purpose of assisting theEuropean Commission in the accession
process by further strengthening the in-depth
analysis of the issues relating to central bank
independence.2.3Nominal convergence
During the last decade, progress in disinflation
in the accession countries has been significant.
Indeed, inflation has come down from double-
digit rates or hyperinflation to relativelylow levels, favoured by the successful
implementation of macroeconomic stabilisationprogrammes. The process of disinflationcontinued to advance in 2002 and, by the end

of the year, the average inflation rate of theaccession countries was slightly above that ofthe euro area (see Table 16). However, some
specific factors Œ contained food prices,
unexpected delays in price deregulation and
appreciating currencies Œ have contributed
to the process of disinflation in someaccession countries. Maintaining low inflationrates remains crucial to entrenching an
economic environment of price stability, alsoin view of the ultimate goal of adopting theeuro and, therefore, the need to fulfil the

Maastricht criteria.
However, delivering low inflation ratesremains a challenge, as a number of factorsare likely to contribute to inflationdifferentials between the accession countries
and the euro area. Some of these factors,such as ongoing price liberalisation andderegulation, are related to the transition
process. In addition, higher productivitygrowth in the tradable sector than in thenon-tradable sector in the accession
countries may lead to a rise in the relativeprice of non-tradables and somewhat higherinflation, a phenomenon often referred to as
ﬁthe Balassa-Samuelson effectﬂ. AlthoughECB  Annual Report 
 2002
120Table 16Period average HICP inflation
(in percentages)most empirical studies indicate that theBalassa-Samuelson effect has so far accountedfor only a limited share of inflation
differentials vis-à-vis the euro area, there isevidence that such an effect operates in these
countries.1 Moreover, the significance of this
effect could increase in the years to come ifproductivity growth in the tradable sectorwere to accelerate supported by, inter alia,
EU accession. In addition to these factors,large nominal wage growth owing to, forinstance, pent-up wage demands, stubborn
inflation expectations or backward-lookingwage indexation may well contribute toinflationary pressures. Finally, the fiscal
slippages recently recorded in some accessioncountries could also jeopardise the hard-wonstabilisation progress and disinflation gains.2.4Monetary policy and exchange rate
strategiesAccession countries can generally be regardedas small, open economies with a high degree ofintegration with the euro area. In this context,the choice of the exchange rate strategy is key,as it provides the framework within whichmonetary policy can continue to be geared
towards price stability, while real convergence

may proceed without being hampered by undueexchange rate movements.
Over recent years, the euro has gainedimportance as the main reference currency
in the accession countries. The most recent

evidence has been provided by Lithuania,which re-pegged its currency board from theUS dollar to the euro in February 2002, and
Malta, which decided in August 2002 toincrease the weight of the euro in its currencybasket to 70%. Countries still follow a variety
of exchange rate strategies, covering the fullspectrum from currency boards to free floats,and the choice of monetary policy strategies
also differs widely (see Table 17). Whilecountries with fixed exchange rate regimes(Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta)
obviously gear monetary policy towards anexchange rate target, other countries operate1Benes, J. et al. (2002),

that unilaterally pegs to the euro with a ±15%fluctuation band (Cyprus and Hungary).
Finally, some countries also include monetaryaggregates prominently in their monetarypolicy strategy (Romania and Slovenia).Overall, the accession countries™ monetary
and exchange rate policies have made a
significant contribution to macroeconomicstability and disinflation, and thereby providedthe conditions for sustainable economic
growth. Most countries, however, havefaced challenges, as exchange rate policymanagement has had to cope with risks to
external competitiveness, rising and volatile
capital flows and the setting and achievementof inflation targets in economies where theexchange rate largely determines monetarypolicy conditions. Moreover, as in all

economies, exchange rate policy managementhas entailed maintaining an appropriatebalance between monetary, fiscal and

structural policies.In view of the need to advance preparationsfor full participation in EMU, managing theprocess up to the eventual adoption of theeuro still poses a number of major challenges.
Excessive exchange rate fluctuations vis-à-visthe euro are likely to hamper trade and
financial relations with the euro area and may
be harmful to the development of a stable
domestic economy. However, fixed exchange
rates may pose more challenges with regard
to the reforms needed to further align theeconomic structures of the accessioncountries with those of the euro area.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
122Countries have so far reacted differently tothis trade-off, leading to a significant diversityin current exchange rate regimes. Some

accession countries will need to adjust theirexchange rate regimes to make themcompatible with ERM II, before they can
participate in this arrangement. Upon EUaccession, important policy choices withregard to the timing of entry and modalities

of ERM II participation will have to be made,in line with the objective outlined in theEuropean Council resolution on ERM II. Such
policy choices are primarily the responsibilityof the countries concerned and must be in
line with the Treaty requirements, such as

the obligation to treat exchange rate policyas a matter of common interest. AlthoughERM II will ultimately play a role in the
convergence criteria for joining the euro,because participation in it for a period of at
least two years is one of the preconditions

to join the euro, its primary role is to helpthe members of ERM II to orient their policies
towards stability and to foster convergence.2.5Financial sector developments
Partly for historical reasons, the financial sectorin the accession countries is largely dominated

by the banking sector, whereas other financialsector components have tended to remain lessdeveloped. From the ECB™s point of view,strengthening the financial sector is importantfor two main reasons. First, the structure andfunctioning of the financial sector has important
implications for macroeconomic developments.In particular, sound financial sectors will help tosupport structural reforms in the real sector of
the economy. Financial sectors may, therefore,be conducive to higher potential output growth
and convergence in real income with the euro
area. Second, financial stability in the accessioncountries is essential if monetary policy is to beconducted smoothly in an enlarged euro area.
Undoubtedly, weaknesses in the financial sectorwould pose significant challenges for the conductof monetary policy, and for the credibility of
central banks and their pursuit of price stability.Encouragingly, over the past few years,significant progress has been made in termsof financial sector restructuring and
consolidation. The banking sector has been
strengthened by means of large-scale
privatisation of state-owned banks and an
extensive opening-up to foreign ownership.This process has led to greater integration
with the EU, due to a significant involvement
of banks from EU countries, and has increasedefficiency significantly. However, thetransformation of the financial systems is far
from complete, as the degree of financial
intermediation remains rather low. This isreflected, above all, in the ratio of banking
assets to GDP (around one-quarter of that of
the euro area) and of domestic credit toGDP (about one-third of that of the euro

area). Moreover, in a few countries thebanking sector continues to suffer from a
significant proportion of non-performing
loans and is hampered in its lending activityby weaknesses in corporate governance and
not very efficient legal frameworks.
2.6Concluding remarks
After a number of difficult years ofmacroeconomic management at the beginning
of the transition period, institution buildingand policy design have advanced far enoughfor accession countries to be able to achieve

macroeconomic stability. Despite a globalslowdown, economic developments remainedbroadly positive in most countries in 2002.

Growth differentials with the euro area havebeen maintained or even somewhat widened,and the progress in disinflation has been

notable. Adequate choices of monetary policy
and exchange rate strategies have contributedto this achievement. However, some
challenges remain: economic growth and legaland institutional reform need to keep up themomentum to accelerate the process of
catching-up in real income, disinflation gains
need to be entrenched, while allowing forongoing price liberalisation, and financial

sectors need to be further strengthened. The123ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
choice of monetary policy and exchange ratestrategies up to the eventual adoption of the
euro also poses a real challenge. Although
large exchange rate fluctuations vis-à-vis theeuro should be avoided, a certain degree of
exchange rate adjustability may be desirableto accommodate the further reforms thatare still necessary for full participation in
EMU.3Accession preparations
3.1Preparations of the decision-making
bodies and committees of the ESCBThe General CouncilIn September 2002 the General Councildecided to invite the governors of theaccession country central banks to itsmeetings as observers following the signing
of the Accession Treaty. This decision, whichis consistent with the approach adopted bythe EMI Council in 1994 with respect to the
governors of the Austrian, Norwegian, Finnishand Swedish central banks, aims to providethe governors of the accession country

central banks with the opportunity tofamiliarise themselves with relevant ESCBissues and working methods, and will enhance

their integration as members of the GeneralCouncil in 2004.The ESCB committeesIn order to support the smooth integration ofthe accession country central banks into theESCB, the Governing Council also decided, once
the Accession Treaty has been signed, to grant,
observer status to experts from the relevant
accession country central banks in the ESCB
committees, whenever they meet in ESCBcomposition.The Governing CouncilThe accession of new Member States to theeuro area will lead to a substantial expansionof the Governing Council, the Eurosystem™ssupreme decision-making body. To ensureefficient and timely decision-making also afterenlargement, the Treaty of Nice provides foran ﬁenabling clauseﬂ, which allows for anadjustment of the voting modalities in theGoverning Council of the ECB (Article 10.2of the Statute of the ESCB) in the form of a
new paragraph 6 to Article 10 (entitled ﬁTheGoverning Councilﬂ) of the Statute.According to this enabling clause, Article 10.2
of the Statute may be amended by way of aunanimous decision of the EU Councilmeeting in the composition of Heads of State
or Government, either on the basis of aunanimously agreed recommendation fromthe ECB, and after consulting the European
Parliament and the Commission; or on arecommendation from the Commission, afterconsulting the ECB and the European
Parliament. The agreed amendment wouldthen be recommended to the Member Statesfor ratification in accordance with their
respective constitutional requirements. In adeclaration annexed to the Final Act of theIntergovernmental Conference preparing the
Treaty of Nice, the governments of theMember States expressed their expectation
that a recommendation in the meaning of
Article 10.6 would be presented as soon aspossible after the Treaty enters into force.Over the past year, the Governing Council

has discussed extensively possible options foran adjustment of its voting modalities andreached unanimous agreement on a revision
of Article 10.2 of the Statute, which waspresented to the EU Council as ECBRecommendation (ECB/2003/1) in February
2003. (The substance of this recommended
adjustment of voting modalities in theGoverning Council is explained in detail in
Chapter XIII.)ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1243.2The ECB
™s subscribed capital andceiling on foreign reserve assetsIn the context of enlargement, the GoverningCouncil and the General Council of the ECBhave also addressed the issue of upward
adjustments to the ECB™s subscribed capitaland the ceiling on initial transfers by NCBs offoreign reserve assets to the ECB. This was

necessary because, under the current rules,
the ECB would have been forced after ESCBenlargement to repay a significant amount of
its paid-up capital to current members of theESCB. Moreover, without any adjustments,the ECB would have also had to retransfer
foreign reserve assets upon the adoption ofthe euro by new Member States. Suchoutcomes would have been particularly
inappropriate at a time when enlargement isexpected to increase the ECB™s operationalactivities and related costs.More specifically, in accordance with theStatute of the ESCB, all NCBs participating in
the ESCB subscribe to the ECB™s capital ofcurrently 5,000 million in accordance with
a key that reflects their countries™ shares in
the Community population and GDP. In orderto provide new NCBs with a weighting in thecapital key when they enter the ESCB, the
weightings of the already participating NCBswould inevitably decrease. Since it has beendecided, under the current ECB arrangements
concerning the paying-up of subscribed
capital, that Eurosystem NCBs shall pay up
their subscribed shares in full, while NCBs of
Member States that have not yet adopted theeuro have to pay only 5% of their subscribedshare, the adjustment of the weightings in the
capital key in the wake of the entry of newNCBs would lead, on balance, to a reductionof the overall amount of paid-up capital.While this effect would have materialisedimmediately when new Member States join
the EU and their NCBs join the ESCB,distortions with regard to the transfer offoreign reserves would have occurred later
when the new Member States adopt the euro.Currently, the ceiling on initial transfers of
foreign reserve assets to the ECB stands at50,000 million and euro area NCBs havetransferred foreign reserves to the ECB in
proportion to their capital key. To allow,therefore, under the current ceiling, forfuture proportional transfers of foreign
reserve assets by the NCBs of all prospectiveeuro area member countries, the ECB wouldhave had to retransfer foreign reserves to
current euro area NCBs.
In order to avoid such adverse outcomesresulting from enlargement, the decision-making bodies of the ECB suggested to theEuropean Commission to undertake the
necessary steps for an appropriate technicalamendment to the Statute of the ESCB. InOctober 2002, the ECOFIN Council adopted
conclusions which recommended that,through the Accession Treaty, a newparagraph be introduced under Article 49  of
the Statute. This new paragraph provides thatthe ECB™s subscribed capital and the ceilingon the initial transfers of foreign reserve
assets by NCBs will be increased upon theaccession of new Member States. Theseincreases are to be automatic and proportional
to the weight of the NCBs of new Member
States in the expanded capital key.3.3Master Plan
The enlargement of the ESCB requires areview of many of the ECB™s functions andESCB infrastructures, so as to enable both
entities to carry out their responsibilities andachieve their objectives.The ECB has started to develop an AccessionMaster Plan, which will act as a guiding
instrument for the planning, implementation
and monitoring of ECB activities across allfunctional areas in preparation for
enlargement of the ESCB and, at a later stage,

the Eurosystem. The Master Plan is inspired
by the EMI Master Plan, which prepared theorganisational and logistical framework
necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasksin Stage Three of EMU.125ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Many of the infrastructure projects, whichrequire relatively long lead times, are wellunder way. Furthermore, the ECB has already
undertaken activities to familiarise theaccession country central banks with theframework of the ESCB, and to help them to
prepare for their integration into the ESCB.The Master Plan activities, which will beintensified throughout 2003, will ensure that
all relevant issues are dealt with in time toenable a smooth integration of the central

banks of the new Member States into the
framework of the ESCB without affecting theoverall operational integrity of the ESCB
™ssystems.3.4Assessment of payment and
securities clearing and settlementinfrastructure in accession countries
In 2002, the ECB, in close co-operation withthe NCBs and the accession country central
banks, made an assessment of the safety andefficiency of the payment and securitiesclearing and settlement infrastructure and the
related oversight functions in the 12 accessioncountries. The assessment involved on-sitediscussions with the accession country central
banks, other relevant national authorities,system operators and market participants. Itfocused on issues relating to EU enlargement
rather than on euro area requirements.Attention was paid to aspects such as the useof various payment instruments, the

appropriateness of the market infrastructureand the most relevant funds transfer systemsand securities clearing and settlement systems
operating or being built in the respectivecountries. It also focused on the degree ofautomation and standardisation, the degree
of securitisation and adequacy of collateral,the central bank
™s role, and its oversight
competence, capacity and objectives.Although there is certainly room forimprovement in all accession countries, the
assessment concluded that the respectivepayment and securities clearing andsettlement infrastructures do not presentproblems which would be serious enough tocreate obstacles to accession to the EU. TheECB provided all accession country central
banks with both general and country-specificrecommendations on issues for improvement.The overall findings and recommendations of
the assessment exercise were alsocommunicated to the European Commissionfor its report entitled ﬁTowards the enlargedUnion Œ Strategy Paper and Report of the
European Commission on the progresstowards accession by each of the candidate
countriesﬂ, published in October 2002.3.5Confidentiality Agreement with
accession country central banksIn view of the forthcoming EU enlargementand the resulting ever closer co-operationbetween the ESCB and the central banks of

the new Member States, the need arose toprovide an overarching agreement on thesharing of confidential information among the

ESCB and the accession country centralbanks. This Confidentiality Agreement hasbeen negotiated between the ESCB and the
12 accession country central banks andcomplements all separate, existingagreements between the ECB and certain
accession country central banks. Its purposeis to ensure that the parties observe common
minimum standards for the handling of

confidential information. The agreementapplies not only to documents, but, ingeneral, to all information exchanged
between the ESCB and accession countrycentral banks. This is particularly relevantgiven that the central banks of the first ten

new Member States will be invited to jointhe ESCB committees as observers after theyhave signed the Accession Treaty.3.6Co-operation in the area of
banknote counterfeiting monitoringWith regard to the start of operations of theECB™s Counterfeit Analysis Centre and theCounterfeit Monitoring System, the ECB hasalso co-operated with the accession country
ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
126central banks in order to prevent and detecteuro counterfeiting. In this respect, the ECBassessed the accession country central banks
with a view to identifying those that have aclear role in their respective countries in theinvestigation and analysis of counterfeit
banknotes. On the basis of this review, fiveaccession country central banks wereidentified as possible first candidates for such
early co-operation, and a template agreementon co-operation was drawn up. The ECBintends ultimately to establish such
co-operation with all accession countrycentral banks.3.7Central banking co-operation
In 2002, the ECB and the NCBs of the euroarea continued to assist accession countrycentral banks in their technical preparations
for a smooth integration into the ESCB and,at a later stage, the Eurosystem. In particular,assistance has been provided by familiarising
accession country central banks with theoperational and functional framework of the
ESCB and the Eurosystem and by expert-

level support in various core central bankingfields. As a consequence, central bankingco-operation between the Eurosystem andthe accession country central banks remained
intense in 2002.In 2002, more than 300 central bankingco-operation activities were conducted,
raising the total number of technicalco-operation activities since late 1999 toaround 1,000. Since 1999, assistance has been
provided in the fields of payment systems,
legal convergence and other issues relatingto the ESCB legal framework, economic

policies and analysis, statistics, monetarypolicy and operational framework, foreign
exchange, supervision, accounting standards,
euro banknotes, internal audit, information
technology and capital account liberalisation.It has taken the form of expert seminars and

workshops, bilateral visits at expert level,high-level consultations, training courses,internships and specific technical assistance

activities. In some cases, experts from the
Eurosystem and accession country centralbanks have drawn up joint analyses, inter alia

on the status of legal preparations for EUmembership, payment and security settlementsystems, financial sectors and various aspects
of the statistical framework in the accession
countries.127ECB  Annual Report

Chapter VIIProduction and issueof banknotesECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1301The introduction of euro banknotes and coins and developments
in terms of circulationEuro banknotes are issued by the ECB andthe euro area NCBs. As of 1 January 2002,euro banknotes and coins were put into
circulation in the 12 participating MemberStates as the new currency for more than300 million European citizens, thereby
replacing the legacy banknotes and coins.Thanks to the extensive preparatory work of
all the professional parties involved and their
major efforts in particular during the cashchangeover period in January and February2002, the introduction of the common

banknotes and coins went very smoothly. The
success of this unique operation was alsosupported by the favourable reception by the

general public, who readily accepted the eurobanknotes and coins at the start of 2002.1.1Frontloading and sub-frontloading
of euro banknotes and coins in 2001Two important factors behind the smoothchangeover were the frontloading of high
volumes of euro banknotes and coins tocredit institutions and the sub-frontloadingby credit institutions of a 
ﬁcritical massﬂ of
banknotes and coins to retailers during thelast four months of 2001. From a logistical
point of view, these operations can be
regarded as key in meeting one of the mainobjectives of the changeover scenario,i.e. that the bulk of cash transactions could
be made in euro by mid-January 2002. All inall, the euro area NCBs provided 6.4 billion
euro banknotes with a face value of some
133 billion to credit institutions locatedboth inside and outside the euro area.Accordingly, the leading players in the cash
changeover were very well prepared for thephysical introduction of the euro banknotes
and coins as of 1 January 2002. As low-

denomination banknotes were especiallyneeded for payment purposes, thefrontloading covered, in volume terms,
around 80% of the changeover needs forsuch banknotes. In parallel with this, around38 billion euro coins were pre-distributed tocredit institutions, retailers and, to a limitedextent, also to euro area citizens in the formof starter kits prior to the launch, which
covered 97% of the total coin needs for the
changeover in volume terms.1.2Introduction of euro banknotes and
coins during the 2002 cash
changeover periodIn addition to the aforementionedfrontloading volumes, the Eurosystem issuedanother 1.7 billion euro banknotes with aface value of 67 billion during the first halfof January 2002. On 15 January 2002 the
number of euro banknotes in circulation(including the banknotes held in the vaults
of MFIs) reached a peak of 8.1 billion.
Subsequently, despite the continuous increasein value, the number of euro banknotes in
circulation fell by 7.5% to 7.5 billion as at
1 March 2002, when the euro banknotesbecame the sole legal tender in the euro
area. This might be explained by the fact that,
in the first two weeks of January, there was a
very high precautionary demand for low-
denomination banknotes (in particular 5 and10 banknotes) by credit institutions and theretail sector, in order to make it easier to
give change. This possible explanation is
confirmed by the fact that the number of 5banknotes in circulation decreased by 34%
and that of 10 banknotes fell by 17%between mid-January and end-February,whereas demand for all other banknote
denominations was still growing during thisperiod.In terms of value, euro banknotes incirculation continued to rise sharply duringthe two-month changeover period, climbing

by 86% from 133 billion at the beginning ofJanuary to 247 billion at the end ofFebruary. At this point in time, the euro

banknotes in circulation already accountedfor 86.5% of the total value of euro and
national banknotes in circulation.
131ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Given the high volume of euro coinsfrontloaded to banks and other professionaltarget groups with a face value of
12.4 billion, the number of euro coins incirculation increased by only 2.6% during thefirst two weeks of the changeover period. As
with the euro banknotes, the number of
euro coins in circulation reached its peak on15 January 2002, with 38.6 billion coins worth
12.6 billion (excluding stocks held by the
NCBs). As of mid-January 2002, the numberof euro coins in circulation started to
decrease slightly and, at the end of the dualcirculation period, there were 35.8 billioneuro coins in circulation. The value of euro

coins in circulation dropped by 8.2%between mid-January and end-February to11.5 billion.1.3Developments in the amount of
euro banknotes and coins in
circulation during the rest of 2002The slight decrease in the number of eurobanknotes in circulation lasted until April2002, when a low of 7.2 billion was reached.

The number of euro banknotes in circulationhad risen moderately by 13.8% to 8.2 billionby the end of 2002. The value of euro
banknotes in circulation continued toincrease, rising by 45.3% between March
and December 2002 to 
359 billion. Thisdevelopment can mainly be attributed to thestrong demand for the high-value banknotes,in particular the 500 and the 200. Addingthe remaining legacy banknotes not yetredeemed at the end of 2002, total banknotesin circulation amounted to 98% of the total
value of national banknotes in circulation atend-2000.Similar to the trend observed for eurobanknotes, the number of euro coins incirculation decreased slightly until April 2002,
when it reached a low of 34.7 billion with aface value of 11 billion. Thereafter, the
number of euro coins in circulation increased
moderately to 40.0 billion worth 12.4 billionas at the end of December.
1.4Withdrawal of the legacy currencies
The circulation of legacy banknotes remainedrelatively normal until the middle of 2001,when the approaching cash changeover
triggered a significant flowback of thesebanknotes, which accelerated sharply from
the beginning of the frontloading period in
September 2001. A significant proportion ofthese were in larger denominations. In valueterms, national banknotes in circulation

dropped by 29% from 380 billion to270 billion during 2001. In volume terms,the number of legacy banknotes in circulation
decreased from 11.7 billion to 9.6 billion inthe same period. In the first two months of
2002, a total of 6.7 billion national banknotes,

i.e. 70% of the number of legacy banknotescirculating at end-2001, were withdrawn from
circulation. During this period, between 4%Chart 33Euro banknotes in circulation in 2002(millions)50201055002001002,5002,000

132and 6% of the remaining value of nationalbanknotes in circulation was lodged each dayat the NCBs. This resulted in sharp declinesof 178 billion in January and 
58 billion inFebruary in the value of legacy banknotes incirculation. During the remainder of 2002,the pace of the flowback of legacy banknotesslowed down significantly. At the end of theyear, the value of legacy banknotes not yet
redeemed was 13.3 billion.2Production of euro banknotes and coins
2.1Production of euro banknotes
After the successful launch of the eurobanknotes, a general review of the standards,

methods and procedures used for their
production was conducted by the Eurosystemwith the objective of improving both the
quality and the efficiency of the overallproduction process. This review took intoaccount the experience gained at the
production sites and also incorporatedfeedback from the general public, banks andother euro banknote users. New techniques
and processes available for production andquality control were also evaluated andimplemented for the following production
programmes, resulting in improved qualitystandards at production sites. Furthermore,a greater emphasis was put on the overall
management, based on industrial standards,of health and safety and environmental issuesrelated to the production and use of

banknotes. In addition, stock was taken of
the various materials used in euro banknote
production.This process of continuous improvement willcontinue to be applied to all futureproduction programmes, both for the currentand future banknote series. Some new andenhanced quality standards were defined forthe banknote production in 2003.
In April 2001 the Governing Council decidedthat, in the following years, production of

euro banknotes would take place inaccordance with a decentralised productionscenario with pooling. This means that each
euro area NCB is responsible for the
procurement of an allocated share of the totaleuro banknote supply for only a small number
of denominations. This pooling arrangementhelps to ensure a supply of consistent qualitybanknotes by reducing the number of
production sites for each denomination andenables the Eurosystem to benefit fromeconomies of scale in banknote production.The necessary exchange of newly printedbanknotes between NCBs takes place without
payment. In 2002 the procedures for the
acceptance, control and auditing of theproduction of euro banknotes were further
improved.Chart 34Banknotes in circulation between 2000 and 2002(EUR billions)0100200300

The total production requirements for 2002amounted to 4.8 billion banknotes. Thesebanknotes are intended to cover any increasein circulation and replace banknotes no longer
fit for circulation and to ensure that NCBshave sufficient logistical stocks to

Furthermore, the Governing Council decidedon the production of banknotes and thefurther arrangements for the establishment
of a Eurosystem Strategic Stock (ESS). Thisstock is intended to be used in those
circumstances when there are insufficient
logistical stocks in the Eurosystem to coveran unexpected increase in demand for eurobanknotes or when there is a sudden

interruption in the supply of euro banknotes.The ESS is made up of 30% of the total value
of euro banknotes in circulation, held in the

three highest denominations, and of 20%of the number of lower-value euro banknotesin circulation, held in these denominations.
Accordingly, the ESS currently comprisesaround 1.74 billion banknotes.The unused part of the Central ReserveStock, which had been established to coverthe risks of a banknote shortage during the
cash changeover, was transferred to the ESS.Another part of the ESS will be produced,
together with the banknotes for the NCBs™logistical requirements, in 2003.2.3Support for the production of euro
coinsThe Member States are responsible forthe production of euro coins. The ECBacts as an independent assessor of coin

quality. It supported the implementation
and maintenance of a common qualitymanagement system in mints producing euro
coins. In 2002, production continued at areduced rate. The quality of the coins was
continually assessed via monthly quality
reports, quality audits and the evaluation ofsample coins taken from production.3Common Eurosystem policies on cash handling
The introduction of the euro banknotes and
coins posed challenges to euro area NCBs,which have different national traditions and
practices as regards cash logistics andservices. The Governing Council hasunderlined on various occasions theimportance of a level playing-field for cashservices and took a number of measures to

promote a fair, competitive environment inthis area.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1343.1Eurosystem fee policy and common
approach to opening hours anddebiting/crediting rules for cash
services at NCB countersA common Eurosystem fee policy for thecash transactions of professional clients atNCB counters was implemented as from1 March 2002. It defines different levels of

services:free-of-charge services: these are the basic
services that all NCBs provide, taking intoaccount their unique role in providing theeconomy with cash; andfee-based services: these are additional
services that NCBs may decide to offer. If
offered, a fee must be paid for theseoptional services, taking into account the
fact that they may also be offered by

commercial third parties.The Governing Council also defined acommon approach to opening hours anddebiting/crediting rules for cash services atNCB counters. The following measures seek
to achieve the objective of promoting a level
playing-field:The NCBs should offer the possibility to
lodge and withdraw banknotes and coinsfor a daily minimum of six hours (the length

of this period is to be defined at thenational level) in at least some of theirfacilities.Debiting/crediting of cash transactions
within the aforementioned time frame
should be effected at the time of physicalwithdrawal/lodgement at NCB counters.The NCBs may also apply measures linked
to their specific role and tasks in therespective countries (e.g. extendedopening hours for cash services, or laterdebiting/earlier crediting, which in terms
of costs for commercial third parties hasthe same effect as extended openinghours).3.2Establishment of terms of reference
for the use of cash-recyclingmachines in the euro areaAs an additional measure, a commonapproach for the use of cash-recyclingmachines in the euro area was agreed upon.

These machines are stand-alone, customer-
operated devices capable of receiving,
processing and dispensing banknotes. This
fully automated cash-recycling process nolonger requires additional manual processingof banknotes and shortens the cash

processing cycle, thus reducing cash-handlingcosts significantly.In a round-table discussion on cash-recyclingmachines with the European Credit SectorAssociations and the manufacturers of these
machines, the organisational and technicalaspects of using such machines werediscussed. Subsequently, the Governing
Council approved the Eurosystem™s terms ofreference for the use of cash-recyclingmachines by credit institutions and other euro
area parties engaged in the sorting anddistribution of banknotes. The main elementsof these terms of reference are the criteria

for authenticating genuine banknotes and therequirements for sorting according to thequality of the banknotes, with a view to
preventing the recirculation of counterfeit orsuspect banknotes or of banknotes that areno longer fit for circulation, e.g. because they
are torn or dirty.135ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
4Protection of euro banknotes against counterfeiting
Although counterfeits have 
historically nevermade up more than a very small fraction ofthe number of banknotes in circulation in
what is now the euro area, the Eurosystem is
nevertheless committed to protecting eurobanknotes against counterfeiting on the basisof the highest standards possible. The euro
banknotes were designed and developedin such a way as to ensure that, in termsof protection against counterfeiting, they
are amongst the most sophisticated in theworld. In addition, the Eurosystem ran acomprehensive information campaign on the
design and security features of the euro
banknotes, addressing both the general public
and professional cash handlers. The campaign
was well received, judging by the results of asurvey conducted in 2002 and the number ofvisits to the information campaign™s website.The effectiveness of the preparations for the
introduction of the euro cash is also borne
out by the fact that the number of counterfeit
euro banknotes recorded in 2002 was onlyabout one-quarter of the number ofcounterfeits of the legacy currencies in 2001.In 2002 the Eurosystem established aCounterfeit Analysis Centre which
co-ordinates the incorporation of statisticaland technical information on euro banknotecounterfeits from the National Analysis
Centres across the entire EU into acomprehensive database at the ECB. Thenumber of counterfeits recorded in 2002
was 167,118. These were distributed asfollows across the denominations:counterfeiting this denomination offers acompromise between maximising the valuegained and minimising the likelihood of closescrutiny by members of the public.With regard to the distribution over time, itis well established that the number of
counterfeits shows seasonal fluctuations,with peaks during the holiday seasons. Thisnormal pattern was not discernible in 2002.

In the first half of that year, the number ofcounterfeits recorded was particularly low,as the euro banknotes were still regarded

as a novelty, under close scrutiny by thepublic, and therefore unlikely to becounterfeited. There was an increase in
recorded counterfeits in the second half of
2002, although levels remained Œ by historical
standards Œ relatively low.
The quality of counterfeits was also generallylow. Although some ingenious techniques
were employed, no counterfeits werediscovered that could not be detected
on the basis of ﬁlook-feel-tiltﬂ tests
recommended by the Eurosystem for therecognition of genuine euro banknotes. TheEurosystem nevertheless continues to
monitor developments in the graphicsindustry and assesses the threats thesedevelopments might pose in terms of
high-quality counterfeits. Indeed, recentdevelopments in technology have made itnecessary for the Eurosystem, like many
other banknote-issuing authorities, to investsubstantially in research and development(R&D). Euro banknotes already contain a
variety of security features, all of which areintended either to make banknotes difficultto counterfeit or to make counterfeit
banknotes easy to detect.The Eurosystem™s R&D efforts are nowfocused firmly upon activities that maintainthe integrity of the euro banknotes inthe face of the threat of counterfeiting. They
are directed towards both the technicalfoundations of future banknote designs andthe improvement of existing security features.As can immediately be seen, the number ofcounterfeit 50 banknotes was particularlyhigh, which reflects the fact that5102050Quantity1,0393,10814,845136,133

136This work is vital to meet the demandsthat will be made on euro banknotes in thefuture. The Eurosystem carefully monitors
developments in the area of euro banknotecounterfeiting and will take appropriatecounteraction whenever necessary.The Eurosystem also continued itscontributions to international co-operation
on counterfeit deterrence in 2002. In April,the international community identified a needfor additional resources to support the
testing and implementation of counterfeitdeterrence technology. The ECB beganexploring the possibility of hosting a technicalunit in Frankfurt, and the Governing Councilagreed in June on the establishment of the
International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre(ICDC), to be staffed by ECB personnel and
officials from other issuing authorities.The

ICDC is the international technical contactpoint for issuing authorities and othersinvolved in the field of counterfeit deterrence.
It also carries out scanning tests to verifydeterrence in selected reproduction equipmentand acts as a technical reference point. The
final details of the establishment and fundingof the ICDC were agreed in December 2002.

 2002
140OverviewThe Eurosystem carries out its task ofpromoting the smooth operation of payment
and settlement systems through the provisionof payment and securities settlement facilities,
as well as by overseeing the euro paymentand settlement systems and acting as a
catalyst for change.On the operational side, the Trans-EuropeanAutomated Real-time Gross settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET) system functioned
smoothly and successfully in 2002 with adouble-digit business increase in terms of
both volume and value. During the year underreview, the Governing Council took strategicdecisions regarding the future of TARGET
and the connection of accession countries
to the system. TARGET2 will be designed
following a consultation of its users.As to the Eurosystem™s operationalinvolvement in the securities area, the
correspondent central banking model(CCBM), intended as an interim solutionenabling the cross-border use of collateral,
has remained the main tool for this purposeand will be further enhanced. As regards theuse of collateral for TARGET intraday and
monetary policy credit operations, thedevelopments for 2002 are presented inChapter II, Section 1.6 on eligible assets.
In the conduct and development of oversight,all systemically important payment systems
operating in euro are assessed against theﬁCore Principles for Systemically ImportantPayment Systemsﬂ (BIS, Basel, January 2001),
which were adopted as minimum standardsby the Governing Council in February 2001.Moreover, public consultations were carried
out on oversight standards for euro retailpayment systems and on electronic moneysecurity objectives. With the start of the

Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) systemin September 2002, the ECB acts as thesettlement agent for CLS banks™ euro
payments and as a co-overseer, with theFederal Reserve System being the leadoverseer.In the field of retail payments, theEurosystem, acting as a catalyst for change,
supported banking industry initiatives toestablish a single euro payment area. The aimis to enable European citizens to make
payments in the euro area as safely, quicklyand efficiently as payments within nationalborders.In the area of securities clearing andsettlement systems, the assessment of
securities settlement systems (SSSs) eligiblefor the settlement of collateral forEurosystem credit operations continued and

the process of integration and consolidationof securities markets has been closelymonitored. The co-operation with the
Committee of European Securities Regulators
continued with the aim of developingEuropean standards for clearing and
settlement activities based on internationallyagreed recommendations.1Operations of the Eurosystem
™s payment and settlementsystems1.1The TARGET system
TARGET is an instrumental part of theintegrated euro money market which, inturn, is a prerequisite for the effective
conduct of the single monetary policy.Likewise, TARGET continued to fulfil itsother two core objectives, namely to increase
the efficiency of cross-border payments ineuro and to provide a reliable and safe
mechanism for the settlement of domestic
and cross-border large-value payments.In 2002 TARGET processed, in terms ofvalue, almost 85% of the total turnover of
large-value payments in euro (compared with141ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
almost 75% in 2001). This increase is due to,inter alia, the ongoing market consolidation,such as the closing-down of the hybrid system
Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) when theDeutsche Bundesbank launched its RTGSplussystem. The continued increase in TARGETcross-border traffic also indicates thediminishing role of correspondent bankingin the euro area since the introduction
of the euro. In 2002 TARGET had
1,560 direct participants, 2,328 indirectparticipants and the number of banks and
branches addressable worldwide numberedapproximately 40,000.TARGET operationsIn 2002 TARGET processed a daily averageof 253,016 payments (both cross-border anddomestic payments) with a total value of
1,552 billion. This equals an increase relativeto 2001 of 20% in terms of volume and 19%in terms of value.Out of the total TARGET traffic in 2002,cross-border traffic represented 31% in terms
of value, compared with 39% in 2001, and
remained 21% in terms of volume. Of the
TARGET cross-border traffic, 96% in terms
of value and 54% in terms of volume wereinterbank payments, the remainder beingcross-border customer payments. The
average value of a cross-border interbankpayment was 15.9 million, compared with17.7 million in 2001, and the average value
of a cross-border customer payment was0.8 million, compared with 
1.0million in2001. Further information, also on peak traffic
days, is provided in Tables 19 and 20.
As already observed in 2001, TARGETparticipants tend to submit their paymentsearly. By 1 p.m. more than 50% of the daily
cross-border turnover, and almost 75% in
terms of cross-border volume, has already
been settled in TARGET. The start-up of CLS
operations in September 2002 encouraged

this pattern as CLS payments in euro have tobe made between 7 a.m. and noon. Earlysubmission contributes substantially to the

smooth functioning of TARGET and helps to
reduce the risk of payment system gridlockresulting from liquidity strains later in the

day.The long-term calendar for TARGET closingdays was applied for the first time in 2002.
Until further notice, TARGET as a whole,
including all the national real-time gross
settlement (RTGS) systems, will be closed onTARGET closing days. The implementation
of the long-term calendar helped to avoid the
uncertainties for financial markets stemmingfrom the calendar changes of previous years.
On 18 November 2002 the new TARGETrelease went live successfully. The upgradeconsisted mainly of software maintenance andTable 19Payment traffic in TARGET *)Volume20012002Change, %

payments. The use of the IBAN is a

prerequisite for and a further step towards
straight-through processing (STP) forcustomer payments.On 27 November 2002 the GoverningCouncil approved a new policy framework
for the compensation of TARGET users inthe event of a TARGET malfunction. Thenew compensation regime is based on
existing market practices and aims to offercompensation for certain damages in a swiftand standardised manner.TARGET availabilityTARGET availability further improved andreached 99.77% in 2002. The number of
incidents of downtime continued to decrease,falling by 6% compared with 2001. TARGET
contingency measures were enhanced in 2002
in order to increase their efficiency and toaddress the requirements of systemicallyimportant payments and the needs of CLS
operations, as well as in view of the lessonslearnt from the events of 11 September 2001.Extensive trialling and the first live experience
proved the usefulness of the enhancedcontingency measures.Relations with TARGET usersIn 2002 the ECB and the NCBs maintainedtheir dialogue with TARGET users. As in theprevious year, regular meetings were held

with the national TARGET user groups, whileat the ESCB level two meetings of theContact Group on Euro Payments Strategy

(COGEPS) were held. In addition, twojoint meetings of the TARGET Management
Working Group (TMWG) of ESCB
representatives and the TARGET WorkingGroup (TWG) of the European bankingindustry were hosted at the ECB in order to

intensify the dialogue on TARGET operationalissues at the European level. A closerelationship with users ensures that theirneeds are given due consideration by andreceive an appropriate response from theEurosystem.Accession processOn 24 October 2002 the Governing Council
decided that the central banks of the
accession countries will have the possibility Œbut not the obligation Œ to connect to
TARGET as soon as their countries join the
EU. A range of options for such connections,including scenarios to avoid the need for
individual euro RTGS platforms, are being
elaborated and discussed with the centralbanks of the accession countries.TARGET2Also on 24 October 2002 the GoverningCouncil took a strategic decision on thedirection of the next generation of the

TARGET system (TARGET2). The mainobjective of the Eurosystem is to ensurethat TARGET evolves towards a system that:
(i) better meets customers
™ needs by
providing an extensively harmonised servicelevel; (ii) guarantees cost efficiency; and (iii) is

prepared for swift adaptation to futuredevelopments, including the enlargement ofthe EU and the Eurosystem. At the same
time, the NCBs will remain responsible forthe accounts of and business relations withcredit institutions.TARGET2, which is not expected to become
operational before the second half of this
decade, will be a multiple-platform system,
consisting of individual platforms and oneﬁshareable platformﬂ. The latter will be an ITplatform shared by a number of central bankswhich have voluntarily abandoned theirindividual platforms. Within three years of
the start of operation of TARGET2, therewill be an assessment of whether the
single shareable platform can satisfy the needs
of all the central banks and their bankingcommunities not wishing to maintain anindividual platform. Eventually, a decision may143ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
be taken to build additional shareableplatforms at a later stage in the development
of TARGET2. As in the case of the present
TARGET system, TARGET2 will be a systemfor the settlement of predominantlysystemically relevant, large-value euro
payments in central bank money. In addition,as at present, it will be open for payments
that users may wish to process in real time in

central bank money. TARGET2 will have a farmore harmonised service level than the
present system. The core service 
of TARGET2,which includes those services and functionsthat are offered by all TARGET2 components,will have a single TARGET-wide price
structure for domestic and cross-borderTARGET transactions. The single TARGET-wide price structure will be based on a
benchmark RTGS system defined as the onewith the lowest average cost per transaction.
NCBs may offer additional services which will

be priced separately and independently byeach NCB. On 16 December 2002 a publicconsultation on ﬁTARGET2 Œ principles and
structureﬂ was launched.
1.2The correspondent central banking
modelThe CCBM enables the cross-border use ofcollateral by counterparties in monetarypolicy and intraday credit operations. It was
implemented in 1998 as an interim solution
until the market developed alternatives. In2002 the CCBM remained the main tool for
the cross-border transfer of collateral to theEurosystem. The amount of collateral undercustody through the CCBM increased from
157 billion at end-2001 to 
194 billion atend-2002.Counterparties have only infrequentlydelivered cross-border collateral throughthe alternative to the CCBM, i.e. the eligiblelinks between SSSs. Chart 35 presents thedevelopments in the cross-border use of
collateral through the CCBM and the links asa percentage of the total collateral providedto the Eurosystem.Following requests from counterparties tomaintain the CCBM and to speed up its

processing time and extend its operatinghours, the Governing Council decided tocontinue operating the CCBM in the medium
term and to allow further improvements. Inthis respect, at the Eurosystem level, it has
been decided to introduce a time benchmark
of one hour1 for internal procedures at the
NCBs as from 2004. In any case, some NCBsalready started in 2002 to automate certain
procedures when implementing a newgeneration of SWIFT messages. Furthermore,
the Eurosystem also had discussions with
custodian banks involved in the CCBM with aview to establishing a code of conduct forcustodians processing CCBM transactions.Chart 35Cross-border collateral as a percentageof total collateral provided to theEurosystem(in %)3025

1442General issues of payment systems oversight
In 2002 the Eurosystem™s oversight activitieswere aimed at ensuring the continuedcompliance of systemically important payment
systems with existing oversight standards
and at developing oversight standards for
retail payment systems. During 2002 theEurosystem started assessing all systemically

important payment systems in the euro areaagainst the ﬁCore Principles for SystemicallyImportant Payment Systemsﬂ2. This includedan individual assessment of the nationalTARGET components. The assessment ofTARGET as a whole was carried out by the
IMF in 2001. The ECB will report on thisassessment exercise later in 2003.In January 2003 the Governing Councildecided that oversight and operationalresponsibilities for TARGET should be
separated within each NCB and the ECB, as aminimum at expert level.On 8 July 2002 draft ﬁOversight standardsfor euro retail payment systemsﬂ were issued
for public consultation. This document
considers the implications of the ﬁCorePrinciples for Systemically Important Payment
Systemsﬂ for retail payment systems. While
systemically important payment systems haveto comply with all ten of the Core Principles,the consultation document presents the view
that six of the Core Principles are sofundamental that they should also apply toimportant retail payment systems. The
responses to the consultation were generallypositive. Wide support emerged for the
approach in general. Commentatorsappreciated the transparency of theEurosystem™s intentions regarding theoversight of retail payment systems.
However, they also remarked that theapplication of the Core Principles to retailpayment systems in the EU countries should
be based on harmonised criteria. Thecomments, which have been published on the
ECB™s website, will be assessed to determinepossible implications for the policy stance.On 19 March 2002 the report on ﬁElectronicMoney Systems Security Objectivesﬂ (EMSSO)
was issued for public comment. It contains alist of security objectives for e-money
schemes. These security objectives focus onthe overall reliability and technical securityof e-money schemes, in order to increase
public confidence in these systems, to providea level playing-field for the different schemes,and to facilitate interoperability between them.
The general approach received support and thecomments received are being considered. Anamended version of the report was published in
February 2003.Moreover, the Eurosystem, jointly with theNCBs of the Member States which have not
yet adopted the euro, is making efforts toidentify the scope of and developments in the
correspondent banking business in euro. Thisis being done with a view to obtaininginformation about developments in the euro
payments business as a whole, and not onlyin the established interbank systems.
3Large-value payment systems
3.1Developments in other large-value
euro payment systemsThe existing four large-value net settlementsystems operating in euro Œ the Euro Clearing
system of the Euro Banking Association
(EURO 1), the French Paris Net Settlement(PNS), the Spanish Servicio de PagosInterbancarios (SPI) and the Finnish PankkienOn-line Pikasiirrot ja Sekit-järjestelmä(POPS) Œ continued to operate smoothly in
2002.In 2002 the largest of the systems, EURO 1,processed some 134,900 transactions per day2ﬁCore Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systemsﬂ,Bank for International Settlements, Basel, January 2001.145ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
with an average daily value of 188 billion.The second largest, PNS, processed some29,700 transactions per day with an average
daily value of 78 billion. The four systemstaken together processed around two-thirdsof the volume and one-sixth of the value of
the transactions processed by TARGET.In line with recent trends, the number ofcustomer payments again increased in allsystems. However, as these are typically low-value payments, the average size of payments
declined, and the overall value of paymentsprocessed decreased by about 10%.
3.2Continuous Linked Settlement
(CLS)On 9 September 2002, CLS, a systemdesigned for the settlement of foreign
exchange (FX) transactions3, started its liveoperations. CLS largely eliminates FXsettlement risk by settling the respective
transactions in its books on a payment-versus-payment basis.
4 The ECB performs a
dual function with regard to CLS: it is involved
in its oversight and it provides settlementservices.Oversight of CLS is performed in accordancewith the co-operative framework that wasoutlined in the Lamfalussy Report5. TheFederal Reserve System is the lead overseer.Prior to the start of CLS, the central banks ofcurrencies now settled in CLS jointly assessed
the risks of including their currencies in CLS.In this exercise the ECB concluded that, in
general, euro FX transactions would be

settled safely and efficiently and should notgive rise to undue risks to the euro moneymarket and euro payment systems. The ECB
approved the inclusion of the euro in CLS.All other central banks involved reached the
same conclusion for their currencies and the
Federal Reserve approved the start-up of the
system.To help underpin the legal finality ofsettlement in CLS, in July 2002 the Bank of
England designated the CLS system (the rules
of which are governed by English law) underthe UK regulations that implement the EUSettlement Finality Directive.When settling their transactions in the CLSsystem, banks fund their CLS accounts in the

relevant currency via the respective RTGSsystem. For the euro, the ECB has opened an
account for CLS and all payments to and
from CLS are processed via the ECB paymentmechanism (EPM) and consequently viaTARGET. Given the time-criticality of CLS
payments, the Eurosystem has improved itscontingency arrangements to mitigate the riskof operational failures. Repeated successful
contingency tests under live conditions wereperformed with the banking community in
2001 and 2002.By December 2002 the daily settlement valuesin CLS had reached USD 268 billion. This is
estimated to be slightly more than 22% of thetotal FX market turnover. After the US dollar,
which has a 47% share, the euro is the most
settled currency in CLS (26%). The liquidity
impact on the euro markets was limited asthe daily pay-ins averaged only 
5.2 billionand the average liquidity retention on CLS™sECB account during the morning (7 a.m. tonoon) was only around 0.8 billion. CLS hasshown good operational stability since its
start. In summer 2003 CLS intends to addthe Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone,

the Danish krone and the Singapore dollar,with the New Zealand dollar and the HongKong dollar following later in the year.
3The currencies that are currently settled are the US dollar, the
euro, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the
Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar.4For further information, see

1464Retail payment services
Since the introduction of the euro banknotes
and coins and the changeover of the payment
infrastructures to the euro on 1 January 2002,public attention and demand have focused on

the further development of the single europayment area. It is the Eurosystem™s objectiveto make the euro area a highly competitive
retail payment area which provides its citizenswith efficient and safe payment means andinstruments. Hence, the Eurosystem
continued to guide its retail payment policiestowards this objective. The Eurosystemcan choose to act as a catalyst for change,
use its oversight competence and becomeoperationally involved itself. The Eurosystemhas pursued its objectives in close co-
operation and dialogue with the EuropeanCommission and the European bankingindustry.At end-2001, the European Parliamentand the Council adopted Regulation (EC)
No 2560/2001 on cross-border payments ineuro. Under this Regulation, banks are obligedto charge for cross-border payments of up to

12,500 (50,000 as of 1 January 2006) at thesame level as for corresponding domesticpayments. In July 2002 the Regulation became
valid for card payments and ATM withdrawals.It will enter into force for cross-border credittransfers on 1 July 2003.
As a catalyst for change, the Eurosystem isaiming to make it easier for the banking
sector to respond to the new environment
established by the Regulation. The objectiveis to foster banks™ co-operation in the
establishment of a governance structure,business standards and practices and aninfrastructure that will allow banks to deliver

retail payments in the euro area efficientlyand safely. Before the adoption of theRegulation, in November 2001, the ECB
issued a report entitled ﬁTowards anintegrated infrastructure for credit transfersin euro
ﬂ to the ECOFIN Council describing
a ﬁroad map
ﬂ to make cross-border credit
transfers as efficient as domestic credittransfers. The ECB called upon marketparticipants to take the initiative by decidingon a governance structure that would bebinding on banks, and to consider onepossible infrastructure option (a pan-
European automated clearing house (ACH)or a linked ACH) that would make for moreefficient processing of cross-border credit

transfers.In 2002 the EU banking industry madeprogress in this direction. The EuropeanPayments Council (EPC) was set up and haslaunched a comprehensive project for the
single euro payment area that aims to enablecitizens to make any payment within the single
euro payment area as easily and inexpensively
as in their home country. The Eurosystemhas strongly supported this project, and theECB has observer status in different working
groups of the EPC. In this context, it should
also be noted that the Euro BankingAssociation (EBA) is developing an automated
clearing house for euro interbank credittransfers called STEP2, which is scheduled togo live in mid-2003. This will most likely make
STEP2 the first service provider for a pan-European ACH according to the definitionsof the EPC. The ECB will regularly assess the
progress of initiatives towards a single euro
payment area and inform the public about its
findings.The ECB also provided its comments on theEuropean Commission™s public consultationon the concept of a new legal frameworkfor retail payments in the EU (ﬁA possiblelegal framework for the Single Payment Area
in the Internal Market
ﬂ, MARKT/208/2001 ŒRev. 1). The Eurosystem intends to continuouslymonitor the achievements of the banking
industry and refine its strategy in the light ofprogress.The increasing use of new communicationtechnologies and the need for specificpayment mechanisms for e-commerce have
led to a range of developments in e-payments.The ECB organised a conference entitledﬁE-payments in Europeﬂ on 19 November 2002,
147ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
at which the market and academia presentedtheir views on current developments ine-payments. Moreover, the issues paper
entitled ﬁE-payments in Europe Œ the
Eurosystem™s perspectiveﬂ (ECB, September
2002) was published for public comment as
well as for discussion at the conference.
In this context, the ECB has also decided, inagreement with the European Commission,to take on responsibility for the e-Payments

Systems Observatory (ePSO), which hadcome to an end as a European Commissionproject.5Securities clearing and settlement systems
The ESCB has a general interest in the
proper functioning of securities clearingand settlement systems. Indeed, theirinappropriate functioning might jeopardise the
smooth execution of monetary policy andthe smooth functioning of payment systems.Disruptions in SSSs can automatically
spread to payment systems owing to theexistence of delivery versus payment (DVP)mechanisms for the transfer of securities
and cash payments. Similarly, centralcounterparties™ inability to clear can prevent
the settlement of securities transactions.The Eurosystem has two roles. First, theGoverning Council assesses the compliance
of SSSs with specific standards. Thosestandards were set in 1998 with a view to
preventing the Eurosystem from incurring
risks when carrying out credit operations.Second, the Eurosystem monitors the ongoing
integration and consolidation process in the
field of securities clearing and settlement.In addition, the ESCB co-operates with other
authorities responsible for the regulation andoversight of securities clearing and settlementsystems at the European level.In 2002 the ECB also provided comments inresponse to the European Commission™spublic consultation on the Communicationon clearing and settlement.5.1Assessment of securities settlement
systemsOn 29 August 2002 the Governing Councilupdated the assessment of SSSs eligible forthe settlement of collateral for Eurosystemcredit operations.The Eurosystem acknowledged that SSSs
had maintained their efforts to enhancecompliance with the standards. In thisrespect, SCLV/AIAF (Spain), SCL Barcelona
(Spain), BOGS (Greece) and Crest (UnitedKingdom) introduced real-time DVPsettlement in central bank money.Moreover, it was noted that the requirementsof the Eurosystem depend on whether NCBs
make use of a pooling or of an earmarkingsystem for the settlement of securities incredit operations. In principle, the standards
require DVP facilities in order to preventprincipal risk. However, in countries where
pooling systems are used, securities are
typically pledged to the central bank on a
free-of-payment (FOP) basis. It wasconsidered that those central banks do not
incur any principal risk since the securities
are pledged before credit is granted and arereleased only after the repayment of the
credit. In any case, the majority of SSSs inthose countries offer DVP facilities for marketoperations.Furthermore, this assessment focusedparticularly on measures to ensure business

continuity. It confirmed that eligible SSSs haveappropriate procedures in place that wouldenable a resumption of operations in the case

of a disaster. SSSs were in the process ofincreasing the testing frequency of their
backup facilities.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1485.2Consolidation of the European
securities infrastructureThe Eurosystem has a keen interest in the
integration of the securities infrastructure atthe European level. The process of
consolidation of the European securitiessettlement industry evolved further in 2002following the domestic consolidation in Italy
and Spain and the acquisition of theLuxembourg SSS by the entity owning theGerman SSS, which resulted in the

Clearstream Group. On 19 September 2002the merger between Euroclear, operating inFrance, the Netherlands and Belgium, and
Crest (United Kingdom) became effective.
The Euroclear group is expected to adopt acommon single settlement engine in 2005.
5.3Co-operation with the Committee
of European Securities Regulators(CESR)Following the decision of the Governing
Council and the decision-making body of the
CESR in 2001, a Working Group composedof representatives of the ESCB, representatives
of the CESR and an observer from the
European Commission continued to operatein the field of SSSs and central counterparties.The aim of the joint work is to develop
European standards for clearing and settlementactivities based on the ﬁRecommendationsfor Securities Settlement Systemsﬂ (BIS, Basel,
November 2001).In this regard, on 15 March 2002 the decision-making bodies of the ECB and of the CESRlaunched a public consultation on the nature,scope and objectives of the standards; the
potential addressees; the access conditionsof systems; risks and weaknesses; settlementcycles; and issues related to the structure of
markets. In general, the consulted parties
welcomed the initiative on common standardsat the European level, and highlighted the
need for co-ordination to guarantee auniform implementation of the new standards.The Working Group continued to discuss
proposals for the standards and a furtherpublic consultation is envisaged in 2003.6Other activities
In July 2002 the ECB released the publication

ﬁPayment and securities settlement systemsin the European Union: Addendum

incorporating 2000 figuresﬂ, also known asthe ﬁBlue Bookﬂ. This is a statistical updateof the 2001 publication.In August 2002, the second edition of
the publication ﬁPayment and securitiessettlement systems in accession countriesﬂwas issued (also known as the ﬁaccessioncountry Blue Bookﬂ). It describes thesituation prevailing in each of the 12 countries

as of 2001 and also contains data for the
period 1997-2001.Moreover, a three-day seminar for centralbankers entitled ﬁPayment and SecuritiesSettlement Systemsﬂ took place at the ECB

1521Structure, performance and risks in the banking sector
The monitoring of developments in thebanking sector from an EU and euro area-
wide perspective was further developed in2002. A significant part of this activity was
carried out under the auspices of the ESCBBanking Supervision Committee (BSC) andrelied on two main strands. The first strand
consists of the annual analysis of structuraldevelopments in the banking industry. Theoutcome of this analysis Œ which addresses
structural developments relevant to centralbanks and supervisory authorities and alsodraws on a recently established set of
statistical structural indicators Œ was
published for the first time in 2002.1 In this
context, the BSC also continued to study a
number of issues on an ad hoc basis, includingdevelopments in banks™ liquidity profile and
management in the new environment

following the introduction of the euro.2 The
second strand refers to the regular macro-prudential analysis of banking sector stability.
Conditions and risks to banking stability aremonitored on a systematic basis, and a formalassessment is submitted twice a year to the
decision-making bodies of the ECB. Work has
continued on methodologies for assessing banks™credit risk exposures vis-à-vis different sectorsand for conducting stress-test analyses, and onimproving the quality and scope of the
information available at the EU level. Of the
various topics addressed, particular mentionshould be made of the exposure of banks tocross-border contagion risks. In addition to the

work performed by the BSC, internal work hasbeen conducted within the Eurosystem toenhance the analysis of financial stability issues
from an overall perspective.Structural developmentsTwo main developments in the EU bankingsector in 2002 warrant particular attention:first, banks™ reorganisation efforts in response
to increased cost-income pressures and,
second, a rapid increase in the use of creditrisk transfer instruments (credit derivativesand securitisation products).Owing both to income losses followingadverse changes in the economic and financialmarket environment in 2001 and 2002 and tointensified competition, EU banks have been
under increasing pressure to reduce costs.Many banks have faced a significant drop,
which began in 2001 and further intensified

in 2002, in some of the new businesslines introduced in the late 1990s (such asprivate banking, investment banking and
asset management). Several EU banks have
thus embarked on major restructuringprogrammes aimed at cutting costs (including
staff costs), streamlining the organisation andrefocusing on the core business. Despiteincreased rationalisation efforts, EU banks
™cost-to-income ratios increased in 2001.
However, banks with assets over 100 billionwere able to decrease their ratios in the first
half of 2002. The increased efforts by banksshould begin to yield more tangibleimprovements in efficiency in the medium

term. The expansion in the use of creditrisk transfer products, and especially credit
derivatives, intensified in 2002. Credit
derivatives are the newest and fastest growingsegment of the derivatives business. Despite
increased defaults, it is expected that their
growth will continue very rapidly. Accordingto a recent survey by the InternationalSwaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA),
the global notional outstanding volume ofcredit derivatives transactions recorded inthe survey reached 900 billion by the endof 2001, of which EU banks account foraround 35%.The maturing of the credit risk transfer
market could promote a more efficientallocation of risks across both banks and
other financial institutions (especiallyinsurance companies). Financial institutionswill also be able to price and manage credit
risk more accurately. However, there couldbe added financial stability concerns as a1See ECB

managementﬂ, May 2002.153ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
result of the distribution of credit risk across
financial institutions becoming lesstransparent for markets and supervisors.
Protection selling is, to a significant degree,concentrated among a few banks andinsurance companies. These instruments

could also increase contagion risks to banksfrom insurance companies, as well as exposing
banks to significant legal and operational risks.
The exact amount of risk transferred will, toa large extent, depend on the specificcontractual clauses.The increase in trading of credit risk hasbeen accompanied by progress in internal
credit risk assessment systems in anticipation
of the New Basel Accord (see the final sectionof this chapter). This has allowed banks to
enhance the alignment of the pricing of creditwith the underlying risk and to improve theirinternal capital allocation. Banks have also
been making advances in assessing andcontrolling operational risks, at least in partas a response to the inclusion of such risks
in the New Basel Accord. Finally, the
integration, deepening and better liquidity ofthe money markets in euro, the introduction
of new payment technologies and financialinnovations have improved banks
™ ability to
manage liquidity risk. At the same time, the
risk of liquidity drying up in situations ofmarket turmoil has increased, as banks are
becoming more dependent on securities
markets. The banking industry has begun todevelop more advanced quantitative methodsfor managing liquidity risk (e.g. liquidity-at-
risk models), but the area is still at a relativelyearly stage of development.Some of the trends highlighted in the 2001Annual Report have continued. Banks havecontinued to expand in central and eastern
Europe, which still offers significant growthopportunities. Some further cross-borderexpansion has taken place within the EU as a
result of mergers and acquisitions and theestablishment of branches and subsidiaries,but the pace of expansion decreased

significantly in late 2001 and 2002. Faced with
more difficult market conditions, banks havetaken a more cautious approach to the risksassociated with mergers and acquisitions, asreflected by the clear reduction in largedomestic and cross-border banking mergers.
Among smaller banks pursuing cost-saving
objectives, the pace of domestic consolidationhas remained high.Since the introduction of the euro, integrationwithin the banking sector has proceeded
unevenly, varying according to the areas ofbanking business.3 As regards wholesale and
capital market-related activities, the formerly
segmented national currency-based markets(e.g. securities underwriting) have already
largely transformed into an integrated area-
wide market. The strong competitionfostered by the entry of international financialinstitutions has substantially reduced the

leading role of domestic intermediariesand reduced underwriting fees. The stillfragmented infrastructure for the cross-
border clearing and settlement of securities
transactions represents a major obstacle tocross-border trading and the provision of

related asset management services. Theintegration process has clearly been slowerin the retail area, which is due to the
traditionally strong local nature of these
activities. However, there are increasing linksacross national markets. In particular, foreign
involvement, in terms of ownershipstructures in national banking systems, isalready significant (over 20% in terms of bank

capital in the EU as a whole).Performance and risks
The profitability of EU banks weakened in
2001, and further so in the first half of 2002,owing largely to increased loan lossprovisions and reductions in non-interest

income, reflecting weaker economic andfinancial market conditions. After thededuction of tax and extraordinary items, the
aggregated return on equity of EU banksdeclined to 10.1% in 2001, from 12.4% in2000, although this level of profitability was
3For further information, see ECB Occasional Paper No. 6,
ﬁBanking integration in the euro areaﬂ, December 2002.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
154still in line with the average levels observed
in the period 1995-99.
4 The shift in the
distribution was even more pronounced: the

number and asset share of banks with a returnon equity (ROE) of below 5% increasedsignificantly, while the set of banks with very
high profitability (ROE above 20%) shrank
markedly. The pace of decline in profitabilityof the major banking groups accelerated in
2002.Loan loss provisions accelerated significantlyin the first half of 2002 in the major bankinggroups for which quarterly data are available(and further in the third quarter), as non-
performing loans started to accumulate morerapidly. In banking groups with assets over100 billion, the ratio of loan loss provisionsto profits (before provisions) increased by
25% in the first half of 2002. This was areflection of the higher frequency of
corporate sector failures in a number of EUcountries and the deterioration in the qualityof some international assets. The income of

many large banks has been especially hurt bythe reduction in income from investmentbanking, which has suffered because of the
dry-up of the primary and secondary capitalmarket and corporate restructuring activity.As a consequence of the turbulent financial

markets, firms have tended to reduce equityand bond financing and corporaterestructuring operations. Earnings from
investment banking came to represent a largeshare of major banks™ profits in the late 1990s
and 2000. The financial market turmoil has

also reduced the appetite for investing insecurities and mutual funds, thus reducingbanks™ income from asset management and
trading activities.All in all, the financial market turmoil hasaffected banks more in terms of incomereductions than credit and market riskexposures, as banks™ direct equity holdings
are typically small (on aggregate around 4%of EU banks
™ consolidated balance sheet
total). For many large banks, the recentprocess of diversification has not generated
the desired benefits, as several banking Œincluding international Œ activities have
suffered at the same time. Banks focusing on
retail banking and having a strong franchise indomestic markets fared best in thecircumstances of 2001 and 2002.Owing to as yet largely unaffected capitallevels and improved risk management
techniques, banks have been able to wellwithstand the shocks in their operatingenvironment. EU banks™ aggregate total capital
ratio has remained at around 12.0%, i.e. wellabove the regulatory minimum. In some areas,however, where the downturn in cyclical and

financial market conditions has furtherdepressed already low structural profitability,the banking sector has been forced to make
structural adjustments. The resilience of thebanking sector has been supported by theabsence of substantial household and
corporate sector imbalances within the EU.However, the uncertainty in the stockmarkets has narrowed the possibilities for
reducing the high levels of debt in some areas
of the corporate sector, notably the TMT(technology, media, telecom) industries.
In a nutshell, the EU banking sector has
shown remarkable resilience to the adverse
developments in 2001 and 2002 and still hasthe potential to withstand further shocks.However, particular vigilance is called for on
the part of banks and supervisors to ensure
that adequate capital buffers are maintainedamid declining profitability and certain asset
quality concerns.4The data referred to in this section are collected by the Banking
Supervision Committee. They cover approximately 99% of the
EU credit institutions™ sector in terms of total assets for the fiscal
year 2001.155ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
2Arrangements for financial stability and supervision
The debate on the adequacy of EUinstitutional arrangements for financial
stability continued in the course of 2002,driven by inter alia the work conducted in
the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC)(see Chapter V). Supervisory responsibilitiesremain at the national level, in accordance
with the subsidiarity principle. The work ofthe EFC5, however, made clear that co-operation should be significantly enhanced in
order to deal with the increasing integrationof financial markets. The EFC™s attention alsocentred on the policies needed to support
progress in the integration of financialmarkets in the EU. The ﬁReport on FinancialIntegrationﬂ, approved in April 2002,
highlighted the potential benefits of fullyintegrated financial markets for the EU
economies and identified a number of steps
to be taken in the regulatory and supervisoryfield towards achieving this objective. Inparticular, the report recommended policy
actions aimed at removing distortions andobstacles arising from inconsistentimplementation and enforcement of financial
regulations in the EU. These conclusions were
in line with the findings of an industry report,prepared within the European Financial
Services Roundtable,6 which also called for
more harmonisation of investor protectionrules, consistency of national rulebooks and
convergence in supervisory practices.The EFC reports triggered a comprehensivereview of the EU arrangements for financialregulation, supervision and stability, with aview to enhancing the effectiveness of the
structures for co-operation, which wasendorsed by the ECOFIN Council in
December 2002. In this regard, the EFC was
mandated by the ECOFIN Council to conductsuch a review. The EFC report on ﬁEUArrangements for Financial Regulation,
Supervision and Stabilityﬂ made a
comprehensive proposal for remodelling thestructures for co-operation. In particular, the
report recommended the extension to allfinancial sectors of the ﬁLamfalussyapproachﬂ, already implemented in thesecurities field. This would imply the adoptionof a more flexible regulatory process, leavingthe handling of technical implementingmeasures to regulatory committees,
composed of representatives of the MemberStates nominated by the relevant ministersaccording to national models, assisted by
supervisory committees. The latter wouldalso be mandated to pursue a more consistent
implementation of EC Directives in Member

States and strive for convergence ofsupervisory practices. The proposed newarrangements would be organised along
sectoral lines, with regulatory and supervisorycommittees for banking, securities andUCITS, and insurance and pensions. A special
regulatory committee would also be set upfor financial conglomerates. A restructured
Financial Services Policy Group (renamed the
Financial Services Committee, FSC) would
provide advice and oversight on financialmarket issues for the benefit of the ECOFIN
Council. The EFC would be the forumresponsible for preparing ECOFIN discussions
on financial stability. To this end, it would
be assisted by the FSC. In the proposednew structures, a role is also acknowledged
for the BSC of the ESCB. First, the structural
and macroprudential analyses conductedwithin the BSC will contribute to the
EU discussions on financial stability
issues. Second, the work accomplished withinthe BSC towards forging a commonunderstanding between central banks and
banking supervisors in several areas ofcommon interest may also serve as ayardstick in the new structures in the field
of exchanging confidential information.
The main issues that emerged from the publicconsultation process that followed theendorsement of a preliminary version of the
EFC report by the ECOFIN Council were,5This was the outcome of the EFC 
ﬁReport on Financial Stabilityﬂ,issued in April 2000, and further refined the following year with
reference to financial crisis management.6F. Heinemann and M. Jopp, 
ﬁThe Benefits of a WorkingEuropean Retail Market for Financial Servicesﬂ, Report to theEuropean Financial Services Roundtable, Europe Union Verlag,
2002.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
156first, the relevance of an institutional balancein the new regulatory process and second,the need to have more formal and transparent
consultation procedures with interested
parties on draft regulations. From a centralbanking perspective, three points are of
paramount importance. The first concerns theparticipation of all central banks, includingthose without direct supervisory
responsibilities, in the structures forsupervisory co-operation in banking. This is
essential for the promotion of financial
stability, since banks embody a certainpotential for systemic risk, and strains in thebanking sector have immediate implications
for payment infrastructures and themanagement of liquidity. The second pointrelates to the participation of technical
experts in the regulatory committees in orderto avoid transferring all the burden oftechnical work on draft regulations to

supervisory committees which may bedistracted by their important tasks in thearea of supervisory practices. The third point
refers to the need for a strong technicalanchor in the work on financial stability,acknowledging the efforts under way within
the BSC and other ESCB structures for
monitoring the vulnerabilities of the EUfinancial system.Two important multilateral arrangementswere agreed in the first part of 2003, under
the auspices of the BSC. First, a Memorandumof Understanding on co-operation betweencentral banks and supervisory authorities in
crisis situations. This agreement lays downprinciples to improve the current proceduresfor co-operation and the exchange of
information between the two authorities incrisis situations. Second, a Memorandum of
Understanding between seven EU central
banks (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,Italy, Portugal and Spain) which manage acentral credit register. This agreement will
allow the opening-up of the registers on across-border basis.With a view to providing enhanced supportto the efforts under way at the EU level, theECB has also established a new DirectorateFinancial Stability and Supervision. In closeco-operation with the other ECB areas
concerned, the new Directorate will seek to
provide a comprehensive overview of financialstability issues relevant to the euro area andwill closely follow developments in financial
regulation, supervision and the other fields offinancial services policy.With regard to institutional arrangements for
financial regulation and supervision in Member
States, the following developments in 2002
should be noted. In Austria, the Financial
Market Authority commenced its activities inApril 2002 as a supervisory authority

responsible for all financial sectors. Thecentral bank™s involvement was enhanced.Indeed, the central bank is closely involved in
the supervisory process, especially in on-siteinspections for credit and market risks, andis also in charge of processing all reporting
by banks. In Belgium, the institutional
relationship between the central bank, thebanking and securities commission and the
insurance supervisory authority wasreinforced also in terms of corporate
governance structures; members of the board
of the central bank will have a seat on theboard of the supervisory authorities and a
new Financial Stability Committee chaired by
the governor of the central bank will be incharge of co-ordinating the supervision of
the financial sector. The purpose of this
reform is, among other things, to exploit
synergies in areas of common interest, suchas financial stability, through the pooling of
resources. In Germany, the newly establishedsupervisory authority (encompassing thebanking, securities and insurance sectors)
commenced its activities in May 2002, whilethe Deutsche Bundesbank™s involvement inprudential supervision was enhanced. In
Finland, the operational framework of theFinancial Supervision Authority is under
review with a view to improving its
functionality. In France, a legislative proposal
was launched to establish a new authority,the Financial Market Authority (FMA),
responsible for the regulation and supervisionof securities markets. The FMA will combinethe functions of the stock exchange157ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
committee and the financial market councilin order to streamline the institutionalframework for securities regulation and
supervision. In Ireland, the legislative processcontinued with a view to establishing the IrishFinancial Services Regulatory Authority, which
will be a constituent but autonomous part ofa restructured central bank, the Central Bankand Financial Services Authority of Ireland.
The new regulatory authority will beresponsible for the regulation and supervisionof all financial sectors, including both
prudential and consumer issues. In theNetherlands, work continued implementingthe institutional reform based on a functional
distinction between prudential supervisionand the conduct of business issues. While aseparate authority is overseeing the conductof business, the central bank and the
insurance and pension fund supervisoryinstitution are responsible for prudentialsupervision. Closer co-operation has been
established between both prudentialsupervisors. Representatives of both
institutions have a seat on each other™s boardand, in December 2002, full integration wasproposed to the ministers responsible. All inall, the above-mentioned developments have
led to a consolidation of the number of
supervisory authorities and to a revised and,in most cases, enhanced involvement of
central banks in prudential supervision.
3Banking and financial regulation
In the area of banking regulation, the revision
of the capital framework remained the mainissue at the international and EU level in 2002.
At the international level, the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)intensified its efforts to further develop andrefine the main elements of the three pillars
of the proposed framework, namely minimumcapital requirements, the supervisory reviewprocess and market discipline. In July 2002
the BCBS reached agreement on a numberof important issues relating to the finalisationof the New Basel Accord. This agreement
encompasses, inter alia: a specific treatmentof banks™ exposures to small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs); the carrying out of

conservative credit risk stress testing underpillar two by banks adopting the internal
ratings-based (IRB) approach; the narrowing

of the gap between the advanced and
foundation IRB approaches; a more flexiblepillar one capital treatment for operational
risk; and the transitional imposition of a singlecapital floor, based on the capital estimatedunder the current Accord. In addition, the
BCBS confirmed a revised time frame forfinalising the Accord, whereby the final (third)consultative paper is expected to be released
in the second quarter of 2003 for publicconsultation, while the New Basel Accordwill be finalised in the fourth quarter of 2003and implemented at end-2006. In October2002 the BCBS launched the third and finalQuantitative Impact Study (QIS 3) with theaim of making a thorough assessment of the
impact of the new Basel rules before the
launch of the third consultative paper. The
results of QIS 3 are expected in early summer

2003. The Accord Implementation Group, asub-structure of the BCBS mandated to dealwith implementation issues, became
operational in 2002.
At the EU level, work on reforming theregulatory capital framework for banks and
investment firms was undertaken by theEuropean Commission in parallel with the
BCBS. In November 2002, the Commissioninitiated a pre-consultative dialogue onthe matter (the ﬁStructured Dialogueﬂ) withthe financial services industry and otherinterested parties. A cover note and a
working document setting out the
Commission™s current thinking on the newEU capital adequacy framework for banks and
investment firms were published as the basis
for this dialogue. The Commission intendsto publish a third consultative paper inearly summer 2003, i.e. shortly after the
BCBS™s third consultative paper, for formalconsultation at the EU level. It is expectedthat subsequently, in the first quarter of 2004,ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
158the Commission will issue a proposal for a
draft Directive on the regulatory capital forcredit institutions and investment firms

amending the existing EU provisions. The newregulatory framework is expected to comeinto effect at the same time as the New Basel
Accord, i.e. at the end of 2006.In response to a request from the Barcelona
European Council of March 2002, the
European Commission will also beresponsible for carrying out a study on the
likely consequences of the new capitalframework for all sectors of the Europeaneconomy, with a particular focus on SMEs.
The aim is to conclude this study by autumn
2003.The ECB, which continues to provide its inputto the decision-making process in this areamainly through its participation in an observer
capacity in the relevant committees, remains
supportive of the thrust of the regulatoryreform as developed so far. Among other
things, the ECB welcomed the introductionof stress tests under pillar two for banksadopting the IRB approach; this, in
conjunction with the adoption of a flatterrisk-weight curve for corporate credits(agreed by the BCBS in November 2001), is

expected to contribute to a lower degree offluctuation in capital requirements over the
economic cycle. Subject to proper finalisation,
the new framework would be instrumental instrengthening financial stability. As regardsEU-specific issues, considerable importance
is attached to ensuring an appropriate
treatment of banks™ exposures to SMEs and
achieving fair treatment for small and
medium-sized banks and investment firmswhose capital requirements should becommensurate with their specific risk profile.

Moreover, convergence of supervisorypractices is also considered important and
will become a core task of the level three
banking supervisory committee.In the area of financial regulation, good
progress has been made in the adoption of
the Community measures foreseen in theFinancial Services Action Plan (FSAP). Inparticular, the priority objectives set by the
Barcelona European Council, such as theFinancial Conglomerates Directive, the

Market Abuse Directive and the Regulationon International Accounting Standards, werenearly all met in 2002. This legislative
progress was accompanied by an increasingawareness of the potential benefits of furtherfinancial market integration (see Chapter V).
In the field of securities regulation, work hasbeen progressing within the ﬁLamfalussyframeworkﬂ, which was proposed by the
Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation
of European Securities Markets. The Market
Abuse Directive was the first to distinguish

framework principles (Level 1 legislation)from the implementation of technical details(Level 2 regulations) and to allocate a
comitology role to the adoption of Level 2regulations to the European SecuritiesCommittee. In addition, the Commission™sproposals for Directives on Prospectuses and,in particular, for the revision of theInvestment Services Directive are widely
reliant on the practicability of the Lamfalussy-type regulatory procedures. The recentlyestablished Committee of European Securities

Regulators has also initiated, at theCommission™s request, technical work on
implementing measures for the Directives on
Market Abuse and Prospectuses. The ECBparticipates with observer status in theFinancial Services Policy Group (FSPG), which
monitors the progress being achieved in the
implementation of the FSAP. In addition, in
accordance with its statutory tasks, the ECB
is consulted on the draft proposals forDirectives in the field of financial regulation,as in the case of those mentioned above.Combating money laundering and thefinancing of terrorism remained a priority
issue in 2002. There were three main
developments in this area. First, manycountries were extensively involved in the
process of implementing the eight Special
Recommendations against terrorism financing
put forward by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF). In this context, the FATFdevoted considerable efforts to providing a
detailed interpretation of these standards.
1597See ECB ﬁFair value accounting in the banking sector: ECB

(IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and

identification and due diligence, suspicioustransaction reporting, regulation andsupervision, corporate vehicles and non-
financial businesses and professions. Third,
the IMF, the World Bank and the FATF havedeveloped a common methodology for
assessing countries™ compliance with theFATF™s 40 Recommendations. The FATF™sstandards will be added to the standards and
codes guiding the surveillance activities ofthe IMF and the World Bank, such as thepreparation of the Reports on the
Observance of Standards and Codes and thecarrying-out of Financial Sector AssessmentProgrammes. The ECB participates in the
FATF in its capacity as an observer.In the accounting field, the InternationalAccounting Standards Board (IASB) hasembarked on the modernisation andimprovement of the existing International
Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as onmajor projects aiming at convergence withUS Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
In this context, the IASB issued drafts forIAS 32 on the disclosure and presentationof financial instruments and IAS 39 on the
recognition and measurement of financialinstruments. The possible extension of theuse of fair value accounting under IAS 39 is
under consideration. The ECB issued anOpinion on applying fair value accounting inthe banking sector in November 2001.7 Asregards developments in the EU, Regulation(EC) No. 1606/2002 of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002
provides that listed companies shall applyﬁinternational accounting standardsﬂ8 from2005 onwards when drawing up theirconsolidated financial statements. Thepurpose of the Regulation is to achieve
harmonisation of financial information inorder to ensure a high degree of transparencyand comparability of financial statements. A
new Accounting Regulatory Committee(ARC) was established to assist theCommission in adopting the standard(s)
applicable under this Regulation. The ECBhas been invited to attend meetings of theARC as an observer.With regard to corporate governance issues,following the report of the High Level
Group of Company Law Experts on amodern regulatory framework for corporategovernance in Europe, the Commission began
work on an action plan to implement theGroup™s recommendations. The ECB willmake its contribution to the development of
this action plan via its participation in therelevant EU fora in which the plan isdiscussed.ˆˆ



Chapter XStatisticalframeworkECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1621Introduction
In 2002 the provision of statistics proceeded
smoothly, with further improvements interms of quality and availability. Additionalimportant enhancements are expected
following the introduction of the newRegulations on the consolidated balance sheetof the MFI sector and on MFI interest rate

statistics, the Guideline on quarterly financialaccounts and other legal acts that arecurrently in preparation. All of this has been
done in close co-operation with the NCBs,which collect data from the reporting agentsand transmit them to the ECB, which, in turn,
produces euro area aggregates.Efforts have been made to strengthenco-ordination in order to enhance theavailability and timeliness of internationallycomparable and consistent monthly and
quarterly data. Steps have also been takentowards the development of a comprehensivestatistical framework of quarterly financial and
non-financial accounts, aimed at enhancingconsistency between different statistics. In2002, the ECB held its first Conference onStatistics and also ran seminars involving usersof data, in particular on seasonal adjustment
and financial market statistics.
The Eurosystem seeks to meet the need forreliable, comprehensive and high-qualitystatistics in a way that minimises the reportingburden on institutions. In doing so, it makes

use of existing statistics wherever possible.New statistical requirements are subject
to a merits and costs procedure involving
reporting agents. During 2002 the formal
procedure for assessing the benefits and costs
of new statistics was further refined.The Eurosystem has provided assistance to
accession countries in the development of

high quality statistics, among other thingsthrough the organisation of various seminars
on specific types of statistics (see Chapter VI).
2Money and banking statistics and statistics on financial markets
The regular provision of money and banking
statistics and statistics on financial markets
proceeded according to schedule.
MFIs report balance sheet data on a monthlyand quarterly basis in order to fulfil statisticalrequirements which were established at the
start of the EMU. The ﬁList of MFIs forstatistical purposesﬂ is updated monthly and
published on the ECB™s website. The purpose
of this is to maintain a consistent applicationof the definition of an MFI across the euroarea and the EU.During 2002 the ECB and NCBs devotedsignificant resources to the implementation
of the ECB Regulation on the consolidatedbalance sheet of the MFI sector (ECB/2001/13),as adopted by the Governing Council in
November 2001. The new requirements arebeing implemented in co-operation with creditinstitutions and their associations. For this
purpose, the Guidance Notes to RegulationECB/2001/13 on MFI balance sheet statisticswere published in November 2002. Datacompiled in accordance with the new
Regulation were reported in early 2003 forthe first time. The main enhancements to theMFI balance sheet statistics relate to more
detailed monthly information on loans anddeposits and to new statistics on revaluationadjustments applied to securities and loans.
The more detailed information refers to theavailability of breakdowns by type of instrument,maturity at issue and counterparty sector of
the MFI balance sheet items. As to therevaluation adjustments, this will significantlyimprove the derivation of flows on a monthly

basis. Moreover, the adjustments may havetheir own information content and enrichthe analysis of monetary aggregates and

counterparts (e.g. the write-offs/write-downs ofloans).163ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Similarly, the ECB and NCBs devoted
significant resources to the implementationof the new ECB Regulation on MFI interest
rate statistics (ECB/2001/18) adopted by theGoverning Council in December 2001. Thesestatistics will provide comprehensive, detailed
and harmonised interest rate data, which willconsiderably enhance the analysis of monetarypolicy transmission and monetary analysis
itself. They are also needed for assessing
financial stability. In total 45 indicators arecompiled, in respect of both outstanding
amounts and new business. The new MFIinterest rate statistics will be available to the
ECB by the 19th working day after the end of
the reference month. The year 2003 isconsidered as a phasing-in period. In thisrespect it is also worth noting that a bank

lending survey has been developed by theEurosystem to complement the statistics oninterest rates.In November 2002 the Governing Counciladopted a Regulation (ECB/2002/8) on the
provision of monthly statistics on the holdersof money market funds shares/units, broken
down by residency of the holder. The aim of
this amendment to Regulation ECB/2001/13is to enhance the long-term stability and
quality of data on the holders of money
market funds shares/units, which are alreadyused in the calculation of M3.In the light of the decision to use 12-month
growth rates, calculated from seasonallyadjusted data, for the comparison of M3
growth with the reference value, furtherefforts were also made to ensure a highstandard of these statistics. Flow adjustments
were improved by means of a more accurateallowance for exchange rate changes (affectingnon-euro items in MFI balance sheets) and

their application extended to cover the more
detailed quarterly data. This permits thecorrect calculation of growth rates of, for
example, sectoral holdings of deposits withand borrowing from MFIs.New indicators have also been developed forthe purpose of assessing financial stability andstructural developments in banking.
In January 2003 the ECB published, for thefirst time, statistics on non-monetary financial
institutions (other than insurancecorporations and pension funds). Thestatistics show euro area outstanding end-

quarter stocks of investment funds brokendown by investment policy (equity, bond,mixed, real estate and other investment
funds) and by restrictions, if any, on thepurchase of the funds™ units/shares (general
public funds and specialised investor funds).
These statistics are not yet fully harmonisedacross the euro area, although NCBs havealready taken measures to make their
national contributions as consistent as
possible. On this basis, euro area aggregatesof an acceptable quality can be compiled.The Eurosystem also addressed some issuesregarding the impact of the euro cash
changeover on the presentations of thenational breakdown of the MFI balance sheetstatistics, which underlie monetary statistics.The securities issues statistics have beenenhanced. The implementation of a new
calculation method, separating the growth oftransactions from revaluations, reclassificationsand other changes unrelated to transactions,
has resulted in more accurate and consistentgrowth rates. Besides, in January 2003 the ECBstarted, on the basis of the preparations of the

ECB and NCBs, the regular publication of newmonthly statistics on the outstanding amountsof quoted shares, broken down by sector of the
issuer.Meanwhile, the ECB has continued developingcommon methodologies for calculatingcomparable euro area statistical indicators offinancial markets.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1643Balance of payments, international reserves and international
investment position statistics, and effective exchange ratesThe compilation and publication of euro areamonthly and quarterly balance of payments(b.o.p.) and annual international investment
position (i.i.p.) data and of the Eurosystem™smonthly international reserve positionproceeded effectively in 2002.As a significant improvement, in November
2002 the ECB published i.i.p. data for year-
end positions from 1999 to 2001 showing theeuro area asset and liability positionsseparately, whereas previously only net

positions had been available. The changes inthe i.i.p. between year-ends are partlyexplained by the b.o.p. flows during the

year. In addition, the stock data reflectvaluation effects arising from changes inasset prices and exchange rates, and other
changes (e.g. write-offs, reclassifications)not related to flows. The above-mentioned
improvement therefore considerably enhances
the information content and analytical valueof euro area i.i.p. statistics.As in previous years, the Eurosystem has
undertaken work to improve the quality andavailability of data. One of the major
challenges lies in portfolio investment. In June2002, the ECB published a report outliningpossible steps to be taken at the national
level in order to enhance the portfolioinvestment collection systems. The ECB,
together with the NCBs, is developing a
centralised securities database aimed atimproving the quality of portfolio investment
data. The ECB has also contributed
extensively to the work at the European levelto define criteria and operational indicators
for assessing the quality of balance ofpayments and related statistics. Further stepshave been taken to improve the consistency
between b.o.p. and related data on the onehand, and money and banking data and the rest-
of-the-world sector in the national accounts on
the other.During 2002 proposed amendments to ECBGuideline 2000/4, which lays down the legalframework for the compilation of euro area
b.o.p., international reserves and i.i.p.
statistics, were considered. An update of thisGuideline is planned for the first quarter of2003.An updated version of the annual publicationﬁEuropean Union balance of payments/international investment position statisticalmethodsﬂ was released in November 2002.
This publication provides information on the
statistical methodologies applied in MemberStates to compile b.o.p. and i.i.p. statisticsand, as such, improves the transparency of
the compilation of euro area statistics.Since October 1999, the ECB has beenpublishing data on nominal and real effective
exchange rates for the euro, and has madedata available for an assessment of the
international role of the euro.4Financial accounts
The regular provision of quarterly financialaccounts data for the euro area non-financialsectors, published for the first time in May
2001, proceeded smoothly. The Guideline ofthe ECB on the statistical requirements inthe field of quarterly financial accounts, as
adopted by the Governing Council inNovember 2002, will ensure that regular
provision of quarterly financial accountswithin the Eurosystem continues. The
Guideline covers current data needs for thecompilation of the Monetary Union Financial
Accounts and the reporting requirementsfor national data, especially on insurancecorporations and pension funds, that will
shortly become available. The new Guidelinecame into effect in November 2002.165ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Further improvements have been made infinancial accounts statistics by ensuringconsistency between capital and financialaccounts. In addition, the statistical treatmentof non-returned banknotes has beenaddressed.5Government finance statistics
As in previous years, the ECB published annual
data on government revenue and expenditure
in the euro area. The data also provide detailson government debt and an analysis of thedifference between government deficits and
changes in government debt. The transmissionof these annual data progressed withoutdifficulty in 2002. An ECB Guideline on statistical
reporting requirements and the procedures forexchanging statistical information in the field of
government finance statistics is in preparation.6General economic statistics
General economic statistics covering prices
and costs, national accounts, labour markets,
and a wide range of other economic datasupport the ECB™s monetary policy strategy.The ECB and the European Commission(which has the main responsibility for thesestatistics at the EU level) collaborated closely
in monitoring the implementation of theAction Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements,which was presented to the ECOFIN Council

in September 2000. As a follow-up to theEMU Action Plan and other initiatives,improvements have been made in general
economic statistics at the national andthe European level, but much remains tobe done. A 
Communication issued by theEuropean Commission in November 2002detailed the progress made towards improvedmethodologies for euro area statistics and
indicators, and envisaged further progress. TheECB also contributed, as in the past, to a furtherProgress Report on Information Requirements

in EMU, which reviews the achievements andrequirements under the EMU Action Plan andwhich has meanwhile been adopted by the
ECOFIN Council.
In addition, the ECB has stressed the needfor further enhancements in the worldwide
comparability of statistics.7Co-operation with the European Commission and international
institutionsAt the European level, the agreed division ofstatistical responsibilities between the ECB
and the European Commission (Eurostat)worked well in 2002, as in previous years. Anupdate of the Memorandum of Understanding

on Economic and Financial Statistics betweenthe ECB and Eurostat is in preparation. TheECB works closely with the European
Commission, in part via the Committee onMonetary, Financial and Balance of Payments
Statistics (CMFB), in which statisticians from
Eurostat, the national statistical institutes,the ECB and the NCBs are represented.The ECB has welcomed the adoption of newinternal rules of procedure for the CMFB to
deal with consultations for the purpose ofthe Excessive Deficit Procedure.The ECB is also in close contact with the
BIS, the IMF and the OECD concerningstatistical matters. In co-operation with
European Community institutions andinternational organisations, the ECBcontributes towards defining international
statistical standards and promotes theirobservance.%

the fulfilment by the 15 EU NCBs of theirobligations under Articles 101 and 102 of theTreaty and Council Regulations (EC)
Nos. 3603/93 and 3604/93. This task isperformed by the General Council of theECB, which also monitors the ECB™s owncompliance with the provisions. Article 101prohibits the ECB and the NCBs fromproviding overdraft facilities or any other type
of credit facility to governments andCommunity institutions or bodies, as well asfrom purchasing debt instruments directly
from them. Article 102 prohibits any measure,
not based on prudential considerations, whichestablishes privileged access by central
governments and other public authorities,public undertakings and Communityinstitutions or bodies to financial institutions.In parallel with the General Council, theEuropean Commission monitors Member
States™ compliance with the above provisions.
The General Council also monitors the EUcentral banks™ secondary market purchases
of debt instruments issued by both thedomestic public sector and the public sector
of other Member States. According tothe recitals of Council Regulation (EC)No. 3603/93, the acquisition of public sector
debt instruments in the secondary marketmust not be used to circumvent the objective
of Article 101 of the Treaty. Such purchases
should not become a form of indirectmonetary financing of the public sector.For 2002, the General Council found threecases of non-compliance with the aboveTreaty requirements and the associated171ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Council regulations by NCBs of MemberStates. In each case, the amount of coins heldby the NCBs and credited to the public sector
following the euro cash changeover exceededthe limit of 10% of the coins in circulation
laid down in Article 6 of Council Regulation
(EC) No. 3603/93. In the case of Greece, thelimit was exceeded in the first three monthsof 2002, while in the case of France andFinland, this problem remained throughout
the year and had not been corrected by theyear-end. The General Council has urged theNCBs of the latter two Member States to
take immediate corrective action.3The administration of the borrowing and lending operations of
the European CommunityIn accordance with Article 123 (2) of theTreaty and Article 9 of Council Regulation(EC) No. 332/2002 of 18 February 2002
(which replaces Article II of CouncilRegulation (EEC) No. 1969/88 of 24 June1988), the ECB continues to have
responsibility for the administration of theborrowing and lending operations of theEuropean Community under the medium-term financial assistance facility. During 2002,however, the ECB performed no such
administration tasks, as there was nooutstanding balance at the end of 2001 andno new operations were initiated during the
year.

Chapter XIIExternal communication
and accountabilityECB  Annual Report 
 2002
174IThe ECB
™s communication policy and activities1.1Communication activities
Efficient and appropriate externalcommunication is indispensable for a central
bank. Using a variety of communication toolsthe ECB Œ in close co-operation with the
NCBs of the Eurosystem Œ continually
strives to enhance the European public
™sunderstanding of its tasks, its strategy andthe decisions based on that strategy. In 2002

work was undertaken to further improve theeffectiveness of external communications. Atthe same time, it is important to maintain
continuity and steadiness in the communicationactivities in order to increase the public™sfamiliarity with the framework of monetary

policy and other central banking-related mattersin the euro area.The first few months of the year weredominated by the Euro 2002 InformationCampaign, entailing an extraordinary

communication effort in which theEurosystem helped euro area citizens toget to know their new currency (see
Box 11). As far as communication on otherissues is concerned, the ECB employed itsregular set of communication tools: press

releases, press conferences, periodicalpublications (Annual Report and Monthly
Bulletin), public speeches and interviews given
by members of the ECB™s decision-makingbodies, as well as brochures and other printedpublications. This wide variety of tools

enables the ECB to reach many differentaudiences, ranging from academics andbanking specialists to media representatives,
students and the general public.Furthermore, the ECB contributes to thedissemination of research findings within thefield of monetary and general economic
research by publishing Working Papers and
Occasional Papers and organising academicconferences, seminars and workshops. In
2002 the main events of this kind were the
seminar held within the framework of theAsia-Europe Meeting in April, the seminar ofthe Eurosystem and Latin American Central
Banks in May, the Second ECB CentralBanking Conference 2002 on ﬁThetransformation of the European financialsystemﬂ in October, and the high-level
seminar on the EU accession process inDecember.A separate communication activity is the
reception of visitor groups at the premises of
the ECB. This is an opportunity, in particular
for students, to gain first-hand knowledge ofthe ECB™s activities. During 2002 more than9,000 visitors were received at the ECB, and
since its inception in 1998, the ECB haswelcomed more than 40,000 visitors.An overarching factor in many of thesecommunication activities is the ECB™s website(www.ecb.int) which gives access to all

documents published by the ECB. Thefrequency of visits to the website as well asthe use of the e-mail hotlines remained high
in 2002. The website also served as a platform
for the launch of public consultations.Public consultations were used quite
extensively as a communication instrumentin 2002, with a total of six public consultation
procedures being initiated by the ECB.Interested parties were invited to providetheir comments either to the ECB or to
NCBs. Both the ECB and the NCBs usedtheir websites for the consultations. Thesubjects of the public consultations included
payment systems and the operationalframework for monetary policy.Co-operation with the NCBs is crucial in thefield of communications and a prerequisitefor achieving the optimal results from the
resources allocated for these purposes withinthe ESCB. In the process of co-ordination,special emphasis is put on the efforts to

ensure ﬁsingle voiceﬂ communication on the
single monetary policy in the euro area.Equally important is the ESCB
™s ability toaddress a variety of regional and nationalaudiences in their own respective languagesand contexts.175ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
The ECB continues to look for ways offurther improving the usefulness of theexisting tools. As part of these efforts, the
ECB conducted a survey in the autumn of2002 on the readership of its Monthly Bulletin.
In the same vein, a project has been launched to
improve the design of this publication.1.2Important communication issues in
2002A number of topical issues can be identifiedas being among the most important for the
Eurosystem™s communication in 2002. Theseissues are dealt with in detail in the relevantchapters of this Annual Report. However,they are also mentioned in brief below to
give an overview of the communicationschallenges facing the Eurosystem in 2002.The ECB was proactive on some of theseissues, with a view to increasing the public™sknowledge of matters relating to the ECB™sfields of competence. For others, the ECB
responded to a demand for information from
the media, from specialised groups or from

the general public.Some of the most important communicationissues in 2002 were as follows:The monetary policy stance (see Chapter I).The introduction of euro banknotes andcoins on 1 January 2002. The Euro 2002Information Campaign was successfully
concluded in the second quarter of 2002(see Box 11).The Eurosystem™s role in the EU accession
process (see Chapter VI).Monetary policy operations (see Chapter II).Discussions on supervisory issues andfinancial stability at the European andinternational level (see Chapters V and IX).The structure of financial markets in theeuro area (see Chapters V and IX).Organisational matters of the ECB, in
particular the launch of an international
Box 11 Euro 2002 Information Campaign
The Eurosystem launched the Euro 2002 Information Campaign at the beginning of 2001. The purpose of thecampaign was to familiarise the public with the new currency and the modalities of the changeover to eurobanknotes and coins. The campaign was unprecedented in many ways. It deployed the same creative concept
and structure throughout the euro area in the 11 official Community languages. The campaign  also set out to
reach an  audience outside the euro area. A budget of 
80 million was set aside for the development andimplementation of the campaign. On top of this, the NCBs undertook complementary measures at the national
and, in some cases, also at the international level.The campaign strategy was based on five leading principles: co-operation with multipliers, feedback oninformation needs through research, interaction between the European and national levels, a multi-mediaapproach, and a multi-disciplinary approach (e.g. public relations, direct marketing, advertising and marketingcommunication).The mass media campaign was able to benefit from a number of media partnerships and preferential positionsin blocks (for television and radio) and magazines. The goal of the mass media campaign was thus attained,
namely to reach 80% of the population with each TV advertisement 2.5 times. In some countries, 90% of thepopulation was reached.Overall, the information campaign fulfilled its objectives extremely well. A quantitative research programmecarried out in several waves Œ the last one in February 2002 
Œ proved that knowledge of the visual appearance
of the euro banknotes and their security features gradually rose during the campaign and had reached a
satisfactory level in all countries by the time the euro banknotes and coins were brought into circulation.ECB  Annual Report

Parliament2.1Overview of relations between the
ECB and the European ParliamentIn line with the provisions of Article 113 (3)of the Treaty, the ECB continued its regularexchanges of views with the EuropeanParliament throughout 2002. As in past years,
the main forum for these exchanges of viewswere the quarterly testimonies by the
President of the ECB before the Committee
on Economic and Monetary Affairs. During
these testimonies, the President reported onthe decisions taken by the Governing Council
on monetary policy and in the other areas ofthe ECB™s competence, and subsequentlyanswered questions put by the Committee
members. The President also presented theECB™s Annual Report 2001 at the plenarysession of the European Parliament, which
held a general debate and passed a resolution.In addition to the quarterly appearances by
the ECB™s President, the Committee onEconomic and Monetary Affairs also invitedother members of the Executive Board to
exchange views on a number of issues. As in
previous years, the Vice-President presentedthe ECB™s Annual Report 2001 to theCommittee. Mr. Issing was invited toexchange views on the economicenvironment and the draft Broad Economic
Policy Guidelines, while Mr. Padoa-Schioppaparticipated in a hearing on financialsupervision in the EU, where he explained

the ECB™s views on EU structures for financialregulation, supervision and stability.Moreover, Mr. Padoa-Schioppa was invited
by the Committee to a hearing on thedevelopments of and new prospects forEuropean economic union.In addition to these public meetings, adelegation of members of the Committee onEconomic and Monetary Affairs visited the ECBfor informal discussions on a variety of issueswith the members of the Executive Board.Lastly, the European Parliament decided toamend its Rules of Procedures in order to
establish an internal procedure whereby all
its Members may submit, via the Chairman ofthe Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs, questions in writing to the ECB.
These, together with the ECB™s replies, aresubsequently published in the Official Journal
of the European Communities1. Even thoughneither the Treaty nor the Statute of theESCB contain any provisions or obligations inthis respect, the ECB has agreed to answer
such questions, insofar as they relate tothe fulfilment of the ECB™s mandate, on avoluntary basis, as it has already done in the
past. At the same time, the ECB emphasisedthat this should in no way lessen theimportance of the regular testimonies, where
the principal questions regarding the ECB™spolicy decisions should continue to bediscussed. Written answers to questions
asked by Members of the European
Parliament during the President™s testimoniesare published on the ECB™s website.2.2Views of the ECB on selected topics
raised at meetings with theEuropean ParliamentThe various exchanges of views between theEuropean Parliament and the ECB covered awide range of issues. While the assessment
of economic and monetary developments andthe conduct of the ECB™s monetary policy1The Official Journal of the European Communities has become,
as of the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, the Official
Journal of the European Union.177ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
were in the forefront of these exchanges,
Members of Parliament also asked questionspertaining to the other tasks which the Treaty
has conferred upon the Eurosystem.
The European Parliament addressed a number
of these issues in its resolution on the ECB
™sAnnual Report 2001, which was adopted atthe plenary session on 3 July. The following
sub-sections deal with some of the principal
issues raised in this resolution and recall theviews presented by the ECB.The euro cash changeover1 January 2002 saw the single currencybecome a tangible reality. On that day the
euro banknotes and coins became legal tenderthroughout the euro area and, thereby, avisible symbol of European identity. The ECB
reported extensively to the EuropeanParliament on the preparation andimplementation of this historic event, and in
its resolution on the ECB™s Annual Report2001 the European Parliament congratulatedthe Eurosystem for its ﬁbrilliantimplementation of the euro cash changeover
ﬂ.However, while underlining that the eurocould be expected to have a positive impacton consumer price developments bystimulating competition, the European
Parliament criticised abusive roundingpractices that had been observed in some
instances (in particular in the services sector).The ECB and the NCBs of the Eurosystemhave, since 2001, closely monitored and
analysed possible effects on pricedevelopments stemming from the euro cash
changeover. During his various appearances
before the European Parliament, thePresident explained that, although theperception of consumers may have been
different, the effects on inflation of theeuro cash changeover were in fact very
limited (see Chapter I).Accountability and transparency of the ECBAnother issue which was raised during these
exchanges of views was the accountability ofthe ECB. In its resolution on the ECB™sAnnual Report 2001, the European Parliament
suggested that minutes of the Governing
Council™s meetings should be published in theform of a summary of the arguments

discussed during the meetings shortly afterthe subsequent Governing Council meeting.Moreover, it proposed that such summary

minutes should indicate, in an anonymousway, the balance of votes and any dissentingopinion of Governing Council members.In response to these suggestions, thePresident explained that during the extensive
press conferences held immediately after thefirst meeting of the Governing Council everymonth, during which monetary policy
decisions are normally taken, as well as in itsMonthly Bulletin, the ECB provides an in-depth explanation of the reasons that
underpin the Governing Council™s decisions.Accordingly, the  reasoning of the GoverningCouncil is made available to the public at a
much earlier stage than would be the casefor formally adopted minutes.Furthermore, the President explained that theECB goes beyond the already stringentreporting requirements laid down in the
Treaty, and that through the comprehensivecommunication tools (see Section 1 of thischapter) already in use, the ECB has achieved
very high standards in terms of bothtransparency and accountability. Moreover,the choice not to publish detailed proceedings
is consistent with the Treaty, which stipulatesthat the proceedings of the meetings ofthe Governing Council should remain
confidential, while the Governing Council maydecide to make the outcome of itsdeliberations public.
With regard to the suggestions about thedisclosure of information on the voting
behaviour and individual views of themembers of the Governing Council, it shouldbe borne in mind that the ECB operates aECB  Annual Report 
 2002
178single monetary policy at the euro area level.Against this background, a procedurewhereby votes and individual opinions were
published (even anonymously) could lead toundue pressure to deviate from a euro areaperspective. Moreover, the Governing
Council acts as a collegiate body and iscollectively responsible for its decisions.Therefore, the ECB sees no merit in adopting
such suggestions and will adhere to its policyof presenting the relevant arguments in aclear, prompt and consistent way in order
to provide the necessary information forunderstanding the conduct of monetarypolicy.Finally, it may be added that the ECB™sreporting requirements, as laid down in the
Treaty, are broadly similar to those of othermajor central banks. The ECB also comparesfavourably in the international context as

regards the practices and proceduresestablished over the years for the fulfilmentof accountability obligations, notably its active

relations with the European Parliament.2Role of Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections and suggestions to publish a
euro area country-by-country reviewThe European Parliament™s resolution on theECB™s Annual Report 2001 also addressedthe issue of Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections. More specifically, the EuropeanParliament suggested that these projections
should give precise figures, rather than ranges,and be explicitly endorsed by the GoverningCouncil, whereby members who disagree
should have the possibility of noting theirdissent anonymously. Moreover, it suggestedthat the ECB should publish, on an annual

basis, a country-by-country review ofeconomic trends in the individual euro areaMember States.The President pointed out that Eurosystemstaff macroeconomic projections are an
important technical contribution to thedeliberations of the Governing Council, asthey help to summarise and assess the
implications of a large body of informationfor future inflation in a consistent way. Thisnotwithstanding, they by no means have an

all-encompassing role in the process ofmonetary policy formulation, but constituteone input, among others, with which to assess

the risks to price stability under the secondpillar. The projections are the result of
Eurosystem staff expertise and should, in the
interest of transparency, be kept separatefrom the analysis and final judgement of the
Governing Council regarding the overall
assessment of risks to price stability. Theranges used in the projections reflect thecomplexity and uncertainties of the projection
exercise and, more fundamentally, theeconomy itself.Considering suggestions that the ECB should
publish annual economic country-by-countryreviews, the allocation of tasks within the
Eurosystem has so far revealed no need toadopt such a practice. Macroeconomic andstructural developments in individual member
countries are, of course, followed in theEurosystem in order to enhance the overallunderstanding of the economic conditions
prevailing in the euro area. In this respect,the NCBs of the Eurosystem regularlymonitor and analyse these developments in
their respective countries. At the same time,given its mandate, it is necessary for the ECBto focus on euro area developments in its
monetary policy analysis.
Fiscal policies and the Stability and Growth
PactFiscal policies and the development ofbudgetary positions in Member States wereother issues that were frequently addressed
during the exchanges of views between theEuropean Parliament and the ECB. In thiscontext, Committee members also expressed

their views on the Stability and Growth Pactand on suggestions to modify its provisions.2For further details on these issues, see the articles in the
November 2002 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin entitledﬁThe accountability of the ECBﬂ and 
ﬁTransparency in themonetary policy of the ECBﬂ.179ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
The President took the occasion of his
testimonies to underline the Governing
Council™s view that the current fiscalframework, as laid down by the Treaty and
further developed by the Stability and GrowthPact, strikes the right balance between

discipline and flexibility. By prescribing amedium-term objective of budgetary
positions close to balance or in surplus, the

Stability and Growth Pact guarantees thatfiscal policies will preserve the sustainability
of public finances while providing sufficient
flexibility for automatic fiscal stabilisers tooperate. Moreover, a credible andenforceable institutional framework for the
conduct of fiscal policies in euro area
countries is a necessary complement to amonetary policy geared towards price
stability (see Chapters I and V).Sound fiscal policies that fostermacroeconomic stability are conducive togrowth in employment and real GDP. Full
compliance with the provisions of the Treatyand the Stability and Growth Pact is,therefore, in the interest of each individual
Member State.  Member States with remaining
imbalances should thus commit themselvesto a clear consolidation strategy to attain the
objectives agreed under the Stability andGrowth Pact within the shortest possible timeframe. In its resolution on the ECB™s AnnualReport 2001, the European Parliament alsounderlined that the Stability and Growth Pactis an essential element of the credibility of

the euro area and that the attainment of abalanced fiscal position is a prerequisite forletting automatic stabilisers work fully.

 2002
182183ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
1The Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks
The European System of Central Banks(ESCB) is composed of the European Central
Bank (ECB) and the national central banks
(NCBs) of all 15 EU Member States, i.e. itincludes the three NCBs of the Member
States which have not yet adopted the euro.In order to enhance transparency andfacilitate understanding of the structure of

central banking in the euro area, theGoverning Council has adopted the termﬁEurosystemﬂ which comprises the ECB and
the NCBs of the Member States which haveadopted the euro. As long as there areMember States which have not yet adopted
the euro, it will be necessary to make adistinction between the Eurosystem and theESCB.The ECB has legal personality under publicinternational law. It was established as the
core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB andensures that their respective tasks are carriedout either through its own activities or viathe NCBs. While decision-making within the
Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised, the
ECB, in taking its decisions on the way inwhich the above tasks should be carried
out, is committed to the principle of
decentralisation in accordance with theStatute of the ESCB.Each of the NCBs has legal personalityaccording to the national law of its respectivecountry. The euro area NCBs, which form an

integral part of the Eurosystem, carry out thetasks conferred upon the Eurosystem inaccordance with the rules established by the
ECB™s decision-making bodies. The NCBs alsocontribute to the work of the ESCB throughtheir participation in the various ESCB
Committees (see Section 5 of this chapter).
They may perform non-Eurosystem functionson their own responsibility, unless the
Governing Council finds that such functionsinterfere with the objectives and tasks of theEurosystem.

1842The decision-making bodies of the ECB
The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governedby the decision-making bodies of the ECB:the Governing Council and the ExecutiveBoard. The General Council is constituted as
a third decision-making body of the ECB, ifand for as long as there are Member Stateswhich have not yet adopted the euro. The

functioning of the decision-making bodies isgoverned by the Treaty establishing theEuropean Community, the Statute of the
ESCB and the relevant Rules of Procedure. 12.1The Governing Council
The Governing Council comprises all themembers of the Executive Board and thegovernors of the NCBs of the Member Stateswhich have adopted the euro. According to
the Treaty, its main responsibilities are:to adopt the guidelines and take the
decisions necessary to ensure theperformance of the tasks entrusted to the
Eurosystem; andto formulate the monetary policy of the

euro area, including, as appropriate,
decisions relating to intermediatemonetary objectives, key interest rates andthe supply of reserves in the Eurosystem,
and to establish the necessary guidelinesfor their implementation.The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twicea month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurtam Main, Germany. It conducts an in-depth

assessment of monetary and economicdevelopments and takes related decisionsspecifically at its first meeting in the month,
while the second meeting usually focuses onissues related to other tasks andresponsibilities of the ECB and the
Eurosystem. In 2002, one meeting was heldby means of a teleconference and twomeetings were held outside Frankfurt: one
was hosted by De Nederlandsche Bank inMaastricht and one by the Banque centraledu Luxembourg in Luxembourg.When taking decisions on monetary policyand on other tasks of the Eurosystem, themembers of the Governing Council do notact as national representatives, but in a fully
independent personal capacity. This isreflected by the principle of ﬁone member,one voteﬂ applied within the Council.
In December 2002 the Governing Councildecided unanimously on the contents of its
proposal on the future adjustment of its
voting modalities. Such an adjustment willbecome necessary in order to maintain the
Governing Council™s capacity for efficient andtimely decision-making in an enlarged euroarea. The proposal was made in accordance
with the ECB ﬁenabling clauseﬂ contained in
the Treaty of Nice (see Chapter VI).Following the entry into force of the Treaty
of Nice on 1 February 2003, the ECB formally
adopted a Recommendation on theadjustment of the voting modalities in the
Governing Council.According to the Recommendation, allmembers of the Governing Council would
continue to attend meetings and participatein the deliberations in a personal and
independent capacity. However, the numberof NCB governors holding a voting rightwould not exceed 15. The 15 voting rights
would rotate among the governors accordingto pre-established rules. The six members ofthe Executive Board would maintain a
permanent voting right. In order to ensurethat at any particular time the governorshaving a voting right are from member countries1The various Rules of Procedure have been published in the
Official Journal of the European Communities. See Rules of

Procedure of the European Central Bank, OJ L 125, 19.5.1999,
p. 34 and L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 32; Rules of Procedure of
the General Council of the ECB, OJ L 75, 20.3.1999, p. 36 and
L 156, 23.6.1999, p. 52; Decision of the European Central
Bank of 12 October 1999 concerning the Rules of Procedure
of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB/
1999/7), OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 34. With the exception of the

latter, these rules have been reproduced in the ECB publication

which, taken together, are representative ofthe euro area economy as a whole, theywould have the voting right with different
frequencies. However, this differentiationbetween governors would apply exclusivelyto the prior determination of the frequency

with which each governor has a voting right.For all governors having a voting right at anypoint in time, the ﬁone member, one voteﬂprinciple would apply.NCB governors would be allocated todifferent groups, according to a ranking of
the relative size of the economies of their
respective member countries. The rotation
system would start operating with two groups
once the number of euro area countriesexceeds 15. When there are 22 euro areacountries, a rotation system based on threegroups would start operating. The rotation

would be robust and automatic in that the
size of the groups and the NCB governors
™voting frequencies would be adjusted over
time so as to accommodate any sequencingof euro area enlargement up to 27 membercountries, i.e. the current EU Member States

and the 12 accession countries listed in theDeclaration on the enlargement of theEuropean Union annexed to the Treaty of
Nice. Precise implementing provisions wouldbe determined by the Governing Council,deciding by a two-thirds majority of all its

members.ECB  Annual Report

The General Council is composed of thePresident and the Vice-President of the ECB
and the governors of all 15 EU NCBs. Itcarries out those tasks taken over from the
European Monetary Institute which still have
to be performed by the ECB on account ofthe fact that not all the Member States haveadopted the euro. In 2002 the General
Council met five times. One of these meetingswas held by means of a teleconference. The
General Council has decided that, as soon asthe Accession Treaty has been signed withthe relevant EU candidate countries, their
respective central bank governors will beinvited to attend the meetings of the GeneralCouncil in an observer capacity.

providing guidance on some aspects ofprofessional conduct. This code complementsthe Code of Conduct of the European Central
Bank which gives guidance to, and sets
benchmarks for, the staff of the ECB and themembers of the Executive Board, all of whom
are encouraged to maintain high standards of
professional ethics in the performance oftheir duties.4The ECB has detailed rules preventing the
abuse of sensitive financial market information(ﬁinsider trading rulesﬂ). The staff of the ECBand the members of the Executive Board arethereby prohibited from taking advantage,
whether directly or indirectly, of inside
information to which they have access whenconducting private financial activities at theirown risk and for their own account, or at the

risk and for the account of a third party.
5 An
Ethics Adviser appointed by the ExecutiveBoard ensures a consistent interpretation of
these rules.The budgetary authority of the ECB is vestedin the Governing Council, which adopts thebudget of the ECB, acting on a proposal put
forward by the Executive Board. The Budget
Committee, which was established underArticle 15 of the Rules of Procedure of theECB, assists the Governing Council in matters
related to the ECB™s budget. It is composedof representatives of the Eurosystem centralbanks. The chairperson of the Committee is
Liam Barron.In order to join the efforts of the institutionsof the European Communities and theMember States to combat fraud and otherillegal activities, the original layers of control2See the ECB Audit Charter on the ECB

In addition to the decision-making bodies
described in Section 2, the corporate
governance of the ECB also encompasses anumber of external and internal control layers.The Statute of the ESCB provides for twolayers, namely the external auditor, whichaudits the annual accounts of the ECB

(Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), and
the European Court of Auditors, whichexamines the operational efficiency of the

management of the ECB (Article 27.2).The Directorate Internal Audit performs
audit missions under the responsibility of theExecutive Board. Its mandate is defined inthe ECB Audit Charter.2 Furthermore, the
Internal Auditors Committee is responsiblefor audit missions under a mandate from theGoverning Council to ensure audit coverage
for joint projects and joint operationalsystems at the ESCB level.The internal control structure of the ECB isbased on a functional approach, whereby eachorganisational unit (Division, Directorate or

Directorate General) is responsible for itsown internal control and efficiency. Inperforming this task, organisational units
implement a set of operational controlprocedures within their area of responsibility.For example, a system of 
ﬁChinese walls
ﬂ is
in place in the Directorate GeneralOperations. In addition to these controls,
the Directorate Planning and Controlling and
the Risk Management Division advise andmake proposals to the Executive Board onspecific control issues affecting the
organisation as a whole.In May 2002, the members of the GoverningCouncil agreed upon a Code of Conduct forthemselves, which reflects their responsibilityto safeguard the integrity and reputation of
the Eurosystem and to maintain theeffectiveness of its operations.3 The
Governing Council has appointed an adviser,191ECB  Annual Report

OJ L 314, 8.12.1999, p. 32.within the ECB have been enhanced with anindependent Anti-Fraud Committee set upon the basis of the ECB Decision on fraud
prevention.6 The Anti-Fraud Committee,
which held two meetings in 2002, is keptregularly informed by the Directorate
Internal Audit of all issues related to theperformance of its tasks. The Governing
Council has decided to extend the initial
three-year terms of office of the currentCommittee members.
3.2Human resources management
StaffingAt the end of 2002, the number of staff
employed by the ECB was 1,109 (1,105.5 full-time equivalent positions) compared with1,043 in 2001, with a total of 1,172.5 budgeted
staff positions (full-time equivalent). The staffbudget for 2003 has been set at a maximumof 1,263.5 full-time equivalent positions,
representing a 7.8% increase over 2002.In 2002 the ECB provided traineeships to
135 students and graduates, mainly with aneconomics background, for an averageduration of four months. In addition, 44 staff
from EU and accession country central bankscame to the ECB for periods of approximatelyfour months on average.Within the Research Visitors Programme, whichfocuses on specific high-level research
projects in the field of monetary policy,20 research visitors were welcomed in 2002.The Graduate Research Programme, which isaimed at highly talented research students atan advanced stage of their doctoral studies,
attracted 12 participants for an average
duration of three months.The External Work Experience Scheme wasintroduced in January 2003. This scheme will
allow ECB staff to gain work experience atcentral banks inside and outside the ESCB or
at European or international organisations,thereby fostering ties between the ECB andits counterparts.Human resources policiesThe method by which the salaries of ECBstaff are annually adjusted 
Œ the General SalaryAdjustment Œ was reviewed and a revised
methodology was put in place with effect
from 1 July 2002. The main element of
the new methodology, which will apply forthree years, remained the adjustment of
salaries in line with a weighted average ofpay settlements at a group of comparatororganisations, now including, in addition to
the NCBs and the Bank for InternationalSettlements, certain Europe-based internationaland supranational institutions.The ECB has appointed an independent SocialCounsellor to provide confidential counselling
to staff members on work-related mattersand to mediate in interpersonal conflicts atthe workplace. The ECB also appointed an
independent Equal Opportunities Adviser to
provide advice on issues related to equalopportunities in the broadest sense, i.e. with
regard to gender, nationality, age, etc.Childcare facilities and the EuropeanSchoolThe ECB childcare facilities have beenenlarged, with the addition of a second
permanent facility, and now offer a total
number of 123 places for children aged mainlybetween three months and three years.However, in view of the continuous high
demand for places, the preparations for theacquisition of a third facility have already started.The European School Frankfurt opened inSeptember 2002 for its first school year,
with five grades at primary level and two
grades at pre-school level. After initially beingaccommodated in provisional facilities, thepupils moved to the new school building at

the beginning of 2003. The school has fourECB  Annual Report

were held in 2002. As in past years, issues
related to banknotes, payment systems andprudential supervision were discussed. The
views of the European trade unionfederations and the 31 employeerepresentatives participating in the Dialogue
were conveyed to the Governing and GeneralCouncils. A proposal from the threeEuropean trade union federations to includeemployee representatives from the accession
country central banks with observer statuswas accepted and will take effect from thesigning of the Accession Treaty.
5ESCB Committees
The ESCB Committees have continued to play
an important role in the performance of the

tasks of the Eurosystem/ESCB. At the requestof both the Governing Council and theExecutive Board, the ESCB Committees have
provided expertise in their fields ofcompetence and have facilitated the decision-making process. Participation in the ESCB
Committees is usually restricted torepresentatives of the Eurosystem centralbanks. However, the NCBs of the MemberStates which have not yet adopted the euro
take part in the meetings of an ESCB
Committee whenever it deals with mattersthat fall within the field of competence of theGeneral Council. Where appropriate, other
competent bodies may also be invited, suchas national supervisory authorities in the caseof the Banking Supervision Committee. At
present there are 12 ESCB Committees, allof which were established under Article 9 ofthe Rules of Procedure of the ECB.

1The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in a
Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 5 December
2002 (ECB/2002/11), OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, pp. 38-59. The
Decision entered into force on 1 January 2003 but also applies
to the drawing-up of the annual balance sheet and profit and
loss account of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2002.
The revisions to the accounting policies of previous years are not
significant.Accounting policies1Form and presentation of the financial
statementsThe financial statements of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) have been designed topresent fairly the financial position of the
ECB and the results of its operations. They
have been drawn up in accordance with thefollowing accounting policies, which theGoverning Council of the ECB considers to
be appropriate to the function of a central
bank. These policies are consistent with theprovisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of
the ESCB, which require a standardised
approach to the rules governing theaccounting and reporting of operations of

the Eurosystem.Accounting principlesThe following accounting principles have beenapplied: economic reality and transparency,prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet
events, materiality, the accruals principle,
going concern and consistency andcomparability.Basis of accountingThe accounts have been prepared on ahistorical cost basis, modified to includemarket valuation of marketable securities,
gold and all other on-balance-sheet andoff-balance-sheet assets and liabilitiesdenominated in foreign currency.
Transactions in financial assets and liabilitiesare reflected in the accounts on the basis ofthe date on which they are settled.Gold and foreign currency assets andliabilitiesAssets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrency are converted into euro at theexchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet
date. Income and expenses are converted atthe exchange rate prevailing at the time ofthe transaction. The revaluation of foreignexchange assets and liabilities is performedon a currency-by-currency basis, including
on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheetinstruments.Revaluation to the market price for assetsand liabilities denominated in foreign currencyis treated separately from the exchange rate
revaluation.No distinction is made between the price
and currency revaluation differences for gold.Instead, a single gold valuation is accountedfor on the basis of the price in euro per fine
ounce of gold, which is derived from the
exchange rate of the euro against the USdollar on 31 December 2002.SecuritiesAll marketable debt securities and similarassets are valued at the mid-market prices
prevailing at the balance sheet date. For theyear ending 31 December 2002, mid-marketprices on 30 December 2002 were used.
Non-marketable securities are valued at cost.Income recognitionIncome and expenses are recognised in theperiod in which they are earned or incurred.Realised gains and losses are taken to theprofit and loss account. An average cost

method is used on a daily basis to calculatethe acquisition cost of individual items. In theevent of an unrealised loss on any item at the
year-end, the average cost of that item is2
2022TARGET is the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross
settlement Express Transfer system (see also Chapter VIII).reduced to the end-of-year exchange rateand/or market price.Unrealised gains are not recognised asincome, but are transferred directly to arevaluation account.Unrealised losses are taken to the profit and
loss account if they exceed previous
revaluation gains registered in thecorresponding revaluation account.Unrealised losses in any one security or
currency or in gold are not netted againstunrealised gains in other securities, currenciesor gold.Premiums or discounts arising on purchasedsecurities are calculated and presented as part
of interest income and are amortised overthe remaining life of the assets.Reverse transactionsReverse transactions conducted underrepurchase agreements are recorded in thebalance sheet as collateralised inward
deposits. The balance sheet shows thedeposits and the value of the securities usedas collateral. Securities sold under this type
of agreement remain on the balance sheet of
the ECB and are treated as if they hadremained part of the portfolio from which
they were sold. Agreements involvingsecurities denominated in foreign currencyhave no effect on the average cost of the

currency position.Reverse transactions conducted underreverse repurchase agreements are recordedas collateralised loans on the assets side ofthe balance sheet, for the value of the loan.
Securities acquired under this type ofagreement are not revalued.Reverse transactions (including securitylending transactions) conducted under anautomated security lending programme are
recorded with effect on the balance sheet forsuch transactions only where collateral isprovided by the borrower in the form ofcash over the maturity of the operation. In
2002, the ECB did not receive any collateralin the form of cash over the maturity of such
an operation.Off-balance-sheet instrumentsCurrency instruments, namely foreign
exchange forward transactions, forward legsof foreign exchange swaps and other currency
instruments involving an exchange of one
currency for another at a future date, areincluded in the net foreign currency positionfor the purpose of calculating foreign
exchange gains and losses. Interest rateinstruments are revalued on an item-by-itembasis. Interest rate futures are recorded on
the trade date in off-balance-sheet accounts.Daily changes in the variation margin arerecorded on balance sheet. Unrealised losses
taken to the profit and loss account at theyear-end are not reversed in subsequentyears against unrealised profits, unless the

instrument is closed out or terminated.Post-balance-sheet eventsAssets and liabilities are adjusted for events
that occur between the annual balance sheetdate and the date on which the GoverningCouncil of the ECB approves the financial
statements if such events materially affect thecondition of assets and liabilities at thebalance sheet date.Intra-ESCB balancesIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-bordertransactions that occur between two EU
central banks. These transactions areprimarily processed via TARGET2 and give
rise to bilateral balances in accounts held
between those EU central banks connected
to TARGET. These bilateral balances arenovated to the ECB daily, leaving each NCB2032

with a single net bilateral position vis-à-visthe ECB only. This position in the books ofthe ECB represents the net claim or liability
of each NCB against the rest of the ESCB.Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBswith the ECB (except for the capital of theECB and positions resulting from the transfer
of foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are
described as intra-Eurosystem claims orliabilities and are presented in the balance
sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or
liability position.Intra-ESCB balances arising from the
allocation of euro banknotes within theEurosystem are included as a single net assetunder ﬁClaims related to the allocation ofeuro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see
ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies).Intra-ESCB balances of the non-euro area
NCBs with the ECB are disclosed under

ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area residentsdenominated in euroﬂ.Treatment of tangible and intangiblefixed assetsTangible fixed assets, with the exception ofland, are valued at cost less depreciation.

Land is valued at cost. Depreciation iscalculated on a straight-line basis, beginningin the quarter after acquisition and continuing
over the expected economic lifetime of theasset, namely:Computers, related hardware and

software, and motor vehicles: four years;
Equipment, furniture and plant in building:ten years;Building and capitalised refurbishment
expenditure: twenty-five years.In the case of building and capitalisedrefurbishment expenditure relating to the
ECB™s existing premises, the depreciationperiod has been reduced in order to ensurethat these assets are completely written offby the end of 2008, at which date the ECB isexpected to have moved to its final location.
This change will affect the annual accounts
mainly from 2003 onwards.Fixed assets costing less than 10,000 arewritten off in the year of purchase.
The ECB™s retirement planThe ECB operates a defined contributionpension scheme. The assets of the plan, which
exist solely for the purpose of providingbenefits for members of the plan and their
dependants, are included in the other assets
of the ECB and are identified separately.
Valuation gains and losses arising on the
assets of the pension fund are recognised asincome and expenditure of the retirementplan in the year in which they arise. The
benefits payable from the core benefit
account, resulting from the contributions of
the ECB, have minimum guarantees
underpinning the defined contributionbenefits.Banknotes in circulationThe ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs, whichtogether comprise the Eurosystem, haveissued euro banknotes as from 1 January

2002.3 The total value of euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated on the last workingday of each month in accordance with the
banknote allocation key.4The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of
the total value of euro banknotes incirculation, which is disclosed under thebalance sheet liability item ﬁBanknotes incirculationﬂ. The ECB™s share of the totaleuro banknote issue is backed by claims on2
204the NCBs. These claims, which bear interest5,are disclosed under the sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims related to the
allocation of euro banknotes within theEurosystemﬂ (see 
ﬁIntra-ESCB balancesﬂ in
the notes on accounting policies). Interest
income on these claims is included within theitem ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ. The GoverningCouncil has decided that this income shall be
distributed separately to the NCBs in the
form of an interim distribution.6 It will be
distributed in full unless the ECB™s net profitfor the year is less than its income earned oneuro banknotes in circulation, and subject toany decision by the Governing Council to
reduce this income in respect of costsincurred by the ECB in connection with the
issue and handling of euro banknotes. For
2002, one interim distribution was made onthe second working day of 2003. From 2003onwards, interim distributions will be made
after the end of each quarter.

cash flow statement would not provide the5ECB Decision of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of monetary

Notes on the Balance Sheet1Gold and gold receivables
The ECB holds 24.7 million ounces of fine
gold (2001: 24.7 million ounces). No
transactions in gold took place in 2002. Thebalance sheet movement is due to thequarterly revaluation process (see ﬁGold andforeign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in the
notes on accounting policies).2Claims on non-euro area and euro area
residents denominated in foreign
currencyReceivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB™s holdingsof Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as at
31 December 2002. It arises as the result of atwo-way SDR buying and selling arrangementwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
whereby the IMF is authorised to arrange salesor purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf ofthe ECB, within minimum and maximum holding
levels. The SDR is defined in terms of a basket ofcurrencies. Its value is determined as theweighted sum of exchange rates of the four
major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, poundsterling and US dollar). For accounting purposes,SDRs are treated as a foreign currency asset (see
ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂin the notes on accounting policies).Balances with banks and security investments,external loans and other external assetsClaims on euro area residents denominated in
foreign currencyThese claims consist of balances with foreign
banks, loans denominated in foreign currency
and investments in securities, denominated inUS dollar and Japanese yen.3Claims on non-euro area residents
denominated in euroAs at 31 December 2002, this claim consisted
of bank deposits with non-euro area residents.4Securities of euro area residents
denominated in euro
All securities of euro area residentsdenominated in euro held by the ECB are a
direct counterpart to the capital and reservesof the ECB. The ECB has decided to reclassify
these holdings as a dedicated portfolio, which isnow included under the heading ﬁOther financialassetsﬂ. The comparable balance as at 31December 2001 has been adjusted accordingly.5Intra-Eurosystem claims

The principal increase, under the headingﬁLand and buildingsﬂ, relates to capitalised
costs of the ECB
™s installations at both itssites, the Eurotower and Eurotheum.Other financial assets
The main components of this item are asfollows:(a)Securities of euro area residents
denominated in euro, valued at 5.4billion (2001: 4.4 billion Œ see note 4).
(b)The investment portfolios relating to the
ECB pension fund, which are valued at
61.9 million (2001: 53.9 million). Theassets held represent the investments of
accumulated pension contributions by theECB and the staff of the ECB as at31 December 2002, and are managed by
an external fund manager. The regularcontributions of the ECB and membersof the plan have been invested on a
monthly basis. The assets of the plan arenot fungible with other financial assets ofthe ECB, and net income thereon does
not constitute income of the ECB, but isreinvested in the funds concerned,pending payment of benefits. The valueof the assets held by the plan is based ona valuation by the external fund manager,using year-end market prices.(c)The ECB holds 3,000 shares in the Bank
for International Settlements which are
included at the acquisition cost of 38.5million.Accruals and prepaid expensesThis position includes accrued interest of
727 million on the ECB™s claims related tothe allocation of euro banknotes within the
Eurosystem (see ﬁBanknotes in circulation
ﬂin the notes on accounting policies). The
remainder of this balance consists principally
of accrued interest on securities and otherfinancial assets.SundryThe increase in this position in 2002 isprimarily due to the accrued interimdistribution of the ECB™s income derived frombanknotes (see ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in
the notes on accounting policies, and note 5above).7Banknotes in circulation

9Liabilities to non-euro area residents
denominated in euroThese liabilities principally represent balances
held at the ECB by non-euro area NCBsarising from transactions processed via the

TARGET system (see 
ﬁIntra-ESCB balancesﬂin the notes on accounting policies).10Liabilities to euro area and non-euro
area residents denominated in foreign
currencyThese liabilities arise from repurchaseagreements conducted with euro area andnon-euro area residents in connection withthe management of the foreign currency
reserves of the ECB.11Intra-Eurosystem liabilities
These represent the liabilities to euro areaNCBs that arose from the transfer of foreignreserve assets to the ECB. The originalliabilities were denominated in euro on a fixed
basis determined by the value of the assets atthe time of their transfer, and areremunerated at the latest available marginal
rate for the Eurosystem™s main refinancingoperations, adjusted to reflect a zero return
on the gold component (see the ﬁNotes onthe Profit and Loss Accountﬂ, note 19).12Other liabilities
This item consists mainly of interest due to theNCBs in respect of their claims relating to the
foreign reserves transferred (see note 11). The
ECB™s liabilities in respect of the pension fundof 61.9 million (2001: 53.9 million) and otheraccruals are also shown under this item.13Provisions
Taking into account the ECB™s large exposureto exchange rate and interest rate risk, andthe size of its revaluation reserves, a general
provision against these risks was made. Thesize and continuing requirement for this
provision is reviewed annually, based on the

ECB™s assessment of its future exposure toexchange rate and interest rate risk.This position also includes administrative
provisions relating to expenditure on goodsand services, together with an appropriate
provision against the contractual obligation
of the ECB to restore its current premises totheir original condition when they are vacated
and the ECB moves to its final site.
14Revaluation accounts
These accounts represent revaluation
reserves arising from unrealised gains onassets and liabilities. The reduction in thesebalances is primarily due to the depreciation
of the US dollar vis-à-vis the euro (see ﬁGoldand foreign currency assets and liabilitiesﬂ in
the notes on accounting policies).20022001

Notes on the Profit and Loss Account19Net interest income
Interest income on foreign reserve assetsThis item includes interest income, net ofinterest expense, in respect of the assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency, as

follows:Interest income arising from the allocation ofeuro banknotes within the EurosystemThis item consists of the interest income of
the ECB relating to its 8% share in the total
euro banknote issue (see ﬁBanknotes incirculationﬂ in the notes on accounting
policies). Interest on the claims of the ECB inrespect of its share of banknotes is earned atthe latest available marginal rate for the
Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations.Remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of
foreign reserves transferredRemuneration paid to euro area NCBs on
their claims on the ECB in respect of theforeign reserve assets transferred underArticle 30.1 of the Statute of the ESCB is

disclosed under this item.Other interest income and Other interest expense
These positions include interest income andexpenses on balances arising from TARGET
and in respect of other assets and liabilitiesdenominated in euro.Excluding ﬁInterest income arising from theallocation of euro banknotes within theEurosystemﬂ, net interest income has decreasedcompared with 2001, primarily due to the declinein US dollar and euro interest rates during the year.
20Realised gains/losses arising from
financial operations
Net realised gains arose on sales of securitiesas a result of normal portfolio managementtransactions. In 2002, there were no major

outflows of foreign currencies.21Write-downs on financial assets and
positionsThis expense is due almost entirely to the
write-down of the acquisition cost of the
ECB™s Japanese yen and SDR holdings to theirend-of-year exchange rate as at 31 December2002, following the depreciation of thesecurrencies against the euro over the year

(see ﬁIncome recognitionﬂ in the notes on
accounting policies).22Net (expense)/income from fees and
commissionsThis item consists of the following incomeand expenses. Income arose from penalties
imposed on credit institutions for non-compliance with the minimum reserverequirements.20022001
Income from fees and
commissions634,241931,206
Expenses relating to fees
and commissions(861,399)(633,086)
Net (expense)/incomefrom fees and commissions(227,158)298,120
23Other
 incomeOther miscellaneous income during the yeararose principally from the transfer of unused2112
administrative provisions to the profit andloss account.24Staff costs
Salaries and allowances of 92.6 million(2001: 82.4 million) and employer™scontributions to the ECB™s pension fund andto health and accident insurance are included
under this heading. The emoluments of the
Executive Board of the ECB amounted to a
total of 2 million (2001: 1.9 million). Nopensions were paid to former members ofthe Executive Board or their dependants
during the year. Salaries and allowances,including the emoluments of holders of seniormanagement positions, are modelled in

essence on, and are comparable with, theremuneration scheme of the EuropeanCommunities.At the end of 2002, the ECB employed 1,105staff, of whom 79 held managerial positions.
The average number of staff employed by theECB in 2002 was 1,080, compared with 997in 2001. 113 additional staff were employed
during the period, and 51 members of staffleft the service of the ECB.25The ECB
™s retirement planIn accordance with the rules of the ECB™splan, a triennial full actuarial valuation isrequired. The latest actuarial valuation was
carried out as at 31 December 2001, usingthe Projected Unit Credit Method, subject to
minimum liabilities equal to cash lump sums
that would be payable to members ontermination of service.The pension cost relating to the plan is
assessed in accordance with the advice of aqualified actuary. The total pension cost to
the ECB including a provision for disabilityand post-retirement benefits was 
27.4million (2001: 14.9 million). This costincludes a provision for pensions to members
of the Executive Board of 2.1 million(2001: 0.7 million) and any supplementarycontributions. Based on the actuary™s findings,the ECB made a supplementary contribution
of 10.5 million in 2002. The required rateof future service contributions by the ECB is16.5% of pensionable earnings of all staff.26Administrative expenses
These cover all other current expensesrelating to rental and maintenance of

premises, goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, professional fees and otherservices and supplies, together with staff-
related expenses including recruitment,relocation, installation, training and
resettlement.The net decrease in administrativeexpenditure compared with 2001 is primarily
due to the fact that in that year additionalconsultancy fees were incurred in connectionwith the Euro 2002 Information Campaign.27Banknote production services
In 2001, costs relating to the production ofa contingency stock of euro banknotes for
the Eurosystem in connection with thechangeover process were capitalised pendingthe allocation of that stock to the NCBs at
cost as required. Following a decision of theGoverning Council of the ECB after thechangeover that the remaining stock of
banknotes should constitute the nucleus of astrategic stock of the Eurosystem, thesecosts, together with similar costs incurred in
2002, have now been expensed. Theremaining costs of establishing theEurosystem strategic stock were borne
directly by the NCBs.The Governing Council decided that theECB™s interim distribution of income arisingfrom the allocation of euro banknotes within
the Eurosystem should be reduced by the

amount of this expense.

that the minimum bid rate on the main
refinancing operations and the interest rateson the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility will remain unchanged at
3.25%, 4.25% and 2.25% respectively.
The Governing Council also decides on an
allotment amount of 20 billion peroperation for the longer-term refinancingoperations to be conducted in 2002. This

amount takes into consideration the expectedliquidity needs of the euro area bankingsystem in 2002 and the desire of the
Eurosystem to continue to provide the bulkof refinancing of the financial sector throughits main refinancing operations. The
Governing Council may adjust the allotmentamount in the course of the year in the eventof unexpected developments in liquidity
needs.7 February, 7 March, 4 April, 2 May,6 June, 4 July 2002The Governing Council of the ECB decides

the longer-term refinancing operations to beconducted in the second half of 2002 from20 billion to 15 billion. This latter amounttakes into consideration the expectedliquidity needs of the euro area bankingsystem in the second half of 2002 and reflects

the desire of the Eurosystem to continue to
provide the bulk of liquidity through its mainrefinancing operations.1 August, 12 September, 10 October,7 November 2002The Governing Council of the ECB decides
that the minimum bid rate on the mainrefinancing operations and the interest rateson the marginal lending facility and the

5 December 2002The Governing Council of the ECB decides
to lower the minimum bid rate on the main
refinancing operations by 0.50 percentage
point to 2.75%, starting from the operationto be settled on 11 December 2002. It also
decides to lower the interest rates on both
the marginal lending facility and the depositfacility by 0.50 percentage point, to 3.75%and 1.75% respectively, both with effect from
6 December 2002.In addition, it decides that the reference valuefor the annual growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3 will remain at 4½%.9 January 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides
that the minimum bid rate on the mainrefinancing operations and the interest rates
on the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility will remain unchanged at2.75%, 3.75% and 1.75% respectively.
23 January 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides
to implement the following two measures to1The chronology of monetary policy measures of the Eurosystem
taken in 1999 to 2001 can be found on pages 176 to 180 of
the ECB™s Annual Report 1999, on pages 205 to 208 of theECB™s Annual Report 2000 and on pages 219 to 220 of the
ECB™s Annual Report 2001 respectively.235ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
improve the operational framework formonetary policy:First, the timing of the reserve maintenanceperiod will be changed so that it will alwaysstart on the settlement day of the main
refinancing operation (MRO) following theGoverning Council meeting at which themonthly assessment of the monetary policy
stance is pre-scheduled. Furthermore, as arule, the implementation of changes to thestanding facility rates will be aligned with the
start of the new reserve maintenance period.
Secondly, the maturity of the MROs will beshortened from two weeks to one week.
These measures are scheduled to come intoeffect during the first quarter of 2004.Further to the press release of 10 July 2002,the Governing Council also decides tomaintain at 15 billion the allotment amountfor each of the longer-term refinancing
operations to be conducted in the year 2003.This amount takes into consideration theexpected liquidity needs of the euro area
banking system in 2003 and reflects the desire
of the Eurosystem to continue to provide thebulk of liquidity through its main refinancingoperations.6 February 2003The Governing Council of the ECB decides
that the minimum bid rate on the main
refinancing operations and the interest rateson the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility will remain unchanged at
2.75%, 3.75% and 1.75% respectively.

236GlossaryAccounting Regulatory Committee (ARC): established to assist the 
EuropeanCommission (Commission of the European Communities)
 in the endorsement of
International Accounting Standards (IAS) which, as from 2005, will form the basis for
the consolidated financial statements of companies listed on a European stock exchange.Asset allocation: the process of distributing investment funds over different asset classes toachieve goals such as optimising portfolio risk/return characteristics.Accession countries: there are currently 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and inthe Mediterranean which are recognised by the European Council as candidates for accession
to the European Union (EU). The following ten countries have been invited to join the EU on1 May 2004, following the signature and subsequent ratification of the Accession Treaty: theCzech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and

Slovakia. Two other countries, Bulgaria and Romania, have already entered into accession
negotiations and have been given the prospect of entry into the EU in 2007. Turkey is also anofficial candidate for accession and is included in the Economic Dialogue with the EU, but it
has not yet started accession negotiations. When referring to accession countries, this Annual
Report refers to the 12 countries with which negotiations for EU membership have beencompleted or are still ongoing.Acquis communautaire: term commonly used to refer to all Community law including EU
treaties, regulations and directives. Countries joining the EU must have implemented the
existing acquis communautaire by the time of accession.
Back testing: the analysis of how an investment strategy would have performed if an
investor had used it over a specific past period of time.Benchmark: in relation to investments, a benchmark is a reference portfolio or index
constructed on the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the returnon, the investments. The benchmark serves as a basis for comparison of the performance ofthe actual portfolio. In the context of the foreign reserve management of the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB), the strategic benchmark is a reference portfolio reflecting the long-
term risk/return preferences of the ECB. Its characteristics are amended only in exceptionalcircumstances. The tactical benchmark reflects the risk/return preferences of the ECB with a

time horizon of a few months, based on prevailing market conditions. It is reviewed on amonthly basis.Bond market: the market on which longer-term 
debt securities, i.e. debt securities withan original maturity of more than one year, are issued and traded.
Cash-recycling machine: a stand-alone, customer-operated device capable of receiving,processing and dispensing banknotes, i.e. providing the cash withdrawal functions of a standardautomated teller machine together with a banknote depositing function.Central government: the government as defined in the 
European System of Accounts
1995 (ESA 95) but excluding state and local governments (see 
general government). Sub-sector of the ESA 95 including all administrative departments of the state and other centralagencies whose competence normally extends over the entire economic domain except forthe administration of social security funds.237ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Chinese wall: a set of rules and procedures established to prevent inside information, forinstance originating from the areas responsible for monetary policy implementation, fromreaching the areas responsible for portfolio management. It aims at preventing any misuse of
inside information or any situation which could lead to suspicion of such misuse, whetherjustified or not.Collateral: assets pledged (e.g. by 
credit institutions with central banks) as a guarantee for
the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. to central banks by credit institutions) aspart of repurchase agreements.Comitology: generally refers to the procedures governing the relations between the
European Commission (Commission of the European Communities) and the
committees which assist the Commission in the exercise of implementing powers ofCommunity law conferred by the EU Council. The different modalities of committeeprocedures are set out in the Council Decision of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures
for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (1999/468/EC). The
term also refers, more specifically, to the procedures for the adoption of Level 2 legislationwithin the Lamfalussy framework, as proposed by the Committee of Wise Men on the

Regulation of European Securities Markets, according to which the Commission must submitto a regulatory committee draft measures implementing technical details of Level 1 legislation.Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB):
the forum for the co-ordination of statisticians from the national statistical institutes and
Eurostat on the one hand, and the national central banks and the 
European Central Bank
(ECB) on the other. The CMFB was created by Council Decision 91/115/EEC (OJ L 59,
6.3.1991, p. 19), amended by Council Decision 96/174/EC (OJ L 51, 1.3.1996, p. 48).Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR): this committee, which was
created in June 2001 in the light of the recommendation of the Report of the Committee ofWise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets, is composed of representatives

from the national authorities regulating the securities markets. As the Level 3 body of the
revised European regulatory approach, it advises the European Commission (Commissionof the European Communities) on securities policy issues and plays an important role in
the transposition of Community law in the Member States.Consolidated MFI balance sheet: this is obtained by netting out inter-MFI positions
(e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) on the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides statisticalinformation on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis non-MFI euro area
 residents
(i.e. general government and other euro area residents) and on its external assets and
liabilities (i.e. balances vis-à-vis non-euro area residents). This consolidated balance sheet isthe main statistical source for the calculation of monetary aggregates and it provides the
basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of M3.Convergence programmes: see 
stability programmes.Correspondent banking: 
an arrangement whereby one credit institution provides
payment and other services to another credit institution. Payments through correspondentsare often executed through reciprocal accounts (nostro and loro accounts), to which standing
credit lines may be attached. Correspondent banking services are primarily provided acrossnational borders, but are also provided in some domestic contexts where they are known as
agency relationships. A loro account is the term used by a correspondent to describe anECB  Annual Report 
 2002
238account held on behalf of a foreign credit institution; the foreign credit institution would inturn regard this account as its nostro account.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a mechanism established by theEuropean System of Central Banks (ESCB) 
with the aim of enabling counterparties to
obtain credit from the central bank of the country in which they are based using collateralheld in another country. In the CCBM, a national central bank (NCB) acts as custodian for theother NCBs with regard to the securities held in its domestic 
securities settlementsystem (SSS)
.Council of Ministers: see 
EU Council.Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with acentral bank).
Credit institution: an institution covered by the definition in Article 1 (1) of Directive 2000/12/
EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up
and pursuit of the business of credit institutions, as amended by Directive 2000/28/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000. Thus, a credit institution is: (i) anundertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and togrant credit for its own account; or (ii) an undertaking or any other legal person, other than those
under (i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic money. 
ﬁElectronic moneyﬂ shall
mean monetary value, as represented by a claim on the issuer, which is: (a) stored on an electronicdevice; (b) issued on receipt of funds of an amount not lower in value than the monetary value
issued; and (c) accepted as a means of payment by undertakings other than the issuer.Credit to euro area residents: a broad measure of the financing provided by the euro areamonetary financial institution (MFI) sector to non-MFI 
euro area residents (including
general government and other euro area residents). It is defined as including loans granted
by MFIs and MFI holdings of securities. The latter include shares, other equity and debtsecurities issued by non-MFI euro area residents.
Currency in circulation: comprises banknotes and coins in circulation that are commonly
used to make payments. Throughout 2002, currency in circulation included banknotes issuedby the Eurosystem and by other 
monetary financial institutions (MFIs) (in Ireland and
Luxembourg) as well as coins issued by the euro area central governments denominated
in both euro and the legacy currencies, even though the euro has been the sole legal tender
in all euro area countries since 1 March 2002. Banknotes of legacy currencies ceased to beincluded in banknotes in circulation as from 1 January 2003, both for Eurosystem financial

reporting and for statistical purposes. The same has been applied consistently for coins oflegacy currencies. Currency in circulation as included in 
M3 is a net concept, meaning that it
refers only to banknotes and coins in circulation held outside the MFI sector (i.e. currency
held by MFIs or ﬁvault cashﬂ has been subtracted). Furthermore, it includes neither central
banks™ stocks of own banknotes (as they have not been put into circulation), nor
commemorative coins (that are not commonly used to make payments).Debt financing of the euro area non-financial sectors:
 this includes the debt financing of
households, non-financial corporations and 
general government. It can take the followingforms: loans granted by euro area monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and other financial
corporations; debt securities issued by non-financial corporations and general government;
pension fund reserves of non-financial corporations; and deposit liabilities of central239ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
government. Not included are loans from general government, non-financial corporations or
banks resident outside the euro area, financial derivatives, shares, other equity and other accountspayable. On an annual basis, a broader measure of this debt financing can be calculated that alsoincludes loans from non-financial sectors and from banks resident outside the euro area.Debt ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal criteria used to define the existence of an
excessive deficit, as laid down in Article 104 (2) of the Treaty. It is defined as the ratio ofgovernment debt to gross domestic product at current market prices, while government debtis defined in Protocol No. 20 (on the excessive deficit procedure) as the total gross debt at
nominal value outstanding at the end of the year and consolidated between and within thesectors of general government.Debt securities: these securities represent a promise on the part of the issuer (borrower)
to make one or more payment(s) to the holder (lender) at a specified future date or dates.They usually carry a specific rate of interest (coupon) and are otherwise sold at a discount to
the amount that will be repaid at maturity. The holder™s income from the debt securitiestherefore consists of any coupon payments received together with the difference between thepurchase price of the bond and its market value upon sale or maturity. They are negotiable

and can be traded on secondary markets, but they do not grant the holder any ownership
rights in the issuing unit. Money market paper and, in principle, private placements are
included in the debt securities statistics of the 
European Central Bank (ECB).Deficit ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal criteria used to define the existence of an
excessive deficit, as laid down in Article 104 (2) of the 
Treaty. It is defined as the ratio of theplanned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product at current market prices,
while the government deficit is defined in Protocol No. 20 (on the excessive deficit procedure)
as net borrowing of the general government.Delivery versus payment (DVP): a mechanism in a securities settlement system
(SSS) which ensures that the delivery of assets (securities or other financial instruments)occurs if, and only if, payment occurs.Deposit facility: a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem which 
counterparties may use
to make overnight deposits
 at a national central bank and which are remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate (see key ECB interest rates).Deposits redeemable at notice: savings deposits for which the holder must respect a
fixed period of notice before withdrawing the funds. In some cases, there is the possibility of
withdrawing on demand a certain fixed amount in a specified period or of early withdrawal
subject to the payment of a penalty. Deposits redeemable at a period of notice of up to threemonths are included in M2 (and hence in M3), while those with a longer period of notice arepart of the (non-monetary) longer-term financial liabilities of the 
monetary financialinstitution (MFI) sector.Deposits with agreed maturity: mainly time deposits with a given maturity that, depending
on national practices, may be either unconvertible prior to maturity or convertible onlysubject to the payment of a penalty. Some non-marketable debt instruments, such as non-marketable (retail) certificates of deposit, are also included. Deposits with an agreed maturity

of up to two years are included in M2 (and hence in 
M3), while those with an agreed maturityof over two years are included in the (non-monetary) longer-term financial liabilities ofthe euro area MFI sector.ECB  Annual Report

240ECOFIN Council: see 
EU Council.Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body set up at
the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), when the MonetaryCommittee was dissolved. The Member States, the European Commission (Commissionof the European Communities) and the
 European Central Bank (ECB)
 each appoint
no more than two members of the Committee. One of the two members appointed by eachof the Member States is selected from among senior officials from the respective national
administration and the other from among senior officials from the respective national central
bank. Article 114 (2) of the Treaty contains a list of the tasks of the Economic and Financial
Committee, which include reviewing the economic and financial situation of the MemberStates and of the Community.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the 
Treaty describes the process of achieving
EMU in the European Union (EU) in three stages. Stage One of EMU started in July 1990 and
ended on 31 December 1993; it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of all internalbarriers to the free movement of capital within the EU. Stage Two of EMU began on 1 January1994. It provided for, inter alia, the establishment of the European Monetary Institute(EMI), the prohibition of financing of the public sector by the central banks, the prohibitionof privileged access to financial institutions by the public sector and the avoidance of excessivegovernment deficits. Stage Three started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary
competence to the European Central Bank (ECB) and the introduction of the euro. Thecash changeover on 1 January 2002 completed the set-up of EMU.
Economic Policy Committee (EPC): a consultative Community body which contributes
to the preparation of the work of the Council in co-ordinating the economic policies of the
Member States and of the Community and provides advice to the Commission and the
Council. It works in close co-operation with the 
Economic and Financial Committee(EFC) and focuses mainly on structural policies aimed at improving growth potential and
employment in the Community. The Committee, which is provided for in Article 272 of the

Treaty, was set up by a Council Decision in 1974. The Member States, the EuropeanCommission and the European Central Bank (ECB)
 each appoint up to four members of
the Committee who are selected from senior officials possessing outstanding competence in
the field of economic and structural policy formulation.ECU (European Currency Unit): the ECU was a basket currency made up of the sum of
fixed amounts of 12 of the 15 currencies of the EU Member States. The value of the ECU was
calculated as a weighted average of the value of its component currencies. The ECU wasreplaced by the euro on a one-for-one basis on 1 January 1999.
Effective (nominal/real) exchange rates (EERs): nominal EERs consist of a geometric
weighted average of various bilateral exchange rates. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated by
a weighted average of foreign, relative to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measuresof price and cost competitiveness. The 
European Central Bank (ECB) calculates nominal
EER indices for the euro against the currencies of a narrow and a broad group of trading
partners of the euro area. Since January 2001, the narrow group has consisted of 12industrial and newly industrialised partner countries, while the broad group has been made upof 38 trading partners including emerging market and transition economies. The real EER
indices for the euro are calculated using alternative measures of prices and costs.

 2002
Electronic money (e-money): an electronic store of monetary value on a technical devicethat may be widely used as a prepaid bearer instrument for making payments to undertakingsother than the issuer, without necessarily involving bank accounts in the transactions (see
also multi-purpose prepaid card).Electronic Payment Systems Observatory (ePSO): an open information-sharinginfrastructure on electronic payments. Its aim is to foster an exchange of views betweenmarket participants and to serve as a source of information. Initially, ePSO was an initiative ofthe European Commission but since early 2003, it has been run by the ECB. The ePSO
website can be accessed under www.e-pso.info.EMU: see 
Economic and Monetary Union.EONIA (euro overnight index average): a measure of the effective interest rate prevailingin the euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest
rates on unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by apanel of contributing banks.
EONIA swap rate: an 
EONIA swap is an agreement between two parties whereby a set of
variable payments indexed to the EONIA and a set of payments at a fixed rate are exchangedover an agreed period of time. The interest rate on the fixed leg of this type of swap is
referred to as the EONIA swap rate and reflects the expected average level of the EONIAover the maturity of the swap. EONIA swaps are offered at maturities of one to three weeksand one to 12 months and are traded over the counter bilaterally in the money market.Equity market: the market in which claims to a share in the ownership of a business are
issued and traded. A major difference between equity and debt is that the former does not
have to be repaid by the issuer.ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II): the exchange rate arrangement which provides
the framework for exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area countries and
the EU Member States not participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three ofEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU). Membership of the mechanism is voluntary.
Nevertheless, Member States with a derogation are expected to join the mechanism. Currently,
the Danish krone participates in ERM II with a fluctuation band around its central rate againstthe euro of ±2.25%. Foreign exchange intervention and financing at the margins of the
standard or narrower fluctuation bands are, in principle, automatic and unlimited, with very
short-term financing available. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the participating
non-euro area national central banks could, however, suspend automatic intervention if this
were to conflict with their primary objective of maintaining price stability.EU Council: an institution of the European Community. It is made up of representatives of
the governments of the Member States, normally the ministers responsible for the mattersunder consideration (therefore often referred to as the Council of Ministers). The EUCouncil meeting in the composition of the ministers of finance and economy is often referred

to as the ECOFIN Council. In addition, the EU Council may meet in the composition of the
Heads of State or Government (see also European Council).EUREPO: the rate at which one prime bank offers funds in euro to another prime bank in
exchange for collateral consisting exclusively of government bonds and bills issued by euro
area countries. The EUREPO™s calculation methodology is similar to that of the EURIBOR. ItECB  Annual Report 
 2002
242is representative of rates in the secured markets (repo markets), by contrast with theEURIBOR which reflects conditions in the unsecured market. The panel of banks is also
different.EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate): the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend
funds in euro to another prime bank. The EURIBOR is computed daily for interbank deposits
with a maturity of one to three weeks and one to 12 months as the average of the daily offerrates of a representative panel of prime banks, rounded to three decimal places.Euro: the name of the European single currency adopted by the 
European Council at its
meeting in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995.Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States in which the 
euro has been adopted
as the single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy isconducted under the responsibility of the 
Governing Council of the 
European CentralBank (ECB). The euro area currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Greece (which joined
on 1 January 2001), Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria,Portugal and Finland.Euro Banking Association (EBA): an organisation which provides a forum for exploring
and debating all banking issues of interest to its members and, in particular, matters pertaining

to the use of the euro and the settlement of transactions in euro. The EBA established a

European System ofCentral Banks (ESCB) and the 
Eurosystem and has legal personality under Community
law. It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implementedeither through its own activities or through those of the national central banks, pursuant to
the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. TheECB is governed by the Governing Council and the 
Executive Board, and, as a third
decision-making body, by the General Council.European Commission (Commission of the European Communities): the institutionof the European Community which ensures the application of the provisions of the Treaty.The Commission develops Community policies, proposes Community legislation and exercisespowers in specific areas. In the area of economic policy, the Commission recommends broad

tasks of the EMI were to strengthen central bank co-operation and monetary policy co-ordination and to make the preparations required for the establishment of the 
EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB), for the conduct of the single monetary policy and forthe creation of a single currency in Stage Three. It went into liquidation upon the establishmentof the European Central Bank (ECB) on 1 June 1998.
European Parliament:
 consists of 626 representatives of the citizens of the Member States.
It is a part of the legislative process, although with different prerogatives according to the
procedures through which EU law is to be enacted. In the framework of 
Economic andMonetary Union (EMU), the Parliament has mainly consultative powers. However, theTreaty establishes certain procedures for the democratic accountability of the 
EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) to the Parliament (presentation of the Annual Report, general debate
on monetary policy, testimonies before the competent parliamentary committees).European Payments Council (EPC): governance body consisting of 52 institutions,including commercial banks, co-operative banks and savings banks, entrusted with bringingabout the single euro payment area and with representing the European banking industry on

The inaugural assembly of the EPC was held on 17 June2002.European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95): a system of uniform statistical definitionsand classifications aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of the economiesof the Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world System ofNational Accounts 1993 (SNA 93). The ESA 95 is a new version of the European system,
implementation of which began in the course of 1999 in accordance with Council Regulation(EC) No. 2223/96.

244those countries belonging to the euro area. Furthermore, three types of sector index(economic and market sectors as well as industry groups) are available for the Dow JonesEURO STOXX index.
Eurosystem: comprises the 
European Central Bank (ECB) 
and the national centralbanks (NCBs) of the Member States which have adopted the euro in Stage Three of

the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is governed by the Governing Council and the 
ExecutiveBoard of the ECB.Eurosystem™s international reserves: these comprise the reserve assets of the 
EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) and the reserve assets held by the national central banks (NCBs) of
the euro area countries. Reserve assets must be under the effective control of the relevantmonetary authority, whether the ECB or the NCB of one of the euro area countries, andcomprise highly liquid, marketable and creditworthy foreign (i.e. non-euro) currency-denominated claims on non-euro area residents, plus gold, special drawing rights and thereserve positions in the International Monetary Fund of the euro area NCBs.Excessive deficit procedure:
 the provision defined in Article 104 of the 
Treaty and
specified in Protocol No. 20 on the excessive deficit procedure requires EU Member States tomaintain budgetary discipline, defines criteria for a budgetary position to be considered an

excessive deficit and regulates the steps to be taken following the observation that the
requirements for the budget balance or government debt have not been fulfilled. This issupplemented by an EU Council Regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation
of the excessive deficit procedure, which is an element of the 
Stability and Growth Pact.Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the European Central Bank(ECB). It comprises the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and four other
members appointed by common accord by the Heads of State or Government of thecountries that have adopted the euro.Fair value accounting (FVA): a valuation principle that stipulates the use of either a

expected cash flows, to establish the balance sheet value of financial instruments.Fine-tuning operation: a non-regular open market operation executed by the
Eurosystem mainly in order to deal with unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market.
Foreign exchange swap: simultaneous spot and forward transactions exchanging one
currency against another. The Eurosystem can execute

 in the
form of foreign exchange swaps, where the national central banks (or the European CentralBank (ECB)) buy or sell euro spot against a foreign currency and, at the same time, sell or
buy them back in a forward transaction.
Funds transfer system (FTS): a formal arrangement, based on private contract or statute
law, with multiple membership, common rules and standardised arrangements, for the

European Central Bank
(ECB). It comprises all the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors
of the national central banks of the countries that have adopted the 
euro.Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): the measure of prices used by theGoverning Council for the purpose of assessing 
price stability. The HICP was developedby the European Commission (Commission of the European Communities)
(Eurostat) in close liaison with the national statistical institutes and the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI), and later the European Central Bank (ECB)
, in order to fulfil theTreaty requirement for a consumer price index constructed on a comparable basis, taking
into account differences in national definitions.High Level Group of Company Law Experts: set up by the 
European Commission(Commission of the European Communities) in September 2001 to make
recommendations on a modern regulatory framework for company law in the European
Union. In January 2002 the Group produced a report which addressed issues relating to the
Takeover Bids Directive. In April 2002 the Group
™s mandate was extended to deal specifically
with a number of corporate governance issues.Households: one of the institutional sectors in the 
European System of Accounts 1995(ESA 95). The household sector covers individuals or groups of individuals as consumers,but possibly also as entrepreneurs (i.e. sole proprietorships and partnerships). Non-profit
institutions serving households are a separate institutional sector according to the ESA 95,although they are often grouped together with households in statistics.
Implied bond market volatility: a measure of expected volatility in the prices of bonds (or
of futures contracts on bonds), which can be extracted from option prices. Given the
observed market price of a bond option, the implied volatility can be extracted using astandard option pricing formula which explicitly depends on, inter alia, the expected volatilityof the underlying asset price during the period until the option expires. The underlying assets
can be bonds, such as the ten-year German Bund, or bond futures contracts. Given appropriateassumptions, the implied volatility may be interpreted as the market™s expectation of volatility
during the remaining life of the option.Implied interest rate volatility: a measure of expected volatility in future short and long-
term interest rates, which can be extracted from 
option prices. Given the observed market
price of an interest rate option, the implied volatility can be extracted using a standard optionpricing formula which explicitly depends on, inter alia, the expected volatility of the underlyingasset price during the period until the option expires. The underlying assets can be futures
contracts on short-term interest rates, such as the three-month 
EURIBOR, or on long-termgovernment bonds, such as ten-year German Bunds. Given appropriate assumptions, theimplied volatility may be interpreted as the market™s expectation of volatility during theremaining life of the option.Implied stock market volatility: a measure of expected volatility in stock prices, which
can be extracted from option prices. Given the observed market price of an equity option,
the implied volatility can be extracted using a standard option pricing formula which explicitlydepends on, inter alia, the expected volatility of the underlying asset price during the period
ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
246until the option expires. The underlying assets can be stock market indices, such as the DowJones EURO STOXX 50 index. Given appropriate assumptions, the implied volatility may be
interpreted as the market™s expectation of volatility during the remaining life of the option.Interbank funds transfer system (IFTS): 
a funds transfer system
 in which most (or
all) direct participants are credit institutions.Interlinking mechanism: one of the components of the 
TARGET system. The term is
used to designate the infrastructures and procedures which link domestic RTGS systems inorder to enable the processing of cross-border payments within TARGET.International Accounting Standards (IAS): statements issued by the 
InternationalAccounting Standards Board (IASB). They are enforceable global standards on theprovision of transparent and comparable information in general-purpose financial statements.In April 2001 the IASB announced that its accounting standards would in future be designated

(or external asset or liability position):the value and composition of the stock of an economy™s financial claims on and financialliabilities to the rest of the world. At present, the euro area i.i.p. is compiled on a net basis,
from aggregated national data.Key ECB interest rates: the interest rates which reflect the stance of the monetary policyof the European Central Bank (ECB) and which are set by the Governing Council. Thekey ECB interest rates are at present the minimum bid rate on the 
main refinancingoperations, the interest rate on the 
marginal lending facility
 and the interest rate on the
deposit facility.Large-value payments: payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainlyexchanged between banks or between participants in the financial markets and usually require

urgent and timely settlement.
Link between securities settlement systems: procedures and arrangements between
securities settlement systems (SSSs) for the transfer of securities through a book-entry
process. As an alternative to the CCBM, the Eurosystem uses eligible links for the cross-
border mobilisation of collateral.Longer-term financial liabilities of the euro area MFI sector: these non-monetary
liabilities include deposits with agreed maturity of over two years, 
deposits redeemableat notice of over three months, 
debt securities issued with an original maturity of more

Eurosystem in the form of a reverse transaction. Longer-term refinancing operations arecarried out through monthly standard tenders and have a maturity of three months.
Lump-sum allowance:
 a fixed amount which a 
credit institution deducts in the calculation
of its reserve requirement within the minimum reserve framework of the 
Eurosystem.M1, M2, M3: see monetary aggregates.Main refinancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by the
Eurosystem in the form of a 
reverse transaction. Main refinancing operations areconducted through weekly standard tenders and normally have a maturity of two weeks.
Maintenance period: the period over which 
credit institutions™ compliance with reserverequirements is calculated. The maintenance period for 
Eurosystem minimum reserves is
one month, starting on the 24th calendar day of one month and ending on the 23rd calendarday of the following month.Marginal lending facility: a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem which 
counterpartiesmay use to receive overnight credit from a national central bank at a pre-specified interestrate against eligible assets (see key ECB interest rates).MFI interest rates: those interest rates that are applied by resident credit institutions and
other institutions to euro-denominated deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations resident in euro area countries. The requirements for the MFI interestrate statistics are laid down in Regulation ECB/2001/18 of 20 December 2001. The non-harmonised statistics produced according to a short-term approach, using already existing
national retail interest rate statistics, are referred to as retail bank interest rates.Minimum bid rate: the lower limit to the interest rates at which 
counterparties maysubmit bids in the variable rate tenders of the 
main refinancing operations. As a key ECBinterest rate it plays, at present, the role previously performed by the rate in fixed rate
tenders.Monetary aggregates: currency in circulation, plus outstanding amounts of certain
liabilities of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and central governments that have a
relatively high degree of liquidity and are held by non-MFI euro area residents outside the
central government sector. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 has been defined as currency
in circulation plus overnight deposits. The ﬁintermediateﬂ monetary aggregate 
M2 comprises
M1 plus 
deposits with agreed maturity of up to two years and 
deposits redeemable atnotice of up to three months. The broad monetary aggregate 
M3 includes M2 plus
repurchase agreements, money market fund shares and units, and money marketpaper and debt securities with a maturity of up to two years issued by MFIs. In October
1998 the Governing Council announced a reference value for the growth of M3, which it
has since reconfirmed (see also reference value for monetary growth).Monetary financial institutions (MFIs): financial institutions which form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area. These include the Eurosystem, resident credit institutions(as defined in Community law) and all other resident financial institutions whose business is toreceive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for
their own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. TheECB  Annual Report 
 2002
248latter group consists predominantly of money market funds. At the end of 2002, therewere 8,545 MFIs in the euro area (13 central banks, 6,907 credit institutions, 1,620 moneymarket funds and five other financial institutions).Monetary income: income accruing to the national central banks in the performance of the
Eurosystem™s monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with
guidelines established by the Governing Council and held against banknotes in circulation
and deposit liabilities to credit institutions.Monetary policy strategy: the monetary policy strategy of the 
European Central Bank(ECB) rests on the quantitative definition of 
price stability and two analytical frameworks
(ﬁpillarsﬂ) which contribute to assessing the risks to future price stability. The first pillarassigns a prominent role to money Œ monetary and credit developments are thoroughly
analysed for their information content. It includes a reference value for monetary growthand a number of models in which monetary and credit developments play a role in determining

or projecting price developments. The second pillar consists of the analysis of a wide range of
other economic and financial variables. It includes various models in which cost pressures andthe relationship between supply and demand in goods, services and labour markets determine
price developments.Money market: the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded usinginstruments which generally have an original maturity of up to one year.Money market fund: a collective investment undertaking which primarily invests in money
market instruments and/or other transferable debt instruments with a residual maturity of upto one year, and/or which pursues a rate of return that approaches the interest rates onmoney market instruments.Money market fund shares and units: shares and units issued by a 
money market fund.Multi-purpose prepaid card: a stored-value card which can be used for a wide range of
payment purposes and which has the potential to be used on a national or international scale,but which may sometimes be restricted to a certain area. A reloadable multi-purpose prepaid
card is also known as an electronic purse (see also electronic money (e-money)).Net external assets of the MFI sector: external assets held by euro area
 monetaryfinancial institutions (MFIs) minus external liabilities of the euro area MFI sector. External
assets held by euro area MFIs mainly include gold, holdings of non-euro banknotes, holdings ofsecurities issued by non-euro area residents and loans granted to non-euro area residents

(including deposits held with banks resident outside the euro area). External liabilities of theeuro area MFI sector mainly include deposits held by non-euro area residents and loans from
non-euro area residents. Changes in the net external assets of the euro area MFI sector
mainly reflect transactions of euro area non-MFIs with non-euro area counterparties, whichare intermediated by the MFI sector.
Net settlement system (NSS): 
a funds transfer system, the settlement operations of
which are completed on a bilateral or multilateral net basis.Nikkei 225 index: an index of the 225 top-rated Japanese companies listed in the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It is a market value-weighted index (i.e. each stock
249ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
price is multiplied by the number of shares outstanding), with each stock™s weight in the indexthus being proportionate to its market value.Non-financial corporations:
 one of the institutional sectors in the 
European System ofAccounts 1995 (ESA 95). This sector consists of institutional units whose distributive and
financial transactions are distinct from those of their owners. Non-financial corporations

encompass all bodies recognised as independent legal entities which are market producers
and whose principal activity is the production of goods and non-financial services.Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in thefinancial markets involving one of the following transactions: (i) buying or selling assetsoutright (spot or forward); (ii) buying or selling assets under a repurchase agreement;(iii) lending or borrowing against underlying assets as 
collateral; (iv) issuing central bank debtcertificates; (v) accepting fixed-term deposits; or (vi) conducting foreign exchange swapsbetween domestic and foreign currencies.Option: an option is a financial instrument which gives the owner the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a specific underlying asset (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined
price (the strike or exercise price) at or up to a certain future date (the exercise or maturitydate). A call option gives the holder the right to purchase the underlying asset at an agreedexercise price, whereas a put option gives the holder the right to sell it at an agreed exercise
price.Other accounts payable: financial liabilities created as a counterpart of a financial or non-
financial transaction when there is a time-lag between this transaction and the correspondingpayment.Outright transaction:
 a transaction whereby assets are bought or sold up to their maturity
(spot or forward).Overnight deposits: deposits with next-day maturity. This instrument category comprises
mainly those sight/demand deposits which are fully transferable on demand (by cheque orsimilar instrument) without significant delay, restriction or penalty. It also includes non-
transferable deposits that are convertible on demand or by close of business on the followingday.Pension fund reserves of non-financial corporations: provisions or similar funds set
aside by non-financial corporations to pay for their employees™ pensions (so-called non-
autonomous pension funds).Price stability: the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the 
EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB)
. In October 1998, the Governing Council published a quantitative
definition of price stability in order to give clear guidance to expectations of future pricedevelopments and to be accountable. The Governing Council defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) 
for the euroarea of below 2%. The Governing Council announced that price stability according to this
definition is to be maintained over the medium term. The definition delineates an upperboundary for the rate of measured inflation; at the same time, the use of the word ﬁincreaseﬂsignals that deflation, i.e. prolonged declines in the level of the HICP, would not be deemed
consistent with price stability.ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
250Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments onconsolidated government liabilities.Projections: the results of exercises conducted by 
Eurosystem staff to project possible
future macroeconomic developments in the 
euro area. Euro area projections are obtained ina way consistent with individual country projections. The projections, which are published
twice a year, form part of the second pillar of the 
monetary policy strategy of the
European Central Bank (ECB) and are one of several inputs into the GoverningCouncil™s assessment of the risks to 
price stability.Quick tender: the tender procedure used by the Eurosystem for 
fine-tuning operations.Quick tenders are executed within a time frame of one hour and are restricted to a limited
set of counterparties.Reference value for monetary growth: the 
Governing Council assigns money aprominent role in the conduct of the single monetary policy, implying that monetaryaggregates and their counterparts are thoroughly analysed regarding their information
content for future price developments. This is signalled by the announcement of a reference
value for the growth rate of the monetary aggregate 
M3. The reference value is derived in amanner which is consistent with and serves the achievement of the Governing Council™sdefinition of price stability on the basis of medium-term assumptions regarding trend real
GDP growth and the trend in the velocity of circulation of M3. Substantial or prolongeddeviations of M3 growth from the reference value would, under normal circumstances, signal
risks to price stability over the medium term. However, the concept of the reference value

does not entail a commitment on the part of the Governing Council to correct mechanisticallydeviations of M3 growth from the reference value.Reference value for the fiscal position: Treaty Protocol No. 20 on the 
excessivedeficit procedure sets explicit reference values for the 
general government deficit
ratio (3% of GDP) and 
debt ratio
 (60% of GDP) (see also 
Stability and Growth Pact).Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs): in these reports, the
IMF and the World Bank assess to what extent a member country adheres to internationally

accepted standards and codes covering 12 areas: data dissemination, fiscal transparency,monetary and financial policy transparency, banking supervision, securities, insurance, paymentssystems, corporate governance, accounting, auditing, insolvency and creditor rights, and
measures against money laundering and terrorism financing. ROSCs are prepared and publishedat the request of the IMF member country.Repurchase agreement: an agreement to sell an asset and to repurchase it at a specified
price on a predetermined future date or on demand. Such an agreement is similar to
collateralised borrowing, although it differs in that ownership of the securities is not retained
by the seller. Repurchase agreements are included in M3 in cases where the seller is a
monetary financial institution (MFI) and the 
counterparty is a non-MFI 
euro arearesident.Repurchase operation (repo): a liquidity-providing 
reverse transaction based on a
repurchase agreement.Reserve base: the sum of the balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) which constitutethe basis for calculating the reserve requirement of a 
credit institution.251ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Reserve ratio: a ratio defined by the central bank for each category of balance sheet itemsincluded in the reserve base. The ratios are used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the requirement for credit institutions to hold minimum reserves
with the central bank. In the minimum reserve framework of the 
Eurosystem, the reserverequirement of a credit institution is calculated by multiplying the 
reserve ratio for each
category of items within the reserve base by the amount of those items on the institution
™sbalance sheet. In addition, institutions are allowed to deduct a lump-sum allowance from
their reserve requirement.Retail bank interest rates: see MFI interest rates
.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under arepurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against 
collateral.RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system: a settlement system in which processingand settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time(continuously). See also TARGET.Securities settlement system (SSS): a system which permits the holding and transfer of
securities or other financial assets, either free of payment (FOP) or against payment (deliveryversus payment).Settlement agent: an institution that manages the settlement process, which involves, forinstance, the determination of settlement positions and the monitoring of the exchange ofpayments, for transfer systems or other arrangements that require settlement.Settlement risk: a general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer
system will not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both credit and liquidity risk.
Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM): IMF initiative to establish a statutory
framework for restructuring sovereign external debt. The SDRM would facilitate timely andcomprehensive agreements between debtors and creditors in cases of severe indebtedness.Stability and Growth Pact: consists of two 
EU Council Regulations on: (i) the
strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co-ordination
of economic policies; and on (ii) speeding up and clarifying the implementation of theexcessive deficit procedure, and of a European Council Resolution on the Stability and
Growth Pact adopted at the Amsterdam summit on 17 June 1997. It is intended to serve as a

means of safeguarding sound government finances in Stage Three of Economic andMonetary Union (EMU) in order to strengthen the conditions for 
price stability and for
strong, sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. More specifically, budgetary

positions close to balance or in surplus are required as the medium-term objective for
Member States, which would allow them to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while
keeping the government deficit below the reference value of 3% of GDP. In accordance with

the Stability and Growth Pact, countries participating in EMU report stability programmes
,while non-participating countries continue to provide convergence programmes.Stability programmes: medium-term government plans and assumptions provided by 
euroarea countries regarding the development of key economic variables towards the achievement
of the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus as
ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
252referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact. Measures to consolidate fiscal balances as
well as underlying economic scenarios are highlighted. Stability programmes must be updatedannually. They are examined by the European Commission (Commission of theEuropean Communities)
 and the 
Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), whosereports serve as the basis for an assessment by the 
ECOFIN Council, focusing, in particular,on whether the medium-term budgetary objective in the programme is in line with a budgetary
position close to balance or in surplus, providing for an adequate safety margin to ensure theavoidance of an excessive deficit. Countries not participating in the euro area must submit
annual convergence programmes, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact.Standard tender: a tender procedure used by the 
Eurosystem in its regular 
openmarket operations. Standard tenders are carried out within 24 hours. All counterpartiesfulfilling the general eligibility criteria are entitled to submit bids.Standard & Poor™s 500 index: Standard & Poor
™s publishes a number of indices, which
measure stock market developments in the United States as a whole. The Standard & Poor™s500 index is one member of this index family. It consists of 500 stocks chosen on the basis ofmarket size, liquidity and industry group representation. It is a market value-weighted index
(i.e. each stock price is multiplied by the number of shares outstanding), with each stock™sweight in the index thus being proportionate to its market value.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative.
The Eurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the 
marginal lending facility
 and
the deposit facility.Stress testing: analysis of how an investment strategy would perform if some assumptions
regarding adverse changes in relevant risk factors were made (e.g. higher volatility and
correlation between portfolio instruments).TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement ExpressTransfer system): the 
RTGS system for the 
euro. It is a decentralised system consistingof 15 national RTGS systems
 and the payment mechanism of the 
European Central Bank(ECB). These are interconnected by common procedures (see
 interlinking
 mechanism)to allow cross-border transfers throughout the European Union to move from one system to
another.TARGET2: second generation of the 
TARGET system to be developed in view of increasing
financial integration within the 
euro area. The main objectives of TARGET2 will be (i) tobetter meet customers™ needs by providing an extensively harmonised service level,
(ii) to guarantee cost efficiency and (iii) to be prepared for swift adaptation to futuredevelopments, including the enlargement of the European Union and of the Eurosystem. InTARGET2, the national central banks will remain responsible for the accounts and business
relations with credit institutions.Tier one asset: a marketable asset fulfilling certain uniform 
euro area-wide eligibilitycriteria specified by the European Central Bank (ECB).Tier two asset: a marketable or non-marketable asset fulfilling specific eligibility criteria
established by a national central bank, subject to European Central Bank (ECB) approval.
253ECB  Annual Report 
 2002
Treaty: refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Treaty was signed in
Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958. It established theEuropean Economic Community (EEC), which is now the European Community (EC), and is

often referred to as the ﬁTreaty of Romeﬂ. The Treaty on European Union (which is oftenreferred to as the 
ﬁMaastricht Treaty
ﬂ) was signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force
on 1 November 1993. The Treaty on European Union amended the Treaty establishing the
European Community and established the European Union. The ﬁTreaty of Amsterdamﬂ,which was signed in Amsterdam on 2 October 1997 and entered into force on 1 May 1999,
and most recently the ﬁTreaty of Niceﬂ, which was signed on 26 February 2001 and enteredinto force on 1 February 2003, amended both the Treaty establishing the European Communityand the Treaty on European Union.UCITS: undertaking the sole object of which is the collective investment in transferable
securities of capital raised from the public and the units of which are, at the request of the
holders, repurchased or redeemed out of the undertaking™s assets.UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System): system for 
ﬁthird generationﬂmobile telecommunications. Licences for mobile telecommunications frequencies are sold or

awarded by European Union governments to telecommunications companies.Uncovered bond: a bond backed only by the integrity of the borrower and not by collateral.Value at Risk (VaR): a risk measure of a portfolio™s maximum loss during a specific periodof time at a given level of probability.Valuation haircut: a risk control measure applied to underlying assets used in 
reversetransactions, in which the central bank calculates the value of underlying assets as theirmarket value reduced by a certain percentage (haircut). The Eurosystem applies valuation
haircuts reflecting features of the specific assets, such as their residual maturity.Variation margin (or marking to market): the 
Eurosystem requires that a specified
margin be maintained over time on the underlying assets used in its liquidity-providingreverse transactions. This implies that if the regularly measured market value of the
underlying assets falls below a certain level, counterparties have to supply additional assets
(or cash). Similarly, if the market value of the underlying assets, following their revaluation,
were to exceed the amount owed by a counterparty plus the variation margin, the central
