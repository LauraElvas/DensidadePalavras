x  OverviewAfter reaching annual average growth rates above 2% last year, economic 
activity in the euro area and the EU has been more subdued this year, but is 
expected to return to potential at th
e beginning of next year.  From an 
estimated 1.3% in the euro area and 1.5% in the EU in 2005, growth is 
projected to reach 1.9% and 2.1%, respectively, next year and to accelerate 
further to 2.1% and 2.4% in 2007. 
The main factors behind the outlook include an accommodative 
macroeconomic policy mix, benign 
financial conditions, wider profit 
margins, a weaker nominal effective exchange rate and a robust global 
environment. 
Over the forecast horizon, the recovery is underpinned by an acceleration 
in domestic demand, with a slight stimu
lus in net terms 
from the external 
sector.  This includes, more specifically, a relatively strong pick-up in the 

pace of investment expenditure and a more gradual recovery of private 
consumption.  A steady improvement is also foreseen for the labour 
market, supported by continued wa
ge moderation and the revival of 
confidence among entrepreneurs.  Employment growth in the euro area is 
expected to rise from 1% 
in 2005 to 1.2% in 
2006, while easing slightly to 
1.1% in 2007.  For the EU as a w
hole, the profile is similar, although the 
growth in employment is
 projected to be sligh
tly lower throughout the 
forecast horizon. World GDP growth exceeded 5% last year, the fastest pace since the early 
seventies.  Despite the 
soft patch in growth in the second quarter of this 
year, the outlook for the global econ
omy remains bright.  Economic 
activity is projected to normalise to 
4.3% this year and next, before edging 
slightly lower in 2007.  Many of 
the factors behind last year’s stellar 
performance remain in place.  These include supportive macroeconomic 
policies, low real interest rates, housing-mar
ket-induced wealth effects, as 
well as sustained strong growth
 in certain economies, su
ch as China, India 
and most of the oil-exporting countries. 
Growth decelerated across most regions of the world in the second quarter 
of this year, partly as a result of rising 
oil prices.  The slowdown was most 
apparent in the manufacturing sector.  
Growth remained healthy in the US, 
supported by private consumption and is expected to reach 3.5% on 

average this year.  Nonetheless, in view of the unbalanced nature of the 
domestic source of US growth and the large and rising current account 
deficit and general government deficit, this pace of economic expansion is 

probably unsustainable.  Accordingly, the 
growth rate is projected to fall to 
3.2% next year and to 2.7% in 2007. 
After last year’s recession, the Japanese economy staged a comeback early 
this year due to a 
strong rebound in dom
estic demand, especially 
investment.  Growth is set to yield 
a robust 2.5% this year, before easing 
next year to 2.2%.  Deflation in con
sumer prices is still
 present in the 
economy but is projected to turn in
to inflation from 
2006 onwards.  
Although easing, growth in Asia (exclud
ingJapan) is set to remain strong 
in the region of 7-7.2% over the forecast horizon.  The pace of China’s

1Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 growth is expected to moderate somewhat from over 9% to around 8.2%, 
while India’s growth rate is sustained
 at around 7%.  Among the other 
emerging regions, economic activity in Latin America is set to cool down 

in 2006-7, while growth should accelerate next year in some parts of 
Africa.  Rising oil revenues have limited
 the slowdown in the main oil-
exporting countries, with economic activity pr
ojected to remain around 6% 
in Russia.  In the candidate and acceding countries, the dynamic 
performance of last year is expected 
to be followed by lower, but still 
robust, growth of around 5% in 
2006 and 2007. Having reached an annual average growth rate of around 11½% in 2004, 
the pace of world trade growth decelerated in the first quarter of this year 

in line with the slowdown in the gl
obal manufacturing sector, but 
recovered once again in the second quarter.  World trade growth is set to 
reach a lower 7% this year and to stabilise in the vicinity of 7.2% over the 

forecast horizon as a result of the projected moderation in world growth. 
World commodity prices maintained th
eir upward trend this year.  The rise 
was driven mainly by the sharp
 price increase in oil and other energy 
products. 
In view of the sustained rise in oil 
prices over the last twelve months, 
reaching record highs in September of this year, the assumed profile for oil 
prices has been revised upwards consi
derably compared to the spring 
forecasts.  From an average of USD 49 per barrel (Brent crude) in the first 
half of this year, the price of oil is assu
med to rise to USD 61.5 in the 
second half of next year before declinin
g gradually to USD 59.5 per barrel 
at the end of 2007.  This leads to an average of USD 55 per barrel for this 
year, USD 61.4 per barrel next year and
 USD 60.3 per barrel in 2007.  
After a rise of 45% this year, this profile implies a further increase of 12% 
next year, followed by a slight decline in 2007. 
In real terms, the price of oil has not reached the peak level recorded 
during previous shocks and
 the oil-intensity of
 industrialised oil-importing 
economies has been reduced substantially during the last twenty-five years.  

Nevertheless, the sustained increase has taken its toll on world growth and 
the persistence of higher oil prices and their increased volatility have 
adverse implications for the outlook fo
r growth and inflation over the 
forecast horizon. Euro-area equity markets have experienced a sustained upward trend since 
April of this year, having fluctuated in
 a fairly narrow range in previous 
months.  While there is considerable variation across Member States, euro-
area equity markets – in line with
 broader European and Japanese share 
prices - have tended to outperform 
the US market, which has remained 
broadly flat.  The decoupling of Euro
pean and US long-term bond yields, 
which began in the fourth quarter of 
last year, continued 
for much of this 
year.  In the euro area, long-term governm
ent bond yields maintained their 
downward trend, reaching record lows in September.  Since then, yields 

have increased as rising inflation expectations boosted market expectations 
of the likelihood of a tightening of
 monetary policy.  From the third quarter 
Energy prices escalate, while real long-term bond yields remain low 
2Overviewof last year until very recently, no trend 
was apparent in US yields.  
Accordingly, the yield differential vis-à
-vis the euro-area rose to 120 basis 
points in October, a gap 
not observed since 1999, 
before diminishing once 
again with the rise in euro-area yields.  Real yields remain low in historical 
terms both in the US and in Europe.  
Emerging market and corporate bond 
spreads have continued to narrow this
 year.  On the whole, financial 
conditions have improved 
further since the spring
 and remain supportive to 
growth. 
After growing at potential last year, the economic performance of both the 
euro area and the EU was disappointing
 in the first half of this year.  
Following a modest acceleration to 0.4% in the first quarter in the euro 

area, real GDP growth slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter.  For the EU, 
the pace of economic activity was sustained at 0.4% in both quarters.  In 
assessing the quarterly data outtu
rn, it is worth noting 
that the working-day adjustment may have distorted the outcome for the first quarter.   
The pattern of a strengthening cont
ribution to growth from domestic 
demand and a negative contribution from the external sector, which had 
emerged in the second half of last year, 
was broken in the 
first quarter of 
this year.  The pick-up in domes
tic demand faltered and net exports 
became once again the main driving force behind growth in both the euro 
area and the EU.  Reflecting the deceleration in world trade growth, this 
was achieved through a sharp contraction 
in imports, which outweighed a 
smaller decline in exports.  The outc
ome for the second quarter proved 
more encouraging for the prospects of a revival of the domestic demand, 

since growth was driven almost exclusiv
ely by the latter.  For the EU, the 
contribution to growth was shared 
across consumption and investment, 
while the accumulation of inventories also played an important role in the 

euro area.  Growth in investment picked up in both the euro area and the 
EU between the first an
d second quarters.  Howe
ver, private consumption

3Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 growth remained unchanged in the euro area, while accelerating slightly in 
the EU.  Supported by a weaker euro, export
 growth surged 
in the euro 
area, but an even sharper acceleration in the growth of imports left the 

growth contribution of the external sector at almost zero.  
Following the poor read
ings at the first half 
this year, survey indicators began to send out positive signals 
once again during th
e third quarter of 
this year on the prospects for a renewal 
of the recovery.  After dropping in 
the first half of the year, the overall economic sentiment indicator for the 

euro area from the Harmonised EU Business and Consumer Surveys 
exhibited a sustained in
crease in the third quarter, which has extended into 
the start of the fourth quarter.  The composite Purchasing Managers Index 

(PMI) has followed a similar path.   
While the surge in oil pr
ices took a toll on busin
ess confidence in the first 
half of the year, the confidence indicator for the euro-area manufacturing 
sector has been rising since the turn of the second quarter.  The flat trend in 
confidence in the services sector, which emerged 
at the beginning of 2004, 
was maintained for most of this year.  Ho
wever, there is some
 evidence of 
a change for the better more recently in both the business climate indicator 
and the PMI for services in the euro area.  Current levels of the PMI for 

both manufacturing and services remain consi
stent with a continuation of 
economic expansion in both the manufacturing and services sectors.   
....followed by a pick-up 
in the second half of the 
year and a return to 
potential growth in 2006

4OverviewUnlike business confidence, the indicators for consumer confidence have 
continued to provide little encouragement for a near-term acceleration in 
consumer spending.  While the Commission’s consumer confidence 

indicator has edged up recently, this
 follows a decline since the beginning 
of the year.  The index remains below its long-term average, as well as 
below the levels recorded at a similar sta
ge in previou
s upswings.  The 
retail confidence index also witnessed an
 increase in recent months, but its 
longer-term trend has been flat since the end of 2003.   
In general, although the trends 
are similar, the Commission’s overall 
economic confidence indicator for the EU has exceeded that for the euro 
area since the third quarter 
of 2003.  This is mainly 
due to the consistently 
higher level of consumer confidence in the EU, 
while the levels of the 
industrial and services confidence indicators have been almost 
indistinguishable from
 their euro-area counterpa
rts in recent months. 
With these indicators providing a back
ground, the impulse to domestic 
demand stems mainly from a strong 
acceleration in gross fixed capital 
formation, especially in 2006.  The 
case for a strengthening of investment 
growth is underpinned by favourable financial conditions, improved 
balance sheets, wider profit margins, and an increasing need for 

replacement investment.  The projected pick-up in private consumption 
over the forecast horizon is more gradual
 in view of the subdued level of 
consumer confidence.  However, good progress in the implementation of 
structural reforms in some coun
tries has resolved some uncertainties, 
which have acted as a brake on co
nsumption in the past.  And although 
purchasing power prospects of consumers 
may be dented by rising energy 
prices in the near-term, the real disp
osable income of households should be 
sustained by the projected rise in employment and the effect on wealth of 
buoyant housing markets and rising 
stock markets in several countries 
should also provide a 
positive impetus to 
private consumption. 
There are several factors underpinning the outlook for a sustained recovery 
in the euro area and the EU over the forecast horizon.  The accommodative 
financial conditions and policy-mix, 
which have prevailed for some time 
now, together with the progress made in
 the implementation of structural 
reforms by some Member States, mean that the euro-area and the EU are in 
a strong position to participate in th
e global industrial recovery that is now in progress.  On the investment 
side, the latter recovery, reinforced by the 
depreciation in the effective exchange rate 
during this year provides the 
boost to demand, which allows corporate investors to finally take 

advantage of their improved balance sheets and profit margins.  The 
resilience of many of the world’s eco
nomies in the face of soaring oil 
prices has also served to boost investor 
confidence in th
e prolongation of 
the current phase of strong demand.  
The return of confidence in the 
business sector should permeate through
 to consumers as employment 
grows further and unempl
oyment declines.  Indeed, 
the fact that consumer 
confidence has not lost 
further ground following 
the surge in oil prices 
over the summer could imply that th
is process has already started.  The 
case of Germany is particularly telling because of its considerable share in 
euro-area GDP.  Here the strong improvement in competitiveness has laid 
5Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 the foundations for the resurgence of domestic demand in Germany, which 
would have positive spillover 
effects on other Member States.   
Both the euro-area and th
e EU labour markets have been markedly less 
influenced by the recent economic downswings and upswings, compared 
to earlier cycles.  Although the labour mark
et conditions worsened with the 
usual lag to the economi
c slowdown in 2001-2003
, the rise in the annual 
unemployment rate was limited to one
 percentage point, 
compared to a rise 
of over three percentage points in
 the early nineties.  In this cycle, 
unemployment peaked at 8.9% of the labour force in the euro area in the 
fourth quarter of 2004.  Several factors bear witness to the structural 
improvement in the functioning of th
e labour market, includ
ing a decline in 
long-term unemployment rates an
d in the average duration of 
unemployment spells, as well as an improve
ment in the matching process.   
In line with the usual lagg
ed response of the labou
r market, around 1.4 
million jobs are expected to be created this year in the euro area and 1.9 
million in the EU.  These figures shou
ld improve further in 2006 as growth 
regains momentum.  The euro-area unemployment rate is expected to 
diminish from 8.6% this year to 8.1% in 2007.  For the EU, the profile is 
similar, from a higher 
starting point of 8.7% th
is year to 8.1% in 2007. 
Boosted by such factors as rising ene
rgy prices and, to a lesser extent, the 
temporary impact of rises in indirect taxes and administered prices, 
headline inflation in the euro area remaine
d sticky this year.  On the other 
hand, since the second half of last year, core inflation has maintained a 
downward trend until recently.  Inflation expectations, as derived from 
index-linked bonds, c
ontinued to fall until 
mid-year, despite rising oil 
prices.  While rising slightly above 2% in
 the third quarter, the survey 
evidence suggests that second-round effects remain contained due to 
ongoing wage moderation and in spite of the continued increase in energy 
prices.  From an estimated average rate of 2.
3% in 2005, 
headline inflation 
is expected to edge lower to 2.2% next ye
ar and a further fall to 1.8% is 
foreseen for 2007.  For the EU as a whol
e, the projected profile over the 
forecast horizon is similar.  After an initial rise from 2.1% in 2004 to 2.3% 

this year, a decline is projected to 2.2% next year and 1.9% in 2007.   
Over the forecast horizon the general government deficit in the euro area is 
expected to mainly reflect cyclical developments.  It is forecast to rise to 
2.9% of GDP in 2005, up from 2.7% of
 GDP a year earlier, in the wake of 
slowing economic growth, and to dimi
nish again marginally in 2006 and 
2007 in the context of a moderate economic recovery.  Based on the usual 
assumption of unchanged po
licies, the fiscal stance is expected to be 
broadly neutral.  In the EU, the nom
inal deficit is expected to remain at 
2.7% of GDP throughout the forecast horizon.  Thanks to the planned 
fiscal adjustment effort in some non-euro area countries, the fiscal stance is 
expected to be slightly restrictive for the EU as a whole.   
Among the euro-area Member States, which are currently running an 
excessive deficit, Portugal, Greece, Germany and Italy are projected to 
achieve, to varying degrees, some fiscal
 consolidation in 2006.  In the case

6Overviewof Germany, current policies do not in
clude the 2006 draft budget, the 
presentation of which was delayed in view of the early elections in 
September.  In France, under current polic
ies, the deficit would rebound in 
2006, due to the expiry of a large on
e-off operation carried out in 2005.  
Overall, current polices are expected to be insufficient to bring the deficit 
below the reference value by the end of the forecast horizon in any of the 

euro-area Member States, which are 
currently under the excessive deficit 
procedure.  Euro-area Member States with
 a relatively favourable budget 
balance are expected to stabilise or 
slightly ease their fiscal position in 
2006 and beyond.  
Outside the euro area, the fiscal outlook across countries is relatively 
heterogeneous.  Among the six recen
tly-acceded Member States with an 
excessive deficit, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to further 
widen their budget deficit in 2006. 
 In the case of Hungary, the upward 
trend is projected to c
ontinue also in 
2007, when curren
t policies are likely 
to bring the deficit close to 7% of 
GDP.  Current policies are expected to 
keep the deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value in Poland and the 

United Kingdom.  By contrast, Cyprus 
is projected to co
rrect the excessive 
deficit by a small margin in 2005, 
followed by Slovak
ia and Malta in 2006. 
In the non euro-area Member States with 
a relatively favoura
ble budgetary 
position, current policies are mostly expected to produce a slight increase 
the deficit or to reduce the surplus.  The upward trend in the euro-area debt
 ratio observed since 2003 is not 
expected to reverse during the forecast period.  It is projected to reach 

71.8% of GDP in 2007, one percentage poi
nt higher than in 2004.  A 
similar development is expected in 
the EU, where the debt ratio is set to 
increase, to close to 64½% of GDP in 2007, up from 63½% of GDP in 

2004.  Concerning the respect of the 60% of GDP reference value, apart 
from Portugal, where the debt ratio is estimated to rise above 60% of GDP 
in 2005, no Member State is expected to cross the reference value over the 

forecast horizons, either from above or below.  Among the countries with a 
debt ratio above the 60% of GDP threshold, Belgium, Greece, Cyprus and 
Austria are projected to further reduce it up to 2007 (inclusive).  In Italy, 

following a sharp incr
ease in 2005, the debt ratio is also projected to 
decline slowly over the forecast horizon, mainly on account of the planned 
receipts from privatisations.  Conversely, a further increase in the debt 

ratio is expected to take place in Germany, France and Portugal.  
The central scenario in this forecast paints a picture of robust global 
economic growth, a sustained momentum in world trade growth and a 
return to potential growth
 in the euro area and the EU as a result of a 
strengthening of domestic demand.  
However, there are several factors that 
should be taken into account in assessing the risks to this forecast.   
The effects of the sharp rise in energy prices this year have been 
incorporated in the central scenario described above.  However, in view of 
the vulnerability of oil production and refining to
 further climatic, security 
and political-tension disrupti
ons, the possibility of
 even higher prices 
cannot be ruled out.  Although w
orld economic growth has withstood the 
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
7Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 effect of the oil-price shock well so far, it cannot be excluded that negative 
non-linear confidence effects might come into play in the relationship 
between energy prices and economic 
growth at higher price levels. 
The resilience of growth in the US has continued to surprise forecasters in 
recent years.  However, an adjustment of consumer behaviour in the US in 

the light of growing uncertainties about
 future income and the impact of 
rising interest rates 
cannot be ruled out.   
Global current account imbalances have continued to rise this year.  Hence, 
a disorderly correction of global imbalances remains a threat to world 
growth.  The new Chinese exchange rate policy may be seen as the first of 

a series of steps that would lead towards more burden-sharing in the 
correction of global imbalances.  Ho
wever, this step alone is not sufficient 
to alleviate fears that a large share of the burden of adjustment would fall 

on European exporters in the event of 
a disorderly unwinding of the 
imbalances.  Furthermore, an abrupt sh
ift in investor expectations 
regarding global economic growth and in
flation could lead to a severe 
correction in some asset prices, with a
dverse implications for both 
financial markets and the real economy.  
On the positive side, th
e counterbalancing effect of th
e behaviour of oil-
exporting countries should also be considered.  There is evidence to 
suggest that the EU has already benefited from the recycling of oil earnings 
from these countries.  Since the start of 2001, 
the value of EU exports to 
OPEC and the CIS has grown at a
nnualised rates of 13% and 20%, 
respectively, compared to 5.5% 
to the “rest of the world”.
  Should the oil-
exporting countries choose to spend a larger share of their additional 
income from oil on imports, the EU would be well placed to benefit from 

this extra demand.   
Internally, private consumption is su
bject to both 
upside and downside 
risks.  Consumer confidence could impro
ve by more than expected due to 
better labour market conditions and a 
reduction of uncertainty over future 
income streams, thanks to past or ongoing structural reforms.  Such a 

recovery in confidence could trigge
r a release of the pent-up demand, 
which has accumulated in the house
hold sector and which could be 
financed through a reductio
n in the saving rate.  
The nature of the risk associated with buoyant housing market in some Member States is difficult 
to assess.  The perceived wealth effects 
from rising housing prices could 
boost consumption expenditure, while 
a correction of the over-valuation of 
housing would work in the opposite direction.  
In the case of investment, positive risks arise from stronger growth of 
specific housing markets, 
stronger-than-expected ex
ternal demand or 
higher productivity as a result of IT-investments and past reforms.  
Negative risks include h
igher oil prices, a disappointing development of 
aggregate demand and entrenched low-growth expectations. 
Overall, the risks are tilted 
to the downside on the 
external side, but appear 
to be balanced on the domestic side. 
8OverviewIn the acceding and candidate countries, GDP growth is expected to remain 
relatively high over the forecast horizon, 
at more than 5% in Bulgaria, 
Romania and Turkey each year, while accelerating to nearly 4½% in 
Croatia in 2007.  Rising labour
 productivity and an expanding and 
modernised capital stock are the main sources of this continued expansion.  
In all countries, domestic demand should continue to outpace production, 

driven by a strong investment 
performance and also by private 
consumption.  In Bulgaria and Romani
a, private consumption expenditure 
has recently expanded particularly rapidly, and is set to decelerate only 

gradually over the forecast horizon. 
Inflation is forecast to decline or remain relatively subdued.  Rising 
productivity and competition in 
these economies and overall prudent fiscal 
and monetary policies are conducive to 
this outlook, combin
ed with a real 
appreciation of the currencies in
 some countries.  However, in all countries 
rising commodity prices are expected to weigh on inflation, for example by 
slowing down disinflation in Turkey 
and Romania or temporarily boosting 
inflation in Bulgaria and Croatia. 
Labour markets are likely to benefi
t from strong ou
tput growth:  
employment is forecast to rise, particularly in Turkey by more than 2% 

annually.  Unemployment rates are accordingly expected to decline, to 
around 7% in Romania in 2007, 9½% in Bulgaria and Turkey, and 12% in 
Croatia. Bulgaria is expected to show balance
d government balances and Romania 
is projected to have small deficits, also
 underpinned by
 strong economic 
growth.  In Croatia and Turkey, deficits
 are currently at higher levels, but 
are expected to narrow by 2007 to less th
an 3% in Turkey and around 3.5% 
in Croatia. In all the acceding and candidate countries, current account deficits have 
been widening during 2005, due to str
ong domestic demand, together with 
rising oil prices.  External imbalances are forecast to remain high, in 
particular in Bulgar
ia and Romania, where curr
ent account deficits are set 
to hover around 10% of GDP in 2006 and 2007, while they are expected to 
reach around 6% of GDP annually over the forecast horizon in Croatia and 
Turkey.Acceding and Candidate Countries 
9Chapter 1 The world economy 1. World economic activity to remain 
robust despite high oil prices The world economy is expected to continue to expand 
at a robust pace, despite the impact from higher 
energy prices and the negative effect of Hurricane 

Katrina on the US economy 
in the second half of this 
year.  This is accompanied by a slower, but still 
robust, expansion of world 
trade. Financial conditions 
remain supportive of globa
l growth with continued 
low long-term real interest rates and low risk premia 
on corporate and emerging market debt, although US 

short-term interest rates have been increasing due to 
ongoing removal of monetary policy accommodation 
in view of growing threats 
to inflation.  Growth in the 
demand for oil is expected to slow somewhat as 
global growth decelerates and as higher prices curb 
demand.  Nevertheless, oil prices are expected to 

remain high for the forecast horizon due to limited 
excess supply and refinery capacity and continuing 
concerns about the security of supply.  Although the 

world economy has, so far, with
stood higher oil prices 
quite well, high and volatile oil prices remain a 
significant source of downside risk for the world 
economy in the short 
term, in particular for oil-
importing countries.  Global current account 

imbalances are set to per
sist, implying ongoing 
downside risks related to a disorderly adjustment. 
Oil prices peak in the third quarter 
The high level of oil prices weighed on growth during 
the first half of the year and is currently one of the 
main sources of uncertainty 
surrounding the outlook 
for both the EU and the world economy.

Over the summer and early au
tumn, oil prices rose 
further, driven by concerns 
about supply disruptions 
and shortage of refining capacity.  In particular, 

Hurricane Katrina influence
d prices of crude oil by 
initially halting crude oil pro
duction by around 1.5 
million barrels per day (mb/d.), while global 

production was 84.7 mb/d. in August, according to the 
International Energ
y Agency (IEA).  As a result, oil 
prices initially jumped to new record levels in 

nominal terms, with the 
price of Brent crude futures 
climbing to around 68 USD/bl. around the end of 
August and the beginning of September.  In addition, 

Hurricane Katrina and the 
ensuing flooding also 
disrupted as much as a quarter of US refinery 
capacity.  This occurred at a time when refining 

capacity in the US was already 
stretched to the limit.  
The outcome was not only a jump in US petrol prices, 
but also a significant increase in petrol prices in 

Europe, as the prevailing market prices in the US 
prompted exports of petrol from Europe. 
The IEA Member States on 2 September to make 
available to the market an equivalent of 2 mb/d. of 
crude oil from reserves 
for an initial period of 30 days 
brought crude oil prices down from their record levels 

and reduced the pressure on 
petrol prices.  In addition, 
demand growth projections have been revised down 
somewhat recently by the IEA, also alleviating the 

pressure on crude oil prices.   
The easing of prices has occurred despite the fact that 
Hurricane Rita added to th
e disruption caused by 
Hurricane Katrina.  Nevertheless, the prices of both 

crude oil and refined products remain high. 
Since the end of last year, the price of oil (monthly 
averages) has risen by close to 50% in US dollar 
terms and around 60%, when measured in euro.  

However, the current price level in real terms and the 
pace of the recent price increases remain below the 
supply-driven price shock of 
the late 1970s and early 
1980s.  In real terms, th
e current price level is 
approximately 35% below the record highs of the 
early 1980s in US dollar terms.  Several factors imply 
upside risks to oil prices. Although slowing, demand 
is projected to remain robust.  In its October report, 
the IEA projected that oil demand would rise by 1.5% 
in 2005 and 2.1% in 2006.  In addition, in a more 
short-term perspective, the increased demand in the 

northern hemisphere winter season could also create 
some upward pressure on prices.

Oil prices - real and nominal
But the recent surge in oil prices is mostly seen to be 
due to concerns about s
upply developments.  Under-
investment in both crud
e production and refinery 
capacity, as a reaction to low oil prices and excess 
capacity in the refining sector in the 1980s and 1990s, 
has constrained supply capacities.  Higher oil prices should boost investment in new oil 
production and alternative energy sources.  However, 
since it takes several years for new investment in 

supply capacity to enter th
e market, the low level of 
spare capacity is likely to persist for some time.  
Lastly, the factors behind disr
uptions to production in 
important oil-producing
 countries, i.e. political 
instability, impact of hu
rricanes and ongo
ing security 
risks, are likely to remain present thereby increasing 

the risk premium and 
the volatility in oil prices. 
The high level of oil prices is, therefore, expected to 
prevail in the medium
-term, with current futures 
prices indicating that the 
price of oil would remain 
around 60 USD/bl. 
in 2006 and 2007. 
Compared to the assumption in the spring forecast of 
an average price of 48 USD/bl. in 2006, the 
assumption for oil prices in this forecast, based on 

current futures prices, implies that the average price 
of oil in 2006 would be 
about 28% higher at around 
61.4 USD/bl.  In 2007, the price is expected to be 
marginally lower, at 60.3 USD/bl., indicating that the 
market participants believe that th
e current level of oil 
prices will be maintained in the medium-term.

The pace of global economic growth has withstood 
rising energy prices quite well, bu
t it is likely that the 
increase in oil prices has had some impact on the 

global growth outlook.  Calculations based on 
simulations with DG Economic and Financial Affairs 
QUEST model suggest that a permanent 25% increase 

in oil prices – from a baselin
e of 48 USD/bl. (which 
also leads to higher prices for natural gas with a time 
lag) – could shave around 0.3 of a percentage point 

off euro-area GDP growth in the first year and 0.2 of a 
percentage point in th
e second. Eu
ro-area inflation would be raised by abou
t a quarter of a percentage 
point during the first two 
years after the shock.  The 
simulations take into accoun
t the repercussions on 
other regions of the world.  The impact on US growth 
is slightly higher and that on Japanese growth 
marginally lower, as a result of their respective higher 
and lower energy intensities.  
In the simulations, some recycling of higher revenues 
from oil-exporting countries is also taken into 
account.  There is evidence that the demand for 

imports by oil-exporting countries has been increasing 
strongly and that the EU has benefited more compared 
to previous episodes of rising oil prices.  Since 

January 2001, EU export values to OPEC and CIS 
countries grew at annualis
ed rates of 13% and 20%, 
respectively, compared with 5.5% average growth for 

exports to the rest of the world. 
Nevertheless, the majo
r oil-exporting countries have 
in general seen current acco
unt surpluses jump along 
with the oil price.  Such high current account 
14Chapter 1 The world economy 
surpluses are likely to persist, although imports driven 
by strong domestic demand are likely to lead to 
somewhat lower surpluses over the forecast horizon. 
While the world economy is therefore expected to 
withstand higher energy 
prices, the possibility of 
further oil price increases and the uncertainty 
surrounding the assessment of the impact of the price 

increase seen so far, including the possibility of 
second-round effects on inflati
on, imply that oil prices 
should be considered as one of the main sources of 

downside risks to the growth outlook. 
Financial conditions remain supportive of growth 
Although world growth has continued to be robust, 
with inflation creeping up 
in many countries due to 
higher energy prices, and the US Federal Reserve 

continuing to withdraw monetary policy stimulus, 
long-term interest rates remain low by historical 
standards.

g-term interest rates, euro area and US 
level
In the United States, th
e trend in long-term interest 
rates has remained relatively flat until recently, 
despite increases in short-term 
interest rates.    In the 
euro area, long-term interest rates declined further in 
2005, but have also increased very recently in view of 
concerns about inflation and market expectations of a 

tightening of monetary policy.  Low interest rates also 
benefited emerging market economies, as emerging 
market spreads remain at historically low levels.  

While low interest rates are supportive of growth, 
they also imply risks for th
e outlook, in particular in 
the medium-term, given th
at global current account 
imbalances persist and that 
inflationary pressures 
following higher oil prices could yet emerge. 
An important development in currency markets was 
the decision by the 
Chinese authorities to allow some 
flexibility in the ex
change rate of the 
yuan renminbi.  
So far, however, this has not caused any significant 
shifts in Asian currencies, 
but some gradual 
appreciation is expected in the coming years.  Among 
the major currencies, the euro exchange rate has 
continued to depreciate ag
ainst the dollar, although 
the dollar weakened tem
porarily in the wake of 
Hurricane Katrina.  Vis-à-
vis the Japanese yen, the 
euro is roughly unchanged 
compared to earlier in the 
year, but it has appreciated somewhat in recent 
months, reversing the depreciation earlier in the year. 
Stock markets have also been supportive of growth, 
contributing to t
he favourable financing conditions for 
firms.  In Japan and Europe, equity prices have 
continued to in
crease on the back 
of solid profit 
developments, whereas US equities have been 

relatively flat, as profit growth
 has passed its peak. 
World growth set to remain robust 
Following a relatively strong first 
quarter, the global 
economy lost some momentum in the second quarter.  

This was mainly due to a slowdown in the 
manufacturing sector which was
 hit by rising oil 
prices.  Over the summer, momentum improved once 

again and, despite the impact of Hurricane Katrina, 
the world economy is expected to continue to grow at 
robust rates over the forecast 
horizon.  For 2005, the 
world economy, excluding the EU Member States, is 
set to grow by 5.1% (pps we
ighted), slowing slightly 
to 4.9% in 2006 and 4.6% in 2007.  
TheUS economy is expected to ma
intain its role as an 
important driver of world 
growth, altho
ugh growth 
should gradually slow down 
as private consumption 
growth is projected to moderate.  In the first three 

quarters of the year, the US economy continued to 
expand above its long-term potential, boosted by 
strong growth in consumer spending and solid growth 

in business fixed investment and residential 
construction.  Despite the continued relatively strong 
growth momentum over the summer, it is expected 
that the growth out-turn later on this year will be 
affected by Hurricane Katrina, as a result of the 

disruptions to economic activity in the affected area 
and the effects of soaring energy prices.  Overall, an 
15Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 annual growth rate of 3.5
% is projected for this year, 
0.1 pp lower than the spring forecast.  The clean-up 
and rebuilding of the hurricane-affected area is likely 

to raise GDP growth in the first half of next year.  
Once this positive effect fades away, growth is 
projected to slow in conjunction with a gradual 

deceleration of consumer spending.  Higher interest 
rates, along with slowing increases in house prices, 
should stimulate personal sa
ving.  The cooling down 
of the housing market should also curb growth in 
residential investment. 
All in all, the US economy is projected to grow by 
3.2% in 2006, falling to 
a below-potential rate of 2.7% in 2007.  Due to th
e cost of the rebuilding effort 
following the hurricanes, the 
US government deficit is 
set to expand to around 5% 
of GDP in 2006.  Despite 
an improved export performance, the current account 
deficit is projected to grow partly due to energy prices 
and a deteriorating investme
nt income balance. As 
also noted in chapter 6, th
ere are several risks to the 
outlook, with short-term ups
ide risks to private 
consumption growth if housing prices continue to 
experience strong growth and downside risks relating 
to possible unwinding of the US imbalances. 
InJapan
, the economy has bounced back from the 
technical recession seen in mid-2004.  Strong GDP 
growth in the first half 
of the year was mainly fuelled 
by a rebound in domestic demand.  Looking ahead, 
the Japanese economy is expected to sustain an 
expansion above potential in the coming quarters.  

With the global economi
c environment remaining 
supportive of GDP growth and domestic demand 
maintaining its current momentum
, this should lead to 
annual GDP growth of 2.5% in 2005 (well over the 
1.1% figure of the spring forecast).  On the external 
side, despite an acceleration of imports associated 

with stronger domestic demand, net exports are also 
projected to support GDP 
growth.  On the domestic

ofit growth, continued

suggest that the increase

confidence should underpin consumption.  Growth is

 and 1.8% in 2007.  Core 
inflation is projected to turn

16Chapter 1 The world economy 
beginning of next year.  However, it should remain 
low in 2006, despite the narrowing of the output gap 
and high oil prices.  The fiscal deficit is set to 

decrease over the forecast horizon, due to the 
improvement in the economic situation and fiscal 
consolidation, but will remain high. 
For Asia 
(excl. Japan)as a whole, many countries 
witnessed a deceleration in export growth in early 
2005, partly explained by th
e cyclical downturn in the 
technology sector and slower import growth in China.  

In the second half of 2005, exports from Asia are 
generally expected to register strong rates of growth, 
as the IT sector experiences a cyclical upturn and 

exports to China rebound. 
 At 7.2%, the autumn 
forecast for real GDP growth in the Asian region in 
2005 is slightly higher than
 that predicted in the 
spring (7.1%), primarily due to the upward revision of 
Chinese growth from 8.5% to 9.3%.  Overall, growth 
is set to remain around 7%
 throughout the forecast 
horizon.  Growth in other Asian economies is 
expected to stabilize, underp
inned by more balanced 
growth of domestic demand and exports.  Despite 
steps towards greater exchang
e rate flexibility, which 
is expected to result in a gradual appreciation of non-

Japan Asian currencies and a transition toward more 
reliance on domestic demand 
as driver of
 growth, the 
current account surplus for the region as a whole is 

expected to remain s
ubstantial for the foreseeable future. 
GDP growth in 
China remained buoyant in the first 
half of 2005, with an 
extension of the already-
observed trend of a modest sh
ift in the composition of 
growth away from investment and towards net 
exports.  Private consumption has continued to grow 

at a healthy pace, supported by rising rural income 
and strong job creation.  Growth is expected to 
moderate in the second half of 2005, averaging about 

9.3% for 2005 as a whole, 
before slowing to 8.7% in 
2006 and 8.2% in
 2007.  The growth slowdown is 
expected to come mainly from a deceleration in 

investment spending in 2005, combined with a decline 
in net export growth in 2006
 and 2007.  Investment 
growth is foreseen to rem
ain constrained by restrictive 
macroeconomic policies.  In a
ddition, the observed squeeze in corporate profit margins due to higher 

commodity prices and wages should also help to 
moderate investment spending, particularly since 
retained earnings are a key source of investment 

financing.  Consumption growth is projected to 
remain strong and to increasingl
y contribute to output 
growth, supported by government efforts to boost 
rural income and employment.  On the external side, a 

continuation of strong export growth is likely in 2005.  
Import growth is set to pick up during the remainder 
of 2005, as inventories have been run down, while 

remaining below the 2004 level due to lower 
investment growth and incr
eased domestic supply of 
import substitutes.  The 
resulting larger trade surplus 
is forecast to lead to an increase in the current account 
surplus of about 2 pps of GDP in 2005.  For 2006 and 
2007, the trade and current account surpluses are 

expected to stay close to this higher level. 
For the 
Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS) countries
, economic growth is also expected to 
be strong in the coming years.  The Russian economy 

is set to expand by around
 6% annually in 2005-2007.  
Given the projected sub
stantial fiscal expansion in 
2006 and the potential for 
higher oil prices, however, 
there is an upside 
risk at least to the 
short-run outlook.  
Robust Russian demand growth and sustained high 
levels of commodity prices 
are likely to complement 
strong domestic demand growth in the other CIS 
countries.  GDP growth in 20
05 in these countries is 
projected to reach over 8%, despite a significant 
slowdown in Ukraine, the second largest CIS 
economy. For the remainder of the forecast period, 

growth is expected to remain at about 8%. 
Economic growth in the 
Middle East and North Africa 
region was strong in the first half of 2005 and 
is projected to remain so throughout the forecast 

period, with real GDP growt
h rates of around 5% in 
each forecast year.  On the external side, the region’s 
oil export volume is projected to grow by 3-4% 

annually during the forecast period and non-oil export 
growth should also remain strong for most countries.  
Import growth is expected to be high, supported by 

oil-price-driven improvements in
 the terms of trade.  
Trade and current account surpluses for the oil-
exporting countries are likely to
 improve substantially 
in 2005 and 2006, be
fore stabilising in 2007. 
Latin America andsub-Saharan Africa
 are also 
expected to experience sustained robust growth.  Both 

regions are benefiting from high prices of primary 
commodities and the relatively strong world growth.
17Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 1. Growth decelerated in the first half of 
2005Renewed growth weakness in the first half of 2005 
Real GDP growth is estimated 
to slow down this year 
to 1.5% in the EU and 
1.3% in the euro area, from 
2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in 2004.  This represents 

a downward revision of 0.5 pp for the EU and 0.3 pp 
for the euro area with respect to the spring forecasts.  
Reflecting an external environment characterised by 
soaring oil prices as well as a deceleration in world 

growth and trade, albeit from the vibrant expansion of 
the previous year, economic
 activity in the EU 
showed renewed weakness during the first half of 

2005.  Following a modest acceleration to 0.4% 
(q-o-q) in the first quarter of 2005, real GDP growth 
slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter in the euro area, 

while it remained unchanged
 at 0.4% in the EU.  The 
latter outturn was one tenth of a percentage point 
lower than expected in the spring for the EU and two 

tenths of a percentage point lower for the euro area.

% change on previous period
In terms of the composition of growth, however, the 
picture emerging from the quarterly national accounts 
data is more encouraging.  A weakening of domestic 

demand (excluding inventories), following the 
improvement in the second half of 2004, was behind 
the moderate level of growth
 in the first half of the 
year.  However, the data for the second quarter of 
2005 showed signs of improving domestic activity.  
Indeed, a mild pick-up of domestic demand in the 

second quarter of this year more than offset the 
negative impulse from the 
external side in the euro 
area.   
At the country level, the growth acceleration in the 
first quarter of 2005 was driv
en by the strong pick-up 
in Germany (0.8%, up from
 -0.1% in the previous 
quarter).  The slowdown 
in the second quarter also 
reflected a marked deceleration in Germany (0.0%) 

and France (0.1%).  Noticeably, some countries even 
registered a contraction of economic activity in the 
course of the first half of 2
005.  Given these lacklustre 
performances and the fact that working-day 
adjustments may have exaggerated the extent of the 
rebound in Germany in the 
first quarter of 2005, the 
euro-area recovery was not able to regain much 
momentum in the 
first half of this year. 
Volatile contributions from net exports 
The turnaround observed in the contribution of net 
exports to growth in the 
first half of the year resulted 
from the more pronounced swings in the evolution of 
imports compared to exports.  In the EU and the euro 
area, both export and import growth had been on a 
downward path since the third quarter of last year.  
This culminated in a contraction in the first quarter of 

2005 that was about three 
times larger for imports 
than for exports. 
Accordingly, after having
 depressed growth during 
the second half of 
2004, the contribution of net 
exports turned positive in the first quarter of 2005 in 
both the EU and the euro area (0.4 and 0.3 pp 
respectively).  In the subsequent quarter, however, 

imports rebounded strongly, outpacing the pick-up of 
exports.  This pushed the growth contribution of net 
exports to zero in the EU 
and into slightly negative 
territory in the euro area (-0.
1 pp).  Nonetheless, due 
to the first-quarter outcome, the average contribution 
from net exports in the first 
half of 2005 still came out 
slightly positive in both the EU and the euro area. 
While the downward trend 
in import growth observed 
up to the first quarter of 2005 was in line with weak 
final demand, the deceleration in the growth of 

exports may be attributed 
to the slowdown in world 
trade growth and the previous appreciation of the 
euro.  According to estima
tes by the CPB Netherlands 
Bureau of Economic 
Policy Analysis, world trade 
expanded at double-digit rates (y-o-y) during the first 

half of 2004 and decelerated below 5% by the end of 
the first quarter of 2005.  
In parallel, the euro-area real 
21Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 effective exchange rate (REER) rose in the last 
quarter of 2004 to its stron
gest level in the last six 
years, implying a considerable
 deterioration of euro-
area price and cost competitiveness.  However, world 
trade growth rebound
ed once again in the second 
quarter, to around 7% 
(y-o-y), while the REER has 
depreciated since the start of the year, as the euro 
eased from the historical highs reached at the turn of 
the year.  Euro-area cost comp
etitiveness improved by 
about 2% in the second quarter of 2005 vis-à-vis the 
previous quarter, and by close to 3% compared to the 
last quarter of 2004.

At the country level, the 
performance in terms of cost 
competitiveness has continued to vary greatly, with 
Germany and the Netherlands seeing improvements 
over the first two quarters of 2005, while Greece, 

Spain, Italy and Ireland recorded further losses. 
Nearly stagnant private consumption 
Following a sharp rebound in 
the last quarter of 2004, 
private consumption growth
 slowed markedly during 
the first half of 2005 in both the EU and the euro area.  

It grew by merely 0.1% q-o-q in the first quarter, 
down from 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2004, in both 
regions.  In the following quarter, private 

consumption growth accelerated slightly to 0.2% in 
the EU, but remained unchanged in the euro area. 
The near stagnation of consumption growth during the 
first half of 2005 reflects 
a deterioration of consumer 
confidence.  According to the EU Harmonised 
surveys, consumers became more pessimistic about 
employment prospects on
ce again, against the 
background of a marginally 
improving but still high 
unemployment rate.  The surveys also revealed 
perceptions on the part of consumers of slightly 

stronger price trends.  Such perceptions are likely to 
have been influenced by the fact that the euro-dollar 
exchange rate movements provided less shelter than 

during 2004 against the sharp rises in energy prices 
experienced during the first half of 2005.

Continued robust credit growth to households 
The subdued growth 
of private consumption stands in 
contrast with continued high level of liquidity and 
robust credit growth in the euro-area economy.  
Monetary data up to and including the third quarter of 

2005 confirmed the pers
istence of strong monetary 
dynamics observed since mid-2
004.  M3 growth 
increased to 8.5% in the year to September 2005.  

This strengthening of monetary dynamics continued 
to be driven, on the counterpart 
side, mainly by strong 
expansion of credit to the private sector.  This can be 
seen as a response to the historically very low levels 
of interest rates in the eu
ro area.  The annual rate of 
growth of Monetary and Financial Institutions (MFI) 
loans to the private sector rose to 8.6% in the year to 
September 2005.  The main contribution to this 

expansion came from lending to households for house 
purchase, which grew at an annual rate of 10.5% in 
September 2005.  These developments suggest that 

ongoing robust credit expansion to households may be 
contributing to strong hous
e price dynamics in several 
parts of the euro area.  Set against a combination of 

ample liquidity and strong
 credit growth, buoyant 
housing markets might constitute a risk to the growth

price increases in property markets in some parts of

it is still an open question 
whether buoyant housing ma

source of wealth effects that would support 
consumption at an opportune time in the cycle.

Moreover, the saving rate of households in the euro 
area is set to decline slightly over the forecast horizon, 

from 14.4% in 2005 to 14.2% 
in 2007.  Nevertheless, 
the projected decline in the saving rate is not 
sufficient to reverse the rise 
observed at the beginning 
of this decade.  However, developments at the 
aggregate level mask divergences across countries.  
Among the larger euro-area 
countries, for instance, 
the saving rate is expected to remain broadly stable in 
Italy and France, decline slightly in Germany and 
more markedly in Spain. 
Subdued investment spending 
In both the EU and the eu
ro area, investment spending 
has, so far this year, failed to 
build on th
e momentum 
achieved in the second 
half of last year.  Despite solid 
earnings growth and supportiv
e financing conditions, 
the evolution of fix
ed capital formation was 
considerably weaker than expected in the spring 

forecasts.  In the first quarter of 2005, the revised 
national accounts data show 
no investment growth in 
the EU and a contraction of capital spending by 0.2% 

in the euro area.  In the subsequent quarter, 
investment growth picked up 
to 0.6% in the EU and to 
0.5% in the euro area.

The weakness of capital formation in the first quarter 
of the year and the subsequ
ent upturn were essentially 
attributable to marked swing
s in investment in the 
construction sector.  In th
e first quarter of 2005, 
construction investment 
in the euro area contracted by 
1.1%, the largest quarterly contraction in the last four 
years.  Bad weather conditions, in particular in 

Germany, contributed to this outcome.  Growth in 
equipment investment, by co
ntrast, picked up sharply, 
from -1.1% (q-o-q) in the last quarter of 2004 to 1.7% 

in the first quarter of 2005.  In the subsequent quarter, 
a moderation of equipment 
investment (to 0.8%) was 
accompanied by a marked rebound of construction 

investment (to 1.3%).

Comparing the current performance with past

current upswing is relativ

previous upturns, invest
ment spending has not 
increased as a share of GDP so far.  This suggests 
that, on top of the sluggishness of the recovery, 
investment may be held back by a number of longer-

well as by labour force developments.

Sizeable growth differences across Member States 
Growth dispersion among euro-area countries, as 
indicated by the gap between the highest and the 
lowest growth rates, remained wide in the first half of 
2005.  For instance, in the second quarter of 2005, 

economic activity contracted
 by 1.6% q-o-q in 
Finland, whereas it expanded by 1.2% in the 
Netherlands.   A sizable dispersion in growth rates 

was again particularly noticeable among the four 
largest Member States, where the gap increased to 
about 1.2 pps on average during the first half of 2005.  

This followed a widening of dispersion last year, 
when the gap rose from 0.3 pp in the first quarter of 
2004 to a full pe
rcentage point in 
the final quarter of 
that year.  A peak in dispersion was registered in the 
first quarter of 2005, when Italy registered a 
contraction of 0.5%, while economic activity 

expanded in Germany by 0.8%.  In the subsequent 
quarter, the gap narrowed somewhat, with Germany 
and France showing almost flat activity, while Spain 

and Italy recorded growth rates of 0.9% and 0.7%, 
respectively.  Although, as mentioned earlier, some of 
the recent dispersion in gro
wth rates is also likely to be due to the effects of wo
rking-day 
adjustments, the issue has raised some concern.  Further analysis 
shows that, even though cyclical elements continue to 
play a non-negligible role
, a significant part of the 
dispersion can be attributed to differences in trend 
growth rates across countries.  The analysis also 
shows that the factors driving growth in this upturn 

differ considerably across Member States.

countries, as well as in the Czech Republic and

second quarter of 2005. 
24Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
Box 2.1:
 Some specificities behind the forecasts   
Exchange rates 
For currencies in ERM II, constant nominal exchange rates 
are assumed. This means that the central rate of these 
currencies against the euro will remain constant over the 
forecast period. The currencies are: the DKK (Danish krone), 
the EEK (Estonian kroon), the CYP (Cyprus pound), the 
LVL (Latvian lats), the LTL (Lithuanian litas), the MTL 
(Maltese lira) and the SIT (Slovenian tolar). Constant real 
exchange rates (that is nominal rates adjusted for changes in 
GDP deflators) are assumed for the CZK (Czech koruna), the 
HUF (Hungarian forint), the PLN (Polish zloty), the SKK 
(Slovakian koruna), the SEK (Swedish krona) and the GBP 
(sterling). Constant real exchange rates are also assumed for 
non-EU currencies.  
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the fourth quarter of 2005, calculated on the 
basis of historical values from 19 October to 2 November 
2005. The average USD/EUR rate for the fourth quarter of 
2005 was 1.20 and the JPY/EUR rate 138.9.  This leads to 
implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.25 in 2005, 1.21 in 
2006 and 1.22 in 2007, and average JPY/EUR rates of 136.7, 
137.3 and 135.7 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively.  
Interest rates 
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the price 
stability objective of monetary policy.  Long-term interest 
rate assumptions are based on developments in short-term 
rates and an assessment of economic conditions.  Attention is 
paid to international financial linkages, market expectations 
and budgetary developments. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are forecas
t taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid 
to futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, 
projected to be 55.0 USD/bl in 2005, 61.4 USD/bl in 2006 
and 60.3 USD/bl in 2007. Prices of primary commodities, 
excluding fuels, are assumed to increase by 7.4% in 2005, 
1.3% in 2006, and to decline by approximately 1% in 2007.  
In 2005, the prices of all groups, except for agricultural 
products, are expected to increase compared to 2004. 
Chain linking In order to improve the accuracy of GDP growth estimates, 
National Accounts have moved to ‘chain linking’ in several 
Member States to incorporate more up-to-date price weights. 
Chain-linking refers to an alternative volume measure using 
the previous year’s prices (instead of prices from a given 
base year) which are then ‘chained’ together. Forecasts for  
10 Member States (namely CZ, DE, ES, FR, IE, NL, AT, PL, 
PT and SI) have been made using the new volume measure. 
Budgetary data Data for 2004 are based on government debt and deficit data 
transmitted by Member States to the European Commission 
in September 2005. In publishing these data, Eurostat has 
indicated that, for certain Member States (the Czech 
Republic, Greece and Portugal), it “has reservations on the 
quality of the data”. For 2006, budgets adopted or presented 
to parliaments and all other measures known in sufficient 
detail are taken into consideration. For 2007, the "no-policy 
change" assumption used in the forecasts implies the 
extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends and the 
inclusion of measures that are known in sufficient detail at 
the time of the completion of the forecast. 
The general government balances reported by Member States 
to the European Commission may be different from those 
published in the national accounts, because of an amendment 
to ESA95. According to Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on 
the reclassification of settlements under swap agreements 
and forward rate agreements, interest flows under swaps have been reclassified from “income property” to “financial 
account”. However, the Regulation states the need for 
specific treatment of these flows for data transmitted under 
the excessive deficit procedure (EDP), allowing for interest 
expenditure to include swaps, contrary to ESA95 new rules. 
In the forecasts, it is the EDP definition of the general 
government balance that is presented.  
The revisions in GDP following FISIM allocations (financial 
services indirectly measured) will only be taken into 
consideration for the calculations of the deficit- and debt- to-
GDP ratios in spring 2006, although FISIM allocations have 
been implemented by 10 Member States already (namely 
DK, DE, EE, ES, FR, IE, NL, AT, FI and SI).  
Calendar effects on GDP
 growth and output gaps 
Last year was a leap year. Compared to the average number 
of working days, there were 2.8 additional working days in 
2004. This translates to an estimated impact of 0.24 pp on 
the GDP growth rate for the euro area in 2004. On the other 
hand, for 2005, the effect is estimated at a negative 0.13 pp. 
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, while quarterly national accounts figures of 
most countries are. The calculation of potential GDP, from 
which the output gap is derived, does not involve any 
adjustment for the number of working days in the leap year, 
because this is considered to be temporary, which should not 
affect the cyclically-adjusted balances. 
252. Financial conditions remain supportive 
of growth in the EU Financing conditions have improved Financing prospects and costs in the euro area, which 
were already favourable in 
the spring, have improved 
further, for both corporatio
ns (a term used in this 
section for non-financial corporations) and 
households.  However, th
ese favourable financing 
conditions have not yet tri
ggered a significant pick-up 
in investment or private consumption.  
Interest rates on bank lend
ing and direct financing 
remain at very low levels, 
in both nominal and real 
terms; although nomina
l market-based interest rates 
have risen in recent weeks.  Interest rates on bank 
lending, which is still the 
predominant source of 
external funding for both sectors, have declined 

steadily since 2003 and have remained at very low 
levels in recent months.  
The decline in interest rates 
has been pronounced for 
corporate and mortgage 
lending, while rates for consumer credit retreated 
more modestly.   
Further evidence of increasingly favourable financing 
conditions can be derive
d from the ECB bank lending 
survey, which shows a contin
uous amelioration in the 
terms of credit conditio
ns for both the corporate sector 
and households.  More r
ecently, however, the banks’ 
credit stance toward the two sectors has begun to 
diverge, remaining on an easing stance in respect of 

companies but reverting toward “neutral” in respect of 
households.  In addition to the decline in interest rates 
on bank lending, financing
 conditions in
 corporate 
bond markets also remain 
favourable due to the 
continued subdued level of interest rates and the fact 
that corporate bond spreads remain close to historical 

lows. Euro-area equity prices have been on a sustained 
upward trend since the 
end of April 2005, having 
fluctuated in a fairly na
rrow range in previous months.  However, evidence suggests that companies 
have yet to return to 
equity issuance as a major 
external funding option.  
While there is considerable 
variation across Member States, the euro-area equity 
markets – in line with broader European and Japanese 
share prices - have tended to 
outperform US markets.  
Robust global growth, im
proved profitab
ility outlook, increasing dividend payments and share buyback 

activity and increased merger and acquisition activity 
are factors that have contributed to the increases in 
equity prices.  Corporate balance-sheet restructuring advanced 
Investment activity in the euro area has been sluggish 
for several years amid a gradual decline in the net 
financial position of non-finan
cial corporations to less 
than 0.5% of GDP in 2
004, as suggested by financial 
accounts data.  The decline in net lending reflects 
weak demand and can be explained as a reaction to 

the accumulation of substantial corporate debt in the 
period 1999-2001.

More specifically, companies have made use of low 
interest rates to re-finance 
existing debt, while 
simultaneously limiting thei
r expenditure on physical 
investment.  As a result, the level of accumulated 
corporate debt has stabilised at about 62% of GDP 
since 2002. As a result of lower interest rates and balance-sheet 
restructuring, companies ha
ve reduced their debt-
servicing costs, with net interest payments to the 
banking sector declining to
 slightly over 1.5% of GDP 
in the second quarter of th
is year.  This development 
is also mirrored in the growing accumulation of cash 
balances within the corporate sector.  In that context, 

the question arises as to what the corporate sector is 
planning to do with those 
funds: dividend payouts and 
share buy backs and/or preparing forthcoming 

investment and spe
nding decisions. 
If the latter option is chosen, the improvement in 
company balance sheets since 
2001 has laid the 
ground for a future acceleration in investment 

expenditure and recent developments are encouraging 
in this regard.

For example, mainly as a result of a pick-up in bank

y-o-y growth in non-fin
ancial corporate deposits at 
banks and the corresponding growth of bank loans to 
the sector.  In August 2005
, the ratio of outstanding 
bank loans to the non-financial corporate sector and 

the corporate sector's bank deposits was about 3:1. In 
addition, total demand for ex
ternal funding – although 
still markedly below earlier expansionary periods – 
seems to be recovering.  Las
tly, rising equity prices 
also suggest a brightening in the business outlook and 
the most recent ECB bank lending survey predicts 

higher loan demand later this year.  However, given 
the still-high level of corpo
rate debt, companies 
remain vulnerable to any negative economic shock, 

insofar as further repair of balance sheets could then 
become necessary with negative implications for 
investment.

The euro-area household sector 
In contrast to the corporate sector, and as mentioned 
in section 1 of this chap
ter, euro-area households have responded to favourable finan
cing conditions in recent 
years by accumulating debt.  Bank lending to 
households has picked up progressively since the 

beginning of 2003, accelerating to an annual rate 
slightly above 8% in the first three quarters of 2005.  
Pronounced growth
 in mortgage lending, which 
represents nearly 70% of total outstanding loans to 
households, has been the main co
ntributor to the rise 
in total lending to 
households. However, growth in 
consumer credit has also accelerated from 2% at the 
end of 2003 to around 7% 
in 2005.  On this basis, the 
financial outlook for the 
household sector is unclear.  
While a positive wealth effect might be expected from 
the recent rise in the price of housing and other assets, 
increased debt liabilities are a cause for concern.

%%Developments in non-euro-area Member States 
Despite accumulated non-financial corporate debt of 
78% of GDP, no significant problems have been 

reported at an aggregate level in the United Kingdom.  
Corporate debt levels in Swed
en continue to
 decline, 
falling to 65% of GDP in 2004 from 70% in 2003, 

while corporate debt in Denmark was about 85% in 
2004.  In all three countries, household debt is at a 
very high level, mostly secured against housing.  
While corporate and household debt levels remain 

relatively low in the recently-acceded Member States, 
many of these are experiencing an accelerated 
financial convergence, as evidenced by the strong 

pace of credit growth to the private sector.  While 
strong credit growth is expected to boost economic 
performance, it also poses some risks such as 

financing an unsustaina
ble rise in demand, 
vulnerability to exchange-rate or interest-rate shocks 
and inefficient credit allocation.
  Consequently, the 
challenge for affected Member States is to ensure the 
soundness of the financial secto
r so as to deliver 
growth supportive financing 
conditions in the medium 
term.

283. A gradual return to potential growth 
(with alternative risk scenarios) A gradual return to potential in 2006 
While growth has disappointed in 2005 – annual GDP 
growth is estimated to be 1.3% in the euro area and 
1.5% in EU – the conditions remain in place for a 

return to potential at 
the start of 2006
 in the absence 
of further shocks.  The foreca
st envisages annual GDP 
growth of 1.9% in the euro area and 2.1% in EU in 

2006, followed by a further improvement to 2.1% and 
2.4%, respectively, in 2007. 
Extending the pattern which 
emerged in the second 
quarter of this year, the rebound is driven almost 

exclusively by a strengthening of domestic demand in 
the euro area and the EU, with a marginal contribution 
from the external sector.   
Within domestic demand, the growth impulse stems 
mainly from a strong acceleration in gross fixed 
capital formation, especially next year.  The positive 
outlook for investment is supported by a marked 

recovery in business confidence, especially in the 
manufacturing sector, in recent months.  The case for 
a strengthening of investment
 growth is underpinned 
by favourable financial 
conditions, improved balance 
sheets, wider profit margins, and an increasing need 

for replacement investment.

The projected pick-up in private consumption over the 
forecast horizon is more gradual than in the case of 
investment.  The fact that euro-area consumer 

confidence remains below its long-term average and 
below the level recorded at a similar stage of the 
recovery in previous cycles supports such a profile.  
However, good progress in the implementation of 
structural reforms in some countries has resolved 

some uncertainties, which have acted as a brake on 
consumption in the past.  And although purchasing

29Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 higher energy prices, the projected acceleration in job 
creation and fall in unemployme
nt should provide a 
boost to private consumption expenditure in 2007.  
Risks and alternative scenarios 
The risks on the external
 side are tilted to the 
downside.  
World demand could be str
onger if the projected 
deceleration of growth in the US and Asia is less than 
anticipated.  Indeed, the resilience of the US and 

emerging Asian economies has continued to surprise 
forecasters in recent years.  Moreover, the behaviour 
of oil-exporting countries should also be considered.  

Should these countries choose to spend a larger share 
of their additional income 
from oil on imports, the EU 
should continue to be well placed to benefit from this 

extra demand. The EU has large export-market shares 
in OPEC, CIS and Norway, in particular.   
In view of the sharp rise in oil prices this year, the 
possibility of even h
igher prices than 
projected in the 
central scenario cannot be ruled out.  The downside 
risk of higher oil prices 
is also related to the 
uncertainty about the imp
act of higher oil prices.  
Business and consumer confidence could be more 
negatively affected by a percentage-point rise in the 

oil price at higher price levels. These so-called “non-
linear” effects could then lead to a stronger adverse 
impact on the economy than already observed.  
It must also be acknowledged that global current 
account imbalances continue to rise.  Accordingly, a 
disorderly correction of gl
obal imbalances (with much 
volatility in financial markets) 
cannot be ruled out.  
The new Chinese exchange rate policy may be seen as 
the first of a series of steps that would lead towards a 
more broad-based sharing of the burden of the 

correction of global imbalances. 
 But this step alone is 
not sufficient to alleviate fears that a large share of the 
burden of adjustment 
would fall on European 
exporters in the event of a disorderly unwinding of the 
imbalances.  
Finally, a possible abr
upt shift in investor 
expectations regarding global economic growth and 
inflation could lead to
 a severe correction in some 
asset prices.  The current level of asset prices suggests 

that a sustained economic recovery and low inflation 
are fully discounted.  Revisions in these expectations 
would affect both financial markets and the real 
economy.

Unemployment and private consumption, euro area
Forecast
The risks on the domestic
 side appear to be more 
balanced. 
Several factors pose 
a risk to the 
outlook for private 
consumption.  Higher 
oil prices represent an 
important threat to real disposa
ble income.  On the 
other hand, consumer confi
dence could improve by 
more than expected, due to better labour market 
conditions and a reduction of uncertainty over future 
income streams, as a result of ongoing and past 
structural reforms.  Such an increase in confidence 
could trigger the release of the pent-up demand that 

has accumulated among private consumers.  This 
could, in turn, be financed through a reduction in the 
savings rate.  As already men
tioned in the first section 
of this chapter, the effect of the buoyant housing 
market in some Member States is difficult to predict.  
Unanticipated housing we
alth effects could boost 
consumption, while a correction of the over-valuation 
of housing could work in th
e opposite direction, with 
negative confidence effects for households. 
In the case of investment, positive risks are linked to 
stronger growth of specific 
housing markets, stronger-
than-expected external dema
nd or higher productivity 
as a result of past IT-investments and past reforms.  

Negative risks include higher oil prices, a 
disappointing development of overall demand and 
entrenched low-growth expectations. 
Overall
, risks are tilted somewhat to the downside in 
this forecast. 30Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU

It is worth exploring what 
the implications would be, 
should some of the risks materialise.  Accordingly, 
two alternative scenarios were simulated and these are 
summarised in the box below. In the worse-case 

scenario, GDP growth in the euro area and the EU 
would be reduced by around ½ pp in both 2006 and in 
2007, compared to the central scenario. In the better-

case scenario, GDP growth in the euro area and the 
EU would be raised by 0.3 and 0.1 pp, respectively, in 
2006 and 2007. 
31Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 Box 2.2:
 Simulation of alternative scenarios 
A worse-case scenario was simulated by applying a number 
of simultaneous shocks in the QUEST model.  The shocks 
include: 
(1) An additional increase in oil prices to a “permanent” 80 
USD/barrel level from the fourth quarter of 2005 onwards; 
(2) A similar rise in natural gas prices with a six-month lag;  
(3) A substantial reduction in private consumption growth in 
the US: by 1.2 pps, which could be linked to a marked 
slowdown in the housing market and a consequent increased 
propensity to save.  In addition, a reduction in US investment 
by 1.8 pps is also assumed. 
Furthermore, higher oil prices and the reduced demand from 
the US are also assumed to have an impact on the rest of the 
world.  Accordingly, GDP growth would be cut by around 
1¼ pps in Asia, while growth in other regions (except OPEC, 
CIS and Norway) would be reduced by 1¾ pps.  
The combined effects of the shocks described above is a 
marked slowdown in US GDP growth (which is lowered by 
1.1 pps compared to the central scenario) and in world 
growth (excluding EU15) by 1.2 pps in 2006 and a further 
0.9 pp in 2007.  This would cause global growth to fall to 
between 3 to 3½%. 
Higher oil prices and reduced global growth would limit the 
EU and the euro-area GDP growth as well.  Overall, GDP 
growth would be reduced by around ½ pp in both 2006 and 
in 2007 in the euro area and the EU25.  This is mainly due to 
the impact of higher oil prices, which reduces growth by 
around 0.3-0.4 percentages points in both years.

GDP growth differentials in the alternative (worse-case)  vs. the 
central scenario
Compared to the central scenario, the alternative scenario 
would imply a downward revision of GDP growth from 
1.9% to 1.3% in 2006 and from 2.1% to 1.6% in 2007 in the 
euro area.  Similarly, EU GDP growth would be cut back 
from the central scenario of 2.1% to 1.5% in 2006  and  from  
2.4% to 2.0% in 2007. 
The outcome may appear somewhat surprising, as global 
growth falls to 3-3½% without implying a larger impact for 
the EU.  However, it should be noted that, in the QUEST 
model, interest and exchange rates are endogenous, while 
confidence indicators are not explicitly modelled.  The 
benign results reflect the reduced oil intensity and the 
relatively low share of extra-EU exports of goods (of around 
10% of GDP).A better-case scenario
 was simulated by applying the 
following shocks to the model: 
(1) An unwinding of pent-up consumer demand in Germany, 
with the savings rate falling in 2006 and 2007, as consumers 
become more optimistic about the future.  This implies that 
consumer spending in Germany would be raised (above the 
levels in the central scenario) by 1.2% in 2006 and by 1.8% 
in 2007; and (2) a spill-over of some of this optimism to other Member 
States, implying that private consumption in the EU would 
be lifted above the central scenario by 0.6 and 0.9%, 
respectively, in 2006 and 2007 (0.7 and 1.0%, respectively, 
in the euro area).  
A decline in savings should be associated with a rise in real 
interest rates to restore the equilibrium between savings and 
investment in the QUEST model.  However, under the 
assumption of an accommodating monetary stance, the 
negative impact on investment would be negligible. 
This more optimistic scenario pushes GDP growth in 
Germany higher than the central scenario by 0.5 pp in 2006 
and 0.2 pp in 2007.  For the euro area, and the EU as a 
whole, GDP growth would be 0.3 and 0.1 pp higher, 
respectively, in 2006 and 2007.

324. Improvement in labour market 
conditionsLimited increase in long-term unemployment in 
the downswing 
Both the euro-area and the EU labour markets have 
been markedly less influenced by the recent economic 

downswings and upswings, compared to earlier 
cycles.  Although the labo
ur market conditions 
worsened with the usual lag to the economic 

slowdown in 2001-2003, the rise in the annual 
unemployment rate was li
mited to one percentage 
point, compared to some 
three percentage points in 
the early 1990s.  In this 
cycle, unemployment peaked 
at 8.9% of the labour force in
 the euro area in the 
second quarter of 2004.  
Several factors bear witness to the structural 
improvement in the functioning of the labour market, 
including a decline in long-term unemployment rates 
and in the average duration of unemployment spells, 

as well as an improvement in the matching process. 
Weak labour demand so
 far in the upswing 
Euro-area employment growth accelerated to 0.2% in 
the second quarter of 2005 
(q-o-q) up from 0.1% in 
the first quarter.  The still relatively modest 
employment growth can be 
partly explained by the 
labour hoarding, which took place during the 

economic downturn and created a ‘reserve’ of 
employees in many enterprises.

(Quarterly percentage change, seasonally adjusted)
The overall development of job creation masks 
significant differences across Member States and 
across sectors.  In the euro area, employment creation 
of 2½-3% was recorded in Greece, Spain, Ireland and 

Luxembourg in 2004, whereas
 a decline was noted in 
France and, in particular, the 
Netherlands (-1½%).  At 
the sectoral level, net job 
creation continued to be 
limited to the services sector, 
while employment has 
been falling in the agricu
lture and industry sectors 
(besides the moderate pick-up 
noted in industry in the 
most recent quarter). 
Employment expectations suggest a pick-up 
Looking ahead, employment
 expectations, as reported 
in the Harmonised EU Business and Consumer 
Survey, improved in Octobe
r.  While the volatility of 
monthly indicators in gene
ral suggests that they 
should be interpreted 
with due caution, an analysis of 
the three-month moving average confirms the 

improvement (when comparing August-October to the 
previous three months).  
At the sectoral level, expectations are indicative of a 
further expansion of empl
oyment in the services 
sector and a possible further 
deterioration in industry, 
although activity is expected 
to expand in both 
sectors.  This would be
 in line with the sectoral 
employment trends discussed 
above.  Nevertheless, it 
should be noted that, when comparing companies’ 
expectations and their assessment of the recent past, 

employment growth has recovered more slowly in the 
services sector than the expectations would suggest.  
Overall, the survey results thus
 point to a modest 
improvement in the employment outlook, although a 
considerable acceleration of employment creation in 
the second half of 2005 
appears unlikely.  This is 
consistent with the improvement noted in consumers’ 
unemployment expectations in the period August-
October compared to May-July. 
Unemployment at 8½% in September 2005 
In view of the moderate employment creation in 
2003-2004, the standardi
sed unemployment rate 
stabilised at around 9% of the 
labour force in both the 
euro area and the EU in 2004.  In
 line with the pick-
up in employment this year
, a certain decline in the 
unemployment rate has been recorded: in September 
2005, the unemployment rate was 8.4% in the euro 

area and at 8.6% in the EU.  
Differences continue to be sizeable across Member 
States, with unemployment ranging from around 4½-
5% in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria and 

the United Kingdom to
 some 9-10% in Germany, 
Spain, Greece, France and Latvia and more than 16% 
in Slovakia and Poland in September 2005.  
Improving employ
ment outlook 
Employment is expected to increase by 1% in the euro 
area and 0.9% in the EU in 2005, before accelerating 
33Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 marginally to 1.2% in 2006 a
nd 1.1% in 2007 in the 
euro area, and to 1.0% in both years in the EU.  
The employment outlook for 2005 may appear high in 
view of the weaker outlook for economic activity 

(both compared to 2004 and to the spring forecast).  
The combined effect of the current GDP growth and 
the employment forecasts is an expected strong 

decline in labour 
productivity growth, from 1.4% in 
2004 to 0.3% in 2005 in the euro area and from 1.8% 
to 0.6% in the EU.   
Specific factors behind the improvement 
Employment growth in 20
05 is, however, partly 
explained by a number of other factors in some 
Member States. 
In Spain, the apparent strong demand for labour is 
further reinforced as a consequence of the 

regularisation of immigrant workers.  It is estimated 
that the latter will boost the number of employed 
persons by 700,000, even
 if the rise in full-time 
equivalents would be substantially lower, as many 
immigrants tend to occupy tem
porary jobs.  In Italy, 
in spite of almost flat GDP growth this year, the 
regularisation of immigrant workers and the 
continuing effect of labour market reforms introduced 

since the 1990’s has led to a further increase in 
employment.  As a result, measured labour 
productivity growth turns nega
tive again in Italy in 
2005.  On the other hand, weaker-than-earlier-
expected economic activity is foreseen to dampen 
(regular) employment gro
wth in Germany, France 
and, in particular, the Netherlands. 
Job creation also arises from measures taken to 
combat unemployment and st
imulate employment in 
some Member States.  In Germany, for example, job 

creation in 2005 stems partly fro
m jobs with reduced 
payroll taxes (“mini-jobs”) and jobs for benefit 
recipients (“one-euro-jobs”).  Both measures raise 

part-time employment.  The former are created in the 
regular labour market, whereas 
the latter are provided and remunerated by the 
public sector.  As with the 
regularisation of immigrants, fu
ll-time equivalent 
employment growth from this type of measure is more 
limited. 
As the economic upswing accelerates, investment-led 
GDP growth is set to be complemented by a gradual 
pick-up in private consumption.  This is likely to 
further enhance the importance of the services sector.  
With lower labour produc
tivity on average in the 
services sector, GDP growth should also tend to be 

accompanied by a greater increase in employment.

forecast
Unemployment diminishing to around 8% in 2007 
Employment is expected to increase by 1.4 million 
persons this year in the eu
ro area, while th
e influx to 
the labour force limits the d
ecline in the number of 
unemployed to 0.3 million persons.  It is thus 

anticipated that the euro
-area unemployment rate will 
fall to 8.6% in 2005 (from 8.9% of the labour force in 
2004).  Similarly, the une
mployment rate in the EU is 
projected to improve by 0.3 pp this year (to 8.7%).   
Over the remainder of the forecast period, euro-area 
employment is expected to 
grow by 1.6 million per 
year in both 2006 and 
2007, facilitating a further 
decline in unemployment.  Overall, employment is 
expected to increase by 4½ million persons in 2005-
2007 in the euro area and by 6 million persons in the 

EU.The unemployment rate is thus foreseen to fall further 
to 8.4% in 2006 and to 8.1%
 in 2007 in 
the euro area.  
A decline is also expected in the EU with the 
unemployment rate declining to 8.5% and 8.1%, 
respectively.  This development
 would correspond to 
a reduction in number of unemployed persons by 0.8 
million in the euro area and 
by 1.6 million persons in 
the EU over the whole forecast period.  
The marked differences in unemployment rates 
recorded across Member States will remain, even if 
34Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
some convergence can be noted.  This follows from 
the expected favourable development in the two 
Member States with the highest unemployment rate, 

Poland and Slovakia, where 
the unemployment rate 
continues to fall over the forecast period. Within the 
euro area, the relatively wide unemployment rate 

range is maintained
: from 4-5% in Ireland, the 
Netherlands and Austria to around 9% in Germany 
and France and almost 10% in Greece.  
Different wage trends across Member States 
On average, wage growth, as measured by 
compensation of employees per head, remained 
relatively unaffected by the economic slowdown in 
2001-2003.  Wage growth began to moderate more 

markedly only this year.  Eu
ro-area wage growth is 
expected to ease to 1.8% in 2005, 2.0% in 2006, 
before edging up to 2.4% in 2007. 
Wage trends exhibit considerable differences across 
Member States, with wage growth being markedly 
higher in (most of) the recently-acceded Member 
States, causing wages in the EU to rise by around 2½-
3%.  Differences are also pronounced within the euro 
area, with projected wage growth ranging from 

around 0% in Germany this year to around 5% or 
more in Greece and Ireland. 
Wage growth seems to reflect labour market tightness 
(or lack thereof) relatively well in most Member 

States in 2005.  This explains the wage increases of 
above 3% in Greece, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg, 
as well as the decline in wages in Germany.  
However, in the cases of Portugal and Finland, 
average wage increases were higher than might be 
expected from the weak economic situation and 
cannot be justified by 
a rapid increase in labour 
productivity.  Wage growth in these countries could, 
to a certain extent, be ex
plained by the ongoing 
impact of multi-annual wage agreements.  Wage 

increases in Italy (of close to 3%) also appear to be 
somewhat on the high side in view of the marked 
deceleration in GDP growth in 2005 and negative 

growth in labour productivity. 
Increasing divergence in competitiveness 
Persistent and relatively hi
gh wage increases, 
combined with low 
(or even negative) labour 
productivity growth, have given rise to 

competitiveness problems for some Member States. 
Nominal unit labour cost is esti
mated to have risen by 
around 2½-3% in Spain, Port
ugal and Finland, and by 
3% or more in Greece, Ireland and Italy in 2005.  

Taking into account real effective exchange rates, unit 
labour cost rose by around 1-2% in Ireland, Italy and 
Finland.  This has had a negative impact on export 
performance of these coun
tries, particularly in the 
case of Italy.  On the other hand, the pronounced 

wage moderation in Germany, as reflected in falling 
unit labour costs in 2004-2006, has provided a 
substantial impetus to expo
rts, thus contributing to 
rising export market shares.

355. Headline inflation lifted by rising oil 
pricesAfter falling below 2% in the beginning of 2005, the 
annual rate of headline inflation in the euro area 
fluctuated around 2.1%, be
fore rising to 2½% in 
September-October.  The stickiness of euro-area 
inflation mainly reflects th
e rise in energy inflation, 
triggered by soaring oil prices.  Since the end of last 

year, crude oil prices have risen by more than 60% in 
euro terms.  
One rule of thumb suggests that a 10% increase in oil 
prices leads to a rise of 1½ pps in the annual rate of 

change in consumer prices of energy within about half 
a year. As energy has a weight of roughly 8-9% in the 
overall HICP basket, this translates into a direct 

increase in consumer price inflation of 0.1-0.2 of a 
percentage point. Compared to an annual rate of 4.5% 
in 2004, energy HICP inflation averaged 9.1% in the 

nine months to September 2005
. This resulted in a rise 
in the contribution of energ
y to overall inflation from 
0.4 pp to 0.7 pp over the corresponding period. 
Largely reflecting fluctuations in
 oil prices, among the 
main components of headline inflation in the first nine 
months of 2005, the hi
ghest annual rates 
of inflation were observed in housing (4.5%) and transport (4%). 
The former, driven by higher rentals for housing and 
surging prices for gas, electricity and fuels, 

contributed 0.7 pp to headline inflation in 2005.  As 
the cost of energy represents a sizeable share of total 
transport costs, transport prices also grew rapidly, 

adding 0.6 pp to overall inflation.  
Rises in indirect taxes and administrated prices 
remained high during 2005, contributing 0.4 pp to 
headline inflation. While sm
aller than in 2004, partly 
as a result of base effects related to sizeable increases 
in indirect tax rates last year, this contribution is still 
above the long-term av
erage of 0.2 pp.  
Deceleration of core inflation 
In contrast to the 
upward trend in 
headline inflation, core inflation (HICP inflation excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) has been on an almost 
uninterrupted downward trend since the beginning of 

2005. In the euro area, core inflation diminished from 
2% in 2004 to 1.5% in September 2005. A similar 
decelerating pattern is evident for the EU. The 
decomposition of core inflation into its main 
components – services, non-energy industrial goods 

and processed food – reveals that the downward trend 
was driven by a slowdown of inflation in 
manufacturing goods and processed food and, to a 
lesser extent, in services.

Price rises in industrial goods have added just 0.1 pp 
to overall inflation this 
year.  Strong competition in 
the tradable goods sector, 
coupled with subdued 
growth in the euro area, put
 downward pressure on 
industrial prices.  Similarly,
 processed food inflation 
contributed only 0.2 pp 
to overall inflation, mainly as 
a result of slowing inflation for fresh food.   
Services inflation, while also decelerating, remained 
above 2% and has added 1 pp to this year’s headline 
inflation.  Since services represent more than 40% of 
the HICP basket, they play an important role in 

shaping the evolution 
of overall inflation.  Within 
services, the moderation is largely attributable to a 
continuous decline (at an average annual pace of 

about 2%) in prices for communication services. 
Short-term upward revision due to energy prices 
Headline inflation is expected to be stubbornly high in 
the short run and to remain 
above 2% for longer than 
anticipated in the spring 
forecast. A prolonged period 
of high energy prices is the main element behind the 
expected upward shift in th
e profile for inflation over 
the coming quarters. As mentioned in chapter 1, a fall 

in oil prices is not expected in
 the near future in view 
of continuous strong demand, limited spare capacity 
and geopolitical tensions in some important oil-

producing countries. As a 
consequence, the direct 
impact of higher oil prices on headline inflation via 
the energy component of the 
HICP is likely to remain 
substantial. 36Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
Contained indirect effects Oil prices can also affect inflation indirectly through 
the effect of higher costs for en
ergy inputs on the 
prices of other goods and services. However, while 

lagged effects might still materialise, to date, there is 
little or no evidence of a pass-through of higher 
energy costs into producer prices. The annual growth 

rate of producer prices excluding energy and 
construction remained broa
dly unchanged at 2% in 
2004 and during the first nine months of 2005.

Breakdown of industrial producer prices,

Evidence from survey data of
 a strengthening of input 
price pressures in the manufacturing and services 
sectors in the short-run is, 
at best, mixed. While the 
price component of the euro-area manufacturing PMI 

suggests an increase in production prices, the 
indicator for prices actually charged by firms is 
consistent with stable manuf
acturing prices. A similar 
development is evident in 
the price components of the 
PMI for services. The index 
of input prices rebounded 
in the third quarter of 2005
, after several months of 
moderating price pressure. However, the index for 
prices charged is still hov
ering around 50, thus 
indicating stable output prices. 
On the whole, the 
more muted increases in prices charged compared to 
input prices suggest that firms are absorbing part of 

the rising costs by squeezing profits.  
In addition, despite the rise in oil prices, there are only 
limited sign of inflationary effects stemming from 
changes in inflation expectations. For instance, 

according to Harmonised EU Business and Consumer 
Surveys, inflation expect
ations in manufacturing have 
been on a downward trend for 
the first half of 2005 
and remain well below the historical average, despite 
the up-tick in recent months. On the other hand, 

inflation expectations of consumers have risen since 
the beginning of 2005. The record high prices of oil 
have apparently influenced h
ouseholds’ assessment of 
the situation. Nevertheless, at the current level, consumer inflation expectations are below their long-
term average. While inflation expectations derived 

from indexed-bonds moved upwards in recent 
months, they remain relatively subdued. The ECB’s 
survey of professional forecasters reported an upward 

revision of short-term in
flation expectations from 
1.9% to 2.1% in 2005, but inflation is expected to 
decline to 1.8% in 2006 and 
to stay at that level also 
in 2007. Overall, euro-area inflation is 
set to hover around 
2.5% for the remainder of this year and during the 
first half of 2006. For 2005 as a whole, HICP inflation 
is estimated at 2.3% in both the euro area and the EU. 
Compared to the spring forecast, this represents an 
upward adjustment of 0.4 pp.  HICP inflation in 2005 
has been revised upwards in all euro-area Member 
States, apart from Finland and Portugal. 
An improved inflation outlook in the medium term 
Notwithstanding the short-term effects of temporary 
price shocks, the medium
-term outlook for price 
developments remains favourable. The inflation rate 
is projected to ease in the second half of 2006, 

reaching 2% in the third quarter of the year and 
hovering around 1.8% from the fourth quarter 
onwards. In annual average terms, HICP inflation in 

the euro area is estimated at 2.2% in 2006 and 1.8% in 
2007. The corresponding figures for the EU are 2.2% 
and 1.9%. Both domestic and external factors are expected to 
contribute to the improved 
inflation outlook. These 
include overall economic conditions, which are 
expected to be conducive to moderate wage 

developments, and an improvement in unit labour 
costs. Growth in compensation of employees per head 
is forecast to be in the vicinity of 2% this year and the 
next, accelerating to 2.4% in 2007. Combined with a 
pick-up in labour productivity 
growth from 0.3% in 
2005 to 0.9% at the end of the forecast horizon, this 
results in some moderation of
 growth in unit labour 
costs.37Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 1.0

This relatively benign outlook for wage developments 
rests on the hypothesis that the rise in oil prices does 
not translate into additional
 wage claims, thus 
avoiding second-round effects on inflation. Given the 

projected gradual recovery in economic activity (a 
negative output gap of 0.8% of GDP is foreseen over 
the forecast period) and moderate improvement in 

labour market conditions, it 
is unlikely that wages will 
represent a major source of inflationary pressures. 
However, one should acknowledge 
the risk that a long 
period of high headline inflation may, at a certain 
stage, feed into core inflation. 
On the external side, the 
stabilisation of oil prices 
should translate into lower im
ported inflation, thus 
putting downward pressure 
on overall inflation. 
Import prices are expected to decelerate from an 

annual growth rate of above 4% in 2005 to 2.5% in 
2006 and to fall further to 1.5% in 2007. From the 
second half of 2006 onwards
, inflation should also 
benefit from sizeable base effects related to the past 
increase in energy prices.  
Inflation differentials across Member States 
remain wide At the Member State level, 
inflation is expected to 
remain low in Germany, at around 1.6% in 2006 and 

1.1% in 2007, held down by weak domestic demand. 
Inflation in France is forecast at 2.1% next year and 
1.9% in 2007, fo
llowing relatively higher wage 
growth compared to its main trading partners. Similar 
inflation rates are forecast for Italy. Services inflation 
remains high but some moderation in wage inflation 

compared to the recent past 
should lead to 
a decline in overall inflation. In Spain,
 inflation is expected to 
decelerate from 3.3% in 2006 to 2.6% in 2007, while 

remaining above the euro-area average due to 
relatively high growth in unit labour costs. By 
contrast, inflation in the Netherlands, estimated at 2% 

in 2006 and 1.9% in 200
7, is set to benefit from a 
contraction in unit labour costs both this year and 
next. Inflation is projected 
to remain above 2% in 
2006 in the remaining euro-area economies, apart for 
Finland.  In 2007, Belgium and Austria are also 
expected to record inflation
 rates below that threshold. 
Outside the euro area, inflation in the UK is set to 
reach 2.2% next year and 2% in 2007. Among the 
larger recently-acceded Member States, inflation in 

Poland is foreseen at 2.3% in 2006 and 2.5% in 2007. 
In Hungary, inflation is set to decelerate markedly in 
2006 (2%), before accelerating once again to 3% in 

2007. Inflation in the Czech Republic is forecast to 
accelerate from 1.7% this year to 2.6% in 2006 and 
2007, largely reflecting rising unit lab
our costs. For 
the remaining Member States, the general picture is 
one of decelerating inflation between 2006 and 2007.

386. Fiscal consolidation stalls in the wake of 
weak economic growth Aggregate budget deficit set to increase slightly 
The general government de
ficit in the euro area is set 
to reach 2.9% of GDP in 2005, up from 2.7% of GDP 
a year earlier, in the wake of slowing economic 

growth as evidenced by a significant widening of the 
negative output gap.  The deficit is expected to 
diminish again marginally in 2006, based on 

unchanged policies, 
and to stabilise in 2007 in the 
context of a moderate economic recovery.  The 
cyclical nature of the widen
ing budget deficit over the 
forecast horizon is mirrored in a primary budget 
balance net of cyclical fact
ors, which remains broadly 
stable at around ¾ of a perc
ent of GDP up to 2007 
(inclusive).  This extends further the period since 
2002 in which little to no adj
ustment has been made 
to correct the underlying 
budgetary position.  The 
public finance outlook for the EU as a whole is 
essentially stable.  The nomina
l deficit is expected to 
edge up marginally, from 2.6% of GDP in 2004 to 

2.7% of GDP in 2005, and to
 remain at that level until 
2007.  Unless policies chang
e, the increase in the 
nominal budget balance masks a slight improvement 
of the fiscal position net of cyclical factors and 
interest expenditure due to 
the fiscal effort outside the euro area. 
It should be recalled that these figures, and those that 
follow, are based on a “no-policy change” 
assumption.  They incorporate the measures 

announced with the budgets for 2006, but do not 
include possible further measures for 2006 nor 
measures for 2007 beyond those resulting from 

decisions already taken.  
When the projected fiscal stance for 2005-2007 is 
assessed against the exp
ected cyclical conditions, 
cross-country data of Member States, which are not 

currently under the excessive deficit procedure, reveal 
some pro-cyclicality in current policies. 
Euro area: diverging trends in 2006 
Following a broad-based pa
ttern towards higher 
deficits among euro-area Member States in 2005, 

trends are expected to diverge somewhat in 2006, 
dividing the euro area into
 two main country 
groupings.  In most Member States with a relatively 
favourable position, i.e. a budget deficit below 2.5% 
of GDP, the draft 2006 budg
et is expected to stabilise 
or to slightly weaken th
e fiscal position.  By contrast, 
among the euro-area Member States, which are 
currently running an excessive deficit, Portugal, 
Greece, Germany and Italy are projected to achieve, 
to varying degrees, 
some fiscal consolidation compared to 2005.  In the case of Germany, current 
policies do not include th
e 2006 draft budget, the 
presentation of which was delayed in view of the 

early elections in September.  In France, under current 
policies, the deficit would rise in
 2006, due to the 
expiry of a large one-off operation carried out in 
2005.  Overall, current polices are expected to be 
insufficient to bring the 
deficit below the reference 
value by the end of the forecast horizon in any of the 

euro-area Member States currently under the 
excessive deficit procedure.

EU as a whole: moderate recovery does not rub off 
on public finances  
Outside the euro area, 
the public finance trends 
projected in 2006 and 2007 are at least as 
heterogeneous as in the euro area.  In spite of a 
moderate recovery of econ
omic activity, there is no 
broad-based trend towards 
improving, or at least 
securing, the fiscal position.  Specifically, of the six 
recently-acceded Member States currently under the 

excessive deficit procedure, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic are expected to widen their budget deficit 
further in 2006.  In the case 
of Hungary the upward 
trend is expected to continue also in 2007, when 
current policies are likely to br
ing the deficit close to 
7% of GDP.  In Poland, cu
rrent policies are expected 
to stabilise the deficit at 3.6% of GDP and to reduce it 
only marginally in 2007.  By contrast, Cyprus is 
projected to correct the excessive deficit by a small 
39Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 margin in 2005
, followed by Slovakia and Malta in 
2006.  Among the recently-acceded Member States 
with a relatively favourable budget balance, only 

Lithuania is expected to reduce its budget deficit over 
the forecast horizon. In
 Estonia (which runs a 
surplus), Latvia, and 
Slovenia, current policies are 
forecast to slightly loosen the fiscal position. 
The Scandinavian non-euro countries, Denmark and 
Sweden, are expected to spend some of their 
budgetary surplus 
in 2006, but withou
t compromising 
their comfortable position.
  Current policies are likely 
to keep the deficit abov
e the 3% of GDP reference 
value in the United Kingdom. 
Debt ratios remain on an upward trend 
The upward trend in th
e euro-area debt ratio observed 
since 2003 is not expected to reverse during the 
forecast period, in spite of the projected recovery of 
nominal GDP growth in 2006 and 2007.  The debt 

ratio is set to reach 72% of GDP in 2007, around one 
percentage point higher than in 2004, as the projected 
revival of economic activity
 is unlikely to outweigh 
the downward shift in the primary budget surplus in 
2005 and beyond. 
A similar development is forecast in the EU, where 
the debt ratio is expected to increase from 63.4% of 
GDP in 2004 to 64
.3% of GDP in 2007. 
 In view of an 
essentially stable primary balance, the increase is 
mainly driven by 
slower nominal GDP growth. 
Concerning the respect of the 60% of GDP reference 
value of the Treaty, apart from Portugal, where the 

debt ratio is estimated to 
rise above 60% of GDP in 
2005, no Member State is expected to cross the 
reference value over the forecast horizon, either from 

above or below.  Among the countries with a debt 
ratio above the 60% of
 GDP threshold, Belgium, 
Greece, Cyprus and Austria are projected to reduce it 

up to 2007 (inclusive).  In the case of Italy, following 
the sharp increase 
in 2005, the debt ratio is also 
expected to decline slowly, mainly on account of 

planned receipts from privatisations.  Conversely, a 
further increase in the debt ratio up to 2007 
(inclusive) is expected to take place in Germany, 

France and Portugal.

75809085709500Activity in 2005 
In 2005, the economic slowdown that had started at 
the end of 2004 turned out to be more severe than 
anticipated. Real GDP growth almost came to a 

standstill in the first quarter and remained moderate in 
the second quarter, mainly 
as a result of declining 
exports. For the last two quarters a real growth of 

0.4% is expected, mainly due to increased external 
demand. Overall, GDP growth in 2005 is forecast at 
1.4%.  
Despite the recovery in the balance of trade expected 
for the second half of the year, external demand is 
likely to have a negative impact on economic growth 
in 2005. Moreover, cont
inuous weak consumer 
confidence, fuelled by the recent turmoil in the oil 
markets and uncertainty regarding the ongoing debate 
on pensions and early retirement, could also dampen 

consumption. Investment 
was exceptionally strong in 
the first half of the year despite decreasing business 
confidence, possibly because of some catching-up  

after low investments in
 previous years. In the second 
half of the year, investment 
is expected to slow down 
somewhat and, following a recent improvement in 
business confidence, settle at an average rate of 4.9% 
for 2005.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
From 2006 onwards, some economic recovery is 
expected, albeit at a moderate GDP growth rate close 
to  2%. While exports shou
ld continue to recover in 
2006, consumption will b
enefit from stronger growth 
in gross disposab
le income resulting 
from the final 
stage of the 2001 direct tax reform and some 
improvement in employment. After decreasing 
continuously since 2002, the household saving rate is 

expected to stabilise around
 12.3%. On the other 
hand, growth in government consumption should 
remain moderate, especially in 
2006, in view of the 
government’s efforts required to reach its budgetary 
targets. Gross capital formation is forecast to remain 
strong in 2006, mainly driven by public investment by 

local authorities in 
the run-up to th
e 2006 local 
elections. However, following the pattern that has 
been observed in the past, public
 investment in 2007 
should decrease markedly. On the other hand, the 
anticipated recovery of external markets and some 
improvement in consum
ption expenditure should 
continue to stimulate priva
te investment, which is 
expected to remain reasonably 
solid throughout the 
forecast period.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
In the first half of 2005
, the Belgian labour market 
benefited from the strong 
economic growth observed 
in 2004, but lost momentum
 towards the second half 
of the year. Higher economic 
growth and efforts to 
reduce the tax burden on labour should revive job 
creation from 2006 onward
s, but its effect on the 
unemployment rate remains limited due to a growing 
labour force. Moreover, the 
cumulative nominal wage 
increase of 4.5% for 2005-2006 foreseen in the latest 

wage agreement will probably 
be exceeded, which 
will also have an adverse effect on the labour market.  
In 2005, the CPI is expected
 to increase by 2.8%. The 
inflationary effect of risi
ng oil prices has been slightly 
offset by some compensating tax measures in the 
second half of the year. However, because some of 
these measures only reduce prices in 2005 and due to 

inflationary pressure st
emming from increased wages, 
inflation could still reach 2.7% in 2006, but should 
fall again afterwards.Public finances 
In 2005, despite the economic slowdown, tax revenue 
remained on track and reforms in the health sector 
helped to keep health 
care expenditure in 
line with the 
4.5% real growth target (a
gainst an overrun of 7.8% 
in 2004). Therefore government accounts are 
expected to reach a position close to balance. For 

2006 a deficit of 0.3% of GDP can be expected, 
against a balanced budget foreseen in the 2006 budget

law1. The difference is mainly due to less optimistic 
assumptions on government expenditure, lower 
estimates for the proceeds of a fiscal regularisation 

measure as well as for some new tax measures, and an 
expected loss in income linked to the sale of tax 
arrears in 2005. In 2007 the government balance is 

expected to further deteriorate due to a substantial 
package of one-off measures in the 2006 budget 
(some 0.5% of GDP) and reductions in social security 

contributions (close to 0.2%). On the other hand, 
public finances will benefit from a normalisation of 
spending by local authorities after the local elections 

(over 0.2% of GDP) and lower interest payments 
(0.1%). Therefore, on a 
no-policy-change basis and in 
the absence of new one-off receipts a deficit of over 

0.5% of GDP is forecast.  
In 2005, the debt reduction 
has been slowed down by 
the assumption of a 2.5% of GDP debt from the 
national railway company. Overall, as a result of 

sustained budgetary 
efforts and declin
ing interest 
expenditure the debt ratio remains on a downward 
path (see graph 3.1). By the end of the forecast 
horizon, the debt ratio is 
expected to fall well below 
90%.                                                           
1For the time being, an assumption of debt from the railway 
company by the government in 2005 has been treated without direct 
impact on the government deficit, while securitisations of tax 
arrears in 2005 and 2006 have been 
recorded as deficit-reducing. 
These treatments are of a pur
ely technical nature and are without 
prejudice to the final accounting decision. Should Eurostat decide 
that such operations should be booked differently, the forecast for 
the deficit would increase by up to 2.7% of GDP in 2005 and 0.2% 
of GDP in 2006. Moreover, the forecast for 2006 assumes that the 
conditions of sales and lease-backs of government buildings (0.2% 

of GDP) permit these transactions to be recorded as deficit 
reducing.432. Czech Republic

Activity in 2005 
The performance of the Czech economy remained 
strong in the first half of 
2005, with growth increasing 
to 4.9% year-on-year, the 
highest growth rate since 
1996. Economic activity was driven mainly by net 
exports which in
creased substantially. Private consumption accelerated, but remained subdued. 

Public consumption continued to fall and growth of 
gross fixed capital formation decelerated. Robust 
economic activity is expected to continue for the rest 

of 2005, leading to an annual growth rate of about 
4¾%. Strong economic pe
rformance will be mainly 
due to vigorous exports. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006 and 2007, the economic expansion is 
projected to remain strong, but to decelerate to some 
4½% in 2006 and 4¼% in 2007. Although net exports 
are expected to continue to be an important driving 

force of GDP growth, domestic demand is expected to 
strengthen. Private demand 
will be stimulated by an 
improving labour market situation and investment by 
higher utilisation of EU structural funds and 
favourable financial conditions. Public consumption 

will accelerate, though only slightly. 
Vigorous exports resulted in a significant 
improvement of the trade balance and a substantial 
narrowing of the current account deficit. The 

developments in the external sector are forecast to be 
positive. Vigorous export growth boosted by EU 
accession should continue, though at a slower pace. 

The trade balance is expected to improve 
substantially, reaching a surplus for the first time 
since 1991. Czech ex
ports seem to be profiting from 
the German export boom and strong growth in 

Slovakia (the second biggest export market), as well 
as gaining new markets 
to the east. As a result, the 
current account deficit 
should decline from 5.2% of 
GDP in 2004 to less than 
3% in 2005. 
The positive trend in the external sector is projected to continue. In 
2007, the trade balance surplus is forecast to be about 

3% of GDP and the current account deficit should 
shrink to some 2¼% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Strong economic performance helped improve the 
situation in the labour market. The trend of falling 

employment was reversed and the rate of 
unemployment began to fall, reaching about 8%. 
Employment is projected to increase over the forecast 

horizon. The rate of unemployment is forecast to fall 
continuously from 8.3% in 2004 to about 7½% in 
2007, mainly thanks to 
strong economic growth. 
Due to the ongoing appreciation of the koruna, strong 
competition, falling food prices and favourable base 
effects, average annual HICP inflation was only 1.3% 

in the first half of 2005. 
Since the beg
inning of 2005, 
inflation has been below the target band set by the 
monetary authorities. As a consequence of high 

energy prices, inflation 
is likely to increase towards 
the end of 2005 and in 
the first half of 2006. A 
temporary overshooting of th
e upper limit of the 
inflation target is expected. However, average HICP 
inflation is projected to remain low in 2005 (1¾%). 
Acceleration to almost 3% is foreseen in 2006 and 

future inflation development will largely depend on 
the reaction of wages to increased energy prices. 
Assuming relatively weak second-round effects, the 

inflation rate is forecast to be slightly below the 
monetary policy target in 2007 (CPI inflation of 3% 
year on year +/-1 pp since 2006). 
Public finances 
Forecasting public finances has become complicated 
since the spending ministries
 gained the possibility of 
rolling over unspent funds 
from previous budgetary 
years. Last year, the unspent
 funds amounted to about 
1% of GDP. This creates uncertainty about when 
those funds will be accumulated and when they will 

be spent.

Over the first ten months of 2005, budgetary revenues 
have been higher than expected, mainly due to very 
strong economic growth. At the same time, under-

execution of expenditures 
is likely to be repeated. 
Given the very positive cash 
developments in the state 
budget, the total budgetary outcome in 2005 is 
expected to again be better than expected. The general 
government deficit is forecast to reach about 3¼% of 
GDP, compared with the convergence programme 

target of 4.7% of GDP. The projected deficit includes 
two major one-off expen
ditures (financial leasing of 
military jets and alleviation of foreign debt) and 

assumes that the expenditure rolled over from 2004 
will be fully spent, but new saving
s of about 1½ % of 
GDP may be realised. 
The 2006 deficit is projected to reach 3¾% of GDP, 
under the assumption that about 1% of GDP on the 
expenditure side will be ag
ain rolled ove
r into 2007. 
Despite the planned nominal medium-term 

expenditure ceilings being overs
hot in the 2006 draft 
budget, higher spending will 
be financed by budgetary 
revenues generated by strong economic growth. 
Given ongoing good economic performance and a 

record of prudent b
udgetary policy, the deficit of 3¼% of GDP in 2007 is 
within reach. However, the 
structural budgetary balance is forecast to worsen in 

both 2005 and 2006. 
Gross public debt is e
xpected to slightly decrease in 
2005 to 36¼% of GDP, main
ly thanks to privatisation 
proceeds. In 2006 and 2007, government debt is 

projected to slightly increase.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
The recovery of economic activity in Denmark which 
took hold in 2004 has continued in 2005. After a 
hesitant first quarter, GDP growth was very strong in 

the second quarter, with the economy growing at a 
yearly rate of more than 2½% in the first half of the 
year. Private consumption continues to be the main 

engine of growth. Consumption is boosted by real 
disposable income gains, 
a booming housing market, 
falling unemployment and low interest rates. 

Consumers have, it seems, not been overly 
discouraged by high fuel
 prices and car sales in 
particular remain buoyant. Public consumption grew 

by 2% in real terms in 2004
 and is expected to expand 
in excess of the government’s 0.5% objective also in 
2005. Fixed investment reboun
ded vigorously in the 
second quarter, with investment in equipment 
expanding at a two-digit 
rate. Investment has been 
growing irregularly in recent quarters but seems to be 

on an upward trend. Export
s also grew very strongly 
in the second quarter, in spite of subdued growth in 
the euro area, Denmark’s main export market. 
However, the impact on GDP growth was cancelled 
out by a rise in imports of a similar magnitude. 
Recent trends are expected to continue during the rest 
of the year. Backed by strong consumer confidence, 
private consumption growth is set to be even stronger 
than in 2004 (4.1%). As ex
ports gather strength, the 
growth contribution of net exports is expected to be 
only slightly negative in 2005, in contrast to the 
markedly negative growth con
tribution in 2004. Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Continuing the healthy gr
owth from 2005, robust 
domestic demand should allow a GDP growth of 
around 2¼% in 2006, only 
slightly lower than in the 
previous year. Private consumption growth is 
expected to remain vigo
rous, underpinned by the 
suspension also in 
2006 and 2007 of the special 
pension savings contribu
tions. Nevertheless, 
consumption growth should moderate as the effects of 
the tax cuts on real disposab
le income taper off. In 
addition, the stimulus to 
household wealth coming 
from the substantial rises in house prices in recent 
years is expected to be less marked as the financing 

costs rise. Denmark’s export markets are expected to expand 
firmly in the forecast period, and Danish exports are 
set to grow robustly, albeit with
 some loss of market 
share. This is a not uncommon feature for Denmark in 
phases of upswing, linked
 inter alia to the 
composition of exports. As the growth of imports is 

expected to dampen in 
line with domestic demand, the 
growth contribution of ne
t exports should turn 
positive in the forecast period. 
In 2007, a continued 
slowdown of private 
consumption is expected as consumer demand for 
durables begins to be sati
sfied and interest rates 
increase. In the absence of further tax cuts, the 
stimulus from income ga
ins will be weaker. Exports 
are foreseen to remain robust, with net exports 

contributing positively to
 economic activity. The 
upswing is thus foreseen to 
be more balanced and less 
dependent on strong consumption growth. On this 

basis, GDP growth in 2007 is expected to be around 
2%.Labour market, costs and prices 
After the only slight improvemen
t in 2004, the labour 
market reacted positively, though with some lag, to 

the recovery in economic activity. Employment 
growth picked up in 2005 and unemployment has 
started to head down firmly. As the expansion 

continues, the labour market can be expected to move 
close to its capacity towards the end of the forecast 
period. This should lead to some upward pressure on 
domestic inflation coming from wages. However, 
there are as yet few signs of labour shortages leading 
to wage-driven inflation. In
 particular in the tradable

).goods sectors, globalisation may be acting to dampen 
inflationary pressures. 
After the historically low inflati
on in 2004, which was 
due to temporary price effects due to tax cuts and low 

import prices, consumer price inflation in 2005 has 
increased. This is largely due to rising energy prices, 
while domestic inflation
 remains relatively subdued. 
Over the forecast period, the effects on inflation of 
rising oil prices will taper
 off, while domestically 
generated inflation is set to pick up as capacity 

pressure in the economy increases. Headline inflation 
is foreseen to be around 2% through 2007. 
Public finances 
Denmark’s public finances are 
among the strongest in 
the EU. After a surplus of 
2.7% of GDP in 2004, 
general government finances are expected to post an 
even higher surplus of arou
nd 3½% of GDP in 2005. 
In addition to the effects of the healthy growth, the 

strength of public 
finances is largely due to the 
developments of revenues from oil and gas 
exploitation and from the pension fund yield tax, 
where the rise in prices and financial market 

developments respectively have boosted tax revenues 
substantially. It should be noted that the figures 
reported by the Commission, in
 contrast to the Danish 
National Accounts, include the surplus of the ATP 
pension fund, thereby improving the general 
government balance by aro
und 1 pp of GDP. This 
situation is expected to continu
e until spring 2007. 
In the forecast period, dampened economic activity 
and receding oil prices and lower revenues from the 
pension fund yield tax 
are expected to contribute to 
lower surpluses. On this basi
s, the gross debt ratio is 
expected to continue to
 fall markedly, reaching some 
31% of GDP at th
e end of 2007.

Activity in 2005 
Seasonally-adjusted GDP data ha
ve been very volatile 
over the last few quarters. After a marginal decline in 
the last quarter of 2004, the fi
rst quarter of 2005 saw a 
strong pick-up, followed by stagnation in the second. 
However, this variation in activity may have been 
exaggerated by the statistical adjustment for calendar 

effects.Overall, the main growth c
ontribution came from 
foreign demand. Exports benefited from decreasing 
relative unit labour costs, which led
 to higher market 
shares in an environment of growing world trade. In 
contrast, domestic demand remained weak as both 
private consumption and construction investment 

receded further in the first half of 2005. The reduction 
in the personal income tax rate from the beginning of 
2005 has so far had little effect on private 

consumption. 
Indicators point to a stro
nger second half of 2005 as 
the German economy is sufferi
ng less from rising oil 
and other raw material pri
ces than might have been 
expected. Net exports will rem
ain the main driving 
force. Recent data on production and domestic orders 

for investment goods point 
towards a strengthening of 
machinery and equipment investment whereas private 
consumption may still 
remain sluggish. The 
construction sector is proj
ected to continue its 
structural decline, though not at th
e same rate as in the 
first semester.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Foreign trade is expected to
 continue supporting 
economic growth in the me
dium term. At broadly 
stable exchange rates, German companies should 

profit in domestic and export markets from improved 
price competitiveness. The current account surplus is 
therefore projected to increase to above 4% of GDP in 

2007. During the winter months of 2005/2006 in particular, 
private consumption will be
 constrained 
by the surge in energy prices, but is 
expected to gain momentum 
towards the end of the forecast period. From 2006 on, 
real disposable income shou
ld benefit from the fall in 
inflation and the pick-up 
in regular employment. Once 
a new government is instal
led, uncertainty about the 
future reform strategy and its implications should 
wane. Consequently, the private savings rate is 

expected to decline somewhat over the forecast 
period.  
Investment in machinery
 and equipment should 
accelerate, while the decline in construction 
investment that has now lasted for over a decade 
should only gradually peter out
. Housing investment 
in particular is still 
suffering from excess capacity, 
subdued disposable income growth and, notably in the 
East, a declining population.  
With a continued sizeable positive growth 
contribution from the external side and a gradual 
recovery of domestic dem
and, GDP growth in 
Germany will gain momentum. With a projected 

growth rate of about 1½ 
% year-on-year in 2007, 
48Chapter 3 Member States, Germany actual growth should finally rise above potential. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Recent developments in the labour market were 
largely shaped by policy me
asures. The bulk of the 
new jobs created were the result of either subsidised 

self-employment, reduced payr
oll taxes ("mini-jobs") 
or work for benefit recipie
nts ("one-euro jobs"). In 
contrast, employment subject to social security 

contributions fell substantially in the first months of 
2005, but seems to ha
ve stabilised thereafter. As a 
consequence, seasonally-adj
usted unemployment 
continued to increase at the beginning
 of this year and 
stabilised only recently. 
The shift towards mo
re flexible forms of employment 
as a result of recent labour market reforms should 

come to an end over the forecast period. In addition, 
continued strong exports and a gradual pick-up in 
domestic demand will lead to a stronger creation of 

full-time employment. This 
in turn should allow wage 
growth in the private sector to pick-up as of 2007. In 
the public sector however, the recent collective 
agreement broadly fixes nominal wages at the current 
level until the end of 
2007. The current wage constraint, together with still rising labour 
productivity, will lead to a 
further fall in unit labour 
costs in 2005 and 2006, wh
ich should bottom out 
thereafter.  
Surging energy prices, tog
ether with increases in the 
tobacco tax, have driven
 headline inflation to the 
highest levels in four 
years. Based on the assumption 
of slightly lower oil prices 
compared with the level 
reached in September 2005, inflation should, under 
current policies with no tax 
rises legislated, converge towards the core rate, which
 is currently hovering 
around 1%. Public finances 
In 2005, the general governme
nt deficit is projected to 
widen and will hence breach the 3%-of-GDP ceiling 

for the fourth consecutive year. In cyclically adjusted 
terms, the deficit is expected to improve marginally 
from the previous year.  
The revenue share in 
GDP is expected to fall slightly this year, which is due to the implementation of the 
last stage of the tax relief law from the year 2000. 

However, subsidy repa
yments by several 
Landesbanken and the intro
duction of the road toll for 
lorries are adding to revenues. The low wage 
dynamics and the fall in the number of regular jobs 
are weighing on the contribution base of the social 

security system. Despite the 2004 
reform of the public 
health care system, public 
health insurers lowered the 
contribution rates only marginally 
in 2005 in order to 
continue running surpluses so as to reduce their debt. 
Expenditure relief continues 
to come from public 
sector wage restraint, reductions in public 
employment and a declining share of public 

investment in GDP. Nevert
heless, the expenditure 
share in GDP is unlikely to
 fall in 2005. While 
pension outlays have been growing less than nominal 

GDP, the rising number of recipients is burdening the 
budget. Pensions are inde
xed to wage developments 
with a lag. Despite the stagnating contribution base, 

current legislation prevents a 
decline in expenditure 
per recipient. As a consequence, the liquidity funds of 
the pension system have b
een further depleted in 
order to hold the contribution rate constant. The 
dampening effect of the 2004 reform of the health 
sector abated in 2005 due to rising prices of 
medication. 
The expenditure relief from the public sector wage 
bill and reduced public inve
stment has been balanced 
by significantly gro
wing expenditure on 
unemployment and social
 benefits. Employment 
growth could not contribut
e much to reducing this 
budgetary burden, as it was to a large extent promoted 
by public schemes. Holde
rs of “one-euro jobs” 
continue to be entitled to
 their social benefits and 
receive a small top-up. Moreover, the implementation 
of the new social benefit system (“Hartz IV”-package) 
did not provide the expenditure relief expected by the 

government. Administrative frictions in the transition 
have been greater than expected, and problems in the 
application of means-testing have led to higher 

expenditure per head 
and a higher number of 
recipients than expected. 
Finally, the pension office for former post office civil 
servants securitised future con
tributions from the post office’s successor companies, raising its liquidity, so 
that the federal government w
ould be able to postpone 
payments to the office in 20
05, equalling 0.25% of 
GDP. According to ESA95
 accounting rules, 
however, this transaction does not reduce government 

expenditure calculated on an accrual basis.

Up to the cut-off date for this forecast, the federal 
government had not adopted a draft budget for 2006. 
With current legislati
on in force, Germany would 
continue breaching the 3%-of-
GDP deficit ceiling also 
in 2006 and 2007. 
Further changes to the tax system 
are not legislated. Budgetary relief will continue to 

come from the public sector 
wage bill, as the wage 
agreement of 2005 
extends to 20
07. In addition, pension expenditure is projected to be dampened by 

the slow growth of the contribution base. In 2006, 
companies will have to carry forward a part of their 
monthly social contributio
ns from the middle of the 
following month to the end of the month when the 
payment is due. This will le
ad to thirteen instead of 
twelve cash payments in 2005, but does not affect the 

budget balance according to ESA95 accounting rules. 
With the political intention to keep the pension 
contribution rate constant, the pension system will 

record a deficit in 2006 an
d 2007. Under current 
legislation, the unemploym
ent insurance period will 
be shortened for elderly 
new recipients from February 
2006, providing budgetary relief from 2007. This will 
be supported by the recov
ery in the primary labour 
market expected for 2007. Overall, these measures are 

projected to reduce the cyclically-adjusted deficit 
slightly towards the end of the forecast period.  
Government debt would continue to rise over the 
entire forecast period, reaching 70% of GDP by 2006. 

According to ESA95 acco
unting rules, privatisation 
operations that involve 
the transfer of shares to 
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) are not debt-

reducing, pending the actual 
sale of shares on the 
market by KfW. As the federal government would 
have transferred most of its stock to KfW by 2006, the 

dampening effect of priva
tisation proceeds on gross 
debt will wane.

Activity in 2005 
GDP growth accelerated further during the first six 
months of 2005, from an annual growth rate of 7.8% 
in 2004 to a remarkable 8.6%. Activity is receiving 

strong support from both domestic demand and net 
exports, including tourism. I
nvestment jumped by 
9.1%, up from 6% last year, while private and public 

consumption, though lively, expanded at a distinctly 
slower pace than GDP. Construction benefited in 
particular from a housing boom, driving up credit 

demand. 
With the trade balance rapidly improving, the external 
account deficit is likely to narrow to less than 10% of 
GDP this year, despite a widening deficit on the 

income balances.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Estonia’s economy is expected 
to remain on a path of 
strong and broad-based growth, with annual rates well 
above 7% and little cyclical variation. Investment is 

expected to remain strong, fuelled by public 
infrastructure spending a
nd smooth absorption of EU 
transfers. The corporate sector can also be expected to 
invest vigorously, partly due to
 the fact that a tax 
exemption for reinvested earn
ings will be abolished 
by the end of 2008, in accordance with the provisions 
of the EU Accession Treaty. Net exports should 
remain positive, while private 
and public consumption 
may ease somewhat, keeping overall growth well-
balanced.  
Continued adherence to a prudent fiscal stance and the 
build-up of private pension funds should improve 
Estonia’s savings–investment balance. As a 
consequence, the external account deficit can be 

expected to distinctly narrow 
to a more sustainable 
level of around 6% of GDP towards the end of the 
forecast period. Labour market, costs and prices 
Buoyant activity is creating many new job 
opportunities, notably 
for the self-employed. 
However, statistics may overestimate the effective 
increase, as improved tax collection measures are 

leading to a systematic wh
itening of the grey 
economy. This same effect explains part of the 
employment growth observed in 2005. With 

unemployment steadily decreasing to 8.1% of the 
workforce in August 2005, labour shortages are 
emerging in certain segments of the market.  
Although wage pressure is mounting in some sectors, 
overall wage growth continues to be largely in line 
with the substantial pr
oductivity increases. Consequently, real unit labo
ur costs for the whole 
economy are projected to remain largely broadly 
stable. Service sector wages are growing most 

strongly as tourism and transport services are 
booming, followed by cons
truction and the public 
sector. Since wage formation is highly decentralised, 

settlements largely respect each sector’s financial 
constraints.During the first 9 months of 2005, HICP inflation 
picked up strongly to an average of more than 4% 

year-on-year, from 3% in 
the year 2004. Since June, 
when the strong base effect from EU accession in 
2004 had just started to abate, consumer prices 

accelerated again as a result of the oil price shock 
combined with a number of administered price 
increases that became effective in March. The weight 

of energy in the Estonian HICP basket is among the 
highest in the EU. Owing to
 this, core inflation rates 
so far have remained stable and low, at around 2%, 

while overall monthly HICP rates are running twice as 
high.  
Higher oil prices and public transport charges will 
continue to drive up
 inflation in the months to come. 
Annual HICP inflation is projected to peak at over 4% 
in 2005 before gradually declining to somewhat above 

3% in 2006 and to around 2½% in 2007. With strong 
competition in the retail sector, low pressure on

).producer prices and even declining prices in the 
telecom industry, core in
flation can be expected to 
remain at present levels, provided that wage increases 

stay in line with productivity 
gains. Since the country 
is aiming for adoption of the 
euro in 2007, keeping 
inflation in check will remain high on the Estonian 

policy agenda.  
Public finances 
Despite a supplementary budget adopted in October 
2005 raising expenditure by 1.3% of GDP, Estonia is 
expected to post a higher-than-projected general 

government surplus of over
 1% of GDP in 2005. This 
is owed to a combination 
of efficient tax collection, 
buoyant GDP growth and windfall gains from higher-

than-anticipated inflation
, in combination with strictly 
applied nominal expenditure ceilings. 
The comfortable budgetary situ
ation is set to prevail 
throughout 2006 and 2007. The 2006 budget which 

targets a small surplus is at 
present before Parliament, 
to be adopted in the last days of the year. The official 
target for 2007 is a balanced budget. However, as has 
been the case in recent years, some room for 

manoeuvre seems to be bu
ilt into the underlying 
government forecast. For both years, further cuts to 
the flat income tax rate, 
from its current 24% to an 
eventual 22%, are planned on the revenue side. 
Possible handouts to the elect
orate ahead of the 2007 
national elections
, especially higher benefits for 
pensioners, whose income is
 not fully protected 
against losses in purchasing power, may partly be 
covered by accumulated public reserves. In all, 

budgetary execution may yield small surpluses also 
for 2006 and 2007. Still, 
the fiscal stance is expected 
to ease at a time when GDP growth is close to its 

estimated potential.

Activity in 2005  
Following two years of strong economic activity, with 
GDP growing at 4.7%, high growth continued in the 
first quarter of 2005. 
However, the second quarter 
brought evidence of a slowdown, which would 
suggest that the planned fiscal withdrawal and the 
petering out of the ‘Olymp
ic bonus’ would already 
weigh on growth prospects. Leading indicators and 
hard data also point to 
slowing-down activity for the 
second half of the year, as well as for the year as a 

whole, but by less than 
anticipated in the Commission 
services spring 2005 forecasts, which projected 
growth rates around 3%. In 
addition, no clear signs 
have yet been observed that the recent oil price hike is 
having a significant impact on the real economy. 
Overall, GDP growth for 2005 is projected at 3.5%. 

Although this growth projection represents a 
relatively sharp growth slowdo
wn compared with the 
4.7% GDP growth rate recor
ded in 2004, economic 
activity in Greece is still growing well above most 
euro-area countries. 
The slowdown has its origin in a deceleration of the 
domestic sector, while, after several years of negative 
contributions, net exports should add to growth this 
year. With real disposable income growing less than 

last year, private consumption is projected to 
decelerate in 2005. In parallel, the fiscal retrenchment 
should put a brake on public consumption and reduce 

public investment in real 
terms, thus heavily weighing 
on total investment, which is projected to grow at a 
sluggish 1% in real terms. Overall, domestic demand 

is now expected to grow by less than 3%, compared 
with more than 4.5% last year. 
Lower growth prospects in th
e domestic sector should 
partially be compensated by 
developments in the 
external sector. The sharp deceleration in domestic 

demand is weighing on imports, which, after 
stagnating in the first half of the year, are forecast to 
be just above 1% for th
e whole year. However, 
supported by a strong tou
rism sector and, to a lesser 
extent, by wage moderation, exports could grow by 
close to 6%. As a result, the external sector could add 

almost one percentage point to GDP growth. 
Prospects in 2006 and 2007 Although the Greek economy is projected to 
decelerate only marginally over the forecast horizon, 
important changes are expected in growth 

composition. In particul
ar, economic activity will be 
almost exclusively based on domestic demand. GDP 
is expected to grow at just below 3.5% in both 2006 

and 2007, so that the Greek economy could continue 
growing above the rates projected in spring and, 
indeed, well above those of the euro area. Moderate 
wage and employment growth, as well as higher oil 
prices, should cause private consu
mption to slightly 
decelerate. However, investment is projected to 
rebound and sustain domestic demand. This rebound 
is expected to come from pu
blic investment, which is 
projected to return to growth rates close to those of 
GDP. Overall, as the recent incentives law and the 
business tax reform should 
continue to support private 
investment, total gross fixed capital formation is 
projected to grow at 
above 4% in 2006.  
On the external front, imports are also projected to 
rebound next year, coming back
 to rates more in line 
with past trends and growing by more than 4%. Based 
on a resilient tourism sector
 and helped by wage 
moderation, exports are expected to grow above 6%. 

As a result, the external sector is projected to 
contribute marginally to GDP growth. 
The economy should develop along quite similar 
trends towards the end of the forecast period, with the 

external sector being broadly neutral for growth. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Consistent with decelerating but still robust GDP 
growth, employment (full-time equivalent) is 

projected to grow above 1%
 per year until 2007. The 
unemployment rate should accordingly decrease to

around 10% by the end of the forecast period. Wages 
per head are set to keep rising above the projected 
productivity growth, but by 
much less than
 in 2004. 
The combination of high nominal wage growth, 
strong domestic demand and oil price hikes should 
fuel inflation, which is expected
 to rise to 3.5% this 
year and remain close to 3% until 2007. 
Public finances 
The September 2005 notification reported a deficit 
figure of 6.6% of GDP in 2004
1. Compared with the 
deficit reported in March this year, the 2004 deficit 

outcome is 0.5 percentage poin
ts of GDP higher. For 
2005, a deficit of 3.7% is 
projected, in line with the 
planned deficit announced by
 the government in 
September. This projection includes 0.8 percentage 
points of GDP one-off revenues from a securitisation 
of tax arrears, although the accounting treatment of 

this operation has not been yet approved by Eurostat. 
The deficit for 2006 is projected at 3.8% of GDP, 
which compares with the target of 2.6% in the draft 
budget. Several factors explain this difference. The 
forecast is based on a less favourable growth scenario 

(3.4% compared with 3.8% in the draft budget) and 
on a more prudent assessment of direct tax revenues, 
based on past outcomes. Moreover, temporary 

revenues worth 0.6% of GDP have not been taken into 
account because the draft budget does not spell out 
the underlying measures. Following established 

practice, the deficit projection 
for 2007, around 3.8% 
of GDP, is based on unchanged legislation. Finally, 
after rising to more than 
109% of GDP in 2004, the 
general government debt is projected to still remain 
above 100% of GDP at the end of the forecast period.

Activity in 2005
1Economic activity in 2005 
is underpinned by dynamic 
domestic demand, while the external sector 
continuous contributing ne
gatively to growth. Private 
consumption remains robust,
 supported by strong job 
creation and easy monetary an
d financial conditions. 
Such factors are also largely behind the projected 

acceleration in household investment in dwellings. 
Private consumption growing above real disposable 
income should further lower the households’ savings 

rate, which is expected to 
fall below 10%. This will 
further increase households’ exposure to interest rate 
and employment shocks. Inve
stment in equipment is 
projected to remain robust, reflecting improved 
business expectations. Overall, domestic demand 
would contribute with more than 5 percentage points 

to GDP growth in 2005. 
The external sector is still recording large imbalances. 
Its negative contribution to 
growth could be close to 2 
percentage points this year. In
 spite of increasing oil 
prices, imports are projected to grow at 7% in real 
terms, while exports present a rather flat profile, 
growing at a meagre 1%. As a result, the trade deficit 
should widen by more than 1 percentage point of 
GDP to attain 7½% this year, while the net lending 

position of the country would reach 6.3% of GDP 
(4.4% in 2004). These wide
ning external imbalances 
mirror the continuous deteriorati
on of the competitive 
position of the Spanish economy. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is projected to
 slightly decelerate to 
3.2% in 2006. Growth should still be based on 
buoyant domestic demand, as, in spite of higher 
interest rate expectations, high 
inflation is projected to 
keep real interest rates in 
the red, which, in turn, 
should push private consumption growing above 
disposable income. As a 
result, the saving ratio should 
continue in a decreasing path,
 going just below 8%. In 
parallel, household debt would rise well above 100% 
of gross disposable income. Investments should 

remain robust, backed by
 equipment and software, 
whereas residential construction growth is expected to 
moderate. All in all, the contribution of domestic 

demand to GDP growth is projected to be slightly 
below 5 percentage points. 
Imports are projected to
 decelerate only marginally 
since the modest slowdown in domestic demand 

comes from the construction sector, which has a low 
import intensity. Deteriorating
 competitiveness should 
keep exports growing well below EU trade, thus 

further reducing Spanish market shares. 
Consequently, the trade deficit should continue to 
widen to over 8.5% of GDP. Overall, the negative 
contribution from the external sector to GDP growth 
is projected to be above 1.5 percentage points. 
GDP growth is projected to further slow down in 
2007. Although o
il prices are expected to remain 
relatively stable, higher interest rate expectations 
should finally lead to po
sitive interest rates in real 
terms, which would put a break on both private 
consumption and investment in dwellings. With 
residential construction grow
ing at a reduced speed, 
gross fixed capital formation should decelerate at the 
end of the forecast period. In parallel, although at a 
55Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 Spain 
more moderate path, the household saving rate should 
go down to situate just 
below 8% of the gross 
disposable income, which, 
in turn, will further 
increase household’s debt. Overall, in spite of the 
rising risks associated to th
e financial position of 
households, domestic demand would contribute to 

GDP growth by around 4¼ percentage points. 
The projected deceleration of domestic demand 
should further moderate im
port growth. However, 
since no significant improvements are expected on 

productivity growth and inflation differentials 
between Spain and its main trade partners, exports 
would only grow by 2%, t
hus leading to further losses 
of market shares. As a result, the trade deficit might 
peak above 9% of GDP. Overall, the negative 
contribution to GDP growth 
from the external sector 
should remain slightly 
below 1¼ percentage points. 
The evolution of the external accounts in 2006 and 
2007 deserves special atten
tion. Declining net tourism 
inflows will narrow the surplus recorded by services, 

especially tourism, which ha
s traditionally offset the deficit in goods trade. The deficit of the balance of 
primary incomes and current transfers should 
increase, partially as a result of larger migrants’ 
transfers abroad and the expected decrease in EU 

transfers by 2007. In fact, prov
isional data for the first 
half of 2005 indicate that the surplus of services only 
just compensates for the aggregate deficits in the 

primary incomes and current transfers accounts. 
Therefore, the cu
rrent account deficit is of same size 
as the trade deficit. All in all, the current account 

deficit is expected to reach 9% of GDP at the end of 
the forecast period. The net borrowing position of the 
economy is projected at ab
ove 8% of GDP in 2007. 
Since net FDI is projected to decrease, portfolio 
investments should repr
esent the main source of 
finance of the external deficit. Persistently increasing 

financial needs might put 
pressure on risk premia, 
with possible negative feedbacks for Spanish 
households, which are already
 highly exposed to 
interest rate shocks. 
There are risks to this scenario. In particular, some of 
the current trends,  nam
ely, higher household’s 
indebtedness, low productiv
ity growth, a persistent 
inflation differential with the euro area and wider 
external imbalances, are increasing the risks of a 

slowdown of the internal demand. However, neither 
hard data nor softer indicators currently point to a 
likely drastic deceleration of the economic activity in 
the short term.  
Labour market, costs and prices  
Job creation is projected to remain robust over the 
forecast period. In 2005, employment is expected to 

grow at around 3% in full-time-equivalent terms. Part 
of the growth is the result of the regularization of 
immigrants carried out by the government during the 

first semester of the year. In 2006 and 2007, job 
creation should decelerate to about 2.5% and 2.2% 
respectively, in line with 
slower economic activity, 
especially in residential construction. The 
unemployment rate would slightly fall over the 
forecast period, to around 8% of the labour force by 

2007. Following the oil price hi
ke in the first and second 
quarters of 2005, headline in
flation, measured by the 
HICP, might be close to 3½% at the end of the year, 

while core inflation would remain around 1 
percentage point lower. Since the increase in energy 
prices is expected to have also
 an impact on 2006, 
inflation is projected to rema
in above 3% in that year 
and then ease gradually to 2.4% in 2007. Structural 

factors such as insufficien
t competition in certain 
utilities and services sectors, coup
led with remaining 
rigidities in the labour mark
et, would keep the 
inflation differential with the euro area at around 1 
percentage point. Although 
the relative moderation of 
construction prices in 2006 a
nd 2007 should lead to a 
narrowing of the gap, the 
GDP deflator is projected to 
keep growing well above the HICP over the forecast 
period. 
Compensation of employees per head is projected to 
grow at around 3% until the end of the forecast 
period. Therefore, real wage
s would almost stagnate, 
consistently with low pro
ductivity growth. However, 
nominal wages in Spain 
would still grow 
above the euro area average, thus mirroring the high and 
persistent inflation differential. Low productivity 

growth, coupled with 
high inflation, will continue being a drag on the co
mpetitiveness of the Spanish 
economy. As a result, unit labour costs are projected 
to keep on growing above the euro area average.

general government consolidated balance in 2005. 
This target appears attainable. In 2006, a close-to-
balance position is projected
 in both nominal and 
structural terms. Therefore, the fiscal policy should 
remain broadly neutral
2. This is in line with the draft 
Budget Law, which target
s a general government 
surplus of 0.2%, based on a 
plausible scenario where 
nominal GDP is projected to
 grow by 7%. However, 
the official projected revenues growth by 8.4% for the 

central government could turn 
out slightly optimistic. 
Regarding central governmen
t expenditures, the draft 
budget gives priority to R&D and infrastructures 

expenditure, which will gr
ow by around 30% and 
12% respectively. Overall, central government 
expenditures are projected to increase by around 8% 

in nominal terms. In 20
07, within the framework of 
the customary no-policy change scenario, with 
decelerating residential construction and private 

consumption, the elasticity of indirect taxes is 
projected to partially return to its long-term value of 
about 1. Consequently, revenues would grow at 6½% 
in nominal terms, compared with 6% nominal GDP 
growth. However, total expenditures are assumed to 
follow previous trends and increase by 7½%. On this 

basis, the general government deficit could be around 
0.4% of a percentage point of GDP. The debt to GDP 
ratio is projected to continue 
on a declining path, 
falling from almost 47% of GDP in 2004 to 41% in 
2007.

a concomitant upward revision of GDP figures by around 0.5 of a 
percentage point per year since 2000.

France - Household's savings rate
long-term average
The economic situation in 2005 
In 2005, real GDP growth slowed down more than 
expected. In the second quarter of this year, French 
GDP grew by a mere 0.1% (q-o-q), after having 

increased by 0.4% in the first quarter and 0.6% in the 
fourth quarter of 2004. Domestic demand and 
especially private consumption, which had supported 

the French economy in previous quarters, declined. 
The expiry of tax exemption, which previously 
encouraged households to free up some savings, 

might partly explain the fall in consumption in the 
second quarter.  Lower sal
es prospects and concerns 
related to oil price volatility hampered firms’ 

investment plans. According to national accounts 
data, business investment fell 
by 1.2% (q-o-q), after a 
rise of 1.9% in the preceding quarter. On the external 

side, the contribution of net trade to GDP growth 
continued to be negativ
e. All in all, the increase in 
stocks was the only factor that prevented the French 

economy from declining in the second quarter.  
Recent indicators suggest that GDP growth is likely to 
strengthen in the third quar
ter of 2005, supported by 
an exceptional rebound in consumer spending on 
manufactured goods. However, private consumption 
is not likely to grow on a sustained basis since the 

recovery of employment is
 slower than expected.  
Exports are projected to recover in the next semester 
thanks to the depreciation of 
the euro. All in all, the 
economy is forecast to grow by about ½% and ¼% q-

o-q, respectively, in the third and fourth quarter of 
2005.   
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006, real GDP growth is expected to strengthen to 
1¾% and to be slightly ab
ove its potential in 2007 at 
2¼%. Economic activity 
should still be driven by 
domestic demand, but the co
ntribution of net exports 
to GDP growth should be less 
negative by the end of 
the forecast period. 
Private consumption is forecast to remain the main 
driving force of economic growth, based on an 
expected recovery in employment. It will increase in 
line with disposable househol
d income, reflecting the 
expected rise in the demand for labour. By the end of 
2007, the reform of the 
35-hour working week may 
boost households’ income through an increase in 

authorised annual overtime and the possibility of 
converting the extra time sav
ed into additional 
revenues. The projected benign inflation outlook 

should also support 
households’ purchasing power.  
Investment in equipment is expected to decelerate 
next year (from 4¾ to 3¾%), mainly due to relatively 
low capacity utilisation. In 2
007, this tendency is 
likely to be reversed due 
to a more positive economic 
outlook, still supportive financing conditions and the 
retention of lower tax rates on new capital 
expenditure. In contrast, the 
investment in building 
construction is forecast to strengthen from 2.4% in 

2005 to about 3% in 
the two coming years thanks to historically favourable mortgage financ
ing conditions.  After a loss in export market shares in 2005 for the 
third consecutive year, export volumes are projected 

to increase again more in lin
e with the expansion of 
58Chapter 3 Member States, France external demand. This is due to an improvement in 
price competitiveness linked to the depreciation of the 
euro and a somewhat stronger impulse from France’s 

main trading partners (not
ably Germany and Italy). In 
this context, and although imports are forecast to 
remain buoyant in response to the robustness of final 

demand, the negative contribu
tion of net trade to GDP 
growth will diminish over the forecast horizon.  
Labour markets, costs and prices 
Uncertainties concerning the durability of the 
recovery and the traditional lag with which  
employment reacts to economic activity largely 
explain the current weakness 
in employment growth. 
In 2006 and 2007, employme
nt growth is set to 
strengthen in response to 
improved corporate 
profitability and better economic prospects over the 
forecast horizon. The recovery of employment should 

also be stimulated by th
e implementation of the 
“emergency employment plan” which aims at 
facilitating recruitment by small companies and 

encouraging return to work
. This would allow a 
substantial decline in the 
unemployment rate, from 
9.7% of the labour force in 2004 to 8.9% in 2007. 
Given the still high 
unemployment rate, wage 
moderation is expected to continue over the forecast 
horizon. Nevertheless, wages will 
still be supported 
by the harmonisation of the 
different levels of the 
minimum wage, induced by the reduction in the 
working week to 35 hour
s implemented between 1998 
and 2002, as well as by the increase in authorised 
annual overtime and the 
possibility of converting a part of it into additional
 income. Moreover, a slight 
cyclical acceleration in wages is expected to occur in 
2006 and 2007, driven by the improvement of the 
situation in the labour market. 
As productivity growth is expected to decelerate from 
the high rate observed in 
2004, unit labour costs 
should rise in 2005 but 
remain broadly 
constant over 
the forecast horizon. Core inflation is thus projected 

to pick up gradually, due to some diffusion effects of 
oil prices and price increases in the services sector. 
The government’s amendment of the so-called 
Galland Law regulating the relationship between 
French retailers and their suppliers 
is likely to lead to 
lower prices of major branded products and hence to a 
moderation of headline infl
ation. On the other hand, 
expected increases in administered prices notably 

linked to the health-care reform and administered 
energy prices should contribute to a rise in HICP 
inflation. Overall HICP inflation should be slightly 
above 2% in 2006 and 
slightly below 2% in 2007. 
Public finances 
Following a decline from 4.2% to 3.6% of GDP in 
2004, the general government deficit is projected to 
be further reduced to 3.2% of GDP in 2005, 
somewhat higher than the 
government deficit estimate 
at 3% of GDP. The Commission’s scenario is based 
on (i) a weaker macroeconomic scenario with a 
slower growth in comp
ensation of employees and 
private consumption and hence lower wage-based 
contributions and VAT, and (ii) higher expenditures 
notably in local administrations and social security 

funds (due to lower employ
ment and higher prices). 
This forecast incorporates substantial one-off 
payments to the general g
overnment for a total 
amount of 0.5% of GDP which are linked to the 

inclusion of the specific electricity and gas 
companies’ pension schemes in the general regime. 
New tax measures have a positive impact on the 
deficit of about 0.2% of GDP and notably include (i) 
an increase in social security contributions resulting 

from the above-mentioned 
incorporation of
 specific 
pension schemes into the general one, the 
implementation of the health-care reform and the 

creation of a complementary 
pension regime for civil 
servants, and (ii) an exceptional tax of 25% 
(compensating for the suppression of the previous 

system) on distributed prof
its not taxed at the normal 
rate1. Dynamic revenues notably from the personal 
income tax and revenues stemming from a good 

housing and stock exchange performance (such as 
taxes on change of ownership and on interest 
earnings) should lead to an overall elasticity of 

revenues to GDP of about 
1.2, above the 
long-term 
average. This forecast for 2005 is consistent with an 
improvement in the cyclically adjusted balance of 

about ½% of GDP, the largest part of which reflects 
the impact of the one-off measures.  
In the following years, the general government deficit 
would increase again to about 3½% of GDP if no 
additional measures are taken
. For 2006, this mainly 
reflects the fact that the ½% of GDP of one-off 

payments mentioned above will vanish. However, the 
2006 budget bill also cont
ains one-off revenues of 
about ¼% of GDP. They are linked to the integration 

of the postal company’s specific pension scheme in

the general regime, the liquidation of a precautionary 
fund associated with subsidised mortgages
2 and the 
exceptional collection of accumulated social 

contributions on specific subsidised saving plans that 
will thereafter be collected on an annual basis. The 
current general government 
deficit estimate is above 
that projected by the go
vernment (at 2.9%). The 
difference stems from a base effect, the growth 
differential, a lower tax-revenues-to-GDP elasticity 

and somewhat higher expenditures compared to the 
government forecast in the areas of local 
administration and health expenditures. About the 

latter, this forecast acknowledges that the health 
reform has noticeably curbed expenditures and thus 
lowered its assumption from 4% in the spring 

forecast, to 3.2%, which is still somewhat higher than 
that of the government (at 2.7%) based on a prudent 
assessment of some of the 
measures announced in the 
2006 draft budget for social security funds. The 
deficit forecast for 2007, at 3½% of GDP, assuming 
GDP growth at 2.3%, follows 
the conventional 
assumption of unchanged po
licies. It thus takes 
account of already decided measures impacting 2007 
such as (i) the income tax reform, (ii) an increase in 

the employment premium and in the income tax 
allowance linked for young
 children, and (iii) the 
entrenchment of lower tax rates for new investment. 

All in all, these measures 
will represent about ¼% of 
GDP in 2007. The debt to GD
P ratio would continue 
to increase from about 65% in
 2004 to 68% in 2007.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP 
expanded by 4.1% on the year in the second quarter 
after a rather meagre increase of 2.1% in the previous 

three months. In the first half of 2005, domestic 
demand was strong and appeared to be the main 
driver of economic growth while the contribution 

from the external economy was negative. On the 
domestic side, consumer demand slightly picked up 
after a more muted performance in 2004. Investment 

expenditure also grew rapidly, mirroring very strong 
demand for equipment and 
continued buoyancy of the 
construction sector. On the external 
side, figures for 
the first half suggest a fairly weak performance by 
exports, reflecting a less favourable trading 
environment. Imports put in
 a somewhat stronger 
performance, following the 
pick-up in consumer and 
investment demand. For the 
third quarter, purchasing 
managers’ indices reported increased activity for both 

manufacturing and services. Confidence indicators, 
however, did not fully confirm the brightening of the 
outlook across sectors, as there have been some 
fluctuations in co
nsumer and retail trade sentiment.  
Despite some risk related 
to uncertainties stemming 
from the external environment, prospects for the 

second half of 2005 are 
positive. The economy’s 
momentum is supported by recent strong employment 
gains (mainly concentrated in the construction sector), 

boosted by record immigration and increased 
participation. Some easing 
of competitiveness 
pressures on the back of the recent depreciation of the 

euro might also allow for 
a stronger performance of 
exporting sectors. For
 the year as a whole, real GDP is 
estimated to grow ju
st below 4½%, as in 2004. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is forecast at 4.8% and 5.0% in 2006 and 
2007 respectively, close to 
the rate commonly thought 
to be sustainable in the medium term. Robust 
domestic demand is expected to continue to be the 
main driving force of economic growth. Private 

consumption is underpinned
 by strong employment 
growth (albeit lower than
 in 2005), though recent 
fluctuations in confidence suggest that the projected 

pick-up in consumer spendi
ng into 2006 might be 
rather gradual. Private spending is projected to 
accelerate further and to reduce the saving rate in 

2007, in the year when the bulk of SSIA funds (a 
government-sponsored saving scheme) reach 
maturity. Investment in housi
ng is projected to taper-
off over the forecast period, as the recent record 
volumes of completions are unlikely to be repeated. 
However, part of the downward correction in the 

residential sector is expected to
 be offset by a rebound 
in commercial construction and strong infrastructure 
investment. On the external side, services exports are 
projected to put in a strong performance but the 
outlook for merchandise 
exports is somewhat less 
positive. Import growth is forecast to accelerate into 
2007, in line with the projected pick-up in consumer 
expenditure. As net profit outflows are expected to 

remain on an upward trend, 
the implied growth rate of 
Gross National Income is somewhat lower than that of 
GDP. Overall, robust economic growth is projected to 
continue, but development
s in the international 
economy and euro/dollar exchange rate remain the 
key medium-term risks to
 an economy as highly 
globalised as Ireland. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2005, employment growth is 
set to strengthen to an 
extremely robust 3.8%. In line with the projected 
gradual easing back of const
ruction output and strong 
performance of the service s
ector, employment gains 
will be somewhat weaker but still
 very robust in 2006 
and 2007. Labour force growth, fuelled by significant 
inward migration (notably from the new EU Member 
States) and increased participation, is projected to 

keep up with the upward employment trend. The 
unemployment rate is thus estimated to remain below 
4½% over the forecast period. In line with the data for 

the first half of 2005, 
per capita compensation is

estimated to grow at around 
5% on the year in 2005. 
Some further easing of wage inflation is projected in 
2006 due to the 
completion of the current round of 
“benchmarking” awards to public sector workers, but 
this is expected to be partly offset by relatively tight 
labour demand. HICP inflation has somewhat picked 

up in the third quarter of 2005, partly reflecting 
adverse energy price developments, and is forecast to 
reach 2.2% for the year as a whole. This annual rate is 

expected to moderate in the second half of 2006 due 
to a base effect, before rising sli
ghtly again into 2007 
in line with the projected revival of consumer 

spending. 
Public finances  
In 2005, the general government deficit is estimated 
to fall below ½% of GDP, 
which compares to the 
initial official target of 0.8% of GDP. The underlying 

general government balance 
is even stronger as the 
projected deficit includes higher net expenditure of 
around 0.6 percentage points of GDP for a February 
2005 court ruling on nursing home payments. This 
relatively favourable estimate
d outturn is mainly due 
to higher-than-expected tax receipts, including also 
one-off income from special Revenue 
Commissioners’ (Ireland’s tax collection agency) 

investigations in 2005, a
nd partly also on account of 
expected slight under-spend
ing in capital outlays. The 
deficit is projected to fall slightly to 0.3% and 0.1% of 

GDP in 2006 and 2007 resp
ectively. Given the non-
indexed nature of the tax and social benefit system, 
the no-policy-change assum
ption is made operational 
for 2006 and 2007 by freezing average tax rates and 
adjusting social transfer payments by the forecast of 
CPI inflation (with a small 
top-up). Government gross 
debt is projected on a mode
st downward trend just 
below 30% of GDP over the forecast period.

Activity in 2005  
After two consecutive qua
rters of negative GDP 
growth at the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005, 
the Italian economy rebounded in the second quarter 

of 2005. Robust private 
consumption and investment 
in construction, as well as stro
ng exports, drove GDP 
up by 0.7%. Recent economic indicators point to 

positive growth in the 
second half of the year. 
However, due to the decline in
 output in the first three 
months of the year, GDP growth in 2005 as a whole is 

forecast to be only 0.2%, down from 1.2% in 2004.  
The nearly flat grow
th in 2005 is the result of a weak 
contribution of domestic demand and a negative 
contribution of the external sector. Private 

consumption in 2005 has been supported by 
surprisingly solid employment growth. The negative 
impact of higher energy 
prices on consumption has 
been partly offset by declines in other components of 
HICP inflation. Total investment is forecast to decline 
by around 1% in 2005, as a 
result of a steep drop in 
investment in equipment that
 has been partly offset by 
positive growth in constructi
ons. On the external side, 
in spite of the projected recovery in exports in the 
second half of the year, Italy is expected to record a 
large loss of market shares in 2005, caused by 

worsening cost and 
price competitiveness.  Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
Against the background of the assumed strong global 
growth, broadly stable exc
hange rates, favourable 
financial conditions an
d stabilising oil prices, the 
recovery started in the second quarter of 2005 is 
expected to consolidate in 2006. GDP is forecast to 
grow by around 1.5% in 2006, slightly above the 
estimated rate of potential growth.   
Although the main con
tribution to GDP growth in 
2006 is expected to come from domestic demand, the 
forecast also projects an improvement in the external 
contribution to growth relative to 2005. In particular, 

exports are expected to accelerate, although to a rate 
of growth still well below that of Italy’s export 
markets.  Private consumption is expected to be supported by 
healthy real disposable income growth (1.5%), 
resulting from further in
creases in employment and 
real wages. Wealth gains on households’ holdings of 

real and financial assets and a further expansion of 
borrowing could also pr
ovide some stimulus to 
consumption. The household savings rate is projected 

to stabilise at the 2005 level.  
Better demand prospects are expected, in turn, to 
stimulate investment expenditure. Some of the pre-
conditions for a pick-up in 
investment are in place: 
business confidence and orders are rising; corporate 
balance sheets have improved and financing costs 

have decreased, as a result of the low level of interest 
rates and the rise in share 
prices. Companies will also 
benefit from a reduction in
 employers’ social security 
contributions of up to 
1% introduced by the 2006 
budget. However, capacity utilisation is still close to 
its medium-term average. 
The forecast for 2007 posits a continuation of these 
trends. GDP growth is exp
ected to slow down 
63Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 Italy 
marginally, to 1.4%, as the 
contribution to growth 
from the external 
sector returns slightly negative 
amidst the assumed weakening in foreign demand and 

further losses in price com
petitiveness. Domestic 
demand is expected to continue growing by around 
1.5%, with a slowing down 
in investment expenditure 
compensated by slightly 
stronger consumption 
growth.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Reflecting the pick up in 
output and further effects 
from the implementation of the labour market reforms 

introduced since the mid-1990s, employment, 
measured in full-time equivalents, is forecast to 
expand by 0.6% in both 2006 and 2007. The main 

contribution to overall employm
ent growth is likely to 
continue to come from the services sector. The rate of 
unemployment is expected to 
fall to 7.5% in 2007. 
After declining in 2005, 
labour productivity is 
forecast to pick up in 2006 and 2007. Together with 
slightly lower wage inflation 
in the private sector and 
the reduction in 
social security contributions, this 
should bring about a marked deceleration in unit 
labour costs compared to 2
005 and contribute to 
keeping core inflation below 2%. Due to the impact of 
higher oil prices, headline HICP inflation is forecast 
to remain slightly above 2% in 2006, before declining 

to 1.9% in 2007.  The expected higher rate of
 productivity growth and 
deceleration in unit labour costs will temper but not 
halt the loss of internation
al competitiveness. Since 
1999, Italy’s unit wage costs in manufacturing have 
risen by almost 20% more than in its euro area 
partners. In addition, high non-wage costs also weigh 

on Italy’s competitive position.  Public finances 
Statistical revisions carried-out in May increased the 
general government deficit in the order of 0.2% of 
GDP for all the years from 2001 to
 2004, on
 average. 
The deficit is now reported 
at 3.2% of GDP in 2001, 
2003 and 2004, and at 2.7% of GDP in 2002. Debt 
levels were also revised upwards. In particular, the 
debt ratio for 2004 is now reported at 106.5% of GDP, 
up from the 105.8% of GDP notified in March. 
The general government deficit is forecast to increase 
to 4.3 % of GDP in 2005 from 3.2% in 2004, in line 
with the government esti
mates. The primary surplus is 
forecast to fall to 0.6% of GDP in 2005, from 1.8% in 
2004. In cyclically-adju
sted terms, the budget balance 
is expected to deteriorate by about half of a 

percentage point of GDP compared to 2004. Taking 
into account the decline 
in the contribution from 
temporary measures from 1.4% of GDP in 2004 to 

0.5% of GDP in 2005, the structural deficit (defined 
as the cyclically-adjusted deficit net of one-off and temporary measures) would be around half of a 

percentage point of GDP 
lower than in 2004.  
In the draft budget for 2
006, the governme
nt targets a 
reduction in the deficit to 
3.8% of GDP, in line with 
the Council recommendation to Italy under Article 

104(7) of July 2005. When including the amendment 
decided by the government 
on 28 October, the draft 
budget and an accompanying law decree combine 

deficit-reducing measures estimated at 1.8% of GDP 
with new expenditures and tax
 cuts totalling 0.7% of 
GDP.  The assessment of the 2006 draft budget has been 
made difficult by the stepwi
se presentation of the 
adjustment measures. On the basis of a cautious 
evaluation of some of the measures in the budget, the 
Commission services forecast the 2006 deficit at 4.2% 
of GDP. In particular, the savings on health care 

expenditure and on current expenditure of central and 
local government are projected to fall short of the 
ambitious official targets. Ceilings on health care 

expenditure have not been 
attained in the past and the 
new procedures set in place to control health 
expenditure in 2006 will have to prove their 

effectiveness. Similarly, the pl
anned cuts to the 
intermediate consumption of
 central and local 
governments would imply decreases in nominal 

terms, which do not seem achievable given recent 
expenditure trends and the fact that mechanisms to 
durably contain intermedi
ate consumption may need 
further strengthening. The primary surplus is forecast 
to remain at the 2005 
level (0.6% of GDP). Net of 
cyclical factors, the budget and the primary balances 

will remain broadly stable relative to 2005. Deficit-
reducing temporar
y and one-off measures, in 
particular sales of real estate and revenues from 
revaluations of corporations’ assets, are estimated at 
around 0.4% of GDP. The assessment of the 2006 draft budget carries both 
positive and negative risks. 
On the one hand, if

expenditure and the ambitious cuts on central and 
local government current expenditure turned out to be 
fully effective, the deficit might be lower than 

forecast. The possible postponement of expenditure 
linked to the Lisbon agen
da to 2007 might also 
improve the 2006 deficit figure. On the other hand, 

even the attainment of the sizable savings on current 
expenditure included in the Commission services 
forecasts might prove challenging to carry-out. 

Moreover, the cuts in 
transfers to p
ublicly-owned companies may be difficult 
to sustain given their 
current financial needs. Finally, the 2006 budgetary 

forecast incorporates measures announced by the 
Government but not yet approved by Parliament.  
The forecast for 2007 of a deficit of 4.6% of GDP is 
based on the customary no-policy-change assumption, 

i.e. only measures already formally adopted by the 
government are taken into account.  
The government debt ratio is forecast to increase to 
108.6% of GDP in 2005, up from 106.5% in 2004, 
thus interrupting the d
ecline started in 1995. The 
negative impact of debt-increasing below-the-line 
operations is expected to 
more than offset the positive 
effect from privatisation receipts estimated at 0.3% of 

GDP in 2005. Planned privatisation receipts of about 
1% of GDP will contribute to th
e decline in the debt-
to-GDP ratio in 2006.

                     growth and GDP growth
Activity in 2005 
In line with the strong growth performance recorded 
in 2004, when GDP growth picked up to 3.8%, 
growth in the first two quarters 2005 reached 3.8% 

and 3.5% year-on-year respectively. Economic 
activity continued to be mainly driven by domestic 
demand, notably private sector consumption and 

investment, including co
nstruction. Concurrently, 
external demand recovered as, inter alia, tourism 
arrivals rose by 6.4% for the 
first nine months, up 
from growth rates recorded in previous years, while 
import growth decelerated following the import spike 
in 2004. Surveys indicate a 
continued po
sitive outlook 
for tourism arrivals for the remainder of the year.  
With uncertainties on oil price developments and 
restrained EU growth prospe
cts, the outlook for GDP 
growth for 2005 as a whole is
 set at 3.9%, similar to 
2004’s. Domestic private sector demand growth is 
projected to slow down after the 
surge in 2004 but 
remains a main growth f
actor, supported by a rebound 
in net external demand. Consumption growth is 
projected at 4.3%, in line with wage and employment 
growth. After strong growth in 2004, investment 
expansion remains relatively bu
oyant at 4.5%, linked, 
inter alia, to a more compe
titive environment 
following EU accession. Interest rates have been 
lowered by a total of 125 basis points so far this year, 
before and after smooth entry in ERM II in May 2005; 

lower rates also should help stimulate demand. The 
growth contribution from net external demand is 
forecast to turn positive through a strengthening in 

exports and deceleration in import growth after the 
rush in 2004 linked to strong domestic demand 
expansion and one-off factors (reduction in car 
excises). However, high ener
gy import price rises put 
upward pressure on nominal import growth and the 
current account deficit is expected to increase slightly 
to 5.8% of GDP.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Based on a continuation of the demand factors noted 
for 2005, the forecast projects for 2006 and 2007 a 
marginal strengthening of GDP growth to 4.0% and 
4.2%, respectively. Private sector consumption is 

foreseen to increase by abou
t 4% both years, 
consistent with wage de
velopments and employment 
growth. Investment growt
h is expected to remain 
strong at 5% by 2007. Public consumption is assumed 
to increase relatively modestly, by 2-2.7%, 
throughout. With a m
oderately positive EU growth 
outlook, export growth is projected to strengthen 
somewhat in both years, 
with similar tourism arrival 
growth rates as in 2005 and robust growth in non-

tourist services. Import growth is expected to pick up 
with domestic demand in 2006 and 2007, while high 
oil prices further push nominal
 imports. Altogether, 
the forecast projects a slight decline in the current 
account deficit to below 5% of GDP by 2007. Deficit 

financing through FDI and portfolio investment is 
expected to remain unproblematic. 
Costs and prices, labour market 
HICP inflation for the first nine months of 2005 
reached 2.1% compared to the same period in 2004. 

This is marginally above 
the 2004 rate at 1.9%, 
mainly as a result of higher energy prices, but still 
slightly below the project
ed rise of 2.3% for the year. 
In 2006 and 2007 in
flation is expected to gradually 
weaken again to around 2.1% as oil price pressures 
abate. In May 2005 Cyprus successfully entered ERM 

II. Following significant 
capital inflows interest rates 
were lowered twice, while the Cyprus pound 
remained in the upper 
fluctuation margin limits. 
Overall, the real effective exchange rate has tended to 
appreciate in the wake of some inflation pressures 
(mainly one-off, through 
VAT increases linked to EU 
harmonisation), leading to some price-
competitiveness loss.  
With steady GDP growth, 
unemployment is projected 
to inch down to 4.8% this year, from a peak of 5.1% 
last year, and to further diminish to 4.5% by 2007.

Wage moderation in the public sector and an 
increasing share of foreign labour (currently about 
14% of the total labour 
force, which includes 
commuting Turkish Cypriot workers) continue to 
exert some downward pressure on wages, which are 
expected to increase between 1.5-2.0% in real terms, 

in line with policy to 
keep real wage growth below 
expected productivity growt
h, leading to real unit 
labour cost decreases of 0.4%-1.0%.  
Public finances 
Government revenues in 
Jan-August 2005 increased 
by 17% and expenditure by 7%, leading to a balanced 
budget for the period (cash-basis). This can be 
attributed to the ongoing impact of one-off (especially 

tax amnesty) but also structural fiscal consolidation 
measures on expenditure and revenue sides. While 
revenues were also supported by a domestic-demand 

based growth composition, leading to extra tax 
revenues, major parts of payments associated with 
expenditure are made toward year-end. Based on the 
above, together with the base-year effect of a better-
than-expected 2004 deficit 
reduction to a total 
adjustment of 2.2 percentage points and successful 
negotiations with social par
tners on a few key planned 
consolidation measures, the forecast projects a deficit 

decline to below 3% of
 GDP this year, in line with 
convergence programme commitments. On an 
unchanged policy basis, and corrected for one-off 

(revenue) measures, a similar deficit is projected for 
2006, declining somewhat by 2007. Given these 
narrow margins, it remains im
portant to keep up fiscal 
consolidation efforts unabatedly.  
On the same assumption, 
debt is projected to decline 
from 72% of GDP in 2004 to below 68% by 2007, 
reflecting mostly the effects of 
improved primary 
balances already from 2005.

Activity in 2005 
According to preliminary national accounts, real GDP 
growth reached an all-time-high in the second quarter, 
registering 11.6% year-on-year after an already robust 

7.4% in the previous quarter. In the first half of 2005, 
domestic demand remained high and external demand 
accelerated. Judging from retail trade turnover, 

consumer demand continues to expand at a steady 
rate, fuelled by better access to consumer credit and 
significant increases in real disposable income. 

Investment grew very fast, re
flecting strong demand 
for equipment and continued buoyancy in the 
construction sector. Export performance was 

particularly strong in the f
irst half of 2005. Export 
values grew by more than 30 percent year-on-year, 
outpacing imports, which grew by around 25 percent. 

Even though, th
e external deficit rema
ins large, the contribution to GDP growth of net exports will be 
negligible. 
Overall, the prospects for the economy in the second 
half of 2005 remain positive. The economy’s 
momentum is supported
 by significant EU-funds-
related activity, increased labour participation and 
declining unemployment. For the year as a whole, 
GDP is estimated to grow 
by around 9%, just above 
the 8.3% recorded in 2004. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Growth prospects fo
r 2006-2006 are also
 strong, with 
an expected expansion exceeding 7% in both years, 
close to the growth of potential output. However, if 

rate and quality of investmen
t (thus contributing to 
maintaining high pr
oductivity growth) were not 
achieved as assumed, there would be significant 
downward risks to the sustai
nability of expansion at 
the rates foreseen. 
Final domestic demand is expected to continue to 
drive growth, primarily 
led by investment, with 
housing construction increasing strongly. Private 

consumption is also expected to remain strong, largely 
because of employment growth, substantially higher 
real wages and better access to consumer credit. The 

continued low cost base and growing productivity 
mainly due to high levels 
of investment will boost 
export growth. Import growth
 is also expected to 
remain robust due to the increase of investment and 
intermediate goods. 
Although import growth is 
projected to slow somewhat, narrowing the trade 

deficit, the negative net contribution to GDP growth 
from trade is expected to widen again in both 2006 
and 2007. Throughout the forecast period, the current 

account deficit is expected to narrow only marginally. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
High growth has contributed to boost employment 
and to reduce unempl
oyment. In line with the 
projected expansion of const
ruction output and strong 
performance of the service s
ector, employment gains 
are likely to remain robust 
in 2006 and 
2007. Labour force growth, after taking account of significant 
outward migration (chiefly to the old EU Member 
States) and negative demographi
c trends, is projected 
to remain sluggish. The unemployment rate is 
estimated to decrease steadily. Active employment 
measures may provide some help in softening 

considerable regional develop
ment disparities. In line 
with the data for the fi
rst half of 2005, per capita 
compensation is estimated to pick up sharply in 2005. 

Wages are expected to continue growing rapidly over 
the next couple of years. Pro
ductivity growth in most 
industries will remain faster than that of wages. 
Since July 2004 HICP inflation in
 Latvia has been the 
highest among the Member States; core inflation has 
also been progressively 
increasing. Thr
oughout 2005 
a sharp pick-up in infla
tion has been reflected in all 
indices, with that for producer prices outpacing 
consumer prices. Several external factors (e.g. high oil 

prices and the relatively high exchange rate peg) have 
contributed to price growth. 
Food prices continue to 
increase at a high rate. Administrative price changes 

were less important in the 
first half of 2005, though

in the second half. The 
main risk to the inflation 
outlook is that price increases could become persistent 

if strong demand continues to drive output above 
potential and feeds into in
flation expectations. Taking 
this into account, the current prospect is for HICP 

inflation for 2005 of around 6¾%, and only modestly 
lower in 2006. Public finances 
Generally, owing to the strong growth, fiscal targets 
have been met or even exceeded. In 2005, the latest 

figures confirm that the budget is so far strongly in 
surplus vis-à-vis a defic
it target of 1.6% of GDP for 
the year as a whole. However, budgetary amendments 

adopted in August foresee 
increases in spending of 
about 1½% of GDP and will br
ing the deficit close to 
the official target. The authorities plan a significant 

increase in investment, largely based on higher levels 
of EU financial aid, which has been rising since 2004. 
The 2006 budget law
 provides for a 
17.6% increase in 
expenditure and a 19.2% increase in revenue. The 
attainment of the 1.5% of GDP deficit target seems 

plausible given the growth
 and inflation outlook. 
However, the 2006 budg
et will not allow a mid-year 
opening to increase expenditure as has been common 

in previous years. All together, the deficit is expected 
to remain at around 1.5%
 of GDP in 2006-2007. 
Government debt is projected 
to remain below 15% of 
GDP over the forecast period.

Output is estimated to have grown by 6.4% in the first 
half of 2005, with domestic demand remaining as the 
main driver for growth. Preliminary data point that 

growth accelerated to 7.6% in the third quarter of 
2005 year-on-year. A deceleration of investment growth in the first half 
of 2005 is seen as temp
orary, and investment is 
expected to lead growth in the whole 2005. Consumer 
spending is forecast to remain strong, as suggested by 
high growth of retail sales and bank credit. A drag 

from net trade continued in
 the first half of 2005 as 
import growth remained str
ong. But exports increased significantly, stimulated by
 strong growth in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and 
despite a sharp drop in electricity exports from 
Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (Lithuania’s major 

power producer).  
Growth prospects in 2006 and 2007 Output growth is expected to gradually weaken 
although remaining at around 6% and becoming more 
balanced. Domestic demand re
mains the main driver, 
despite a slowdown led by lower growth of private 
investment and consumption. 
Investment is nevertheless e
xpected to lead growth in 
2005-2007, aided by EU funds and favourable 
financial conditions for pri
vate investment. In 2006-
2007, the reduction of the 
personal income tax and 
higher disposable income growth are likely to 
stimulate consumption, thou
gh a weaker growth rate 
than in previous years is assumed as bank credit 
growth moderates.   
Import growth is forecast to stabilise in 2006-2007 at 
around 11% after slowing down in 2005. Export 
growth is expected to p
ick up significantly in 2005 
and maintain the impetus in 2006-2007, aided by high 
import growth in some of Lithuania’s main trading 
partners (the CIS and neighbouring EU countries). 

The negative contribution of net trade to growth is 
expected to remain broadly unchanged, though an 
improvement in the terms of trade leads to a reduction 

of the current account deficit to about 7% of GDP by 
2007. Lithuania’s net borro
wing position in the 
balance of payments is anticip
ated to fall to about 
5.3% of GDP in 2007, due 
to the positive impact of 
increasing capital transfers from the EU.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The 12-month average HICP inflation accelerated to 
2.7% in September 2005, 
mostly reflecting rising 
energy, health-care, transport and some food prices. 
However, monthly y-o-y inflation in the period May–
September 2005 turn
ed out lower than 
expected in the 
Commission services 2005 spring forecast, as core 
inflation remained low and one-off effects that created 

inflation pressures in May 2004 started fading away 
more rapidly than foreseen. Thus, the annual average 
HICP inflation forecast for 2005 is revised down to 

2.6% (from 2.9% in spring). 
In 2006, inflation is projected to edge up to 2.8%. An 
initial slowdown, due to fad
ing one-off effects that 
arose in the early months of 
2005, is expected to be 
followed by an acceleration in the second half of the 
year. Inflation is foreseen to in
crease to 2.9% in 2007. 
Core inflation is expected to remain low and rapid 

productivity growth is likely 
to continue over the 
forecast period, but oil prices, several services prices 
and wage growth are assumed to remain high. Risks 

to the inflation pr
ojections are on the upside. High oil 
prices and a strong reaction of wages and prices to 
demand growth are the main threats, together with a 

potential increase in gas prices, which is being 
considered by Lithuania’s single gas supplier. 
Employment growth picked up in the first half of 
2005, while the unemploymen
t rate declined further to 
below 10%. The labour market continued tightening 
and earnings started accelerating rapidly. Some 

sectors are experiencing problems 
to balance supply 
and demand of labour, reinforced by emigration.

).Structural unemployment is high and thus the high 
unemployment rate is not 
very indicative of available labour resources. 
Employment growth is anticip
ated to peak in 2005 
and remain positive over the forecast horizon. The 
labour market is likely to
 continue tightening. 
Nominal wage growth is expe
cted to remain above the 
moderate trend of last years and surpass productivity 
growth. Current active labour market measures should 
improve labour availability, but 
are unlikely to offset 
labour market imbalances 
in the short term. A 
personal income tax cut in 
July 2006 is expected to 
slow down wage growth in 2006-2007, reducing the 

gap with productivity gains and moderating the 
impact on unit labour costs.  
Public finances 
Methodological changes regarding the classification 
of compensation for lost (rouble) savings and real 

estate restitutions resulted in 
a downward revision of 
the government deficits in
 previous years. A tax 
reform was approved last June. Personal income tax 
will be lowered in two steps 
from the present 33% to 
24% in 2008. The corporate profit tax will be 
temporarily increased to 19% in
 2006, but will fall 
back to the present 15% in 2008. A new tax on real 

estate was approved, but it is still unclear how it will be applied. The general government deficit is 
projected to increase from 1.4% of GDP in 2004 to 

2% in 2005, mostly due
 to salary increases in the 
public sector, higher pension benefits and rising 
investment. The deficit is forecast to decrease 

gradually to about 1.6% of GD
P in 2007, on the back 
of robust tax revenue growth. The impact of the tax 
reform is likely to be broad
ly neutral until 2007, due 
to the temporary increase of the corporate tax.

Luxembourg - Employment and 
                     unemployment
The situation in 2005 
The Luxembourg economy has performed well in 
2005 and real GDP growth should reach more than 
4%, only slightly less than th
e 4.5% recorded in 2004. 
The financial sector value added has risen by more 
than 6%, thanks to th
e good health of financial 
markets. Industry has performed well too, even if the 

figures might be somewhat inflated by the strong 
growth of the energy sector
. Hotels and restaurants 
benefited from the fact that Luxembourg held the EU 

presidency in the first half of the year. On the other 
hand, retail trade is stagnating, reflecting the weakness of private consumption. 
Domestic demand has been rather subdued in 2005, 
with private consumption growing by hardly more 
than 1%. Although unempl
oyment remains relatively 
low by EU standards, its rise in recent years is likely 

to negatively affect consumer confidence. Similarly, 
gross fixed capital formation grew by merely 1½%. 
Only housing showed some buoyancy, while 

investment by the government and enterprises was 
weak.  Actually, growth in 2005 was chiefly 
supported by external trade, especially in services, 
with both exports and im
ports of services rising by 
about 10% in real terms. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth should slightly accelerate to about 4½% 
in 2006 and 2007: the 
external sector will probably be less supportive than in 2005 but domestic demand 
should be more dynamic. Pri
vate consumption should 
accelerate despite the projected rise in unemployment: 
wage increases are projected between 2.5% and 3% 
and residents employment is forecast to rise by 1½% 
to 1¾% a year over the forecasting period.. 

Consequently, the increase in real households 
disposable income will not be negligible despite the 
relatively high inflation recorded in 2005 and 

projected for 2006 Similarly, investment by 
enterprises, which has been ve
ry subdued in 2004 and 
2005 should accelerate appreciably in response to 

rapid output growth. The more dynamic domestic 
demand should also lead to a significant acceleration 
in imports, which explai
ns for a part why external 
trade will be less supportive. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Reflecting the strong growt
h in output, employment 
rose by about 3% this y
ear. However, unemployment 
kept rising: with a 5.3 %   unemployment rate this 

year, the Grand-Duchy no longer has the lowest 
unemployment in the EU. Once again, job creation 
mostly benefited non-residents, whose number rose 

by nearly 6% while resi
dents employment only 
increased by about 1½%. This discrepancy probably 
reflects mismatches between the skills (or absence 
thereof) of unemployed residents and those required 
by the jobs created but it might
 also be the result of a 
significantly higher reserva
tion wage in Luxembourg, 
related to the high level of 
wages and the generosity 
of the social security system. Due to this bias towards 

non-residents, it increasingly 
seems that employment 
has to rise by more than 3½% a year in Luxembourg 
for unemployment to stabilise. Employment growth is 

projected to accelerate over the forecast period but 
probably not enough to prevent unemployment from 
continuing to rise, albeit at a slower pace. Moreover, 

like in recent years, the rise in domestic employment 
should considerably outpace the increase in resident 
employment. 
Inflation considerably accelerated in the course of 
2005, mostly as a result of the surge in oil prices, with 
the yearly rise in the HICP reaching 5.0% in October. 
The national CPI, which excludes consumption by 
non-residents and especially 
their large purchases of 
car fuel, alcohol and tobacco products, neared 3%. In 

yearly averages, the HICP should increase by more 
than 4% and the national CPI by more than 2½% this 
year. However, underlying inflation remains moderate 

and is even decelerating. Inflation is also expected to 
slow down during the projection period. However,

due to the large carry ov
er effect, both the national 
CPI and the HICP could post higher annual increases 
in 2006 than in 
2005. In 2007, on the contrary, both 
indexes are projected to decelerate significantly to the 
neighbourhood of 2%, as underlying inflation is 
expected to remain moderate. 
Public finance 
Since record surpluses were registered in 2000 and 
2001 (6.1% and 6.5% of GDP respectively), the 
position of general government finance has 
continuously deteriorated. It posted a 1.2% of GDP 

deficit in 2004. This deficit 
probably deepened to 
about 2.3% of GDP in 
2005 despite strong GDP and employment growth. Beside the rapid increase in 

expenditure (+8.0% for current expenditure and 
+8.6% for total expenditure), the main factor behind 
this deterioration was a very large shortfall in VAT 
revenues. According to
 the latest estimates, these 
VAT revenues should be ab
out 540 millions euros 
(27% of total planned revenues and 2% of GDP) 
lower than projected in th
e 2005 budg
et. Clearly, the 
weakness in private consumption may have played a 

role in this shortfall but, according to the latest 
available information, it appears that the largest part is due to massive and unexpected
 VAT reimbursements.    
Since this VAT shortfall is not expected to repeat 
itself in 2006, the rise in rev
enues should significantly 
accelerate next year and the deficit should improve 
somewhat despite a continuously rapid rise in 

expenditure. However, at unchanged policy, the 
deficit should deteriorate again 
in 2007, despite the 
strong growth in GDP and employment, as the 

increase in expenditure is projected to remain faster 
than the rise in revenues.

Hungary - Government deficit and debt
Activity in 2005 
After a vigorous expansion in the second half of 2004, 
real GDP growth slowed do
wn to 2.9% year-on-year 
in the first quarter of 2005. This was the weakest 

growth rate since the th
ird quarter of
 2003, reflecting 
the weakening of export demand largely explained by 
the deterioration of the growth outlook for the main 

EU trading partners. In 
the second quarter of 2005 
GDP growth picked up agai
n and grew by 4.1% year-
on-year. The main driver behind GDP growth was the 

strong performance in gros
s fixed capital formation 
and net exports. Most of the increase in gross capital 
formation was realised in public infrastructure 

investment. Annual real GD
P growth in 2005 is 
expected to remain around 3.7%. 
The current account deficit is estimated to have 
remained close to 8% of GDP in 2005, increasingly 

financed by non-debt-creating 
inflows, mainly due to 
the larger share of EU funds in the capital account. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is projected to remain firm in the 
forecast period due to stable demand and export 
conditions. The composition 
of growth continues to 
be favourable, supported by dynamic investment 

activity, improving external demand conditions and 
moderate consumption growth. Private consumption 
growth is projected to increase 
slightly in 2006, to 
about 3.5%, fuelled by fiscal measures, notably the 
reduction of the highest VAT rate of 25% to 20%, and 
to stabilise around this rate in 2007. 
Export growth is expected to 
remain steady during the 
forecast period. Investments will continue to benefit 
from extensive highway co
nstructions in 2006 and 
2007. Military expenditure amounting to 0.5% of 
GDP will be reflected in increased imports in both 
2006 and 2007.  
Due to the fiscal expansion the current account deficit 
will decline only slightly. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment, still stagnating 
in the first half of 2005, 
is expected to rise by about 0.5% in 2006 and 
somewhat less in 2007
. Real wage growth will ease 
due to tighter labour mark
et conditions. After a sharp 
increase in the final quarter of 2004 and the first 
quarter of 2005, the unempl
oyment rate is projected to 
increase, partly due to the stagnating labour demand. 
The inflation trend remains 
favourable, backed by the 
slowdown of wage increases, the strong value of the 

forint and the intensifying 
competition following EU 
accession. Annual consumer price inflation is forecast 
to decelerate sharply to about 2% in 2006. This is 
supported by the cut in
 the VAT rate and benign 
inflation expectations. It is 
projected to return to about 
3% in 2007, with faster con
sumption growth and the 
rise in the minimum wage posing a possible upside 
risk.  Public finances 
Hungarian deficit figures have been characterised by 
their regular ex-post upward
 revision due to statistical 
reclassifications. Mainly as a result of the 
reclassification of 13th month public sector salary, the 

2004 deficit has recently been revised from 4.5% to 
5.4%
1 of GDP. Even taking into account the higher 
2004 base level, 
the 2005 deficit is expanding.  
In 2005, the original de
ficit target of 3.6% of GDP 
will be significantly missed for the fourth year in a 
row with an expect
ed outcome of above 6% of GDP, 
despite some corrective measu
res taken in the first 
half of the year. The main reason for this marked 
deviation is a recent statistical clarification regarding 
the planned sale of motorways worth almost 2% of 
GDP, which does not reduce the general government 
deficit as previously assumed by the Hungarian 

authorities. In addition, a 
significant rev
enue shortfall based on overly optimistic 
budget assumptions and an 
expenditure overrun due to the underestimation of

).open ceiling expenditures, lead
ing to an additional 
slippage of 0.5% of GDP was acknowledged by the 
Hungarian authorities, without deciding on corrective 

measures contrary to previous commitments.  
For 2006, the authorities have submitted a draft 
budget of 4.7% of GDP which does not include the 
appropriate recording of military aircraft delivery in 
2006. This is compared to
 a deficit target of 2.9% of 
GDP contained in the c
onvergence programme update 
of December 2004. In this forecast the 2006 deficit is 

projected to be even higher, reaching 6.7% of GDP. 
The draft 2006 budget lacks significant structural 
reforms targeting expe
nditure reduction, while it includes relevant tax cuts worth of about 1% of GDP, 
mainly on VAT2. No significant changes are projected 
for the macroeconomic environment in 2007. Due to 

the second step of the 
tax cut programme the deficit 
increases even further to 6.9% of GDP. The forecast 
assumes that the accounting of military fighters will 

increase the deficit by ½ percentage point of GDP in 
both 2006 and 2007, while new public–private 
motorway investment projects worth about 1% of 
GDP will reduce the general government deficit. The 

latter assumption is subject to risk. 
In the light of increasing 
yearly deficit levels, the

themselves of the possiblity of the temporary reclassification of 
second pillar pension funds inside the general government as 
permitted by Eurostat until the March 2007 notification, this 

forecast uses the official reclassified figures. This approach lowers 
the deficit figures by 1.2-1.4 pps between 2004 and 2007.

be included at some point into the general government budget 
should be noted.

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
Sluggish growth continued in the first quarter of 2005, 
but the acceleration of public investment brought 
about a rebound in the sec
ond quarter. GDP is now 
projected to grow slightly below 1% for the year as a 
whole. Private and public
 consumption are expected 
to remain negative, falling by 0.8% and 1.9%, 

respectively. The contraction of public consumption is 
the consequence of ongoin
g fiscal consolidation. 
Investment will remain the most dynamic component 

of domestic demand, projected
 to grow by around 
10%. The buoyant performan
ce of investment in the 
midst of stagnation in the rest of the Maltese economy 

is due to the implementati
on of infrastructure projects 
financed by EU Structural Funds and public works 
funded through th
e Italian Protocol, 
which consists of 
grants from the Italian government for major 
infrastructure projects. As in 
previous years, the high 
level of public investment 
reflects the building of the 
Mater Dei Hospital, which is now 
in its final stages. 
This specific growth com
position, which is 
particularly based on civil construction works, largely 
explains why high investment growth is unrelated to 
any other demand component. Overall, domestic 

demand is projected to cont
ribute 1.2 pps to growth. 
Exports are expected to drop by around 2½%. This 
contraction is partly explained 
by sluggish growth of 
Malta’s main trade partners, having a particularly 

significant impact on the stagnation of the tourism 
sector. In addition, low productivity growth, 
especially in the produc
tion of semiconductors, is weighing on exports of goods. Imports are also 
projected to contract, by around 2%, due to weak 
consumption and private investment, and to the low 
import-intensity of infrastructu
re investment. As a 
result, the contribution of
 the external sector to 
growth is estimated at -0
.3 of a percentage point. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is projected to
 slightly decelerate to 
0.7% in 2006 and, then, to accelerate to a still 
moderate rate of 1.1% in 
2007. A modest recovery is 
projected for both private and public consumption. 
Specifically, private consumption is expected to gain 
momentum and increase by 0.6% in 2006 and 0.9% in 

2007. This small recovery of private consumption can 
be explained by a slight rise 
in disposable income, in 
turn supported by a still-hig
h-job-content of growth 
over the forecast horizon. After a period of strong 
fiscal consolidation, public consumption growth is 
projected to increase by 1.1% in 2006 and by 1.3% in 

2007. While growing at 
lower rates than in 2005, 
investment growth should re
main strong. However, 
this deceleration reflects the finalization of a number 

of infrastructure projects in
 the next two years. 
Overall, the contribution of
 domestic demand to GDP 
growth should be around 1½ pps in both years. 
Exports are expected to rebound moderately in 2006 
and accelerate in 2007. This rebound should largely 
be supported by better prospects for the 

semiconductor and touris
m sectors. Imports are 
expected to be slightly more 
dynamic than exports, 
due to the recovery of consumption. Consequently, 

the negative contribution of the external sector would 
reach 0.7 pp in 2006 and 0.6 pp in 2007.  
The current account deficit 
is set to attain 6.8% of 
GDP in 2006, slightly higher th
an in 2005 (6.7%), and 
to worsen to 7% in 2007. Current account 
developments mirror those of the trade deficit, which 
should reach 17% of GDP at the end of the forecast 

period, while the traditional 
surplus in the services 
balance should remain 
fairly stable at around 8½% of 
GDP. This deficit is set to be
 only partially financed 
by roughly constant capital transfers from the EU in 
nominal terms. Accordingly, the net borrowing 
position of the country is proj
ected to widen from 4% 
in 2005 to around 6% of GDP in 2007. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Despite slow GDP growth, employment is projected 
to keep rising, largely owing to the ongoing labour-

projects. In parallel, the 
unemployment rate should marginally fall to 6.8% in 
2007. With sluggish growt
h, inflationary pressures 
come only from the energy prices increase: HICP 
inflation is projected to decline from 3.1% this year to 
2.6% in 2006 and 2.2% at the end of the forecast 

period. Unit labour costs are expected to grow by 
2.3% in 2006 (1.3% in 2005), reflecting oil prices 
increase, but should ease again to 1.3% in 2007, in 

line with more stable energy prices.  
Public finances 
After declining to 5.1% 
of GDP in 2004, the 2005 
deficit is expected to fall 
to 4.2% of GDP. Although 
Malta is implementing the measures planned in the 

2005 budget, in
cluding expenditure cuts and revenue 
enhancing measures, lower-than-expected GDP 
growth is an obstacle to the achievement of the deficit 

target set up in the Converg
ence Programme for 2005. 
Under a no-policy change scenario, the general 
government deficit is set to decrease to 3.0% of GDP 
in 2006 and to 2.5% of GDP in 2007. The projection 
for capital expenditures incorporates the fall 
associated with the finalization of
 the Italian protocol.  
The general government gross debt in 2005 is 
expected to remain at around 77% of GDP, slightly 
above its 2004 lev
el. This figure takes into account 
the effect of the privatization of the Malta 
International Airport, to be accomplished in 
November 2005. At unch
anged legislation, the debt-
to-GDP ratio is expected
 to rise slightly to around 
77½% of GDP in 2006, bu
t a growing primary 
balance should lead to 
slight decrease in 2007 (77%). 
These debt figures do no

effects of additional pri

The Netherlands - GDP growth and 
                      employment growth
Recent economic developments 
After a sharp and protracted
 slowdown from 2001 to 
2003 and a short-lived recovery in 2004, 2005 was 
another gloomy year for the Netherlands. In the first 

quarter of the year real GDP 
fell by 0.8% quarter-on-
quarter but it strongly recovered in the second quarter 
(+1.2% quarter-on-quarter) a
nd this recovery should 
continue in the second 
half of the year. Nevertheless, 
on average, real GDP growth
 in 2005 will probably 
not exceed ½%, down from 1.7% in 2004. 
Private consumption, which declined in 2003 and 
stagnated in 2004, is expected to decrease again this 
year, by about ¼%. The main reason was a further 
decline in households’ disposable income, by nearly 

1% in real terms, due to the continuing decline in 
employment, renewed wage moderation after the 
excessive wage increases of the late 1990s and early 

2000s, and a fall in 
non-labour income. Public consumption stagnated and public investment 
declined by about ¾%, reflecting the continuing effort 

to further reduce the government deficit. Gross fixed 
capital formation by corporations was nearly flat but 
investment in dwelling
s still increased by 3%. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the course of 
2005. It is projected to r
each about 2% in 2006 and 
about 2½% in 2007, essentially because domestic 

demand should be significantly more dynamic than in 
recent years. Developments in both private and public 
consumption next year are 
blurred by the reform of 
the health care system on 1 
January 2006, which will 
result in a shift from the 
former to the latter of about 
1.7% of GDP. This instituti
onal change is the main 
reason why private consumption is expected to 
decrease by about 3% in real terms and government 
consumption to rise by 
more than 9% next year. This 
shift apart, private consumption 
should rise by about 
½% in 2006 as households’ gross disposable income 
will broadly stabilise in real terms after several years 

of decline. In 2
007, private consumption is set to 
accelerate to around 2%: households’ disposable 
income should rise significantly, 
for the first time in 
years, essentially due to the recovery in employment; 
on the other hand, their sa
ving rate, which dropped 
considerably in recent years and thereby supported 

consumption, is expected to rise again.  
Government consumption should increase by nearly 
2% in volume (without th
e effects of the health care 
reform) in 2006 and by about 3% in 2007. While 

government investment should still stagnate next year, 
gross fixed capital formation by corporations is 
forecast to begin to recover, rising by about 6½% in 
2006, but this relatively high figure is inflated by 
some large projects in the transport sector. In 2007, 

both government and private investment are projected 
to speed up in line with the acceleration in growth. 
Exports of goods and services are forecast to 
accelerate to more than 5% in 2006, but to remain 

below the expansion of ex
port markets as the large 
loss in competitiveness 
recorded in recent years 
continues to take its toll. 
However, thanks to renewed 
wage moderation, unit labour costs should start 
declining again after a slight surge 
in 2005 and the 
gap between the growth in exports and the export 

market is expected to narrow markedly. Moreover, re-
exports, which now represent nearly half of Dutch 
exports of goods, are forecast to remain very dynamic. 

In 2007, export growth should accelerate to about 
6¾%, close to the rise in exports markets. In parallel, 
imports will accelerate too, pushed by the recovery in 

domestic demand and by buoyant re-exports. As a 
result, the contribution 
of foreign trade to GDP 
growth should be significantly more limited in 2006 
and even more so in 2007 than it has been in recent 
years.Labour markets, costs and prices 
Employment decreased for the fourth consecutive 
year, by about ½% in 2004. As a result,

unemployment continued to increase from 5.5% in 
2004 to about 6%. With the recovery in output, 
employment is also projected
 to improve, rising by 
about ½% in 2006
 and 1% in 2007. Unemployment 
should thus begin to d
ecline marginally in
 2006 and 
more markedly in 2007. 
After surging in the late 19
90s and early 2000s as a 
result of the overheating 
of the Dutch economy, 
inflation has considerably decelerated in recent years. 
The HICP rose by 1.4% in 2004. It should, however, 

accelerate this year to about 1.7%, mostly as a result 
of the surge in oil prices, since wage increases are 
very moderate. Inflation should accelerate to slightly 

above 2% in 2006, due to the remaining impact of oil 
prices, before sliding back somewhat in 2007.   
Public finances 
The general government deficit, which was brought 
back from 3.1% of GDP in 2003 to 2.1% of GDP in 

2004, continued 
to decline, to 1.8% of GDP in 2005. 
In order to support activity, and to improve 
competitiveness and households’ purchasing power, 
the 2006 budget pr
ovides for cuts in 
taxes as well as 
increases in spending for a total of half a percentage 
point of GDP. On the other ha
nd, the recent rise in oil 
prices will lead to an increase 
in the price of natural 
gas, which will result in 
additional revenues. As a 
result, the general governme
nt deficit should stabilise 
in 2006 at around the 
2005 level, despite the 
acceleration in GDP growth. However, in 2007, on 
the assumption of unchanged policy and with faster 
output and employment growth, the deficit should 

resume its decline and fall below 1½% of GDP.

Activity in 2005 
Economic growth slowed down from 0.4% quarter-
on-quarter in late 2004 to 0.1% in the first three 
months of 2005, accelerating again to 0.4% in the 

following period. Priva
te consumption had been 
expected to grow significantly 
due to the substantial 
cuts in personal income ta
xes introduced in early 
2005. However, this scenario did not materialise, as 
household demand remained subdued in the first two 
quarters of the year. Up to now, the effects of rising 

oil prices seem to be outweighing the impact of the 
expansionary fiscal policy.  
As expected, gross fixed cap
ital formation slumped in 
the first half of 2005, confirming that the fiscal 

investment premium, which had expired in 2004, had 
given rise to a good deal 
of planned investment being 
carried forward rather than 
creating additional 
spending. With such weak domestic demand, net 
export was again the main
 contributor to GDP growth. 
In the second half of the year, growth is supposed to 
be driven also by private consumption as the effects 
of rising oil prices ebb away and consumers realise 
the benefits of the tax reform. On an annual basis, real 

GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 1.7% in 
2005.   
Growth prospects fo
r 2006 and 2007 
Having slowed down signi
ficantly in 2005, GDP 
growth is expected to accelerate slightly in 2006 and 

again in 2007, narrowing the negative output gap over 
the forecast period.   
The growth in private consumption is expected to 
gradually accelerate in 2006 and 2007. However, it 
will still be moderate compared
 with historical levels. 
Investment in construction 
is projected to grow at a 
solid rate, supported by the government’s measures 
aimed at improving Austria’s infrastructure, 
undertaken mainly in order to address growing 

unemployment. Equipment i
nvestment, which is 
expected to slump in 2005 in the wake of the expiry 
of the fiscal investment 
premium, should grow at a 
solid rate in the near futu
re on the back of rising 
replacement demand and healthy profits. 
Export growth is expected to remain robust, but will 
not match the level of 2004, so that over the forecast 

horizon, there should be a 
shift from external to 
domestic demand forces as the main driver of growth.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment is expected to grow throughout the 
forecast period but will be outpaced by the increase in 

labour supply. The governm
ent’s special measures to 
combat unemployment are likely to rein in the rising 
trend in 2006, but they will not suffice to bring the 
record unemployment rate down
 from its peak. Due to 
the short-term nature of the measures, unemployment 

growth is bound to accelerate in 2007. 
Consumer price inflation is
 projected to stay above 
2% in 2005 and 2006. It 
should ease down toward the 
end of the forecast period as the effects of higher oil 

prices start disappearing. As wages are expected to 
develop in line with productivity, no inflationary 
pressures should arise from labour costs.  
Public finance 
The second stage of the 2004/2005 tax reform came 
into force in 2005
. The burden on 
the budget incurred 
by the reform this year is estimated at 0.8% of GDP, 
but tax revenue has so far turned out to be higher than 

expected, mainly owing to higher proceeds from 
VAT, corporate tax, capital 
gains tax and energy tax.  Also in 2005, the government announced two 
packages of special measures aimed at fighting 

unemployment. The May package, which 
concentrated mainly on ra
ising employment by 
renovating highways, bridges and railways, will be 
financed by the state-owned railway and motorway 
companies, and by the sale of assets. Therefore,

according to ESA 95 accounting rules, it will be 
neutral for government account
s in the short term. 
The package adopted in September, worth 

approximately 0.1% of GDP, consists mainly of 
measures aimed at combating youth unemployment 
and helping women re-enter the job market. The cost 

of the package will be borne by the 2005 and 2006 
budgets.   
The 2005 budget will also
 be burdened with 
additional expenditure 
on social transfers as the 
number of unemployed turns out to be significantly 
higher than foreseen by the government.  
However, the unexpectedly high tax revenue will 
more than compensate for 
the additional expenditure. 
Therefore, the deficit in 2005 should not surpass the 
1.9% of GDP planned by the government.  
2006 will see the peak of 
the revenue loss from 
previous tax reforms, estim
ated at 1.4% of GDP. In 
addition, the budget will have to 
bear a part of the cost 
of both the central government’s job market package 
and those of regional authorities. Therefore, the 
deficit in 2006 is projected 
at 1.8% of GDP, which is 
slightly higher than the government’s target in the 
November 2004 update of
 the stability programme.  
As the impact of the tax reforms wears off and GDP 
growth rises, the deficit ratio sh
ould go down by ½ 
percentage point in
 2007, which is 
still considerably 
higher than the stability programme target.  
The debt ratio is expected to decrease slightly over the 
forecast period, but it will nevertheless remain above 

the 60% of GDP reference value.

Activity in 2005 
Economic activity in the first 
half of 2005 did not 
fully recover from the slowd
own in late 2004. Real 
GDP growth in the second quarter of this year was 

2.8% year-on-year, up from 2.1% in the first quarter. 
After a surprising drop to 
1% year-on-year in the first 
quarter, investment growth rebounded in the second 

quarter (3.8% year-on-year). Polish companies seem 
to have postponed their in
vestment decisions pending 
the results of the parliamentary and presidential 

elections. Moreover, there appears to be a lack of 
capacity to absorb EU funds. Domestic demand fell 
by 0.3% year-on-year in the second quarter for the 

first time since the first quarter of 2002, as large-scale 
de-stocking cancelled out the modest growth of 
consumption and investme
nt. Overall, economic 
growth in the first half of
 2005 was mainly driven by 
net exports, as was the case in the past two years. Net 
exports contributed to GDP growth by 2 percentage 

points, while the contribution to growth of domestic 
demand almost halved from 
the first quarter to the 
second. The contribution of inventories to GDP has 
been on a downward trend 
since the beginning of 
2004 and reached -2.2 percentage points in the second 

quarter. Large de-stocking indicates that enterprises 
have adjusted their inventory levels to weaker 
demand.  
Short-term indicators do not
 show any sign of 
recovery, inter alia reflecting the uncertainty of the 
pre-election period. Higher gr
owth is expected in the 
last quarter of the year as more EU funds are 
transferred to enterprises 
and political uncertainties 
dissipate. In 2005 as a whole, real GDP growth is 
projected to slow down 
to 3½%, down from 5.3% in 
2004. Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Domestic demand is expected to take over from net 
exports as the main driving force of GDP growth in 
2006 and 2007. Both investment and private 

consumption growth are likel
y to pick up over the 
projection period. After 
the parliamentary and 
presidential elections and the formation of a new 

government in the autumn, the period of political and 
economic uncertainty will pr
obably end, making 
companies more in
clined to invest. Furthermore, 
companies are starting to face capacity constraints, 
while corporate profitability is strong and interest 
rates are at a record-low level. Private consumption is 

expected to increase as a result of the indexation of 
pensions, direct paym
ents to farmers and moderate 
real wage growth. The 
administrative difficulties 
encountered in d
ealing with EU funds have so far 
limited Poland’s absorp
tion capacity, but the situation 
is likely to improve si
gnificantly in the coming 
months. Therefore, in 2006 and 2007, EU funds (up to 
1.2% and 1.5% of GDP, respectively) will boost 

domestic demand and increase imports, which will 
translate into a negative contribution of net exports to 
GDP growth, despite the good performance by Polish 

exporters.  Exports started to grow again in the second quarter of 
2005 after two quarters of decline, suggesting that 
82Chapter 3 Member States, Poland despite the considerable 
appreciation of the zloty 
since May 2004 and the econ
omic slowdown in the 
EU, Polish exporters are again gaining market shares, 

mainly in the countries on
 its eastern border (Russia 
and Ukraine). The current account deficit is expected 
to narrow to 3.2% in 2005
. Growing imports in line 
with strengthening domestic
 demand will lead to a 
steady increase in the trade and current account 
deficits this year and next. However, higher transfers 

from the EU will have a positiv
e impact on both the 
current and capital accounts. In total, the current 
account deficit is projected to widen to 3.5% of GDP 

in 2006 and 3.9% in 2007, and will thus remain 
within sustainable bounds.  Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market conditions have
 been improving since 
the second quarter of 
2004. Overall, employment 
started to grow in
 2004 and is expected to stay on an 
upward trend over the forecast horizon, but the rate of 
employment still remains the lowest in the EU. As 

economic activity gains momentum again the foreseen 
employment growth should 
translate into a decline in 
the unemployment rate by 
more than 2 percentage 
points over 2005-07. This decline can be also partially 
explained by a falling particip
ation rate, reflecting the 
extension of early retirem
ent rights and a rapid growth 
of the number of students.
 However, unemployment 
will still be relatively high, at 16.5% of the labour 

force, by the end of the forec
ast horizon, reflecting the 
deep-seated structural probl
ems in the labour market. 
Poland’s unemployment has a large structural 

component, and labour market difficulties are 
exacerbated by unfavourable demographic 
developments and the ongoing restructuring process 

in heavy industries and agriculture. Nevertheless, the 
fall in unemployment since 2004 has been quite 
significant compared to recent years, which bodes 

well for the near future. 
After a sharp increase in 
2004, annual HICP inflation 
decreased to a record low of 1.4% in mid-2005 from 
3.6% on average in 2004. 
The one-off effects of EU 
accession on prices faded out in the first half of 2005, 
but the unfavourable developments in oil and energy 

prices are expected to push consumer price inflation 
up to 2¼% in 2005. A sli
ghtly negative output gap, 
which is not likely to close over the forecast horizon, 

and low inflationary expectations are expected to keep 
inflation in 2006 and 2007 below the central bank’s 
medium-term target of 2.5%
, despite moderate growth 
of wages and unit labour costs.  
Unit labour costs are projected to expand by 1.7% in 
2005, owing to a drop in productivity growth 

combined with modest compensation growth. In 2006 
and 2007, unit labour cost growth is expected to ease 
to 1¼% as productivity 
growth recovers somewhat 
and compensation growth
 remains subdued. Although 
nominal wages are expected to increase in order to at 
least sustain growth in real earnings, high 

unemployment should exert 
a moderating influence 
on wage growth. 
Public finances  
Since the 2005 spring
 forecast, the picture of public 
finances has changed signi
ficantly in view of 
substantial data revisions following methodological 
changes. The most noticeable change concerns the 
2004 general government deficit which was revised 

down to 3.9% of GDP from an earlier estimate of 
4.8%. This significant reduction is mainly due to 
revisions to the method of calculation of accrued taxes 
and social contributions as well as revisions to the 
accounts payable. The general government deficit is expected to reach 
3.6% of GDP in 2005, in
 line with the target set in the 
December Convergence Programme (3.9%). 
However, there remains considerable uncertainty as 

regards the implementation of the 2005 budget. 
Higher revenues due to extr
a dividend contributions 
from state-owned enterprises, together with lower 

expenditure for debt servicing 
may not be sufficient to 
outweigh the effects of lower-than-expected GDP 
growth. Also an inflation rate below initial 

expectations and the non-implementation of an 
important part of the g
overnment’s multi-annual plan 
for fiscal consolidation (Hausner plan) are weighing 

on the deficit.  
Assuming that the new government does not 
significantly modify the draft budget, the general 
government deficit is expe
cted to stabilise in 2006 
despite an expected increase in revenues. In 
particular, the measures recently adopted by 
Parliament – early retirement entitlements for miners, 
the reimbursement of VAT increase for building 
materials and the indexation of pensions in 2006 – 

will weigh negatively on the 2006 budget. Under the 
no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is forecast to

% of GDP
Activity in 2005 
Imbalances continue to pe
rsist in Portugal. Having 
recovered from recession in 2004, GDP is expected to 
grow by a modest 
% in 2005. 
Activity was relatively lively up
 to mid-2005, driven 
by private consumption. Yet the recent expansion 
seems to have been largely the result of purchases 
carried forward against the announced VAT hike in 

July. According to recent indicators, the momentum 
of household spending is now abating. Investment 
continues to suffer from a shrinking construction 

sector and lacklustre business prospects.  
Exports are hampered by 
a weak competitive position, 
although the external sector’s contribution to GDP 
growth was less negative than in 2004, owing to 

decelerating imports. Nevertheless, the jump in oil 
prices has further exacerbated the imbalance in 
Portugal’s net external position, which is forecast to 
climb to a negative gap close to 8% of GDP by the 
end of 2005, with the deterior
ation in the income and 
capital balances also playing a role.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
Domestic demand is forecast to slow down over the 
forecast period. The cooling of private consumption is 
assumed to be stronger in 2006 with a re-assessment 

of income expectations by private households and a 
weaker labour market outlook. Investment is expected 
to recover in 2007 reflecting already more 
encouraging business prospects and a slowly 
improving construction secto
r. In addition, in 2006, 
both consumption and investment rates will be 
dampened by a negative carry-over from the second 
half of 2005. Public consump
tion will be held back by 
a tightening of general government expenditure.  
The contribution of the external sector to growth is 
projected to increase. Exports are expected to 
accelerate helped by less adverse cost developments 

in manufacturing and by a b
oost in car exports, yet 
foreign market shares will d
ecline further. In fact, 
export performance is hampered by a relatively 

subdued demand and by increased competition from 
emerging economies. Sluggish domestic demand is 
forecast to hold import growth down. 
In all, the projected dema
nd pattern will yield GDP 
growth below 1% in 2006 and close to 1¼% in 2007, 
with the net external borrowing remaining high. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment is projected to remain on an upward 
trend until 2007. Job cuts 
have been particularly 
marked in manufacturing, wh
ich should hold down 
unit labour costs and he
lp boost co
mpetitiveness. 
Inflation abated until mid-2005
, but the July increase 
in the normal VAT rate from 
19 to 21% is rekindling 
inflation. However, the hike 
has not been fully passed 
on to prices. In 2006, the 
carry-over of the VAT 
increase will be felt and some 
excise taxes will go up, 
but the large negative output gap should limit the 
scope for price increases. In 2007, the fading impact 
of the VAT hike on the annual rate of price increase 
and more stable import prices may pave the way for a 
deceleration of inflation. 
Public finances 
The 2005 general
 government deficit is projected to 
reach almost 6% of GDP after a deficit of 3% of GDP 
in 2004. This jump is largely due to the government’s 
decision to no longer impl
ement one-off measures. 
In 2005, both current revenue and expenditure have 
increased as a share of GDP. Tax revenues have been 
growing in excess of what th
e relevant tax base would 
indicate, which suggests a fur
ther improvement in tax 
collection, as already observed 
in 2004. In addition, 
the VAT increase in July is a
dding to tax revenues. 
Overall, the tax burd
en is expected to jump by nearly 
1 percentage point. Strong upward pressure on 
expenditure has persisted. Old-age pension spending

grows strongly with a gro
wing number of retirees and 
higher per capita benefits. Public consumption has 
been increasing due to wage increases above the 

2003-04 average and rising health expenditure. 
This forecast already includes a sizeable corrective 
package adopted in mi
d-2005. Measures on the 
revenue side comprise the increase in VAT, tax 
increases for petrol and tobacco and a curb on tax 
benefits. Regarding expe
nditure, efforts are being 
targeted at the reform of 
pension schemes and public 
administration, including career and wages scales. In 
the meantime, there will be a freeze on promotions in 
the public sector until the end of 2006
1.A marked improvement of the government balance is 
projected on account of the corrective measures. 
However, there are some risks that may bound its 
success. First, economic conditions may be adverse 

with subdued domestic demand jeopardizing a 
stronger expansion of tax revenues. Second, some 
expenditure-curbing measures may yield limited 
short-term savings. Additionally, interest expenditure 
will increase with rising debt and interest rates.  
In 2006, the general 
government deficit is forecast at 
close to 5% of GDP. Based on the no-policy-change 
assumption, the deficit will marginally improve in 
2007. The trend in the pri
mary deficit should be 
somewhat better. On the back of high deficits and low 
GDP growth, the government debt ratio will remain 
on an upward path. 
                                                          
1Since some measures have not 
been announced in
 sufficient detail 
for them to be properly assessed, they are not included in the 
current forecast, e.g., private sector pension reform and the 

government’s new career and 
wage scales. According to the 
Portuguese authorities, these measures are still in preparation. 
Everything else being equal, this may imply a difference between 
this and other forecasts or policy targets.

Activity in 2005 
In 2004, economic growt
h was lower than initially 
estimated; real GDP grew by 4.2% (instead of 4.6%)
1.The stimulus was mainly 
internal. The considerable build-up of inventories took place before EU 
accession as imports surged in anticipation of changes 
in trade regimes with some
 countries of the former 
Yugoslavia. At the same tim
e, exports rallied, which helped to narrow the negative contribution of foreign 
demand to GDP growth.  
Despite the bleak circumstan
ces in the international 
environment this year, GDP growth is likely to 
decelerate only slightly, to 3.8%. After relatively 
weak activity in the first 
quarter, the economy 
boomed in the second quarter. It seems, however, that 
this was mainly due to (temporary) effects in foreign 
trade linked to the substantial increase in exports of 
cars to France and Austria. Contrary to expectations, 
export performance was not seriously affected by the 
slowdown in the main 
European trading
 partners and 
remained remarkably resilient in the face of oil price 
increases. High commodity price 
levels, on the other 
hand, impinged on imports, and producers reacted by 
limiting their investment 
activity. As also de-stocking 
occurred capital formation plunged whereas 

household consumption strengthened with a sustained 
rise in employment, a marked increase of real wages 
and advantageous borrowing 
conditions (as of 2004, 
domestic banks are also allowed to offer loans in 
foreign currency to i
ndividuals). This year, the 
economy will continue to be driven by domestic 

demand while the external 
contribution turns positive. Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
In 2006, real GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 
4%. Investment expenditure is 
expected to pick up as 
production processes are adjusted in order to improve 
the competitiveness of Slovene industry, and 
investment spending related to construction activity 
should also stay high, as evidenced by strong growth 

in the number of constru
ction permits issued. Private 
spending, particularly the purchase of durable goods, 
is likely to remain buoyant. Domestic demand should 

fuel the economy while foreign demand is also 
expected to contribute 
positively to GDP growth 
against the projections of healthy export growth to 

continue.  
With export markets recovering as oil prices decrease, 
and expectations linked to the adoption of the euro 
that spur domestic consumption, GDP growth is 

projected to accelerate further to 4.2% in 2007. As 
imports are set to rise stead
ily in step with strong 
private and investment spending, the negative current 

account is likely to deteriorate further. According to 
the revised balance-of-payments statistics, which 
revealed a much bigger deficit for 2004, the current 
account is expected to linger around -2% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices   
In 2005, the situation on the labour market improved 
with a marked rise in employment and a sustained fall 

in unemployment, togethe
r with a considerable 
increase of gross wages compared to the year before. 
Admittedly, this is estima
ted to result from the 
methodological adjustment 
in the calculation of the 
average wage to include enterprises with 1-2 
employees. Furthermore, it also reflects the effect of 

the new tax regime, which ended favourable treatment 
for freelance fees and thus encouraged employers to 
pay salaries instead. Wage increases in 2005 are, 

therefore, likely to depart from the arrangement 
whereby wage rise should lag behind productivity 
growth by more than one percentage point. Although 

the wage negotiations for 2006-2007 are still ongoing, 
the immediate outlook for the labour market remains 
relatively positive as the unemployment rate is 
projected to drop below 6%, 
in step with 
the robust 
GDP growth. 
In 2005, against the ba
ckground of oil price 
fluctuations, consumer price
 inflation has become 
volatile but continued 
to decline on average. In

October, the 12-month moving average inflation rate 
stood at 2.7%. Regular adjust
ments of excise duties to 
temper the adverse effects of high 
oil prices helped in 
keeping the disinflation path smooth. Furthermore, the 
government has regulated ad
ministered price rises in 
such a way as not to 
exert inflationary pressures, 
while market prices have clearly been driven down by 
increased competition following EU entry. Moreover, 
inflation has been falling again
st the stab
le exchange rate ever since Slovenia joined ERM II.  
Assuming the continuation of policy measures geared 
toward further disinflation, consumer prices will rise 
only slowly. The commitment 
to adopt the euro in 
January 2007 restricts the authorities’ room for 
manoeuvre in setting prices while oil prices are 
considered a risk factor. 
Public finances 
After revision of the general
 government deficits for 
2000-2004 to include the two extra-budgetary funds, 
further alignment with th
e Eurostat rules has caused 
an additional substantial up
ward revision of the 2001 
and 2003 deficit. In 2005, 
however, 
the general 
government deficit is set to decline to 1.7% of GDP as 

the shortfall of the new direct tax regime will be 
smaller than expected. 
Given the uncertainties 
surrounding the future amendments to the tax 

legislation, the forecast for 2006 projects the deficit to 
increase again against the decision to index pensions 
to wages and the commitment of the new government 

to gradually abolish the payroll tax.

Graph 3.27: 
Slovakia - GDP growth and contributors
Activity in 2005 
Thus far, the available data suggest that economic 
growth in 2005 remains 
strong at slightly above 5% 
and continues to be driven by domestic demand, 

particularly by investment
 and private consumption. 
Robust employment 
and real wage growth are 
expected to lift private consumption growth above 5% 
in 2005. Gross fix
ed capital formation is estimated to 
grow by more than 8% supported by the realisation of 
some big investment projects as well as by an increase 
in public infrastructure i
nvestment. The contribution 
of net exports should remain in negative territory 
against the backdrop of lower
 growth of both exports 
and imports which can
 be partly attributed to 
interruptions in production caused by switches to new 
product lines in the 
car manufacturing industry. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The economic expansion is anticipated to accelerate 
to around 5½% in 2006 and to above 6% in 2007. 

Domestic demand is likely to remain the driving force 
while export growth should speed up in 2006 as new 
export capacity will gradually come on stream and the 
external contribution should thus become positive 
again.Strong household credit 
growth is also likely to 
continue to support private consumption growth 
which should remain above 4% over the forecast 
horizon. Gross fixed capital 
formation is predicted to 
further accelerate in 2006 as already pledged green-
field investments are realised
 while the government, 
supported by EU funds, co
ntinues to invest in large 
infrastructure projects. The investment boom should 
then decelerate in 2007, under the assumption of no 
new major foreign direct investments. As the 

increases of exports induced by the new production 
capacities are initially accompanied by imports of 
investment goods fo
r these facilities, the external 
contribution will probab
ly not increase significantly 
until 2007. The current account deficit is expected to widen 
further to above 6% of GDP in 2005 as sharply 

increasing repatriated profits add to the negative trade 
balance. Accelerating exports should lead to a 
measured improvement in the current account balance 

in 2006 and 2007.   
Labour market, costs and prices 
In the second quarter of 2005 total employment 
(labour force sample survey) increased by more than 
2% (y-o-y) and it has now b
een growing for a year. A 
similarly positive trend 
is expected to continue 
throughout the whole year leading to employment 
growth for 2005 at around 1¾% while the 
unemployment rate should decrease to below 17%. 
Similar, though slower, trends 
are also anticipated in 
2006 and 2007.   Although the yea
r-on-year consumer price inflation 
rate fell to 2% in August 2
005 and averaged 2½% 
over the first 8 months of 2005, the adjustments in 

administered prices and indirect taxes are estimated to 
drive it up to about 4% towards the end of the year. 
As these one-off effects fade out, inflation should fall 

back to 2% in 2007 if 
the second-round 
effects and, in particular, nominal wage growth are kept in check. 
Public finances 
After the tax reforms were put in place in 2004, a 
pension reform was launched in 2005. This reform 

affects social contributions by
 redirecting 9 percent of 
gross wages to a funded
 (second) pension pillar. Due 
to a large public interest, rev
enue transfers to the 
second pension pillar are an
ticipated at about ¾%, 
1¼% and 1½% of GDP in 2005, 2006 and 2007 
respectively.From autumn 2005 until 
the end of the transition 
period granted by Eurostat in spring 2007, the 
Commission services’ forecasts will present the general government deficit net of the pension reform

The general government deficit for 2005, net of the 
pension reform cost and ne
t of the cancellation of 
some developing countries’ debt amounting to about 
0.8% of GDP, is anticipated at around 3¼% of GDP 
which is slightly lower than 
foreseen in the 2005 
budget. This positive development is, however, 
mainly driven by a lo
wer-than-expected 
interest cost 
of public debt. The prim
ary deficit is estimated to be 
larger than originally planned
 as some of the financial 
resources that were freed are being used to cover 
other unplanned pub
lic expenditures.  
The general government deficit net of the pension 
reform cost is for 2006 estimated at some 3% of GDP. 
Increases in public expenditure in the election year are 
anticipated to largely offset a favourable growth 

performance as well as the 
positive trend in the 
servicing costs of public debt preventing a more 
significant fi
scal consolidation. In order to ensure 
sufficient public revenues 
the government adopted a 
number of measures, the most significant being the 

restriction of child tax allowances and increases in 
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol as well as in some 
administration fees. 
Under the customary no policy change assumption the 
budget deficit net of the pension reform cost will in 
2007 fall to about 
2½% of GDP as a result of 
accelerating growth. 
Gross public debt is estimate
d to decrease sharply to 
around 36¾% of GDP in 2005 as a part of the 
privatisation revenues from previous years has been 
used to pay-off some of th
e country’s de
bts. In 2006 
and 2007, government de
bt is projected to slightly 
increase but should remain below 40% of GDP.

Graph 3.28:
Finland - Industrial production and exports
Activity in 2005  
Following a rate of 3.6% 
in 2004, real GDP growth 
slowed down to about 1% year-on-year in the first 
half of 2005. Output edged down in the first quarter 

by 0.1% from the previous pe
riod, owing mainly to a 
decline in gross fixed capital formation and sluggish 
industrial production. In the second quarter, GDP 
contracted by a further 1.6% from the previous 
quarter as the seven-week-long paper and pulp 
industry lockout that ended
 in late June weighed 
heavily on growth.  The lo
ckout is estimated to shave 
roughly 1 percentage point off GDP growth for 2005. 
This includes the direct and indirect effects on other 

parts of the economy, e.g. 
transport, forest
ry logging 
and the chemical industry. 
Domestic demand was the driver of growth in the first 
part of 2005, while the 
contribution from net exports 
was more subdued than expected. Household 
consumption was fuelled by 
higher earnings, a pick-
up in employment and low 
interest rates.  The upward 
trend in total investment 
since summer 2003 was 
reversed in the first part of 2005, with investment 
down by around 2% from 2004. Residential 
construction edged down slightly, while equipment 
and machinery investment shrank markedly, by over 

8%. In the first half of 
2005, exports were surprisingly strong despite the paper industry labour conflict. However, part of the foreig
n trade was in transit 
exports, such as automobiles and telecommunications 
products, which were import
ed to Finland, then 
exported mainly to Russi
a. Consequently, import 
growth was robust in the first part of 2005. The 
weakening in the terms of trade continued as export 
prices fell somewhat, while import prices increased 
further.   
Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
The economy is projected to return to and remain on a 
firm growth path throughout the forecast period. 

Survey indicators suggest that
 activity will pick up in 
the latter part of 2005, 
as industrial production and 
exports are strengthening wh
ile domestic demand 
remains solid. The paper indust
ry labour dispute is 
deemed to have had only short-term temporary effects 
on the economy. Therefore, real GDP growth should 

rebound to close to 3½% in 
2006, partly boosted by 
the base effect, and then abate to its potential growth 
rate of 2½%-3% in 2007.  
Private consumption is expected to continue to give 
firm support to activity, 
underpinned by income tax 
cuts and healthy job creation. 
Public consumption is 
foreseen to increase modestly, 
given the efforts of the central government to cont
rol expenditure. Investment 
is projected to bounce back after a surprisingly weak 
performance in 2005 and provide a solid stimulus to 
growth in 2006-2007. Net ex
ports should increasingly 
contribute to growth. Exports are anticipated to 

rebound and gain further momentum due to strong 
import demand from Russia. The electronics industry 
has remained competitive and the prospects for 

exports of telecommunications equipment appear 
rather promising. Imports ar
e expected to grow at a 
firm pace on the back of lively domestic demand.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Despite the slowdown of activity, employment has 
increased further this year, by over 1¼% year-on-year 
up to September. As labour supply has expanded less 
than employment, the unem
ployment rate fell to 8.3% 
in September.  
Recently, higher energy prices have exerted upward 
pressures on HICP inflation, while tightening 
competition in services, especially in 

telecommunications, has kept price increases in 
check.   During the forecast period, inflation is 
expected to stay at around 1½%.  
The centralised wage agreemen
t, settled in late 2004, 
provides for moderate wage increases up to 
September 2007. Assuming the usual positive wage 

drift of about 1 percentage 
point, per capita wages are 
expected to increase on average by 3.0% in 2006-

2007. However, higher grow
th in productivity appears 
likely to limit the rise in 
unit labour costs to around 
1% over the forecast period.  
Public finances  
On the basis of the government’s medium-term 
spending guidelines of spring 2005 and the budget 
proposal for 2006, the genera
l government surplus is 
projected to fall slightly from over 2% of GDP in 

2004 to 1¾% by 2007. The general government 
surplus will rest solely on 
the surplus of social 
security. Central government finances are expected to 

be roughly in balance in 2005
 and then slip into 
deficit since the government has supplemented the 
collective wage agreement by sizeable income tax 

cuts of about 1% of GDP. 
Local government finances 
will stay in deficit due to higher operating 
expenditure, even with tax revenues projected to rise.  
The government debt ratio is projected to steadily 
decline to below 41% of GDP by the end of the 
forecast period. 9224. Sweden Continued recovery after blip-1012

Forecast
Activity in 2005 
The slowdown in growth that took place towards the 
end of 2004 continued in the first quarter of 2005. 
This slowdown affected exports and domestic 

consumption in particular 
while investments 
continued to expand strongly. However, national 
account figures for the second quarter indicate a 

recovery, mainly led by 
stronger private consumption 
and a recovery in exports. Overall, GDP growth was 
up around 2% on the year 
in the first half of 2005.  
Recent indicators are generally positive. Consumer 
confidence has continued to show an increasingly 
positive picture both as reg
ards household views on 
the economy as a whole and on their own economic 

situation. Industrial confidence has, however, fallen 
back somewhat to around its long-term average while 
there is more optimism in
 services, retail trade and in 
particular construction.   
These prospects are expected to be confirmed in a 
steady continuation of th
e recovery in the remainder 
of 2005, with GDP grow
th of around 2½% led by 
domestic demand.  
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
In 2006, economic growth is expected to be around 
3% with domestic demand driving growth while in 

2007 the economy is expected to grow somewhat less 
but close to the potential growth rate  
A resumption of employment growth will contribute 
positively to household disposable income in 2006 

and 2007, enabling continued st
eady growth in private 
consumption. While households have taken on more 
debt, financial wealth has bene
fited from rising equity 
and house prices, contributing to the maintenance of a 

relatively strong wealth po
sition. A modest reduction 
of the saving rate is expected over the forecast period. 
Public consumption is expected to increase, reflecting 
more stable local gove
rnment finances and a 
relatively expansionary 
2006 central government 
budget. In investme
nt, the conditions for a continued expansion, albeit at a decelerating pace, remain in 

place: a benign demand outlook, favourable financing 
conditions and a high capacity utilisation rate in 
manufacturing. A high rate of 
investment is therefore 
expected over the forecast period. Exports are 
expected to continue to grow
 relatively strongly both 
in 2006 and 2007, in 
line with world markets. Imports 
should also grow faster as fi
nal demand strengthens. 
Overall, net exports will only make a substantial 
contribution to growth 
again in 2007.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment growth, after having been negative in 
2004, is expected to turn po
sitive in 2005 and remain 
so over the forecast period. The relatively strong rise 

in economic activity foreseen
 over the 2005-2007 
period is expected to result in
 an improvement in the 
labour market given that the very high labour 

productivity growth seen over the last few years will 
moderate. Against this background and supported by a 
significant increase in the volume of active labour 

market measures in 2006, 
the unemployment rate will 
decrease over the period. It should be noted that a 
methodological change in the measurement of 

unemployment increases the le
vel by around 0.4%-

Inflation has continued to 
fall considerably, 
in spite of 
the significant recent rises in oil prices. The subdued 

outlook for inflation has en
abled the Riksbank to 
continue reducing interest rate
s, with a further cut in 
the repo rate of 50 basis points in June 2005. 
The relatively weak developm
ents in the labour 
market have helped to contain wage demands and 
wages are expected to continue to rise relatively 
moderately, reflecting the current wage agreement for 
private sector and central government, reached in the 
spring of 2004 and covering
 a period including 2006. 
Recent wage agreements for local government 
employees have resulted in slightly lower negotiated

).wage rises than in the previous agreement. Against 
this background, inflationary pressures continue to be 
subdued. As demand and growth revive further in 

2006 and 2007, 
inflation is expected
 to rise towards 
2% during the 
course of 2007.  
Public finances 
In 2005, the surp
lus in public finan
ces is expected to 
be around 1½% of GDP, 
similar to 2004. In both 
years, the budget has benefited from large one-off 
corporate tax receipts amounting roughly to a 
cumulative 1% of GDP.   
Sweden will continue to 
show budget surpluses over 
the forecast period. Income tax cuts proposed in the 
2006 Budget Bill, th
e last step of a phased income tax 
reform, as well as additional labour market measures, 

will contribute to an e
xpansionary fiscal policy stance 
that will reduce the surplus ratio in the government 
finances in 2006 as compared to 2005. On current 

policies, a slight rise in the bu
dget surplus is projected 
in 2007, as a result also of 
an improvement in the 
labour market. It should 
be noted that Swedish 
government accounts will include second pillar 

pension funds (contributing to improve the budget 
balance by about 1% of GDP per year) until spring 
2007.  General government gross debt, mainly central 
government liabilities, is pr
ojected to rise as central 
government is expected to remain in deficit over the 
forecast period. The increase is nevertheless slower 

than nominal GDP over the forecast period, resulting 
in a fall in the debt ratio 
to close to 48% of GDP in 
2007. 9425. United Kingdom

Forecast
The economy in 2005 
UK GDP growth has slowed markedly since the 
second half of 2004 and into 2005.  Growth was 1.5% 
year-on-year in th
e second quarter of 2005, down 
from 1.7% in the first quart
er.  By comparison, year-
on-year growth in the sec
ond quarter of 2004 was 
3.7%. The slowdown in the first half of 2005 has been 

reflected by lower growth in the service sector than in 
previous quarters, while manufacturing output 
actually shrank over the period.  
For 2005 as a whole, GDP gr
owth is now projected at 
just above 1½%, compared to 3.2% in 2004. Faltering 
domestic demand is chiefly responsible for the sharp 
slowdown, in the second quarter of 2005 growing by 

only 1.3% over the previous year, down from 3.7% 
for the whole of 2004. Household consumption 
appears to have been hit by
 a cooler housing market 
and the impact of higher interest rates on highly-
leveraged household balance sheets, and is expected 
to remain subdued for the rest of the year.  
Total investment has also slowed compared to 2004. 
Although government investment has grown rapidly, 
in line with budgetary plans, business investment has 

not responded to favou
rable conditions (high profitability, robust equity markets and low real 
interest rates).  Investment is 
expected to remain 
subdued throughout 2005. 
Net trade evolved erratically in
 the first two quarters 
of 2005. Overall, however, data for the first half of 
2005 show slower growth of imports compared to 

exports, consistent with the observed slowdown in 
domestic demand. For the year as a whole, net trade is 
expected to be neutral in terms of contribution to GDP 
growth, after the large negativ
e contribution in 2004. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
GDP growth is expected to pick up over the forecast 
period, rising to just 
above 2¼% in 20
06 and around 
2¾% in 2007, mainly th
anks to expanding domestic 
demand driven principally by government 

consumption, investment and to a lesser extent private 
consumption.    
Household consumption is ex
pected to start to pick up 
a little in 2006, and th
en settle at a moderate but 
significant rate of growth
 by 2007. The private 
consumption pick-up is support
ed by a labour market 
expected to remain relatively firm. A projected 

increase in the saving rate from 
the very low levels in 
2004 points to some balance sheet consolidation in the 
household sector.  
Business investment 
is restrained by uncertainties 
over the overall macroeconomic outlook, 
compounded by high oil prices. Against that 
background, business will prob
ably hold back on 
expanding capacity in the short term.  Nonetheless, 
business investment is expected
 to pick up in 2006 
and 2007, eventually reacting to the favourable 
conditions and high levels of profitability projected to 
continue throughout the forecast period. 
Growth in government consumption and investment is 
expected to play an impor
tant role in supporting 
domestic demand during the economic slowdown. 
95Economic Forecasts, Autumn 2005 United Kingdom 
Government gross fixed capital formation should 
grow strongly in 2005 
and 2006, consistent with government plans to increase investment in public 

services. Beyond that, gover
nment investment growth 
is planned to slow significantly in 2007.  
On the external side, the estimates project a smaller 
decline of the UK’s share of world trade than in the 

recent past. Net trade contributes positively albeit 
modestly to growth.  
In sum, the forecast shows the economy becoming 
slightly more balanced, with domestic demand 

playing a lesser role in drivi
ng growth and net exports 
becoming slightly positive for growth.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Higher oil prices have heightened inflationary 
pressures through higher fuel pump prices and 

through the indirect effect on the cost of producing 
goods and services that use oil as an input.  Moreover, 
demand pressure on capacity is feeding through to 

prices, including demand pressure in the rest of the 
world which has helped push up import prices.  
Persistently high oil prices are 
expected to result in 
HICP1 inflation in 2005 exceeding the Bank of 
England’s 2% target. However, given the credibility 
of the monetary policy framework, inflationary 

expectations are expected to 
remain anchored around 
the target and HICP inflation to
 decline towards the 
2% mark over the forecast period. 
The labour market continues 
to perform well.  The 
unemployment rate remains around a historical low, 
yet with earnings growth st
able. Temporarily higher 
inflation is not expected to 
feed through 
into higher 
earnings growth, which is projected to remain 
consistent with achievemen
t over time of the official 
inflation target. Moderate wage growth matches a 

slight weakening of the labour markets in 2006, in 
line with the slowdown of the economy.  
Employment growth is expected to moderate, partly in 
response to lower growth 
and partly because of the 
already high UK employment
 rates.  As the lagged 
impact of slower growth is felt in the labour market, 
unemployment is projected 
to rise slightly in 2006,

Public finances 
According to data released in August, the general 
government deficit reached 3.2% of GDP in the 

2004/05 financial year
2 (running from April to 
March). Given the mo
re subdued short-term 
prospects, the deficit is expected to widen to just 

below 3½% of GDP in 2005/06. The table below 
details the projections for general government deficit 
and debt on a fi
nancial year basis.

is produced on the basis of the last quarter of 
2007
Growth of revenues from i
ndirect taxes is subdued in 
2005, reflecting the drop in output and consumption. 

This is partly offset by the positive impact of higher 
oil prices on offshore corporation tax revenues. 
Recent changes to the timing of offshore corporation 

tax receipts mean that most of the favourable impact 
is expected to accrue in the last two quarters of 
2005/06. This should boost overall corporation tax 

receipts, which were already buoyant in the first half 
of 2005.  The projections assume primary non-cyclical 
expenditure in line with government plans throughout 

the forecast period, although outturn data for the first 
two quarters of 2005/06 po
int to the potential for 
under-spending this fina
ncial year, and thus the 
possibility of a lower deficit than the central forecast.  
The budget deficit is projected to remain over 3% of 
GDP in 2006/07.  Nevertheless, the projected trend is 
expected to be a gradual improvement to around 3% 

of GDP in 2007/08.

apply the Eurostat decision of 14 July 2000 on the allocation of 
UMTS receipts. The UK has not generally applied this decision in 
domestic publication of its deficit data, which results in the net 
lending balance on a Eurostat basis being approximately 0.1% 
points of GDP per annum lower than reported in UK national 

accounts from respectively 2001 and 2001/02 onwards.

The gradual improvement of the budget deficit hinges 
on three factors. 
First, a cyclical improvement from the pick-up of 
growth over 2006 and 2007. The continued 

profitability of UK companies throughout the forecast 
period is also expected to sustain the corporation tax 
base, depressed in the recent past by losses carried 
forward from previous years;  
Second, the projections include a structural 
improvement in the ratio between direct tax receipts 
and their respective tax bases 
in line with long term 
trends; Third, reflecting the government’s plans, overall 
expenditure growth is projected to moderate slightly 
in the 2007/08 
financial year.   
General government gross debt is projected to 
increase from just below 41%% of GDP in 2004/05 to 
around 44 ½ % of GDP in 2007/08.

%Developments in 2005 
After record growth of 5.6% 
in 2004, growth of real 
GDP accelerated further to 6.2% in the first half of 
2005. Growth was again mainly driven by buoyant 

domestic demand fuelled by higher government 
expenditures in the run-up
 to the elections in June, 
higher real wage increases and continued strong credit 

growth especially in the first quarter. Gross fixed 
capital formation expanded most strongly. It is 
expected that growth will 
calm down slightly in the 
second half as additional measures to curb credit 
growth, which were introduced in April, start to have 
some effect. Floods during the summer have caused 

some disruptions in p
articular in agriculture which 
showed negative growth, 
but this is likely to be offset 
by additional flood-related 
expenditures in the further 
course of the year. Imports have again expanded more 
rapidly than exports, implying a strong negative 
contribution to growth from 
the external balance. 
Consumer price inflation accelerated steadily during 
the year as a result of rising oil prices and is expected 
to reach an average 4.5%. Employment will continue 
to grow, although at a decelerating rate due to 
increasing bottlenecks in the labour market. High 
import growth and ri
sing import prices are 
contributing to a substantial fu
rther deterioration of 
the current account deficit, which is expected to reach 
12.2% of GDP in 2005. As in previous years, net 

inflows of foreign direct investment are likely to 
finance the current account deficit to a large extent. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The pattern of strong ec
onomic growth based on high 
domestic demand is expected to
 continue into 2006 
and 2007. Some signs of overheating have become 

apparent in 2005 and both the trade and current 
account deficits have increased considerably, partly 
also as a result of substantial oil price increases. A 

certain correction in 2006 
may result from a further 
dampening of credit growth, lower employment 
growth and a slight moderat
ion in real wage growth, 
although pressures on wage increases will remain 
fairly strong. Higher excise duties in
 2006 should help 
to contain private consumption, while a reduction in 

pension contributions a
nd some adjustments in 
income taxation will at
 the same time increase 
disposable incomes. Ther
efore, GDP growth is 
expected to come down only slightly to around 5½%, 
which may be insufficient to
 prevent a further 
widening of the trade deficit. 
This will probably be followed
 by a consolidation of 
growth at a high level in 
2007 with investment growth 
remaining particularly strong as the catching-up 
process continues. Higher absor
ption of EU transfers 
and potentially higher government expenditures due 
to accession-related extra financing needs would also 

contribute to the continuation of strong growth. 
Consumer price inflation is 
expected to remain high in 
2006 in the wake of the 
substantial hike in oil prices 
in 2005. Increases in excise du
ties will also have a 
noticeable effect on consumer prices. Together with 
continuing wage pressures 
this will lead to an 
acceleration of inflation to above 5% in 2006. More 

favourable developments in import prices and the 
anticipation of excise duty 
increases in 2006 should, 
however, allow inflation to decelerate to 3.5% in 

2007. In line with the strong econom
ic growth, the labour 
market situation should
 continue to improve. Further 
employment growth will however be hampered by a 

decline in the working-age population as well as 
increasing mismatches in the labour market. While 
employment growth will therefore probably decrease 
over time, the unemployment rate is expected to come 
down further and to drop below 10% in 2006.

Public finance 
Government revenues have again been much higher in 
2005 than planned, leading to the accumulation of a 
sizable budget surplus in the first 
half. Due to extra 
expenditures on flood relief and traditionally higher 
expenditures in the last quart
er, this surplus will come 
down in the remainder 
of the year. But the planned 
surplus of at least 1% of GDP appears realistic. 
Planned cuts on pension contributions and income tax 
will imply lower revenues in 
2006. At the same time, 
further expenditures on flood relief will be necessary. 
Given the budget over-performance in recent years, 
the objective of a balanced budget should nevertheless 

be achievable. This should also be the case in 2007, 
despite potential extra fi
nancing needs related to 
accession. In line with this fiscal stance and continued 

strong growth, gross pub
lic debt as a share of GDP 
will decline further to 
below 30% in 2007. 
External balances The trade deficit is expected to
 widen to more than 
17% of GDP in 2005 as a result of strong import 
growth and higher import prices. While the gap in the 

growth rates of imports and exports should start 
declining next year, the trade deficit will still increase 
further. The continuation of this trend and 
improvements in the term
s of trade should however 
lead to a narrowing of th
e trade deficit in 2007. 
Improvements in the services and transfer balances 

should allow for a slight reduction of the current 
account deficit already in 2006 before a smaller trade 
deficit will lead to a more significant reduction in 

2007. Net foreign direct investments will continue to 
largely finance the

Recent economic developments 
In 2004, real GDP grew by 8.3%. Household 
consumption rose strongly 
by 10.8% on the back of 
high real wage gains, str
ong consumer credit growth 
and the impact of a bumper harvest on rural incomes. 
The consumption binge was particularly pronounced 
in the second half of the year with a growth rate of 

close to 13%, partly caused by pre-election hikes in 
pensions and public sect
or wages. A solid expansion 
of gross fixed capital formation, by 10.1%, also 

sustained growth. Export
s increased by 14.1%, but 
their growth slowed considerably over the year, and 
they continued to be outpace
d by rapid import growth 
of both consumer and investment goods. As a result, 
net exports turned strongly 
negative, and the trade 
deficit widened to 9.0% of GDP.  
The increasingly unbalanced growth continued in the 
first half of 2005. Househo
ld consumption expanded 
by 11.7%, while investment growth slowed to 7.6%, 
export growth dropped to 5.9% and import growth 

remained above 17%. Disinflation eased due to both 
demand-pull and cost-push 
factors, and the central 
bank was forced to raise its 
end-year inflation target 
to 7.5%. Pro-cyclical fiscal policy and slippage in 
public sector wage policy bear 
a responsibility for the 
widening of macroeconomic imbalances. 
Prospects for 2005 to 2007  
The outlook for Romania’s economy points to 
continued strong growth, a gr
adual decline in inflation 
and a considerable current a
ccount deficit, which is 
caused by both high imports of goods and services 
and decelerating exports reflecting rising real unit 
labour costs and rapid appreciation of the exchange 

rate in 2005. In 2005, 
the buoyant household 
consumption will offset the 
lower momentum in 
export growth and th
e output loss caused by floods. In 
2006, GDP growth will 
benefit from the repair and 
upgrading of damaged housing and infrastructure. 
Household consumption is expected to gradually 

moderate in 2006-07 in tand
em with more subdued 
wage dynamics and the diminishing effects of the tax 
cuts undertaken. 
GDP growth and components 
In 2005, private consumption is expected to remain 
strong due to the effect of tax cuts on incomes and 
hikes in public sector wages. In 2006, the fiscal 
reform will be fully phased in and private 

consumption growth is likely 
to start to decline and 
reach a more sustainable level in 2007. Investment 
growth is expected to peak in 2006 due to floods 

repairs and will remain strong over the forecasting 
period on the back of the ongoing modernisation of 
production facilities, co
nsiderable FDI inflows and 
public investment projects in preparation for EU 
accession. The negative contribution to GDP growth 

from net exports is expected
 to diminish somewhat 
over the forecasting period. 
InflationInflation is expected to remain on
 a downward path, 
although disinflation is now expected to happen at a 

slower pace due to excess demand and persistently 
high energy prices. Consumer price inflation fell to 
11.9% on average in 2004, and it is forecast to fall to 

9.1% in 2005 with food
 prices increasing only slowly 
and import prices falling due 
to rapid appreciation of 
the currency. While high wage growth and the 

ongoing adjustment of adm
inistered prices in 2005 
kept non-food and services infl
ation at its 2004 level, 
cost-push factors are seen to become progressively 

less important, which will help
 inflation to decline to 
7.4% in 2006 and 6.0% in 2007. Productivity gains 
due to industrial restructuring will help keeping 
inflationary pressures down. 
Labour market 
The unemployment rate is expected to fall gradually 
over the forecast period due to declining working-age

population and rising employ
ment. Growth 
in private 
sector employment will continue to mitigate the effect 
of lay-offs in state-owned 
enterprises in 2005-06. Labour market trends should be interpreted with 
caution due to data revisions, changing methodology 
and the large informal sector, which the recent tax 

reform may help reduce. 
Public finances 
Against the background of
 strong revenue collection 
of VAT, excises and customs duties as well as lower 
than budgeted public 
investments, the general 
government deficit is expe
cted to be contained to 
0.9% of GDP in 2005. In 2006, public expenditure 
growth would continue to be affected by the slippage 

in public sector wages and increasing expenditures for 
floods repairs. As revenues are affected by lower 
GDP growth and the revenue-to-GDP ratio has 

declined as a result of the cuts in income and profit 
taxes, the general government deficit is expected to 
increase to 1.4% in 2006 and 2.2% in 2007.  
External balances Strong domestic demand will keep import growth 
high and, together with lower export growth, will 
result in a widening trade deficit. The significant 

improvement in the terms of
 trade in 2005, mainly 
due to strong appreciation of
 the currency, will be 
reversed. Increasing remitta
nces and EU transfers will 
mitigate the impact on the current account deficit over 
the forecasting period, which would nevertheless still 
widen considerably. High
 FDI inflows, improved 
access to financial markets and large international 
reserves facilitate the financing of the growing deficit.

Recent economic developments 
Economic growth continued 
to slow down to 3.5% 
year-on year-in the first half of 2005, as compared to 
3.8% in 2004, due to a sharp decline of growth in the 

first quarter (1.9%), followed by an acceleration of 
growth in the second quarter (5.1%). In the first 
semester, gross fixed capital 
formation grew by 1.9%, 
significantly lower than 
in 2004 (4.4%). Private 
consumption growth slowed to 3.4% from 3.9% in 
2004. Real export 
growth slowed to 4.2% as 
compared to a growth rate of 5.4% in 2004, while real 
import growth increased to 
4.1% from 3.5% in 2004. 
As a result, net external demand posted a negative 

contribution to growth (-0.7
 percentage points) in the 
first semester, after it added half a percentage point in 
2004. Industrial performance remained strong during 

the third quarter (around 6% year on year), while 
construction activity 
decreased by 3.6% year on year 
during the same period. 
Growth of retail trade in real 
terms slowed to 2% in July, before it picked up to 
5.1% in August. 
As a result of higher en
ergy, transport and food 
prices, annual average inflation increased to 3.0% in 
September 2005, up from 
2% in 2004. Producer prices 
rose by 3.4% year-on-year 
during the first eight 
months, following an 
annual increase of 3.5% in 2004. In the fist half of 2005, merchandise exports increased 
by 8% year on year, and services exports declined by 

2.7%. Merchandise import growth picked up 
somewhat to 6.7% from around 5% in 2004. On a four 
quarter rolling basis, the tr
ade deficit as a share of 
GDP remained unchanged during the last three 
quarters at a little above 24.3
%. However, the current 
account deficit increased to around 7% of GDP in the 

twelve month to June, also as
 a result of a significant 
increase in re-invested earnings. 
Prospects for 2005 to 2007 
In 2005, real GDP growth is expected to come down 
to 3.6%, slightly lo
wer than in 2004
, as a consequence 
of lower growth of private consumption (down to 
3.7% from 3.9% in 2004) and gross fixed capital 
formation (down to 3.4% from 4.4% in 2004). Growth 

is forecast to accelerate to 4% in 2006 and 4.4% in 
2007, based on stronger private investment in the 
context of ongoing privatisation and enterprise 

restructuring and a continued strong merchandise 
export and tourism performance.  
Based on the assumption of a continuation of 
stability-oriented monetary policies moderate growth 

of private consumption of 3.7% is foreseen in both 
2005 and 2006, before 
it will pick up somewhat in 
2007 as further EU integration increases consumer’s 
confidence. Growth of gross fixed capital formation is 
expected to accelerate over the forecast period from 

3.6% in 2005 to 5.3% in 2007, as a result of stronger 
private investment following further improvements in 
the overall business environment. Real exports will 

continue to grow by aroun
d 6-7% annually, in 
particular backed by strong services exports. A rising 
stock of FDI will gradually 
improve the prospects for 
merchandise exports. Real imports are expected to 
expand more slowly th
an exports, but they will 
accelerate in line with growing GDP. Accordingly, 

net exports will contribute by almost around half a 
percentage point to GDP growth each year over the 
forecast period.  
Annual average consumer price inflation is expected 
to rise to 3% in 2005, largel
y as a result of higher oil 
and food prices. Further a
djustments of administrative 
prices and indirect taxes will slightly accelerate 

inflation further in 2006 and 2007 to 3.1% and 3.2%, 
respectively.In line with accelerating GDP growth, employment 
growth is forecast to accelerate slightly from 0.9% in 
2005 to 1.2% in 
2007. This will lead to a gradual 
reduction of the unemploy
ment rate from 13.3% in 
2005 to 12.1% in 2007. Real wage growth is expected 
to accelerate in 2006 and 2007, slightly above average

Public finances 
The general government deficit is expected to be 
reduced from 4.9% of GD
P in 2004 to
 4.5% in 2005. 
The forecast assumes a further reduction of the deficit 
to 3.7% in 2006 and 3.4% 
in 2007. The share of 
current spending in GDP will be reduced, also as a 

result of some policy measu
res taken in 2005 (change 
in pension indexation, reduction of subsidies) and 
public investment growth 
will further slow down to 
more sustainable levels. Revenues as a share of GDP, 
in particular indirect taxes, will only slightly decline. 
The fiscal impact of the agreed repayment of old 

pensioners obligations starting 
in mid-2006 remains 
unclear and constitutes a po
tential downside risk to 
fiscal performance over the forecast period. The 

general government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
be reduced to 43.1% by 2007.  
External balancesThe trade deficit is expected to come down only 
slightly in 2006 an
d 2007, as import growth remains 
strong, reflecting 
a rather high import content of 
exports and a stronger private consumption growth in 
2007. As a result, the 
deficit as a percentage of GDP 
will only slightly decline from 24.3% in 2005 to 

23.8% in 2006. The current account deficit is forecast 
to increase to 6.2% of GDP in 2005 (from 5.3% in 
2004), due to a deterioration 
of the terms of trade, a 
higher income balance
 deficit and statistical revisions. 
The deficit will however be 
gradually reduced in 2006 
and 2007 to 5.8% and 5.2%, respectively, primarily 

on the back of a higher surplus of the services 
balance. 1072. Turkey Economy growing close to potential

Recent economic developments 
In 2004 and 2005, 
economic stabilisation has 
continued along with a better balancing of the sources 
of growth.  During the first half year of 2005, strong 

investment led to an increase in output by 4½%.  
Favourable base-year effects and leading indicators, 
such as industrial production
 and capacity utilisation, 
point to continued strong growth in the second half, 
which most likely will bring output growth in 2005 to 
about 5%. Inflati
onary pressures continued to decline, 
reflecting the strength 
of the Turkish 
currency and the strict fiscal policy of the Turkish authorities.  As a 
result, consumer price inflation fell to 7½% in 

October 2005, below th
e year-end target of 8%.  
After almost three years of strong growth with almost 
no job creation, employment started to rise since mid-
2004 by roughly 2% year-on-
year.  The labour force 
participation rate went slightly up to about 50%. 
These trends together led to
 a small fall in the 
unemployment rate to be
low 10%.  Public finances 
remained largely on track, achieving a primary 
surplus of 6½% of GDP.  
This substantial surplus and strong GDP growth led to a sharp reduction in the 
debt ratio, from 87% of GDP in 2003 to 80% in 2004.  
The current account deficit widened considerably 

reflecting accelerating domestic demand and the 
strength of the currency, from just over 3% of GDP in 
2003 to about 5 % of
 GDP in 2004.  
Prospects in 2005 to 2007 
The overall picture for the forecasting period looks 
favourable.  Turkey should 
be able to maintain strong 
export growth -in particular 
in tourism- while the tight 
fiscal policy stance will support the current 
disinflation process, in spite
 of pressures arising from 
high oil prices and rigi
dities in services prices.   The continued decline in
 inflationary pressures will 
improve predictability and allo
w for a fall in interest 
rates and improve the investment climate.  Overall, 
economic growth is expected to increase by about 5% 

throughout the forecasting period. Output growth is 
expected to be increasingly balanced by domestic 
demand components, with
 private investment 
outpacing overall growth.  Declining inflation will 
support disposable income
 and allow consumers to 
gradually increase consumption from 4¾% in 2005 to 

5½% in 2007.  Fixed in
vestment will continue to 
benefit from reduced macroeconomic and political 
uncertainty and declining 
real interest rates. On the 
other hand, the build-up of
 stocks appears to have 
come to an end in 2005. 
 The strong investment and 
consumption will lead to con
tinued high growth of 
imports, in particular of
 consumer durables and 
capital goods.  Exports 
should benefit from 
diversification and quality im
provements resulting 
from earlier high investments.  However, the relative 
strength of the Turkish currency might make it more 

difficult for exporters to 
benefit from new trade 
opportunities. Parliament
ary and Presidential 
elections are due in 2007. This might have an 

important impact on public spending. Any possible 
impact stemming from policy changes in the context 
of political events has not been
 incorporated in the 
current forecast.  
The trend in declining 
inflationary pressures is likely 
to continue.  Fiscal disciplin
e, improving credibility 
of the Central Bank’s disi
nflation targets and the 
recent strength of the currency are important elements 
in this respect. Annual 
average consumer price inflation is expected to stay below 8% by the end of 
2005. However, high oil and services prices might 
slowdown the disinflation
 process in 2006-2007.  
In line with the stro
ng growth performance, 
employment is forecast to increase by about 2% per 
year. This will lead to a slight reduction of the 
unemployment rate from 10% in 2005 to 9¾% in 

2007.  108Chapter 5 Candidate Countries, Turkey

Public finances  
The public sector imbalances are likely to decline 
markedly during 2005-2007, benefiting from the 
sustained recovery, declinin
g interest rates driven by 
improved market confidence and a prudent fiscal 
policy stance.  The ongoing
 public finance reforms 
will help to widen the 
tax base and to increase the 
efficiency of tax collection.  Non-interest 
expenditures are seen to remain largely constant as a 
percentage of GDP.  The general government deficit 

is expected to fall from 3.9% of GDP in 2004 to 2.9% 
by 2007. General government debt is forecast to 
decline from 80% at the end of 2004 to 62% at the 

end of 2007.  
External balances Growth of imports remains strong, partially reflecting 
a rather high import content of exports. The current 
account deficit is forecast to increase to 6¼% of GDP 

in 2006, due to a deteriorati
on of the terms of trade 
and a higher deficit of the income balance.  Primarily 
due to a higher surplus of the services balance, the 

deficit is forecast to narrow to 5¾ in 2007.

Forecast
Growth and imbalances 
The US economy continued to expand at a rate above 
long-term potential into th
e third quarter of 2005. 
Growth this year has again been led by buoyant 

consumer spending, supported by robust gains in 
housing and equipment i
nvestment. The advance GDP 
estimate for the third 
quarter showed an annualised 
growth rate of 3.8%. Towards the end of the quarter, 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the US Gulf Coast 
and caused widespread devastation and disruption to 

economic activity. The disaster, which was 
accompanied by a surge in energy prices, is likely to 
curb growth for some months. 
The labour market has improved
 further in 2005, with 
the unemployment rate drifting down to around 5%. 
However, the absence of any wage acceleration seems 
to indicate that there is not yet any real labour market 

tightness. At the same time, th
e underlying growth of 
productivity has remained robust. Reflecting the sharp 
rise in energy prices, headl
ine inflation surged to 
4.7% year-on-year in September. Core inflation, 
however, has so fa
r been relatively benign at around 
2% year-on-year. Serious macroeconomic imbalances provide a 
worrying background to th
e expansion. The current 
account deficit has increased from 5.6% of GDP last 

year to 6.2% in the first half of 2005 in national 
account terms, even though exports are now growing 
faster in real terms than imp
orts. Rapidly declining 
net investment income is contributing to the widening 
external deficit. The fiscal deficit of general 
government declined from 4.7% of GDP last year to 
3.5 in the first half of 2005 following a temporary 
surge in tax revenues based on last year’s corporate 

and personal income. Personal saving as a share of 
disposable personal income declined from 1.8% last 
year to 0.3% in the first half of 2005. The advance 

estimate for the third quarter 
shows even a negative 
personal saving rate (-1.1%). Double-digit house price 
inflation has contributed to the falling saving rate via 

mortgage equity withdrawals. The housing market is 
increasingly displaying features of an asset price 
bubble. Higher energy prices and interest rates to take 
their toll Looking forward, it can be expected that consumer 
spending will be curbed 
by the combined effects of 
higher energy prices and rising interest rates. The 

large increases in energy prices 
in the third quarter 
are, by and large, assumed to persist over the forecast 
period and will reduce real disposable incomes 

noticeably. At the same time, the Federal Reserve is 
poised to continue to remove monetary stimulus 
gradually, an approach which has so far raised the 
federal funds target rate from 1% in June 2004 to 4% 
in November 2005. Lo
ng-term rates have also 
increased recently and may rise further in view of 
growing concerns about in
flationary pressures and a 
worsening fiscal outlo
ok. As a corollary to rising 
interest rates, the housing ma
rket is expected to cool 
down which should lead 
to higher household saving. 
Business investment is lik
ely to soften in response to 
downward pressure on profit margins from somewhat 

higher unit labour costs. Also
, the fact that industrial 
capacity utilisation is still be
low its long-term average 
suggests that there is no need for particularly high 

capital spending. Overall 
capital formation should 
also be held back by a fall in residential investment 
activity, which is particularly 
sensitive to higher 
interest rates. External trade should have a broadly 
neutral effect on growth over the forecast period, as 
the gains in internationa
l competitiveness from the 
dollar depreciation in 2002-04 have been somewhat 
reduced by the dollar’s appreciation in real effective 

terms since the spring. 
The disruptions caused by the hurricanes are likely to 
suppress GDP growth in the fourth quarter of this 
year. Subsequently, however, 
the additional economic 
activity needed to clean up and rebu

area should boost national output. The main weight of 
the rebuilding effect is expected
 to fall in the first half 
of 2006, when it may offset the growth-reducing 

effects from higher energy prices and interest rates. 
The federal government 
is committed to providing 
substantial funding for the reconstruction effort. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007 
The forecast sees output growth at slightly above its 
long-term potential in the 
first half of 2006. As the 
post-hurricane rebuilding effect wanes from the 
middle of next year, GDP growth is projected to fall 

below potential, particularly in 2007. This profile will 
result in annual growth rates of 3.2% in 2006 and 
2.7% in 2007. The anticipated slowdown in consumer 

spending should push personal saving back up to 
about 2% of disposable pers
onal income by
 2007. The 
slowing economy would result in a slight rise in the 

unemployment rate by 20
07 when employment 
growth falls below the 
growth in labour supply. 
Headline inflation numbers should benefit from a 
stabilisation of energy prices, although core inflation 
can be expected to be under upward pressure for a 

while. The general government deficit is forecast to 
rise to the range of 4% - 5% of GDP again, driven by 
fiscal spending for hurricane relief. The current 

account deficit will continue to rise, although at a 
somewhat slower pace. 
There are risks to the GDP forecast on both sides. On 
the upside, there is th
e possibility that continued 
strong gains in real estate values will keep household 
spending growth at recent levels. The downside risks 
may be somewhat less likely, but their effect more 

severe, should they materialis
e. A sharp rise in long-
term rates, possibly in connection with a loss of 
confidence in the 
dollar, could result in large negative 
wealth effects followed by a recession.

Japan - Real GDP growth rates
Economic activity improved in 2005 
The Japanese economy is emerging from the technical 
recession that took place in mid-2004. GDP grew by 
3.3% at an annualised rate in the second quarter of 

2005 after growing by 5.8% in the first quarter of the 
year. While there was a noticeable slowdown in 
exports, the recovery was main
ly fuelled by a rebound 
in domestic demand.  
Private consumption improved considerably in the 
first half of 2005. Househo
ld income has been rising 
moderately as a result of an
 improving employment 
situation and the interruption 
of the decline in real 
wages. Non-residential investment was also a 
significant contributor to GD
P growth in the first half 
of the year. Corporate 
profitability is high and 
business companies have significantly improved their 
balance sheets. On the external side, exports 

registered a slowdown over the first half of the year 
compared to 2004, mainly due to the loss of 
momentum of exports to 
the rest of Asia. Overall, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the first 
half of the year was neutral. 
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity 
should continue to expa
nd steadily in the coming 
quarters. On the domestic front, the gradual 
improvement of the situation
 in the labour market as 
well as positive confidence environment should 
enable household consumption to remain on its 
upward trend. On the corporate front, industrial 

production seems to have turned up in August, and 
orders are rising. Business investment is forecast to 
further increase as the business outlook becomes 
brighter and confidence continues to remain 
favourable on the whole. On the external side, 
exports, particularly to the rest of Asia, seem to be 

picking up again.  At the same time, imports’ growth 
should stabilise.  
Given the negative growth overhang into the year, 
annual growth is forecast to 
marginally slow down 
from 2.7% in 2004 to 2.5% in 2005, in spite of these 
strong developments in the first half of 2005. 
Prospects for 2006 and 2007  
The current economic recovery appears sustainable 
during the forecast horizon as GDP growth is 

becoming more balanced. The global economic 
environment is expected to remain supportive to 
growth, while domestic demand should maintain its 

current momentum. In part
icular, strong projected profit growth, continued
 reduction in corporate 
indebtedness and high cap
acity utilisation suggest that 
capital expenditures should continue to expand. 
Increasing wages, asset prices and confidence should 
support consumption. Moreover, the recent election 
results should further boost structural reforms and 
might stimulate household and business confidence.  
On the external side, despite an acceleration of 
imports associated with stronger domestic demand, 
net exports are not projected to be an important drag 
on GDP growth, as export 
growth should remain 
resilient. Overall, economic growth is expected to moderate in 
pace over the coming years but should continue to be 
close to potential. GDP gr
owth is forecast to slow 
down to 2.2% in 2006
 and 1.8% in 2007. 
An improving situation 
in the labour market The situation in the labour ma
rket has been improving 
markedly since the beginning of 2005, with the 
number of full-time employees increasing for the first 

time in more than five 
years. Although the growth of 
part-time employment is gradually slowing down – in 
line with the progress made in corporate restructuring 

– total employment is 
now on an upward trend. The 
unemployment rate stood at
 a low of 4.2% in 
September 2005. In the light of these developments, 
real wages have started to rise, albeit with some 
fluctuations.  114Chapter 6 Other non-EU Countries, Japan

Core deflation eases gradually  
Deflationary pressures conti
nue to ease, although 
slowly. In September, the headline CPI decreased by 
0.3% year-on-year, while the 
core index fell by 0.1%. 
The end of asset price deflation also seems on track 
with signs of land prices increasin
g in some regions.  
Bank lending growth was pos
itive in August and September 2005 (+0.4%) for the first time since 1998, 

indicating that the functioni
ng of the monetary policy 
transmission mechanism might be improving. Core 
inflation is projected to turn
 positive around the 
beginning of 2006. However, it should remain 
relatively low in 2006, desp
ite the narrowing of the 
output gap and high oil prices.  
Economic policy challenges  
Given the core inflati
on profile, an official interest 
rate hike in 2006 might not yet be warranted. The 
current monetary policy stance 
of quantitative easing 
is likely to be maintained 
for the major part of next 
year, though on a reduced scale. A gradual and 
cautious monetary tightening could be expected in the 

course of 2007, however.  
As for fiscal policy, the government has taken a very 
cautious attitude towards fiscal 
consolidation for a 
long time, fearing that any sizeable package might 

bring the economy back into recession. So far, 
cautious measures of expenditure cuts have been 
preferred to raising re
venues. The government has stated the objective of reducing the primary balance 
by around 0.5 of a percentag
e point annually. So far, 
however, there is no medium-term fiscal 

consolidation plan to
 achieve this.

ANNEX151Note on concepts and sources 
1. The directorate general for
 economic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term economic 
forecasts twice a year: in the spring and in the autumn. These 

forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for the 
Member States, the Acceding andCandidate Countries, the 
European Union as a whole, the euro area and the international 
environment. 
2. Data for 2005, 2006 and 2007are forecasts. The sources for all 
tables are the Commission services, except where it is stated 

otherwise. In general, the historical data for the Member States are 
based on the ESA 95 system. The forecasts for 10 Member States 
(namely CZ, DE, ES, FR, IE, NL, AT, PL, PT and SI) have been 
made using chain-linked volume measures (based on previous year’s 
prices). For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.  
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand, respectively, 
present data including inventories. 4. In Table 16, the data are based on the national index for USA and 
Japan, and for EU Member 
States and the aggregates prior to 1996. 
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment 

and the NAIRU play a key role. Compared to earlier forecasts, the 
labour component has been replaced by
 average hours worked per 
year and person in employment (thereby also including self-
employment) in absolute level terms in the autumn 2005 economic 

forecast. The cyclical adjustment of budgetary balances is based on 
this concept.6. Employment data are based on numb
ers of persons employed. The 
concept of full-time equivalent (FTE) is used for Germany, Spain, 
France, Italy, the Netherlands and E
stonia. Tables 21-27 and 31-32 
use data on FTE for these countries.  
7. The nominal short-term interest rates are defined as the 3-month 
inter-bank rates. The nominal long-term interest rates are defined as 
the yield on the central government 
benchmark 10-year bond from 
1995. 
8. EU25 and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using Purc
hasing Power Standards (PPS). 
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the 
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates. 
Tables 48-52, 60 and 61 show also 
EU25 and euro area "adjusted" 
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU25 and euro area vis-à-vis 

third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the 
individual countries in the EU25 or
 the euro area. However, intra-
EU25 or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting 
errors.  The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls 
and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU 

trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated 
compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an overestimation of the 
surplus. For the past, the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat (for 
EU25) estimates and ECB (for euro area) estimates. For the future, 
they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2004. 9. Tables 37, 38, 39 and 42 are based on government deficit and debt 
data for the period 2001-2004, as 
transmitted by Member States to 
the European Commission in September 2005. In publishing these 

data, Eurostat has indicated that, for certain Member States (the 
Czech Republic, Greece and Portugal), it “has reservations on the 
quality of the data”. The data are according to the ESA95 system of 
national accounts. Interest expenditure includes settlements under 
swap arrangements and forward rate 
agreements (Tables 35, 37, 38 
and 40). All Member States are in the process of revising their 

national accounts. Though no significant impact is expected on 
deficit and debt figures, the expected upward revision of GDP levels 
by 1-2% typically leads to marginal downward revision of deficit 

and debt ratios. However, it should be noted that the revisions in 
GDP following FISIM allocations (financial services indirectly 
measured) will only be taken into consideration for the calculations 
of the deficit- and debt- to-GDP 
ratios in spring 2006, although 
FISIM allocations have been implemented by 10 Member States 
already (namely DK, DE, EE, ES, FR, IE, NL, AT, FI and SI).  
10. The allocation of mobile phone licences (UMTS) impacts strongly 
on the general government accounts for some countries in 2000-
2005. Tables 35, 37 and 39 include th
e amounts from the sale of the 
licences, while the cyclically adjusted balances in tables 40 and 41 

exclude these amounts. The amounts in bn of national currency are 
for 2000: DE 50.8, ES 0.5, IT 
13.8, NL 2.7, 
AT 0.8, PT 0.4, 
UK 22.5, EU25 105.9 and 
euro area 69.1. For 
2001: BE 0.5, CZ 7.4, 
DK 3.2, EL 0.6, FR 
1.2, PL 3.0, SI 21.
8, EU25 3.8 and euro 
area 2.3. For 2002: FR 0.
6, IE 0.2, EU25 0.8 
and euro area 0.8. For 
2003: EE 0.2. For 2005: SI 9.0. 
11. Second pillar pension funds are included in the general government 
sector in the following Member States ( with the estimated effect on 
the deficit as % of GDP indicated in brackets): DK (1.1 in 2001, 1.0 

in 2002, 1.1 in 2003, 1.0 in 2004-20
07), HU (0.7 in 2001-2002, 0.9 
in 2003, 1.1 in 2004, 1.3 in 2005 an
d 1.4 in 2006-2007), PL (1.5 in 
2001, 1.9 in 2002, 1.6 in 2003, 1.
9 in 2004, 2.0 in 2005-2007), SK 
(0.8 in 2005, 1.3 in 2006 and 1.4 in 2007) and SE (0.9 in 2001-2003, 
1.0 in 2004-2006.  
12. German, EU25 and euro-area 
figures are for unified Germany from 
1991 onwards; from 1992 onwar
ds for percentage changes.  
13. With respect to the RAMS (recently-acceded Member States), which 
are currently in a transition phase, the quality of statistical data may 

not always be directly comparable to the EU15 Member States. 
14. Geographical zones are defined as follows :  
Euro area:  EUR12 (EU15 excluding DK, SE and the UK); 
Acceding countries: Bulgaria and Romania
Candidate countries:  Croatia and Turkey. 
Industrialised Countries:  EU25, Acceding and Candidate Countries, USA, Japan, 
 Canada, Norway, Switzerland,
 Iceland, Australia and New 
 Zealand. 
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa):   Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran
, Iraq, Israel, Jo
rdan, Kuwait, 
 Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Om
