insight into the art of a particular EU country. Contemporary art has been chosen since it 

reflects the period in which Monetary Union has become reality. 
Some of the artworks are purchased for the ECB™s art collection, which is to be expanded. The 
seven pages which separate the chapters of this Annual Report show a selection of works from

FOREWORD
12ECB Annual Report
2005I would like to begin by paying tribute to my 
predecessor Wim Duisenberg, our first 

President, who passed away last year. As I said 

on several occasions, in Amsterdam, Frankfurt 

and many other cities across Europe, this 

institution, the European Central Bank, its staff, 

my colleagues and I on the Executive Board, the 

Governing Council and the General Council, 

we all owe an immense debt of gratitude to 

Wim. His memory will always be with us or, as 

Chateaubriand would have said, ﬁdeath has not 

defeated him; it has only made him invisibleﬂ.
***In 2005 the euro area saw real GDP rise by 

1.4%, compared with 1.8% in 2004 and 0.7% 

in 2003. The pace of economic activity was 

moderate in the first half of the year, but tended 

to accelerate during the second half, benefiting 

from the continued strong growth in global 

demand, robust growth in corporate earnings 

and very favourable financing conditions. 

Economic activity therefore proved to be 

relatively resilient against a background of high 

and volatile oil prices. However, owing to large 
increases in commodity and energy prices and, 
to a lesser extent, rises in administered prices 

and indirect taxes, annual HICP inflation in 

2005 was 2.2% Œ slightly higher than the rate of 

2.1% observed in the two preceding years. 

Nonetheless, domestic inflationary pressures 

remained under control as continued moderate 

wage developments and favourable trends in 

prices of imported manufactured goods offset 

to some extent the increase in commodity and 

energy prices. 
***In the context of subdued domestic inflationary 

pressures, the Governing Council kept key ECB 

interest rates unchanged at the historically low 

level of 2% for most of the year, while 

continuing to closely monitor longer-term 

inflation expectations. As the year progressed, 

the ECB™s economic analysis suggested that 

upside risks to medium-term price stability 

were increasing, an assessment which was 

confirmed by the monetary analysis, given 

strong monetary and credit growth in a situation 

of already ample liquidity. Towards the end of 

2005, regular cross-checking of the economic 

and monetary analyses indicated that an 

adjustment of the accommodative stance of the 

ECB™s monetary policy was warranted in order 

to address these risks. Therefore, on 1 December 

2005 the Governing Council decided to increase 

the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, 

after having kept them unchanged for two and a 

half years.
Inflation expectations for the euro area as a 
whole are solidly anchored at levels in line with 

price stability, as reflected in surveys and 

financial indicators. This has contributed to 

safeguarding the low level of risk premia 

embodied in nominal interest rates across the 

whole maturity spectrum, thereby leading to 

lower levels of both short and long-term interest 

rates. The ECB™s high level of credibility and 

its stability-oriented policy have thus helped to 

maintain very favourable financing conditions 

for investors, thereby supporting economic 

growth and job creation. They have also 
13ECB Annual Report
2005contributed to preserving the purchasing power 
of consumers, which is of great importance to 

all euro area residents, not least those on lower 

incomes. It is essential that this asset of the 
euro area economy be preserved. To this end, 

the Governing Council will continue to closely 

monitor all relevant developments so as to 

ensure that medium to long-term inflation 

expectations remain solidly anchored at levels 

in line with price stability. 
***The success of EMU also depends on sustainable 

fiscal policies and comprehensive structural 

reforms aimed at increasing the economy™s 

growth potential. Such a combination of 

policies not only promotes the cohesion and 

flexibility of the euro area economy but also 

supports monetary policy in its task of 

maintaining price stability, thereby enhancing 

its effectiveness and contributing to sustainable 

output growth and job creation. 
Compliance with the agreed fiscal rules 
strengthens the sustainability of public finances, 

which is crucial not least because of the 

expected budgetary impact of ageing 

populations. This is why the Eurosystem has 

always strongly supported the Stability and 

Growth Pact. A rigorous and consistent 

implementation of the revised rules is conducive 

to fiscal discipline and helps to restore the 

credibility of the EU™s fiscal framework as well 

as confidence in prudent fiscal policies. 

Reliable compilation and timely reporting of 

government finance statistics is also essential 

for the European fiscal framework and the 

effective functioning of mutual surveillance.  
Some progress with structural reforms has been 
made in recent years, but the mid-term review 

of the Lisbon strategy undertaken in March 

2005 showed that much greater efforts are 

needed to improve Europe™s growth and 

employment potential. More flexible labour, 

product and financial markets encourage a 

better allocation of resources, and a more stimulative business environment fosters the 

ability to innovate, invest and create jobs. There 

is also the challenge of completing the internal 

market, including for services, thus allowing 

firms to benefit from economies of scale and 

increasing economic efficiency. Overall, the 

opportunities arising from globalisation and 

rapid technological change can best be seized 

by allowing and speeding up structural change. 

This offers the best prospect for the future 

prosperity of Europe™s citizens. 
***The Eurosystem pays close attention to 

developments related to financial integration in 

Europe. Financial integration contributes to the 

smooth implementation of the single monetary 

policy throughout the euro area, as well as to 

the efficient allocation of financial resources 

and thus to economic growth. It has implications 

for the Eurosystem™s task of preserving financial 

stability and is also important for the effective 

operation and smooth functioning of payment 

and settlement systems. In September 2005 the 
ECB published its first report presenting a set 

of indicators on financial integration in the 

euro area. These indicators suggested an 

increase in financial integration, although to 

varying degrees in the different market 

segments. Finally, the ESCB supports, without 

prejudice to the objective of price stability, the 

general objectives of the EU, which include 

financial integration.
Integration has already been fully achieved in 
the field of real-time gross settlement systems, 

through the TARGET system. The Eurosystem 

is actively preparing the TARGET2 system, 

which will offer enhanced services and a new 

pricing framework for core services. TARGET2 

will go live on 19 November 2007 for the first 

group of countries to migrate. All central banks 

participating in TARGET2, together with their 

national banking communities, are expected to 

be using the new system by May 2008.   
14ECB Annual Report
2005As regards retail payment systems, the creation 
of a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) remains 

a crucial objective. Within the SEPA, customers 

will be able to make payments throughout the 

whole euro area from a single bank account, 

using a single set of payment instruments, as 

efficiently and safely as in the national context 

today. It is envisaged that this option will be 

available to citizens by 2008. The Eurosystem 

fully supports this deadline, which requires the 

strong commitment of all the parties involved. 
Following the signing of the Treaty establishing 
a Constitution for Europe (European 

Constitution) in October 2004, Member States 

started the necessary ratification procedures. 

So far 15 Member States have ratified the 

European Constitution or are very close to 

formal completion. In France and the 

Netherlands, the Constitution did not achieve 

majority support. In the view of the ECB, the 

European Constitution clarifies the legal and 

institutional framework of the EU and enhances 

the Union™s ability to act at both the European 

and the international level, while confirming 

the existing monetary framework. It should be 

stressed that the ratification process has no 

bearing on the functioning of Monetary Union 

and does not affect the stability of 

the euro. The ECB, whether operating under 

the current Treaty or under the European 

Constitution, will continue to ensure the 

credibility of the euro and to deliver price 

stability, which is a prerequisite for a non-

inflationary macroeconomic environment 

conducive to economic growth and employment 

creation. In 2005 four EU Member States joined the 
exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) with a view 

to joining the euro area when all convergence 

criteria have been met on a sustainable basis. 

The ECB, as well as the European Commission, 

will issue its regular biennial convergence 

report in autumn 2006. It is worth underlining 

that Member States will be judged on a case-

by-case basis according to their individual 

economic and monetary performance, in full 

respect of the principle of equal treatment. 
Under such conditions, enlargement of the euro 
area will be beneficial to both the current euro 

area and the countries joining it.***In 2005 the ECB earned a surplus of 
992 million. An equivalent amount was set aside in 

a provision against foreign exchange rate, 

interest rate and gold price risks, leaving a 

declared net profit for 2005 of exactly nil. The 

provision will be used to cover losses arising 

from exposure to such risks, in particular 

valuation losses not covered by the revaluation 

accounts. The surplus in 2005 follows a net loss 

of 1,636 million in 2004, which was mainly 
due to the appreciation of the euro against the 
US dollar. In 2005 the euro depreciated against 

this currency.
The total number of staff positions in the ECB™s 
budget for 2005 was 1,369.5 full-time equivalent 

positions, as compared with 1,362.5 in 2004. At 

the end of 2005 the number of staff employed 

by the ECB on permanent or fixed-term 

contracts of at least one year was 1,360, which 

corresponded to 1,351 full-time equivalent 

positions. After 15 May 2005 the ECB started 

accepting applications from nationals of the 
two acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania. 

The implementation of the new human resources 

strategy initiated in 2004 continued throughout 

2005. In addition to promoting mobility, the 

strategy focuses on the development of ECB 

management and on the continuous acquisition 
and development of skills and competencies by 

staff members. Furthermore, the six ECB values 

identified in 2004 were gradually embedded in 

the human resources policies and will continue 
to guide all staff members in their day-to-day 

work.
Human resources issues are also addressed at 
the Eurosystem level. With the aim of further 

promoting the cooperation and team spirit 

among Eurosystem/ESCB central banks in this 
field, the Governing Council established a 

Human Resources Conference (HRC) in 2005. 

Without prejudice to the exclusive competence 
15ECB Annual Report
2005of the NCBs and the ECB in this area, the HRC will allow experience, expertise and 

information to be exchanged on relevant human 

resources policies and practices, contributing 
inter alia to identifying opportunities for 

common training activities and developing 

measures to foster staff exchange. The HRC, 

together with the Eurosystem/ESCB 

Communications Committee, has also been 

mandated to implement the concrete measures 
aimed at promoting the Eurosystem mission 
statement that was published in January 2005. 

Giving a concrete meaning to the mission 

statement for Eurosystem employees in their 

day-to-day work will be an ongoing process 

that will enhance the team spirit between the 

ECB and the NCBs of the euro area.      
As a public institution, the ECB is committed 
to delivering the best services at the lowest 

cost. In view of this permanent commitment, 

the Executive Board decided to review the 

ECB™s effectiveness and efficiency by 

conducting a zero-based budgeting assessment 
(ZBB) in which its staff and management were 

actively involved. Based on the ZBB findings, 

the Executive Board decided that a substantial 

number of positions could be saved or 

re-oriented without laying off staff. A temporary 

recruitment freeze was put in place. The 

Executive Board adopted a number of other 

measures covering a wider range of 

organisational issues within and across the 

various business areas of the ECB, which will 

allow the institution to increase its effectiveness 

and efficiency. The organisational changes 

triggered by the ZBB Œ such as the restructuring 

of certain business areas to better exploit

synergies, the concentration of expertise and 
analytical capabilities, the simplification of 

business processes and a refocusing on 

medium-term strategic planning Œ are being 

progressively implemented. The impulse 

provided by the ZBB will lead to a strengthened 

managerial culture aimed at making the best 

use of existing resources.
Following the selection in early 2005 of an 
architect for the design of the ECB™s future 

premises, the Governing Council decided to 

review the overall requirements and dimension 

of the project. This optimisation phase led 

to a significant reduction in the estimated 

construction costs. The Governing Council 

approved the revised design and launched the 

planning phase of the project in December 
2005. The ECB is committed to handling and 

monitoring this project with utmost care as 
regards the overall cost and the timely 

achievement of the various milestones.

CHAPTER 1ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS ANDMONETARY POLICY
18ECB Annual Report
2005Economic growth in the euro area moderated in 
the second half of 2004 and the first half of 

2005, partly on account of rising oil prices, a 

temporary slowdown in world trade and the 

lagged effects of the past appreciation of the 

euro. In the second half of 2005, however, the 

expansion of economic activity in the euro area 

strengthened again, benefiting from the 

persistently strong growth of global demand, 

robust growth in corporate earnings and very 

favourable financing conditions. Overall, real 

GDP Œ adjusted, albeit only partially, for the 

number of working days Œ rose by 1.4% in 

2005, compared with 1.8% in 2004 and 0.7% in 

2003. Against the background of high and 

volatile oil prices, economic activity thus 

proved to be relatively resilient in 2005.
Despite large increases in commodity and 
energy prices, domestic inflationary pressures 

remained contained against the backdrop of 

recovering but still relatively moderate 

economic growth. In particular, wage 

developments remained moderate. Inflationary 

pressures were also limited by favourable trends 

in prices of imported manufactured goods. 

Long-term inflation expectations in the euro 

area remained well-anchored at levels consistent 

with price stability. Nonetheless, headline 

inflation remained somewhat elevated in 2005, 

mainly owing to large increases in energy prices 

and, to a lesser extent, rises in administered 

prices and indirect taxes. Overall, annual HICP 

inflation stood at 2.2% in 2005 Œ slightly higher 

than the rate of 2.1% observed in the two 

preceding years. Upside risks continued to 

prevail, in particular with regard to potential 

second-round effects in wage and price-setting 

resulting from higher oil prices.
Monetary dynamics, which had started to 
strengthen in mid-2004, gained further 

momentum in 2005, before moderating 

somewhat in the last three months of the year. 

This increase in momentum partly reflected the 

stimulative effect of the prevailing low level of 

interest rates on demand for money and credit. 

Strong monetary growth contributed further to 

the already ample liquidity in the euro area, 1 MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS
pointing towards upside risks to price stability 

over the medium to longer term.
Against this background, the minimum bid rate 
on the Eurosystem™s main refinancing 

operations remained unchanged at the 

historically low level of 2% for most of the 

year. Early in the year the economic analysis 

pointed to underlying domestic inflationary 

pressures being contained. However, given an 

environment of strong monetary growth and 

ample liquidity, the Governing Council voiced 

a need for vigilance with regard to upside risks 

to price stability. Moreover, inflation projections 

were progressively revised upwards in the 

course of the year, in part because it was 

becoming apparent that the surge in oil prices 

would continue for longer than initially 

anticipated, confirming the existence of upside 

risks to price stability. By December 2005 the 

regular economic and monetary analyses and 

their cross-checking led to the view that an 

adjustment of the accommodative stance of 

monetary policy was warranted in order to 

address these risks. The Governing Council 

therefore decided on 1 December 2005 to 

increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis 

points, after having kept these rates unchanged 

for two and a half years. The minimum bid rate 

on the Eurosystem™s main refinancing 

operations was raised to 2.25%, while the rates 

on the deposit facility and the marginal lending 

facility were raised to 1.25% and 3.25% 

respectively (see Chart 1).
Looking more closely at monetary policy 
decisions in 2005, it is useful to divide the year 

into two parts. Starting with the first half of the 

year, the data available in the first few months 

of 2005 gave reason to believe that the 

weakening of real GDP growth observed in the 

second half of 2004 would be short-lived. 

However, largely as a result of persistently high 

and volatile oil prices, that assessment became 

somewhat more pessimistic in the second 

quarter of 2005, as heightened uncertainties 

with regard to the short-term evolution of 

domestic demand were identified. In June 

2005 the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
19ECB Annual Report
2005projections for real GDP growth were 
consequently revised downwards in comparison 

with those of December 2004. Annual real GDP 

growth was projected to moderate from 1.8% in 

2004 to between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2005, and to 

rise to between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2006. 

Forecasts by international and private 

organisations gave similar indications. 

Nevertheless, the conditions for a strengthening 

of economic activity were seen to have remained 

in place despite downside risks to growth 

related to low consumer confidence, high and 

volatile oil prices and global imbalances. On 

the external side, the growth of the world 

economy remained strong, thereby supporting 

euro area exports. On the domestic side, very 

favourable financing conditions, robust 

corporate earnings and business restructuring 

provided a positive environment for investment. 

Private consumption growth was expected to 

benefit from an anticipated increase in real 

disposable income in the context of stronger 

growth in employment and lower inflation. 

Revised statistics (which became available only 

later in the year) indicate that real GDP growth, 

while remaining moderate, actually recovered 
gradually in the first half of 2005 (from 0.2% in 
the last quarter of 2004 to 0.3% and 0.4% in the 

first and second quarters of 2005 respectively), 

mainly reflecting a stronger contribution from 

net exports.
Regarding price developments, annual HICP 
inflation eased to 2.0% on average in the first 

half of 2005, from around 2.3% in the second 

half of 2004. However, this decline mainly 

reflected base effects. The surge in oil prices 

continued to exert significant upward pressure 

on inflation dynamics. Nonetheless, wage 

developments remained moderate, so there 

was no evidence of underlying domestic 

inflationary pressures building up in the euro 

area. Accordingly, the Eurosystem staff 

macroeconomic projections of June 2005 

expected average annual HICP inflation to 

range between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2005 and 

between 0.9% and 2.1% in 2006. While 

underlying domestic inflationary pressures 

remained contained in the baseline scenario, 
upside risks to these projections were identified, 

which related, in particular, to future oil price 

developments and potential rises in indirect

2005taxes and administered prices. Moreover, the 
Governing Council emphasised that continued 

vigilance was required with regard to potential 

second-round effects in wage and price-setting 

that could result from higher oil prices.The strengthening of monetary dynamics, 
which had started in mid-2004, continued in the 

first half of 2005. In contrast with the previous 

period of strong monetary growth seen between 

2001 and mid-2003, monetary growth was 

driven by the most liquid components of M3 

and was associated, on the counterparts side, 

with an expansion of credit to the private sector. 

These developments reflected to a large extent 

the stimulative effect of the historically very 

low level of interest rates in the euro area. As a 

result of strong M3 growth in recent years, the 

stock of liquidity in the euro area was 

significantly greater than that needed to finance 

non-inflationary economic growth. Moreover, 

demand for loans for house purchase continued 
to be robust, contributing to strong house price 

dynamics in some regions of the euro area, 

while the annual growth rate of loans to non-

financial corporations gradually picked up 

again.All in all, the Governing Council came to the 
conclusion that, while it remained appropriate 

against the background of subdued domestic 

inflationary pressures to keep interest rates at 

their historically low levels, the cross-checking 

of the economic analysis with the monetary 

analysis supported the case for continued 

vigilance with regard to the materialisation of 

risks to price stability over the medium to 

longer term. In that context, developments in 

longer-term inflation expectations were 

monitored particularly closely.
In the second half of 2005 the economic analysis 
gradually confirmed the strengthening of 

economic activity that had been expected in the 

Eurosystem staff projections of June of that 

year. Real GDP growth in the euro area rose to 

0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 

2005. In addition, the conditions for continued 

growth identified in the previous Eurosystem 
staff projections remained in place. On that 
basis, the Eurosystem staff projections 

published in December 2005 pointed towards 

real GDP growth of between 1.2% and 1.6% in 

2005 and between 1.4% and 2.4% in both 2006 

and 2007, i.e. real GDP growth broadly in line 

with the projections made in June. Forecasts 

by international and private organisations 

painted a similar picture. At the same time, the 

outlook for economic activity remained subject 

to downside risks, related mainly to higher than 

expected oil prices, global imbalances and 

consumer confidence that, although increasing, 

remained weak.
With regard to price developments, HICP 
inflation rates rose to levels significantly above 

2% in the second half of 2005, peaking at 2.6% 

in September, mainly as a result of increases in 

energy prices. In addition, contrary to what had 

been expected earlier in 2005, it became 

increasingly apparent that the upward shift in 

oil prices would be fairly protracted. 

Accordingly, while the projections and forecasts 

available in early 2005 pointed to a relatively 

marked decline in HICP inflation in 2006, this 

view changed substantially in the course of the 

year. In the second half of 2005 it was seen as 

likely that average annual HICP inflation in 

2006 could remain above 2%, even on the 

assumption, as maintained, that wage increases 

would remain contained. Notably, the 

Eurosystem staff projections in December 2005 

saw average HICP inflation between 1.6% and 

2.6% in 2006 and between 1.4% and 2.6% in 

2007. Forecasts by international and private 

organisations offered a broadly similar picture. 

Moreover, the Governing Council confirmed 

that this scenario remained subject to previously 

identified upside risks.
In the second half of 2005 monetary analysis 
continued to point towards upside risks to price 

stability over the medium to longer term. 

Liquidity in the euro area was ample by 

all plausible measures. Furthermore, the 

strengthening of monetary growth seen from 

mid-2004 gained further momentum in the third 

quarter of 2005. The growth of the broad 
21ECB Annual Report
2005monetary aggregate M3 continued to be driven 
by its most liquid components in a context of 

very low interest rates. Furthermore, the 

expansion of borrowing Œ especially in the form 

of mortgage loans Œ remained very robust. In 

that context, price dynamics in a number of 

housing markets needed to be monitored 

closely.
Consequently, in the second half of 2005 the 
Governing Council expressed increasing 

concern about upside risks to price stability 

and emphasised the need for strong vigilance 

with regard to developments in longer-term 

inflation expectations. Indeed, by December an 

adjustment of the accommodative stance of 

monetary policy was warranted, taking into 

account the risks to price stability that had 
been identified in the economic analysis and 

confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary 

analysis. Against this background, the 

Governing Council decided on 1 December to 

increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis 

points. The Governing Council took the view 

that this decision would contribute to keeping 

medium to longer-term inflation expectations 

in the euro area soundly anchored at levels 

consistent with price stability. Such anchoring 

of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for 

monetary policy to offer ongoing support to 

economic growth in the euro area. After the 

decision of 1 December 2005 interest rates 
across the entire maturity spectrum in the euro 

area remained very low in both nominal and 

real terms. The monetary policy of the ECB 

thus continued to be accommodative and to 

lend considerable support to economic activity 

and job creation. The Governing Council 

stressed that it would continue to monitor all 

developments closely with regard to risks to 

price stability.
22ECB Annual Report
20052.1 THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT
WORLD ECONOMY CONTINUED ITS 
ROBUST EXPANSION
In 2005 the global economy continued to 

expand at a robust pace, slowing only slightly 

from the exceptionally high levels of growth 

observed in 2004. As in 2004, growth was 
especially strong in Asia. In particular, the 

Chinese economy continued to expand at a more 

or less unabated rate, while the Japanese economy 

gained momentum. Global activity continued to 

benefit from favourable financing conditions and 

robust corporate profitability in many countries. 

Global growth also continued to be supported by 

the strength of the US economy. 
Reflecting to a large extent the robust expansion 

of the global economy and the associated 

increase in the demand for energy, together 

with the progressive erosion of spare capacity 

throughout the oil supply chain, oil prices 

continued to rise through most of the year, with 

the price of Brent crude oil reaching a historical 

high of USD 67.5 per barrel in early September. 

The effect of elevated oil prices on global 

growth and inflation, however, appears so far to 

have been relatively muted. While the headline 

CPI was affected by the rise in the energy 

component, underlying inflationary pressures 

remained fairly well-contained in most 

countries. For the countries of the Organisation 

for Economic Co-operation and Development 

(OECD), annual headline CPI inflation was 

2.7% for the year as a whole. 
In the United States, economic activity expanded 
at a strong pace in 2005, with real GDP growing 

by 3.5% for the year as a whole. Growth in real 

GDP was underpinned by continued strong 

private consumption and investment spending, 

while net trade made a small negative contribution 

to growth. Private consumption remained brisk 

for most of the year, supported by favourable 

financing conditions, rising residential house 

prices and a continued improvement in 

employment conditions. With wage growth 

remaining relatively subdued, the rise in energy 
2 MONETARY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENTSprices moderated growth in real disposable 
income, contributing to a further decline in the 

already low personal savings rate. Meanwhile, 

household debt as a percentage of disposable 

income rose further in 2005. Business investment 

grew rapidly, buttressed by the favourable 

financing conditions and high levels 

of corporate profitability. Notwithstanding high 

oil prices and an increase in the cost of raw 

materials, modest wage increases, combined 

with vigorous, albeit moderating, growth in

during the year.
The external balance of the United States 
deteriorated further in 2005, with the current 

account deficit recording a historical high of 

6.4% of GDP. The growth of imports exceeded 

that of exports, leading to a further widening of 

the external deficit. 
Consumer prices rebounded temporarily in the 
third quarter of the year owing to the negative 

effects of hurricane-related disruptions and the 

prolonged rise in energy prices. However, price 

pressures receded by the end of the year, with 

annual CPI inflation standing at 3.4%. Inflation 

excluding energy and food remained relatively 

contained at 2.2%. Despite increases in oil 
prices and raw material costs, as well as the 

negative effects of the hurricanes, a dollar 

appreciation in nominal effective terms and a 

moderate increase in unit labour costs helped to 
keep price pressures in check, while, at the 

same time, inflation expectations remained 

contained.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 
of the Federal Reserve System increased the 

federal funds rate target by 200 basis points in 

2005. This increase was carried out in eight 

consecutive 25 basis point steps, bringing the 

target for the federal funds rate to 4.25% by the 

end of the year. In the statement following the 

last meeting of the year the FOMC noted that 

some further measured policy firming was 

likely to be necessary. As regards fiscal policy, 

the federal budget deficit declined in the fiscal 

year 2005 compared with 2004, primarily owing 

to increased corporate and personal tax 

revenues. The federal budget deficit stood at 

2.6% of GDP in the fiscal year 2005.  
In Japan, the economic recovery continued in 
2005, with real GDP growing at a rate above 

potential for the second consecutive year (2.8%, 

after 2.3% in 2004). Economic activity rapidly 

gained momentum at the start of 2005, supported 

by a strong expansion in private consumption 

and non-residential investment. The robust 
growth observed in consumer spending reflected 
continuing improvements in income and 

employment conditions, while the rapid 

expansion in non-residential capital expenditure 

was supported by favourable financing 

conditions, healthy corporate profits and 

improved financial positions, and the 

replacement of 
ageing capital stock. While 
domestic demand remained the main driver of 

economic growth in 2005, early signs of a 

recovery in exports (notably to China) became 

evident towards the end of the year. Over the 

year the banking sector benefited from the 

gradual recovery in macroeconomic conditions 

and improved credit risk conditions. 
Deflationary concerns eased further in 2005. 
The annual rate of change of consumer prices 

was slightly negative for the year as a whole 

(-0.3%, compared with 0.0% in 2004) and, 

towards the end of the year, the consumer price 

level excluding fresh food ceased falling. The 

Bank of Japan left its target for the outstanding 

balance on current accounts unchanged at around 

JPY 30-35 trillion in 2005. However, in late 

2005 the Bank of Japan indicated that it was 

likely to end its quantitative easing policy (which 

has been in place since March 2001) during the 

fiscal year 2006 if favourable projections for 

price developments materialise (the Bank of 

Japan has indicated that a continued increase in 

consumer prices is a prerequisite for the ending 
of its current monetary policy strategy). 
In non-Japan Asia, growth, while remaining 
strong, declined somewhat in 2005 from the 

very high rates recorded in the previous year,  

mainly owing to a slowdown in external demand, 

less robust domestic demand and higher oil 

prices. As regards price developments, elevated 

oil prices resulted in high inflation rates in a 

number of major economies in the region Œ 

with the exception of China Œ and monetary 

authorities started to gradually raise interest 

rates. The Chinese economy continued to 

grow strongly, supported by buoyant external 

demand and robust domestic demand. The 

macroeconomic tightening measures slowed 

investment momentum, particularly in the real 
24ECB Annual Report
2005estate sector, and stabilised inflation. The 
transition to a more flexible (but still tightly 

controlled) exchange rate regime in July 2005 

does not seem to have had any significant 

impact on the economy. In December, following 

China™s first comprehensive nationwide 

economic survey, China™s National Bureau of 

Statistics (NBS) revised upwards its GDP level 

for 2004 by CNY 2.3 trillion, or 16.8% of 

previously reported nominal GDP. The NBS 

also revised China™s GDP growth figures for 

1993 onwards, increasing them by an average 

of around 0.5 percentage point. This revision 

was prompted mainly by the improved 

measurement of China™s services sector, which 

turned out to be almost 50% larger than 

previously calculated. In 2005 as a whole 

Chinese GDP grew by 9.9%.
In Latin America, the economic situation 
continued to show a solid improvement, albeit 

at a slightly slower pace than in 2004. The 

region benefited from a highly favourable 

external environment and higher commodity 

prices, which allowed the reduction of financial 

vulnerabilities. Growth in the region, while 

driven by strong export growth, also benefited 

from improving demand for consumption and 

the opening-up of opportunities for new 

investment. Argentina experienced rapid real 

output growth, while the pace of economic 

expansion in the region™s two largest countries, 

Brazil and Mexico, was moderate. 
COMMODITY PRICES ROSE STRONGLY IN 2005
Oil prices soared for a second year in a row in 

2005. The price of Brent crude oil increased to 

a new all-time high of USD 67.5 per barrel in 

early September. Oil prices eased somewhat 

thereafter and reached USD 58 at the end of the 

year. For the year as a whole, the price of Brent 

crude oil averaged USD 55, which is 45% above 

the average for 2004. 
While oil demand growth eased in 2005, spare 
capacity throughout the oil supply chain was 

eroded further. Oil prices remained very 

sensitive to changes in supply and demand 

conditions. Low non-OPEC oil supply growth 
contributed to the tightening of oil market 
fundamentals. Production growth in the 

Commonwealth of Independent States (the 

main source of non-OPEC supply growth in 

previous years) eased and North Sea oil 

production decreased in 2005. In addition, 

extreme weather (i.e. hurricanes) severely 

disrupted production in the US Gulf of Mexico. 

Demand for OPEC™s oil, the ﬁcall on OPECﬂ, 

increased as a result. However, the increase in 

OPEC production was unable to ease prices, as 

dwindling spare OPEC production capacity 

kept market participants concerned about the 

lack of a safety cushion against the possibility 
of future supply disruptions. 
Rising demand for refined oil products squeezed 
spare refining capacity and bottlenecks also 

increased because of the lack of sufficient 

capacity to process heavy and sour grades of 

crude oil. The quality mismatch between the 

marginal barrel of oil supplied and demanded 

also supported the prices of light and sweet 

grades of crude oil such as Brent. Geopolitical 

concerns regarding the security of future oil 

supplies put additional pressure on oil prices, 
as threats (re-)emerged in various oil-producing 

countries. Chart 3

2005. 2.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
M3 DYNAMICS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN IN 
AN ENVIRONMENT OF LOW INTEREST RATES
In 2005 monetary growth strengthened 

substantially, driven by the stimulative effect of 

the low level of interest rates in the euro area. At 

the same time, the offsetting, dampening effect 

on M3 growth associated with the normalisation 

of euro area residents™ portfolio allocation 

behaviour (following their strong preference for 

liquidity between 2001 and mid-2003) lost 

momentum, especially in the first half of the 

year. Overall, the strengthening of monetary 

growth during 2005 added to the already ample 

liquidity situation in the euro area. After increasing in the second half of 2004, M3 
growth remained robust in the first few months 

of 2005. From April 2005 the strengthening of 

monetary growth resumed in earnest, with the 

annual growth rate of M3 rising to 8.0% in the 

third quarter of 2005. Shorter-term monetary 

dynamics were particularly strong in the middle 

of the year, with the six-month annualised 

growth rate of M3 reaching, in September 2005, 

its highest level since the start of Stage Three 

of EMU. In the last quarter of 2005 monetary 

growth showed some signs of moderation, 

although M3 still grew at a robust rate of 7.8% 

on an annual basis. On the components side, the largest contribution 
to overall M3 growth came from the most liquid 

assets within M3 contained in the narrow 

aggregate M1. On the counterparts side, 

monetary expansion was driven largely by MFI 

credit to the private sector. Both these 

developments suggest that the prevailing low 

level of interest rates in the euro area, implying 

low opportunity costs of holding liquid balances 

and reduced borrowing costs, was a key driving 

factor behind monetary dynamics in 2005.
These developments also imply that the 
substantial strengthening in M3 growth as from 

mid-2004 was of a different nature to the 

strengthening observed between 2001 and early 

2003. During the earlier period, which was 

characterised by heightened economic and 

financial uncertainty, the increase in annual M3 

growth was accompanied by a steady decline 

in the annual rate of growth of loans to the 

private sector (see Chart 4). By contrast, the 

strengthening in monetary dynamics observed 

since mid-2004 has been associated with an 
increase in growth of loans to the private sector. 

It is thus more likely to reflect fundamental 

factors, in particular the low level of interest 

rates, rather than the impact of portfolio shifts 

induced by volatility in financial markets, such 

as those seen between 2001 and mid-2003. (For 

an analysis of the driving forces behind M3 

growth since mid-2004, see Box 1 entitled ﬁThe 

changing nature of strong monetary dynamics 

in recent yearsﬂ.) 
The normalisation of the portfolio allocation 
behaviour of euro area residents following their 

heightened preference for liquidity between 

2001 and mid-2003 continued throughout 2005, 
although only at a very slow pace. Portfolios 

were shifted from money into longer-term 

assets, exerting some dampening effect on M3 

growth, although of a much more modest size 

than would have been expected on the basis of 

past regularities. In particular, the euro area 

money-holding sector continued to demonstrate 

a reluctance to invest in foreign assets, which 

contrasted with the willingness of foreigners to 
invest in euro area assets. However, towards the 
26ECB Annual Report
2005end of the year there were tentative signs of a 
possible resumption of the unwinding of past 

portfolio shifts into money, as reflected in the 

behaviour of MFI net external assets. To the 

extent that this unwinding dampens monetary 

growth, it would imply that the official M3 

growth series tends to understate the underlying 

rate of monetary expansion. 
As was the case in 2003 and 2004, the main 
contribution to annual M3 growth in 2005 came 

from its most liquid components contained in 

M1 (see Chart 5). The continued strong overall 

contribution from M1 concealed some 

differences in the development of the underlying 

components. On the one hand, the annual 

growth rate of holdings of currency in 

circulation moderated over the course of 2005, 

to stand at 13.7% in December 2005, down 

from 18.5% in January 2005. This development 

was in line with expectations of a drawn-out 

process of adjustment of holdings of banknotes 
and coins following the euro cash changeover 

in January 2002. On the other hand, 2005 

witnessed a strengthening in the annual growth 

rate of overnight deposits, supported by the 
very low opportunity costs of holding these 
instruments in an environment of very low 

interest rates. The average interest rate on 

overnight deposits for households and non-

financial corporations remained broadly 

unchanged from its level at the end of 2003, 

standing at 0.81% at the end of 2005 (see 

Chart 6). At the same time, financial 

innovations, such as highly liquid and highly 

remunerated internet deposit accounts, which 

are partly recorded as overnight deposits, may 

also have played a role.
While M1 made the largest overall contribution 
to M3 growth in 2005, the strengthening of 

annual M3 growth in 2005 was in large part 

attributable to developments in short-term 

deposits other than overnight deposits (see 

Chart 5). Their average contribution to annual 

M3 growth was around 2.1 percentage points in 

2005, almost double the figure for 2004. This 

large contribution reflected a sustained increase 

in the annual growth rate of short-term time 

deposits (i.e. deposits with an agreed maturity 

of up to and including two years), while that of 

short-term savings deposits (i.e. deposits

Overall, the relative strength of demand for 

short-term deposits other than overnight 

deposits is likely to reflect the low opportunity 

cost of holding these relatively poorly 

remunerated but also relatively liquid assets in 

a low interest rate environment. 
With regard to marketable instruments, their 
average contribution to the annual growth rate 

of M3 only increased slightly to 0.6 percentage 

point in 2005, from 0.5 percentage point in the 
previous year. This increase concealed divergent 

developments in the components. On the one 

hand, the annual growth rate of money market 

fund shares/units remained at a relatively 

subdued level. As these assets are often held by 

households and firms as a safe savings vehicle 

in times of economic and financial uncertainty, 

their moderate growth was consistent with an 

ongoing but slow normalisation of the portfolio 

allocation behaviour of euro area residents in 

2005. On the other hand, demand for debt 
securities with a maturity of up to two years 
strengthened significantly, possibly reflecting 

the emergence of new structured products 

which combine these securities with derivative 

instruments that involve some exposure to 

developments in equity markets, while 

protecting investors from large capital losses. 

The average annual growth rate of repurchase 

agreements also increased strongly in 2005 

compared with the previous year, although 

growth in these instruments can be highly 

volatile. 
A sectoral breakdown of short-term deposits 
and repurchase agreements (i.e. the largest 

aggregation of components of M3 for which a 

reliable sectoral breakdown is available) 

suggests that the strengthening in monetary 

growth over the course of 2005 was, to a large 

extent, attributable to deposit holdings of 

financial intermediaries other than MFIs (see 

Chart 7). In particular, non-monetary financial 

intermediaries excluding insurance corporations 

and pension funds (known as other financial

2005intermediaries or OFIs) were in large part 
responsible for the upward M3 dynamics 

observed during most of 2005, despite 

accounting for only a small part of the total 

stock of money holdings. The increased 

importance of OFIs in recent years as a money- 

holding sector may, to a large extent, reflect 

financial deregulation and liberalisation as well 

as the associated development of deeper and 

more liquid securities markets.
At the same time, the contribution of deposits 

held by non-financial corporations to the 

growth in short-term deposits and repurchase 

agreements also increased somewhat compared 

with 2004. In the case of non-financial 

corporations, these holdings are typically 
concentrated in the most liquid types of deposits, 
suggesting that they are generally held 

for transaction purposes and associated with 

short-term financing and working capital needs. 

In addition, the stronger growth of corporate 

deposits might also reflect precautionary 

motives, as non-financial corporations may hold 

liquid deposits to avoid opportunity costs related 

to foregone investment possibilities and/or the 

costs of obtaining external finance, should 

unanticipated cash needs arise. Finally, data on the sectoral breakdown of 

short-term deposits and repurchase agreements 

indicate that households remained the main 

contributors to the strong growth of these 

instruments throughout 2005. 
Box 1
THE CHANGING NATURE OF STRONG MONETARY DYNAMICS IN RECENT YEARS
Monetary developments in recent years have been characterised by two periods of significant 

strengthening in the annual rate of growth of M3. The first period starts with the doubling of 

annual M3 growth from rates of around 4% to around 8% during 2001 and ends with a further 

rise to almost 9% in the first half of 2003. The second period begins in the middle of 2004, 

since when annual M3 growth rates have risen from around 5% to a peak of 8% in the third 

quarter of 2005. This box uses information contained in the components and counterparts of 

M3 and the sectoral breakdown of deposits to illustrate the differing nature of the strengthening 

of monetary growth in the two periods. 
The main drivers of stronger M3 growth between 2001 and the first half of 2003 were the 
heightened geopolitical, economic and, especially, financial uncertainties that prevailed at the 

time, associated with a series of large shocks to the world economy.
1 These shocks included a 
substantial fall in equity prices, the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, 

a spate of accounting scandals on both sides of the Atlantic in the aftermath of the equity 

market correction, and the wars in Afghanistan in late 2001 and in Iraq in early 2003. Seeking 

a ﬁsafe havenﬂ for savings in the face of these shocks, the money-holding sector (mainly 

households and non-financial corporations) shifted their wealth portfolios from risky and 

longer-term assets into safe and liquid monetary assets, thus raising monetary growth. In the 

period since mid-2004, by contrast, strong monetary growth appears to have been more 

fundamental in nature, driven by the low level of interest rates and hence the low opportunity 

costs of holding money. 
A detailed look at the components of M3 reveals that the portfolio shifts from risky assets into 
money between 2001 and mid-2003 boosted the inflows into debt securities with a maturity of 
1 See the article entitled ﬁMoney demand and uncertaintyﬂ in the October 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.  
29ECB Annual Report
2005up to two years and money market fund 
shares/units, which are held by households 

and firms in order to ﬁparkﬂ liquidity at times 

of heightened uncertainty. As a consequence, 

developments in these two components exerted 

a significant influence on overall monetary 

dynamics, while the contribution of the most 

liquid components played a subordinate role. 

By contrast, high M3 growth since the middle 

of 2004 has been driven by the most liquid 

components contained in the narrow aggregate 

M1. At the same time, the annual flow into 

debt securities with a maturity of up to two 

years and money market fund shares/units has 

been modest (see Chart A). 
Turning to the counterparts of M3, the 
differing nature of strong monetary growth in 

the two periods is apparent from developments 

in loans to the private sector (see Chart 4 in 

the main text). Between 2001 and mid-2003, 

the strengthening of M3 growth was 

accompanied by a steady decline in the annual 

rate of growth of loans to the private sector. In other words, during the prolonged period of 

heightened economic and financial uncertainty the growth rates of M3 and private borrowing 

moved in opposite directions. By contrast, the period since the middle of 2004 has been 

characterised by a strengthening of both monetary growth and growth in loans to the private 

sector, reflecting the low opportunity costs of holding monetary assets and the favourable 

financing conditions implied by the low level of interest rates.

2005Chart B illustrates the essential role played by the strong capital flows into the euro area in the 
strengthening of monetary dynamics from 2001 to mid-2003 (represented by the changes in net 

external assets over this period). In the environment of heightened financial market and 

geopolitical uncertainty, euro area residents repatriated funds previously invested in foreign 

equity, as they searched for a safe haven from the shocks affecting the global economy. In the 

period since mid-2004, the change in the net external asset position has played a far more 

modest role in the strengthening of monetary dynamics, even though it has remained positive. 

While this suggests that the euro area money-holding sector has remained reluctant to invest in 

foreign assets (at least relative to non-euro area residents™ demand for euro area assets), the 

impact of this on M3 growth has been modest when compared with the impetus provided by 

loan expansion.
As regards the overall development of the counterparts of M3, the period between 2001 and 
mid-2003 can be characterised by a shift from risky longer-term assets into shorter-term 

monetary assets as illustrated by the modest flow into MFI longer-term financial liabilities. In 

the period since mid-2004, in the context of an expansion of the overall consolidated MFI 

balance sheet, substantial inflows into MFI longer-term financial liabilities could be observed 

in parallel to strong monetary dynamics.
Looking finally at the sectoral breakdown of deposits across all maturities (the aggregate for 

which a sectoral breakdown is available since 1999, which includes longer-term deposits outside 

M3), it can be seen that, during the first period, the strengthening of demand for deposits 

(including repurchase agreements) originated predominantly in the household sector (see 

Chart C). This reflects households™ increased 

risk aversion and liquidity preference after the 

bursting of the stock market bubble and the 

emergence of geopolitical uncertainties. In the 

second period, the strengthening in deposit 

growth across all maturities is characterised 

by a rising contribution from the ﬁother non-

monetary financial intermediariesﬂ sector, 

with the impact of household deposits being 
modest. However, the data for short-term 

deposits and repurchase agreements (i.e. those 

components of M3 for which a sectoral 

breakdown is available but which have only 

been collected since 2003) indicate that the 

contribution of households in this period is 
more pronounced for deposits contained in M3 
than for overall deposit holdings. 
In summary, the analysis of the sectoral 

breakdown of deposits, and the components 

and counterparts of M3, confirms that the two 

periods of strong M3 growth in recent years, 

from 2001 to the first half of 2003 and since 

mid-2004, were of a different nature. In

2005particular, the strength of the growth in the most liquid components and the dynamism of 
demand for credit suggest that during the latter period a key driving factor of monetary growth 

has been the low level of interest rates. With regard to the implications for price stability, the 

earlier surge in M3 growth, in an environment of exceptional financial and geopolitical 

uncertainty leading to a heightened preference for liquidity, appears to reflect changes in 

portfolio allocation behaviour and can be seen as relatively benign in terms of the outlook for 

price developments, while the different nature of the strong monetary developments since mid-

2004 implies a higher risk of inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term. 
GROWTH OF MFI CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR 

STRENGTHENED FURTHER
On the counterparts side, monetary dynamics 

were driven by a continuous strengthening in 

MFI credit to the private sector (see Chart 8). 

This reflected a strong increase in the annual 
growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector, 

in an environment of low interest rates, 

improved credit supply conditions (as reported 

by the bank lending survey for the euro area) 

and strong asset price rises, particularly in the 

housing market. At the end of 2005 the annual 

growth rate of loans to the private sector had 

increased to 9.1%, from 7.1% in December 

2004. The dynamism of MFI loans to the private 

sector in 2005 was broadly based across the 

main money-holding sectors. While the largest 

contribution to private sector loan growth was 

attributable to the household sector, reflecting 

mainly loans for house purchase, the continued 

strengthening in loan growth also reflected, to a 

large extent, developments in loans to both 

non-financial corporations and other financial 

intermediaries. 
Among the other counterparts of M3, the 
dynamics of MFI longer-term financial 

liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) 

remained robust in 2005, after strengthening 
substantially in the previous year. This pointed 

to a continued inclination on the part of the 

euro area money-holding sector to invest in 

longer-term euro assets. However, given the 

lack of an acceleration in MFI longer-term 

financial liabilities in 2005 compared with 

2004, the developments also suggested some 

loss in the momentum of the normalisation of 

euro area residents™ portfolio allocation 
behaviour, which was characterised by a shift 
from liquid monetary assets into instruments 

with a longer maturity. 
Developments in MFI net external assets were, 
for the greater part of 2005, still characterised 

by positive annual flows, which exerted upward 

pressure on M3 dynamics (see Chart 8). Balance 

of payments data suggest that this phenomenon 

reflected the greater propensity of non-euro area 

residents to invest in euro area equity and bonds 

compared with that of euro area residents to

2005invest abroad. During the first half of the year, 
this investment pattern may have been related 

to developments in the euro exchange rate.
1 The second half of the year instead saw a 
succession of month-on-month net capital 

outflows from the euro area, possibly due to the 

further widening of the interest rate differential 

between the United States and the euro area at 

the short end of the yield curve. This may have 

been associated with some unwinding of past 
portfolio shifts into monetary assets, with such 

funds being reinvested in riskier foreign 

securities, following an apparent decline in the 

reluctance of euro area investors to invest 

abroad. These developments gradually reduced 

the annual flow of euro area MFI net external 

assets, eventually leading this counterpart to 

turn negative in November 2005, for the first 

time since December 2001. Towards the end of 

the year, the dampening effect on M3 growth 

stemming from the developments in net external 

assets and longer-term financial liabilities more 

than offset the strengthening in credit growth.
LIQUIDITY REMAINED AMPLE
The strengthening of M3 dynamics over the 

course of 2005 added to the already ample stock 
of liquidity in the euro area. Available estimates 

of the liquidity situation (as represented by the 

nominal money gap and the real money gap), 

which attempt to measure the liquidity available 

beyond the amount needed to finance non-

inflationary growth, rose further in 2005 (see 

Chart 9). The nominal money gap is defined as 

the difference between the actual level of M3 and 

the level of M3 that would have resulted from 

constant M3 growth at its reference value of 4½% 

since December 1998, while the real money gap 

corrects the nominal money gap for the excess 

liquidity that has been absorbed by past price 

developments (i.e. the cumulated deviation of 

inflation rates from the ECB™s definition of price 

stability). Towards the end of the year, both 

measures showed some sign of stabilisation, 

albeit at still high levels.
The ECB has also regularly published money 
gaps constructed on the basis of an adjusted M3

2005extent arbitrary, the levels of these measures 
are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and 

should thus be treated with caution. Moreover, 

it cannot be entirely ruled out that the current 

liquidity situation, to some extent, reflects a 

permanent change in the money demand 

behaviour of economic agents, i.e. a structurally 

higher liquidity preference and, hence, an 

increase in the desired level of money holdings. 

Finally, the estimate of M3 corrected for 

portfolio shifts is surrounded by a considerable 

degree of uncertainty related to the estimation 

of the corrections made to M3 itself.  
These considerable uncertainties are well 
reflected in the wide range of estimates shown 

by the four liquidity measures discussed here. 

However, notwithstanding these uncertainties, 

the overall picture painted by these measures is 

that liquidity conditions in the euro area 

remained ample over the course of 2005. Viewed 

from a medium to longer-term perspective, 

ample liquidity poses risks to price stability. In 

addition, strong monetary and credit growth in a 

context of already ample liquidity implies a 

need to monitor asset price developments 

closely, particularly in housing markets, given 

the potential for misalignments to emerge. 
AFTER REMAINING STABLE, MONEY MARKET 

INTEREST RATES ROSE TOWARDS THE END OF THE 

YEAR For most of 2005 the Governing Council 

decided to keep its key policy rates unchanged. 

On 1 December 2005 key ECB interest rates 

were increased by 25 basis points but remained 

at low levels by historical standards. Money 

market rates at the short end of the yield curve 

(such as the one-month EURIBOR shown in 

Chart 10) closely mirrored this development in 

the key ECB interest rates. Money market 

interest rates remained broadly stable at levels 

slightly above 2% until November, when they 

rose amid expectations of an increase in key 

ECB interest rates. Money market interest rates at longer maturities 
remained broadly stable in the first quarter of 

2005, at levels somewhat above rates at shorter 
maturities. In the second quarter of 2005, the 
twelve-month EURIBOR started to decline, 

with the result that by the end of June it had 

reached the same level as Œ and had briefly even 

fallen below Œ rates at the short end of the 

money market yield curve. This downward 

movement reversed towards the end of July 

2005, and, from the start of the fourth quarter, 

the upward trend in longer-maturity rates 

accelerated, a development which persisted into 

the beginning of 2006. 
These developments were reflected in the slope 
of the money market yield curve. Towards the 

end of May 2005 some expectations of a 

lowering of key ECB interest rates triggered a 

downward movement in rates, especially at the 

longer end of the money market yield curve. 

The slope of the money market yield curve Œ as 

measured by the difference between the twelve-

month and one-month EURIBOR Œ became 
negative in June and reached a trough of 

-5 basis points on 23 June 2005. However, 

market expectations of a further reduction in 

key ECB interest rates subsided quickly as 

prospects for euro area economic growth 

improved. This resulted in a steepening of the 

money market yield curve, which continued 

until mid-November, when short-term rates 

reacted to the rising expectations of an increase 

in key policy rates and the yield curve flattened 

somewhat. After the turn of the year, shorter-

term money market rates broadly stabilised, 

whereas longer-term rates continued to increase. 

As a consequence, the slope of the yield curve 

steepened in January 2006 to reach levels 

comparable to those observed in mid-November. 

In February, however, this movement reversed 

with shorter-term rates increasing while longer-

term rates remained broadly stable, leaving 

the one-month and twelve-month EURIBOR 

standing at 2.55% and 2.96% respectively on 

24 February. As a result, the slope of the money 

market yield curve declined again by 

10 basis points during February. 
The implied volatility derived from options 
on three-month EURIBOR futures contracts 

declined substantially between January and May

2005, indicating that market participants 
attached very low uncertainty to the expected 

future path of short-term interest rates. However, 

from this low level, volatility rose on two 

subsequent occasions: in June 2005 and, more 

markedly, during the fourth quarter of 2005. On 

both occasions, the increase in volatility was 

associated with the emergence of market 

expectations of a change in the key ECB interest 

rates. Towards the end of the year and, in 

particular, after the Governing Council™s decision 

to increase interest rates on 1 December, 

volatility first declined and then stabilised. At 

the beginning of 2006, volatility declined again, 

reaching very low levels compared with the level 

observed in 2005 (see Chart 11). 
LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS RECORDED HISTORICAL 

LOWS IN 2005
In 2005 long-term bond yields in the euro area 

recorded the lowest levels seen in a century.
3 Following the historically low level of 3.1% in 
September 2005, euro area ten-year government 
bond yields increased to 3.4% by the end of the 

year, still around 35 basis points below the 

levels prevailing at the end of 2004 (see 

Chart 12). 
Overall, the low levels of euro area long-term 
bond yields in 2005 reflected perceptions 

among market participants of subdued long-

term inflationary pressures and low real yields 

(see Chart 13). Long-term inflation expectations 

Œ as reflected in break-even inflation rates Œ 

fluctuated within a rather narrow range in the 

course of 2005 and thus remained well-anchored 

at relatively low levels. Real long-term bond 

yields appeared to have been affected not only 

by downward revisions in long-term growth

 2)expectations, especially in the context of the 
upsurge in oil prices (see Box 2 entitled ﬁThe 

impact of increasing oil prices on bond yields 
and stock prices: a historical comparison for 
the euro area and the United Statesﬂ), but also 
by the high demand for government bonds.
By the end of the first quarter, long-term bond 
yields in the euro area recorded their highest 
level in 2005, namely 3.8%, mirroring, in 

particular, rising US long-term government 

bond yields amid increased price pressures and 

generally favourable data releases with regard 

to the economic outlook in the United States. From the end of the first quarter to the end 
of the third, euro area long-term bond yields 

resumed their tendency to decline, reaching a 

historically low level of 3.1% by the end of the 

third quarter of 2005. This decline in long-term 

bond yields reflected a fall in real yields up to 

the end of the third quarter, whereas inflationary 
concerns remained subdued, despite the upsurge 
in oil prices (see Chart 13). The decline in real 

yields seemed only in part to be attributable to 

macroeconomic fundamentals, i.e. long-term 

growth prospects, and to a larger extent to other 

factors relating primarily to the unusually high 

demand for long-term bonds.
4 In the euro area, pension funds in particular increased their 

holdings of long-term bonds, motivated in part 

by regulatory changes and the increased need 

for pension funds to match their assets with 
their (long-term) liabilities. From a longer-term 

perspective, another structural development 

which may have contributed to the low level of 

bond yields is the increasing savings activity of 

the baby boom generation and the ageing 

population in general. Speculative behaviour, 

such as yield curve carry trades, i.e. borrowing 

at low short-term interest rates and investing in

2005longer-term instruments, may have amplified 
the decline in long-term bond yields. 
Low long-term government bond yields were 
observed in all major markets. This may suggest 

that bond yields in the euro area declined not 
only on account of domestic factors but also, 

and to a large extent, on account of an increased 

demand for euro area bonds in a global context. 

In that respect, a strengthening of demand for 

bonds by oil-exporting countries and continued 

high demand for bonds by Asian and other 

central banks, together with a growing foreign 

exchange reserve diversification, may have 

played a role. In addition, it cannot be ruled out 

that the low levels of long-term bond yields in 

2005 were also linked to abundant liquidity in 

the global financial system after an extended 

period of monetary policy accommodation.  
By the end of the third quarter of 2005, the 
decline in nominal and real bond yields in the 
euro area had come to an end. The rise in long-

term nominal and index-linked bond yields 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 suggests that 

markets expected a somewhat increased pace of 

economic growth in the euro area in the near 

term. The rise in long-term nominal and real 

bond yields in the euro area also reflected 

upward revisions by market participants with 

regard to the future path of short-term interest 

rates over the near to medium term, as suggested 

by the gradual upward shift at the corresponding 

maturity segments of the implied forward yield 

curve in the fourth quarter of 2005. 
As a result of these developments, nominal ten-
year government bond yields in the euro area 

ended the year at 3.4%, around 35 basis points 

lower than at the end of 2004. In the United 

States, by contrast, ten-year government bond 

yields increased by around 20 basis points over 
the same period. Consequently, the differential 
between ten-year interest rates in the United 

States and in the euro area widened significantly 

over 2005. Having stood at 55 basis points at 

the end of 2004, it peaked at 120 basis points at 

the start of the fourth quarter of 2005. This 

decoupling of long-term interest rates reflected 

diverging views among market participants 

about the macroeconomic prospects and 

short-term interest rate expectations in the 

two economies. Longer-term real bond yields 

declined in the euro area in 2005, whereas in 

the United States they rose significantly. 
In 2005 long-term break-even inflation rates 
fluctuated within a narrow range of between 

1.9% and 2.2% in the euro area, as shown in 

Chart 13, despite the upsurge in oil prices. The 

break-even inflation rate based on the 2012 

maturity ended the year at 2.0%, which 

corresponded to a decline of 20 basis points 

compared with the end of 2004.
In 2005 implied bond market volatility Œ which 
provides evidence of market views about the 

ranges within which bond yields are expected 

to move in the near term Œ remained at the low 

levels observed in the second half of 2004. This 

indicates that in 2005 market participants 

expected fairly limited near-term yield 

fluctuations in the euro area bond market. 
In the first two months of 2006, long-term 
government bond yields in global markets 

increased. On 24 February ten-year government 

bond yields in the euro area stood 20 basis 
points above the prevailing levels at the end of 

2005. This increase was reflected in a rise in 

longer-term indexed-link bond yields, whereas 

longer-term inflation expectations, as measured 

by break-even inflation rates, remained broadly 

unchanged. 37ECB Annual Report
2005Box 2
THE IMPACT OF INCREASING OIL PRICES ON BOND YIELDS AND STOCK PRICES: A HISTORICAL 
COMPARISON FOR THE EURO AREA AND THE UNITED STATES
This box focuses on the impact of higher oil prices on market expectations of economic growth 

and inflation as reflected in long-term bond yields and stock prices in the euro area and the 

United States. The reactions of the financial markets to the most recent surge in oil prices are 

compared with those of previous episodes of high oil prices. Quite in contrast to past experience, 

the reaction of euro area and US bond yields and stock prices has been rather muted over the 

past year. 
The ﬁFisher hypothesisﬂ helps to clarify why and how bond yields react to oil price changes. It 
says that long-term nominal interest rates can be decomposed into an expected real interest rate 

and the premium that investors require to compensate for expected inflation over the life of the 

bond. The real interest rate component can, in turn, be linked to the economy™s average growth 

prospects over the maturity of the bond as perceived by bond market investors, among other 

things. Higher oil prices usually dampen the short to medium-term growth prospects of non-oil 

producing economies and at the same time increase inflationary pressures and thus inflation 

expectations. In theory, the overall reaction of nominal bond yields to higher oil prices through 

the ﬁexpectations channelﬂ is therefore ambiguous, as it depends on the relative strength of its 

impact on growth expectations and inflation expectations. 
In the past, nominal bond yields have tended to increase during oil price spikes, as surging 
inflation and inflation expectations clearly offset downward pressures on real rates that are 

associated with the concurrent economic downswing. The first three rows in Table A show the 

changes in ten-year bond yields during the 12 months leading up to the two oil price peaks 

reached during the oil shocks of the 1970s (January 1974 and November 1979) and the spike 

caused by the Gulf war in 1990 (October).
1 Indeed, ten-year government bond yields surged on 
both sides of the Atlantic, by between 90 and 180 basis points in the case of Germany and 

between 50 and 150 basis points in the case of the United States. During those historical 

episodes, actual inflation rose considerably in both economies, triggering heightened inflation 

expectations among investors. It is most likely that the economic recession that characterised 

those episodes also exerted downward pressure on the real interest rate. Therefore, the resulting 

sharp increases in nominal bond yields suggest 

that the higher inflation expectations more 

than compensated for the probable declines in 

long-term real interest rates.
During the most recent oil price spike, 
however, long-term interest rates reacted very 

differently, particularly in the euro area (see 

the fourth row in Table A). In the 12 months 

prior to the oil price peak in September 2005, 
ten-year government bond yields declined by

38ECB Annual Report
2005around 90 basis points in the euro area and increased by 20 basis points in the United States. 
This seems mainly to reflect the fact that, compared with previous oil price shocks, actual and 

expected inflation have remained rather stable this time. Indeed, as also shown in Table A, ten-

year break-even inflation rates Œ although they are not a perfect measure of inflation expectations 

Œ have changed only slightly over the period concerned.
2 Moreover, it seems that the higher oil 
prices have also led to some downward revisions in market participants™ growth expectations 

and, accordingly, to lower long-term real interest rates. During the period leading up to the oil 

price peak in September 2005, euro area ten-year index-linked bonds declined by about 

80 basis points, whereas in the United States there has been very little evidence of a similar 

reaction (see Table A). The decline in euro area long-term nominal bond yields over this period 

therefore mainly reflects lower real bond yields, with inflation expectations remaining basically 

unchanged. Furthermore, better credibility and predictability of central banks may have 

contributed to reducing uncertainty, thereby also contributing to the muted movements in bond 

yields over the past year. However, explaining the link between the recent behaviour of long-

term bond yields and oil prices only through the oil price impact on market participants™ growth 

and inflation expectations neglects several other factors which could have directly affected 

both variables.
3 Stock prices may also be affected by oil price developments. In theory, the price of a share is 
equal to the sum of the expected future dividends discounted by the risk-free interest rate and 

the risk premium that investors require for holding it. Expected future dividends can be replaced 

by earnings expectations in the valuation, if it is assumed that a certain proportion of the 

earnings will be paid out in dividends. Changes in oil prices may have an impact on all three 

components. For instance, higher energy costs may lead to slower expected earnings growth for 

some corporations, but also to higher expected earnings growth for those companies that tend 

to benefit from oil price increases, for example oil exploration companies. Long-term real 

government bond yields are often used as a proxy for the real risk-free rate, and changes in oil 

prices can also influence this component as 
explained above. Finally, in periods of high oil 

prices, investors usually become more 

uncertain about the outlook for corporate 

earnings which, in turn, may lead to demand 

for higher equity risk premia. Even though 

some of the components may work against 

each other, high and rising oil prices generally 

tend to be bad news for stocks, as they are 

usually overshadowed by the future negative 

impact on the company™s perceived 

profitability (see the first three rows of 

Table B). 
Table B depicts the annual return on the euro area and US stock markets for the same four 
periods of oil price spikes. It also highlights some striking differences in the stock price 
2 The index-linked bond market is a rather new feature and thus this decomposition is not possible for the three earlier period
s of oil price peaks.3 For example, it is likely that recent developments in long-term real interest rates were also driven by several factors deter
mining risk premia embedded in bond yields. See the box entitled ﬁRecent developments in long-term real interest ratesﬂ in the April 2005 i
ssue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.

2005performance during the most recent period and previous periods leading up to the oil price 
peaks. Whereas the two oil price shocks in the 1970s and the spike in the early 1990s coincided 

with relatively poor returns for stock market investors, the period between September 2004 and 

September 2005 saw stock prices increase, particularly in the euro area. In the most recent 

episode, market participants therefore seem to have attached less importance to the oil price-

related factors that tend to weigh on stock prices. 
A reason may be that compared with the 1970s and early 1980s, mature economies are far less 
dependent on oil, and that the price increases of oil recently have been more demand-driven, 

spurred by overall healthy global economic activity. Furthermore, risks of escalations in the 

wage-bargaining process and wage-inflation spirals appear more limited than in previous oil 

price shocks. With regard to relative performance, the stronger increase in the euro area stock 

market than in the US stock market in the period 2004-05 reflects, to some extent, the greater 

decline in long-term real interest rates in the euro area (see again Table A).
To sum up, contrary to the historical episodes of oil price peaks, euro area and US bond and 
stock markets reacted in a more contained manner during the latest oil price surge. The decline 

in the real yields offered on euro area index-linked bonds may indicate that the recent height in 

oil prices may have brought about some concerns about the euro area economic growth outlook, 

although other structural and short-term factors may have played a role in this period. As 

regards the stable break-even inflation rate in the euro area, it cannot be excluded that central 

banks™ increased credibility in delivering a low and stable inflation environment has played a 

key role in the observed resilience of financial asset prices to the most recent oil price shock. 
EURO AREA STOCK PRICES CONTINUED TO 

INCREASE IN 2005 In 2005 euro area stock prices continued the 
upward trend which began in early 2003 (see 

Chart 14). The Dow Jones EURO STOXX index 

ended the year with a gain of 23% compared 

with the end of the previous year, thus 

underperforming the Nikkei 225 index but 

outperforming the Standard & Poor™s 500 index, 

which moved sidewards in 2005. Apart from 

relative interest rate developments, the US 

stock market™s underperformance can to some 

extent also be explained by exchange rate 

developments: in 2005 the US dollar appreciated 

by 13% and 15% vis-à-vis the euro and the 

Japanese yen respectively.
The strong stock market performance in the 
euro area in 2005 seemed to reflect several 

factors, in particular lower long-term interest 

rates, which act as a discount factor for future 

expected cash flows, and sustained double-digit 
growth in actual earnings per share (see 
Chart 15). Stock market analysts generally 

revised their earnings estimates upwards. 

Continued low stock market volatility, which 

suggested low uncertainty among market 

participants about the near-term stock market 

outlook, also seemed to provide a favourable 

environment for stock price developments.
Potentially negative factors, such as the less 
optimistic economic outlook resulting from the 
surge in oil prices (see Box 2), have only 

partially attenuated stock price gains. 
Turning to a sectoral breakdown, the increase 
in euro area stock prices in 2005 was most 

noticeable in the oil and gas sectors (in line 

with the strong growth of reported earnings 

resulting, to a large extent, from oil price 

developments), and in the financial sector.

The consumer services and healthcare sectors 

also underperformed the overall index in 2005. 

The underperformance of these sectors suggests 

that the earnings outlook of companies more 

dependent on private consumption was 

comparatively weak in 2005. 
In early 2006 global stock prices continued to 
rise. Up to 24 February 2006 the Dow Jones 

EURO STOXX index increased by 8% compared 

with the end of 2005. The Standard & Poor™s 

500 and the Nikkei 225 rose by less over the 

same period. These stock price increases can be 

explained by overall solid corporate profit 

growth, together with an increase in investors™ 

appetite for equity.
STRONG HOUSEHOLD DEMAND FOR FINANCE 
In 2005 household borrowing continued the 

upward trend observed since mid-2003, 

reflecting robust growth in loans for house 

purchase and increasingly strong growth in 

consumer credit. The annual rate of growth of 

MFI loans to households increased to 9.4% in 

December 2005, from 7.9% at the end of 2004. 

At the same time, developments at the euro 

area level tend to obscure differences across 

countries (see Box 3 on ﬁDifferences in 

household loan growth across the euro area 

countriesﬂ). The dynamics of loans to households from other 
financial intermediaries, which in the previous 

year had been much stronger than the dynamics 

of loans from MFIs, slowed considerably in 

2005, resulting in a convergence of the annual 

growth rate of total loans to households with 

that of MFI loans to households.41ECB Annual Report
2005may have also been related to some easing of 
credit standards applied by banks to the approval 

of loans for house purchase in the first and third 

quarters of 2005. This easing of credit standards 

and the strong demand partly reflected an 

increasingly favourable assessment of housing 

market prospects by both banks and borrowers. 
Despite relatively subdued growth in nominal 
consumption spending at the euro area

level, the annual growth rate of consumer credit 

followed an upward trend in 2005, reaching a 

rate of 7.5% in the last quarter of 2005. This 

strengthening is in line with the low interest 

rates on consumer credit prevailing in 2005 and 

is also corroborated by the results of the bank 

lending survey for the euro area, which point to 

an easing of credit conditions. Looking at the breakdown of MFI loans to 
households by purpose, the strength of household 

borrowing seems to have become more broadly 

based across different loan categories during 

2005 compared with the previous year. This 

notwithstanding, loan dynamics continued to be 
driven largely by the robust demand for loans for 

house purchase (see Chart 16). It is likely that 

the ongoing strength of mortgage borrowing was 

associated with both the further reduction of 

mortgage interest rates throughout the euro area 

and the dynamic housing market developments 

witnessed in many regions (see Section 2.3 of 

this chapter). Mortgage lending rates continued to decline in 
2005, from the already low levels reached in 

previous years (see Chart 17). For instance, 

MFI interest rates on new loans for house 

purchase with an initial rate fixation of over 

five and under ten years declined by 13 basis 

points over the course of the year, to stand at 

3.7% in December 2005. In addition, the results of the bank lending 
survey for the euro area suggest that the robust 

growth in loans for house purchase, albeit 

mainly driven by strong demand by households,

DIFFERENCES IN HOUSEHOLD LOAN GROWTH ACROSS THE EURO AREA COUNTRIES
The annual growth rate of MFI loans to households in the euro area has been strengthening 
at a reasonably steady pace since mid-2003, to stand at 9.4% at the end of 2005. However, 

these robust loan dynamics at the euro area level tend to conceal sizeable differences in the 

growth rates across individual euro area countries. This box discusses these differences in 

terms of statistical dispersion measures and provides some explanations of the cross-country 

variation.
Measuring differences in household loan growth across the euro area countries
The differences in household loan growth 

across countries can be analysed along several 

lines. Chart A shows the range between the 

highest and lowest annual growth rate of total 

MFI loans to households among the euro area 

countries in the period since the start of Stage 

Three of EMU. This range has typically been 

very large, exceeding 30 percentage points on 

several occasions. While annual growth rates 

in the countries experiencing the most rapid 

expansion of loans fluctuated between 25% 

and 40%, in those countries witnessing the 

slowest growth over the reference period 

household borrowing dynamics proved very 

subdued, occasionally falling below zero. 

Comparing this with the growth rates of 

between 5% and 10% recorded for the euro 

area as a whole suggests that the countries 

accounting for the highest growth rates were ﬁoutliersﬂ and/or have only a relatively small 

weight in the euro area-wide outstanding amount of household loans.
Taking into account the weight of the individual countries in the euro area aggregate, Chart B 
shows the cross-country dispersion of annual loan growth over the period 1999-2005 as 

measured by the weighted coefficient of variation. This measure has the advantage that it is less 

subject to the influence of outliers. Nonetheless, in broad terms the evolution of the two 

dispersion measures since 1999 is quite similar: after peaking in mid-2002, the cross-country 

dispersion of household loan growth appears to have declined somewhat throughout 2003 and 

broadly stabilised thereafter at levels above those seen in 1999.
Total MFI loans to households can be decomposed into loans for house purchase, consumer 
credit and other lending. As shown in Chart B, the weighted coefficient of variation for 

mortgage loans increased until the end of 2002 but has since remained fairly stable. Given the 

high share of mortgage loans in the total stock of MFI loans to households (close to 70% at the 

end of 2005), the dispersion in mortgage loan growth largely determines the dispersion in 

overall household loan growth. The weighted coefficient of variation for growth in consumer

2005credit and other lending has been much more 
erratic in the past than that for growth in 

mortgage loans. However, it also seems to 

have stabilised recently, albeit at a 

significantly higher level than the weighted 

coefficient of variation for growth in mortgage 

loans. Household loan growth and differences in 

debt levels across the euro area countries
The differences in household loan growth 

across countries in past years can reflect a 

variety of factors, including differences in the 

financial position of households and the 

degree of interest rate convergence prior to 

Monetary Union; differences in the structure 

of financial markets Œ especially for mortgage 

credit; and differences in key economic 

determinants of household borrowing Œ 

notably the dynamics of real estate markets and house prices.
Chart C plots the average annual growth of total MFI loans to households across the euro area 
countries in the period between the fourth quarter of 1998 and the fourth quarter of 2005 

against the level of household indebtedness in the individual countries at the end of 1998. Euro 

area countries at the start of Stage Three of EMU displayed considerable variation in household 

indebtedness as measured by the ratio of the stock of MFI loans to GDP. The chart illustrates 

that the countries with initially lower debt ratios have, on average, experienced stronger loan 

growth than those countries with a higher 

initial debt ratio. Part of the discrepancies in 

average loan growth witnessed since 1999 

could therefore reflect a ﬁconvergenceﬂ 

process of debt ratios as interest rate and 
inflation levels converge.
The structure of financial markets also varied 
substantially across countries in 1999 and is 

thus likely to have contributed to different 

initial levels of household indebtedness. In 

the case of mortgage markets such variation is 

for instance reflected in the differences of the 

available products with regard to factors such 

as the length of contracts, the use of fixed or 

variable interest rates, as well as average 

and maximum loan-to-value ratios. While 

financial market liberalisation and increased 

competition between financial intermediaries 

have been pervasive in recent years, the impact

44ECB Annual Report
2005of such structural changes in the financial 
markets has been more profound in some euro 

area countries than in others, on account of 

both their starting-point and the pace and 

scope of reforms made. This has resulted, for 

instance, in a sharper reduction of interest rate 

margins and other borrowing costs, as well as 

a wider range of innovative and diversified 

mortgage products Œ for example, the 

availability of 30 or even 50-year loans and 

the appearance of ﬁaccordionﬂ variable rate 

and ﬁamortisation freeﬂ mortgages Œ in some 

countries than in others, thus enabling more 

households to access financing for house 

purchase. Cross-country variation in 

household borrowing dynamics may, in part, 

thus reflect the heterogeneity of both the level 

and rate of change of the sophistication and 

depth of financial markets. 
While Monetary Union has resulted in a uniform short-term interest rate across countries, 
cross-country variation in household borrowing dynamics also reflects the heterogeneity of 

macroeconomic developments across euro area countries. This has been particularly marked in 

developments in real estate markets. As shown in Chart D, several countries (for example, 

Ireland and Spain) have experienced very rapid house price increases since 1999, while others 

(such as Germany and Austria) have been characterised by stable house prices. Since mortgage 

credit is the largest component of overall household borrowing and is naturally related to the 

dynamism of housing market developments, the substantial differences in the evolution of real 

estate prices are reflected in the heterogeneity of household loan growth rates. Differences in 

consumer credit may in turn stem from diverse patterns of household disposable income and 

private consumption across countries.
To sum up, there were substantial differences in the annual growth of total MFI loans to 
households among the euro area countries between 1999 and 2005. The evidence also shows 

that these cross-country differences have been persistent. While the convergence in the level of 

inflation and interest rates before the start of EMU Œ and thus the impact of moving to a 

credible low inflation environment at the start of Stage Three Œ may help to explain the cross-

country variation, the heterogeneous experience since the introduction of the euro, especially 

with regard to housing market developments and changes in financial market structure, has also 

played an important role. Of course, other factors may also have contributed to the variation

in household loan growth across countries. They include for instance differences in income and 

private consumption developments as well as in demographics and attitudes towards owner- 

occupied housing across countries, while differences in tax deductibility of interest payments, 

capital gains taxes on housing gains and securitisation of mortgages may also have played a 

role. Differing advances made in modelling in the financial industry, which have increased the 

ability of banks to assess market developments and credit risk, may also explain part of the 

differences.

2005RISING HOUSEHOLD DEBTAs a result of the continued strong borrowing 
dynamics, the ratio of household debt to 

disposable income edged up further in 2005 

(see Chart 18). Nonetheless, household 

indebtedness in the euro area remained below 

that seen in other industrialised countries, such 

as the United States, the United Kingdom and 

Japan. Moreover, despite the rise in 

indebtedness, the total debt service burden of 

the household sector (the ratio of interest 

payments plus principal repayments to 

disposable income) remained broadly 

unchanged. The higher debt repayment burden 

associated with the strong loan growth observed 

in recent years has been more or less offset by 

the lower share of income that needs to be 

devoted to interest payments in a low interest 

rate environment. 
This notwithstanding, the rise in indebtedness has increased households™ exposure to changes 

in interest rates, income and asset prices. 
Moreover, when assessing these aggregate 
figures, it should be taken into account that 

they represent an average for the euro area-wide 

household sector, and that the debt service ratio 

for households which have an outstanding 

mortgage would be higher. In addition, the debt 

service burden may vary across euro area 

countries as well as across households in 

different income categories. Finally, some 

uncertainty relates to the fact that the share of 

existing mortgage debt exposed to changes in 

prevailing interest rate conditions depends on 

the specific features of the underlying mortgage 

contracts, which vary substantially across the 

euro area. CONTINUED LOW REAL COST OF EXTERNAL

Notes: The real cost of the external financing of non-financial

bank lending, the cost of debt securities and the cost of equity, 

based on their respective amounts outstanding and deflated by 

inflation expectations (see Box 4 in the March 2005 issue of the 

ECB™s Monthly Bulletin). The introduction of harmonised MFI 

lending rates at the beginning of 2003 led to a break in the 

statistical series.12

2005be low by historical standards throughout 2005 
(see Chart 19).
5 There was a marked increase in 
the debt financing of non-financial corporations 

on account of its very low cost, while the 

issuance of quoted shares increased only 

slightly in the second half of the year.
Regarding the components of the real cost of 
external financing, real MFI lending rates to 

non-financial corporations decreased slightly 

up to the second quarter of 2005 (see Chart 17). 

This reflected the further decline in short and 

medium-term government bond yields in the 

first half of the year. The rise in government 

bond yields in the second half of the year was 

only partly reflected in MFI lending rate 

developments. In the fourth quarter, the real 

cost of bank lending remained unchanged at 
low levels after a slight rise in the third quarter. 

Overall, the low real cost of bank lending 

reflects a positive credit risk assessment of 

non-financial corporations by banks. This is 

also indicated by the results of the bank lending 

survey for the euro area, which indicated a net 

easing of or broadly unchanged credit standards 

for enterprises in 2005.
The real cost of market-based debt was more 
volatile than the real cost of bank lending 

during 2005. From a low in the first quarter of 

2005, the real cost of market-based debt of non-

financial corporations increased up to the 

middle of the second quarter. This was related 

to the rise in corporate bond spreads, which 

was driven mainly by a series of firm-specific 

events affecting, primarily, the automobile 

industry. Thereafter, the real cost of market-

based debt fell up to the third quarter, mainly 

owing to the partial reversal in the second and 

third quarters of the rise in corporate bond 

spreads, but rose again in the fourth quarter of 

2005. This was due largely to the rise in market 

interest rates in the second half of the year and 

the increase in corporate bond spreads in the 

fourth quarter. By the end of 2005, its level was 

somewhat higher than at the end of 2004, but 

still very low by historical standards.
In 2005 the real cost of quoted equity of non-financial corporations remained at considerably 

higher levels than the real cost of debt financing, 

and was broadly in line with its average for the 

period since 1995. In the first half of the year, 

the real cost of quoted equity rose somewhat. 

This may have reflected the fact that the higher 

than expected profitability of non-financial 

corporations was not fully reflected in stock 

market prices or that there has been a rise in the 

equity risk premium. Towards the end of the 

year, however, mainly as a result of favourable 

stock market developments, the real cost of 

equity fell to around the same level as at the 

beginning of the year. 
RISE IN THE DEMAND FOR EXTERNAL FINANCING 

BY NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS  
Non-financial corporations increased their 

demand for external financing considerably in 

2005. This occurred within the context of sound 

corporate profitability levels in 2005 (and the 

associated rise in internal financing 

possibilities), after a strong rise in profitability 

in 2003 and 2004, as indicated by aggregated 

financial statements of listed non-financial 

corporations in the euro area (see Chart 20).
6 A 
key factor in profitability improvements were 

cuts in operating expenses relative to sales. 

While rising corporate earnings growth was 

anticipated for the 12-month period ahead 

between February and October 2005, towards 

the end of 2005 stock market-based profitability 

measures indicated that the profitability growth 

of large listed corporations was expected to 

moderate slightly over the next 12 months. At 

the same time, expected corporate profitability 

levels remained relatively high.
In the course of 2005 the real annual growth 
rate of external financing of non-financial 

corporations rose considerably, to 2.8% in the

external financing of euro area non-financial corporations, see

the euro areaﬂ in the November 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly 

Bulletin. 47ECB Annual Report
2005fourth quarter, from 1.3% at the end of 2004. 
This development was driven mainly by a strong 

increase in the contribution of loans, whereas 

the rise in the contributions of debt securities 

and quoted shares was more modest (see 

Chart 21).
The annual growth rate of MFI loans to non-
financial corporations increased to 8.0% in 

December, from 5.4% at the end of 2004. In the 

first half of the year, the rise was largely due to 

developments in short-term loans. However, in 

the second half of the year, the annual growth 

rate of long-term loans picked up strongly. 

While short-term loans are often used as 

working capital, long-term loans are generally 

more closely linked with business investment. 

In line with this development, the October 2005 

and January 2006 bank lending surveys reported 

that fixed investment contributed to an increase 

in the net demand for loans or credit lines by 

enterprises. In addition, the annual growth rate 

of gross fixed capital formation increased 

considerably in the second and third quarters

of 2005. In this respect, non-financial 
corporations may have wished to take advantage 

of the low cost of financing and the relatively 

accommodative credit standards for business 

expenditure.  
Evidence available for the period up to the end 
of the third quarter of 2005 indicated that, by 

contrast with MFI loans, the annual rate of 
change of non-MFI loans to non-financial 

corporations remained negative. This may still 

be attributable to changes in the tax regulations 

of one euro area country, which gave rise to 

some replacement of inter-company loans with 

unquoted equity. 
The annual growth rate of debt securities issued 
by non-financial corporations remained modest  

overall in 2005. After recovering in the first 

quarter, partly in relation to a rise in merger 

and acquisition activity, the annual growth rate 

declined in the second and third quarters and 

remained modest in the last quarter of 2005. 

Possible explanations for the generally relatively 
48ECB Annual Report
2005low debt securities net issuance activity are a 
substitution of debt securities by loan financing 

as well as the rise in the profitability of large 

listed enterprises. At the same time, while the 

net issuance of debt securities at fixed rates 

was subdued in 2005, non-financial corporations 

strongly increased their long-term debt 

securities issuance at variable rates. Moreover, 

2005 was characterised by a high level of 

redemptions of debt securities issued in the 
period 1999-2001, when the euro area corporate 

bond market was booming. 
The annual growth rate of quoted shares issued 
by non-financial corporations increased slightly 

in 2005, but remained subdued overall, partly 

as a result of the fact that the real cost of equity 

was significantly higher than that of debt 

financing. However, there was a slight rise in 

the quoted shares issuance of non-financial 

corporations in the second half of the year.
As regards the developments in the balance 
sheet position of non-financial corporations in 

the euro area, the rise in the demand for debt 
financing by non-financial corporations led to 

a slight increase in the debt ratios of non-
financial corporations in 2005, to 63% of GDP 

at the end of the fourth quarter (see Chart 22). 

This might indicate that the period of intense 
balance sheet restructuring of non-financial 

corporations came to an end in 2005. At the 

same time, however, it is likely that the situation 

varies considerably at the individual firm 

level.
The slight rise in the debt ratios has to be 
assessed in conjunction with the improved 

profitability of non-financial corporations and 

the continued low real cost of external financing 

by historical standards. In addition, net interest 

payments of non-financial corporations on their 

MFI loans and deposits (as a percentage of 
GDP) remained at a low level.
All in all, despite the slight rise in debt ratios, the balance sheet position of non-financial 

corporations seems, overall, to have improved 

in 2005, mainly owing to sound profitability.

Compared with the data compiled on the basis of the annual

mainly because of the inclusion of loans granted by banks

2.3 PRICE DEVELOPMENTS
Overall HICP inflation in the euro area averaged 

2.2% in 2005, following 2.1% in the previous 

two years (see Table 1). Underlying domestic 

inflationary pressures remained low in 2005, 

partly reflecting the continuation of wage 

moderation in a context of subdued labour 

market developments. Higher oil prices were 

the main factor exerting upward pressures on 

prices, notably in the second half of the year. 

However, there were only limited signs of a 

pass-through of past oil price increases to prices 

at a later stage of the production chain. At the 

same time, inflation was dampened by the

In addition, the contribution of net indirect 
taxation and administered prices to HICP 

inflation was slightly lower in 2005 than in 

2004. HEADLINE INFLATION MAINLY AFFECTED BY OIL 

PRICE DEVELOPMENTSThe profile of overall HICP inflation was 

significantly affected in 2005 by developments 

in the energy component, as oil prices rose 

strongly (see Chart 23). The average price of a 

barrel of Brent crude oil in euro increased by 

around 45% in 2005 compared with 2004. As 

a consequence, the annual rate of growth in 

energy prices was 10.1% in 2005, after 4.5% in 

2004. The contribution of energy prices to 

the average annual inflation rate in 2005, 

0.8 percentage point, was the highest in five 

years (see Chart 24).
Headline inflation remained close to 2.0% in 
the first half of 2005. In the second half of the 

year, largely reflecting developments in oil 

prices, inflation rose to a peak of 2.6% in 
September before declining to 2.2% by the end 

of 2005. The impact of the rise in oil prices on 

inflation was also reflected in the revisions of 

inflation expectations in the course of 2005. 

For example, inflation expectations for 2005 
included in the ECB Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) increased from 1.9% in 

the first quarter to 2.2% in the last quarter of 

2005. By contrast, SPF long-term inflation 

expectations remained unchanged at 1.9% in 

2005. This pattern was also broadly shared by 

other survey indicators for short and long-term 

inflation expectations.
The less volatile components of the HICP 
played an important role in containing the 

upward pressures on overall inflation emanating 

from oil prices. After declining in the first half 

of 2005, the annual rate of growth of the HICP 

excluding energy and unprocessed food levelled 

off in the second half of the year. Overall, the 

annual rate of growth of the HICP excluding 

energy and unprocessed food was 1.5% in 

2005, down from 2.1% in 2004. Part of this 

decline is explained by the lower contribution 

of net indirect taxation and administered 

prices to overall inflation in 2005, of around 

0.4 percentage point, compared with around 

0.6 percentage point in 2004.7 For example, 
processed food price inflation benefited from 

favourable base effects in the first half of 2005,

prices, see the box entitled ﬁThe impact of developments in

countries in the first half of 2004. These base 

effects were only partially offset by a tobacco 

tax increase in Germany in September 2005. 

Overall, the annual rate of change of processed 

food prices was 2.0% in 2005, significantly 

below the rate of 3.4% in 2004. The annual rate 

of change in non-energy industrial goods prices 

also declined, from 0.8% in 2004 to 0.3% in 

2005. This historically very low contribution of 

non-energy industrial goods prices may reflect 

a downward impact on prices stemming from 

strong external competition and the lagged 

effects of the past appreciation of the euro. 

Despite some short-term variability owing to 

some volatile components, such as package 
holidays and transportation services, services 
price inflation declined in the course of 2005 

and was 2.3% on average in 2005, compared 

with 2.6% in 2004. Overall, in 2005, there was 

little evidence of significant indirect effects 

from energy price increases.
The fact that overall HICP inflation was just 
above 2% in 2005 for the fifth consecutive 

year highlights the relevance of analysing the 

determinants of the persistence of inflation. 

Box 4 presents the main conclusions of the 

Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network on 

inflation persistence and price-setting behaviour 

in the euro area.51ECB Annual Report
2005Box 4
RESEARCH NETWORK ON INFLATION PERSISTENCE AND PRICE-SETTING BEHAVIOUR IN THE EURO 
AREA The Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network (IPN) was created in 2003 to analyse the 

patterns, determinants and implications of inflation persistence and price-setting behaviour in 

the euro area and in its member countries. Inflation persistence refers to the tendency of 

inflation to converge only slowly to its long-run value following a shock. The IPN finalised its 

work in 2005. 
The IPN was a joint research project between all the Eurosystem central banks. It used an 
unprecedented dataset, covering a large amount of information on macroeconomic and sectoral 

variables and on the price-setting behaviour of individual firms. The individual price records 

underlying the construction of both consumer and producer price indices were made available 

for a large number of euro area countries. In addition, the IPN conducted surveys on price-

setting behaviour in nine countries. Taken together, these databases constitute a unique 

opportunity to understand the behaviour of price-setters. They are unprecedented, even by 

international standards, as the coverage of the data available to the IPN extends well beyond 

that available for other economies.
The IPN presented its preliminary results at academic conferences in order to receive early 
feedback from the academic community that could be taken into account in its subsequent 

work. In the course of 2005 presentations were given at the Annual Meeting of the American 

Economic Association in Philadelphia and at the Annual Congress of the European Economic 

Association in Amsterdam. A large number of research papers have been published in the 

ECB™s Working Paper series, with more to follow in the coming months, and some have been 

released or are forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals. 
As to price-setting, the key insights from the IPN are the following. Prices in the euro area are 
rather sticky, changing on average only once every year.
1 When price adjustments do occur, they 
tend to be quite large at around 8-10% in the retail sector and about 5% in the producer sector. 

Interestingly, price increases and price decreases are almost equally frequent and of similar size, 

with the notable exception of the services sector in which small price increases are common and 

decreases are very rare. There is marked heterogeneity across sectors, in particular with respect 

to the frequency of price adjustments. Furthermore, the frequency, size and direction of price 

changes depend on macroeconomic conditions (such as the inflation rate) and time factors (like 

seasonality) and are responsive to specific events (such as VAT changes).
Surveys showed that most firms undertake price reviews both at regular intervals and in 
response to changing economic conditions. Price reviews are more frequent than price changes, 

which may be because the reviews suggest that there is no need to change prices or because of 

factors preventing price changes even if the reviews suggest doing so. The surveys conducted 

by the IPN found evidence of some impediments to changing prices, with explicit or implicit 

contracts between firms and their customers and the strategic interactions among firms being 

the most important factors. 
1 This is much less frequent than price changes in the United States, for example. For a more detailed overview of these result
s, see 
the article entitled ﬁPrice-setting behaviour in the euro areaﬂ in the November 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
52ECB Annual Report
2005A further key finding of the IPN is that the degree of inflation persistence increases with the 
level of aggregation. Individual or highly disaggregated price series are, on average, much less 

persistent than aggregate series. Empirical estimates point to a moderate degree of inflation 

persistence under the current monetary policy regime; it is important, however, to take account 

of earlier occasional shifts in the mean level of inflation in estimates that cover extended 

periods. Nevertheless, even when this is done, such estimates continue to be surrounded by a 

fair degree of uncertainty.
Overall, the results of the IPN have considerably advanced the knowledge of inflation 
persistence and price-setting behaviour in the euro area. There are important policy implications 

and consequences for model-building, as several of the most commonly used assumptions in 

macroeconomic models with microeconomic foundations are strongly challenged by the new 

findings. With respect to policy, the results highlight how important it is for central banks to 

ensure that inflation expectations are well-anchored, as this will reduce inflation persistence 

and thus facilitate the conduct of monetary policy.
DYNAMIC RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES
Euro area residential property prices, which are 

not included in the measurement of the HICP, 

continued to rise in 2005, increasing by 7.7% 

(year on year) in the first half of 2005 compared 

with 7.0% for 2004 as a whole (see Chart 25). 

This strong overall growth, however, masked 

considerable diversity at the country level. The 

recent dynamism largely reflects buoyant 

residential property markets in Spain, France 

and Italy, whereas residential property prices 

slightly declined in Germany. Available 

quarterly data for the second half of 2005 

continued to show strong price increases in the 

case of Spain and France, albeit at a slightly 

more moderate pace than before.LIMITED INDIRECT EFFECTS AT LATER STAGES OF 

THE PRODUCTION CHAIN
The annual rate of growth of industrial producer 

prices (excluding construction) in the euro area 

was 4.1% in 2005, significantly above the 2.3% 

rate recorded in 2004 (see Chart 26). This 

increase was mainly due to energy prices as the 

annual rate of growth of industrial producer 

prices excluding energy (and construction) 

stood at 1.8% in 2005, compared with 2.0% in 

2004. This overall stability in the annual growth rate 
of industrial producer prices excluding energy 
masked diverging developments at the sub-
sector level. The annual growth rate of capital 

goods prices stood at 1.3% in 2005, compared 

with 0.7% in 2004. These upward pressures 

were partly offset by a strong deceleration in 

intermediate goods prices, partly reflecting 

non-oil raw material price developments and 

also lagged effects of the past euro appreciation. 

The annual growth rate of intermediate goods 

prices dropped from 5.5% in January 2005 to 

1.9% in December 2005 and averaged 2.9% in 

2005 compared with 3.5% in 2004.
There was little sign of significant price 
pressures building up at later stages of the 

production chain. Producer prices of consumer 

goods grew by 1.1% in 2005, down from 1.3% 

in 2004. Weak consumer demand, increased 

external competition and the past appreciation 

of the euro may have prevented firms from 

passing on increases in energy and, to a lesser 

extent, intermediate goods prices.
MODERATE DEVELOPMENTS IN LABOUR COSTS IN 

2005Growth in compensation per employee 

showed a significant decline in the first three 

quarters of 2005, with an average annual 

growth rate of 1.5% compared with 2.0% in 

2004 (see Table 2). This decline was mainly 

driven by wage developments in industry

in the services sector (see Chart 27). However, 

within the services sector, developments 

diverged. While growth in compensation per 

employee in the market-related services sector 

increased in the first three quarters of 2005, 

with an average annual growth rate of 1.8% 

compared with 1.5% in 2004, the growth in the 

non-market-related services sector declined 
significantly, with an average annual growth 
rate of 0.8% compared with 2.1% in 2004. 
Other labour cost indicators also suggest 
moderate wage growth. The annual growth rate 

of negotiated wages was 2.1% in 2005, 

unchanged compared with 2004. In addition, 

anecdotal evidence from wage-bargaining 

agreements signed in the period up to late 2005

the emergence of significant second-round 

effects from higher oil prices beyond the 

mechanical effects of wage-indexation schemes 

in countries where they exist. Overall, with 

ongoing moderate real GDP growth and limited 

pressure in euro area labour markets, wage 

developments remained subdued in 2005.
Despite the fall in wage growth, unit labour 
cost growth remained unchanged in 2005. Unit 

labour costs grew by an average of 0.9% in the 

first three quarters of 2005, as in 2004. This 

reflected the decline in productivity growth 

rates, which averaged 0.6% in the first three 

quarters of 2005, compared with 1.1% in 

2004.2.4 OUTPUT, DEMAND AND LABOUR MARKET 
DEVELOPMENTS SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 2005
Real GDP growth in the euro area (partly 
adjusted for the number of working days) was 

1.4% in 2005, below the 1.8% recorded in the 

previous year and the trend rate of growth in 

potential output (see Table 3). The lower than 

expected  performance in 2005, continuing the 

moderate growth in economic activity observed 

since mid-2004, reflected oil price strength, the 

lagged effects of the appreciation of the euro in 

2004 and a temporary slowdown in global 

demand in the first half of 2005.
The pace of the recovery that started in the third 
quarter of 2003, following the protracted period 

of slow growth from mid-2001 to mid-2003, 

has been relatively weak compared with 

recovery periods in the early 1980s and early 

1990s. Several factors may explain this. First, 

unlike previous recoveries, the current phase

2005has been marked by very strong oil price 
increases and a significant appreciation of the 

euro. Second, there is tentative evidence that 

potential output growth has declined over recent 

years, mainly as a result of lower labour 

productivity growth. Third, it should also be 

taken into account that the slowdown preceding 

the recovery was relatively shallow. To the 

extent that the strength of the rebound tends to 

depend on the depth of the previous downturn, 

it is not surprising that the current recovery is 

to some extent less dynamic than previous 

recoveries.
8The moderation in growth in 2005 as a whole 

can be attributed to a lower contribution of both 

the external sector and internal domestic 

demand. Growth in both domestic demand and 

exports in 2005 was below expectations at the 

end of 2004 (see Chart 28). 
As regards the domestic contribution to growth, 
growth in private consumption continued to be 

subdued in 2005 (see Table 3). This was partly 

a result of low increases in real disposable 

income, reflecting restrained growth in nominal 

income and the rise in energy prices. These 

effects were not offset by lower household 

savings, possibly because employment 

expectations remained relatively pessimistic. 

Concerns about the sustainability of pension 

and healthcare systems may also have played a 

role, together with the fact that low-income 

earners, with a higher marginal propensity to 

consume, may have been disproportionately 

affected by weak income growth and shocks to 

the prices of necessity goods and services.

Investment growth in the first half of 2005 was 
significantly below that observed in the second 

half of 2004. This deceleration was mainly due 

to lower growth in non-construction investment, 

predominantly attributable to a negative 

development in the transportation sector.
However, gross fixed capital formation grew 
more strongly from mid-2005 onwards. Factors 

supporting investment in 2005 included 

improvements in business efficiency, robust 

corporate earnings, the very favourable financing 

conditions and growth in global demand.
A sectoral breakdown of economic growth in 2005 
shows that value added in industry (excluding 

construction), construction and the services sector 

contributed positively to growth. Value added 

growth in the market services sector was higher 

than in 2004. However, in industry excluding 

construction it was lower. Industrial and services 

confidence deteriorated in the first half of 

2005, although it improved in the second half (see 

Chart 29). The services sector has significantly 

increased in importance over recent decades and 

its contribution to the euro area economy is 

expected to grow further in the years to come. 

Box 5 describes the sectoral composition of euro 

area growth, providing a more detailed analysis of 

developments in the services sector.
Box 5
THE SECTORAL COMPOSITION OF EURO AREA GROWTH
This box provides an overview of sectoral structure of the euro area economy and of sectoral 

shifts in recent years. It also discusses the contributions to growth of value added in the euro 

area and to volatility by the main economic sectors in recent years and explores whether the 

relative weakness of the current recovery in comparison with former upswings is linked to 

developments in specific sectors.
The sectoral breakdown of value added highlights the prominent role of the services sector in 
the euro area (see Chart A). With a share of around 70%, the services sector represents by far 

the largest economic sector in the euro area. The industrial sector, which comprises mainly 

manufacturing (but also mining and quarrying, and the electricity, gas and water supply 

industries), accounts for around 20% of euro area value added. Construction and agriculture 

have shares of only 6% and 2%, respectively.
57ECB Annual Report
2005The services sector, in turn, is generally broken down further into three main categories of 
roughly equal size, namely trade and transportation, financial and business services and a 

sector that comprises mainly government-related services (see Chart B). Although this 

breakdown does not provide for any strict separation between private and public services, the 

categories comprising trade and transportation, and financial and business services are usually 

referred to as the market services sectors.
In line with trend developments generally observed for developed economies, the euro area 
economy has undergone significant structural changes. This is reflected in the fact that the 

services sector has increased significantly in importance, while the share of the industrial 

sector has declined continuously. Since 1996, for instance, the share of the services sector in 

total value added has risen by around 3 percentage points, while that of the industrial sector has 

decreased by 2 percentage points. A number of factors may account for the rising share of the 

services sector. These include a shift in consumer demand towards services as income rises, the 

liberalisation of the services sector, and the increasing participation of women in the labour 

market, which implies some shifts from household to services activities. 
The changes in the share of value added accounted for by individual euro area sectors reflect 
significant differences in sectoral growth performance. As regards business services, the 

outsourcing of some activities by firms in the industrial sector may also partly explain the rise 

in the services sector. This development also strengthens ties between the two sectors. The table 

shows that, on average since the beginning of the 1990s, real gross value added in the euro area 

has increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter. Services grew at the same rate, driven in particular 

by growth in market services. Industry (excluding construction) expanded by 0.3%, on average, 

while construction recorded the lowest rate of increase, at just 0.1%. As a result of their size 

and strong performance, services were the main contributor to the rise in euro area value added. 

On average since the mid-1990s, services have contributed 0.4 percentage point to the growth 

of euro area value added, compared with an average contribution of just 0.1 percentage point 

by the industrial sector.

2005Significant differences between sectors also arise in terms of the volatility of growth in value 
added. Growth in value added in services displays far lower volatility than that in other sectors 

(as measured in terms of the standard deviation). Nevertheless, on account of its size, the 

services sector has on average contributed about as much to the volatility of growth in value 

added since the mid-1990s as the industrial sector.
In view of the substantial differences between the average growth performance of the main sectors 

in the euro area, the question arises as to the extent to which sectoral developments may have 

contributed to the relative weakness of the current recovery when put in a historical perspective. 

The recovery that started in mid-2003 lost momentum in the second year of the upswing, before 

gaining further strength in the third quarter of 2005. Charts C and D compare the developments in 

the services and industrial sectors in the current recovery with those in the two previous upswings.

59ECB Annual Report
2005developments in any specific sector. In fact, the pattern of the relative performance in both the 
industrial and services sectors followed that of overall GDP. In both sectors, there were no clear 

divergences in the first year of the current recovery in comparison with average developments in 

the two previous recoveries. In the second year of the recovery, however, the growth of value added 

in both sectors was weaker than on average in the two previous recoveries. The charts moreover 

illustrate the much more volatile nature of developments in the industrial sector compared with the 

services sector. A number of factors are likely to have played a role in the relative weakness of 

growth in the second year of this recovery, including lower trend output growth, shocks to both the 

exchange rate of the euro and oil prices, and uncertainties about ongoing reforms in some euro 

area economies (see Box 5 entitled ﬁThe current euro area recovery from a historical perspectiveﬂ 

in the November 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin).
Overall, the sectoral composition of growth in euro area value added highlights the importance 

of the services sector in the euro area. The services sector is by far the largest economic sector 

in the euro area. It has grown considerably in importance over recent decades, a process which 

is very likely to continue, and now contributes about as much to overall volatility in the growth 

of value added as the industrial sector. Accordingly, when compared with previous upturns, the 

weaker growth in the second year of the current recovery, i.e. from mid-2004 to mid-2005, has 

been broadly shared by the main euro area sectors.
Various dispersion measures indicate that the 
divergence of real GDP growth rates among 

euro area countries remained roughly unchanged 

in 2005. Reflecting in part a moderation in 

global economic growth and trade and the rise 

in oil prices, average annual real GDP growth 

declined or remained practically unchanged in 

all euro area countries in 2005 compared with 

the year before, except in Spain, where it 

increased somewhat and remained relatively 

strong.ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LABOUR 

MARKET Employment rose throughout the year at a 

similar pace to that recorded in 2004 (see 

Table 4). At the sectoral level, employment 

rose strongly in the services and construction 

sectors while continuing to decline in 

industry (excluding construction) and in 

agriculture. Survey indicators for employment 

prospects in both the services and industrial 

sectors also increased markedly towards the 

end of the year. In light of the subdued 

economic activity in 2005, it is likely that

measures fa
cilitating the expansion of part-
time work and self-employment are playing a 

key role.
The unemployment rate in the euro area 
declined steadily in 2005, to reach 8.3% at 

the end of the year (see Chart 30). The 

unemployment rate for workers under 25 fell 

significantly. Following an increase in the non-

accelerating inflation rate of unemployment 

(NAIRU) between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, 

which largely reflected adverse shocks and 

rigid labour market institutions in most euro 

area countries, NAIRU estimates have been 

lowered slightly over the last decade.
9 This 
reduction has been attributed above all to the 

impact of labour market reforms in some euro 

area countries (see Box 6 for further details). 

While several countries have made significant 

progress towards making their labour markets 

more flexible, in many countries more ambitious 

reforms are needed. Only a more determined 

commitment to structural labour market reforms 

will allow unemployment rates to be 

significantly reduced in the years ahead without 

endangering price stability.

2005remained above productivity growth for the 
economy as a whole. Euro area productivity 

growth in recent years has been disappointing. 

It has declined from above 2% in the 1990s to 

slightly above 1% more recently. Lower 

productivity growth in the euro area has been 

partly related to higher employment, but it also 

reflects an insufficient use of new productivity-

enhancing technologies. A breakdown of 

labour productivity growth in recent years also 

shows that lower labour quality is playing a role 

in explaining labour productivity growth.
10 Tentative empirical evidence links the relatively 

poor productivity performance in the euro area 

countries to a lack of competition and to 
employment protection legislation.
11 Looking ahead, this suggests that policies in the area of 

human capital should be geared towards 

enhancing educational attainment and providing 

more on-the-job training. There is also a clear 

need for economic policies that stimulate 

innovation and promote the use of productivity-

enhancing technologies.

PROGRESS WITH STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN EU LABOUR AND PRODUCT MARKETS
Intensified competition, rapid technological change and the ageing of the population imply that 
European countries must tackle new challenges and turn them into opportunities. With regard 

to labour and product markets, those challenges include increasing labour market flexibility, 

enhancing the skills of the labour force, completing the Single Market (including for services), 

promoting innovation and strengthening the business environment. This calls for structural 

reforms to enhance Europe™s economic growth potential, promote job creation, facilitate 

adjustment and increase resilience to shocks.In response to these challenges, the spring 2005 European Council agreed that the Commission, 
the Council and the Member States should relaunch the Lisbon strategy Œ the ambitious reform 

agenda introduced in March 2000 Œ with a renewed focus on sustainable growth and jobs.
1 In 
this context, and after a proposal from the Commission, the ECOFIN Council adopted in 2005 

the ﬁIntegrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobsﬂ, covering both the new Broad Economic 

Policy Guidelines and the new Employment Guidelines, for a three-year period (2005-08). 

These guidelines for economic and employment policies call, inter alia, for structural reforms 

to improve the functioning of labour and product markets in the EU. Based on the Integrated 

Guidelines, the Member States have prepared national reform programmes setting out their 

planned structural reforms for the period 2005-08 (see Section 1 of Chapter 4). A parallel 

Community Lisbon Programme was adopted by the Commission in July 2005 to complement 

the national reform programmes, with action to be taken at the European level.
Improving the performance of labour markets is one of the most important priorities in the 
national reform programmes. With 20 million people still unemployed in the EU, progress in 

raising employment rates and reducing unemployment rates has so far been slow. Although 

Member States have announced many reform measures to improve labour market performance, 

it seems that more urgent action is needed to meet the Lisbon strategy™s employment targets. In 
1  See the article entitled ﬁThe Lisbon strategy Œ five years onﬂ in the July 2005 issue of the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin.
62ECB Annual Report
2005particular, participation and employment rates of female workers, younger workers under the 
age of 25 and older workers over the age of 55 need to increase. Against this background, in 

2005 Member States aimed their labour market policies mainly at affecting labour supply by 

providing incentives for more people to enter the labour market. Most of the policy measures 

concerned labour taxation, active labour market policies and unemployment and welfare-related 

benefits. Most measures adopted in the field of labour taxation were aimed at reducing the tax 

burden on labour so as to stimulate employment by lowering labour costs. With regard to active 

labour market policies, several countries restructured their public employment services. In the 

area of unemployment and welfare-related benefits, various measures were taken, aiming at 

more targeted interventions, tighter controls and stricter eligibility conditions. Some EU 

countries have so far reported overall positive effects on their labour markets from opening up 

their borders to migrant workers from the new Member States. At the same time, few reforms 

were launched with regard to early retirement schemes.
Europe also risks losing ground if the business climate is not improved in terms of competition 
and regulation. Goods, services and energy markets, including the network industries, are still 

not fully competitive. Generally, the process of improving regulation at the national and EU 

levels has gained momentum. With regard to services, the implementation of the Directive on 

services in the internal market will constitute an important step towards completing the internal 

market. However, more action is needed to remove barriers to entry and to ensure a proper 

functioning of markets, including for the network industries.
Labour and product market reforms need to be complemented by reforms creating the right 
climate for knowledge development and innovation. In terms of R&D spending, however, the 

EU is low in international rankings. Spending as a share of GDP has been more or less stagnant 

since 2001, at around 1.9% of GDP. This is well below the Lisbon target of 3%. While in their 

national reform programmes many Member States plan a significant increase in overall R&D 

expenditure by 2010, in the medium to long run more efforts are needed to promote private 

R&D spending in particular. Regarding education, this area needs more emphasis in order to 

keep developments in labour quality consistent with the aims of the Lisbon strategy. 
To sum up, some further progress with structural reforms was made in 2005. The reform 
measures initiated in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy, as subsequently announced in 

the Community Lisbon Programme and the national reform programmes, are a welcome 

additional step in the right direction. On the basis of these programmes, the overall pace of 

reform now needs to be stepped up. 
2.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS 
BUDGETARY DEVELOPMENTS DISAPPOINTING IN 
2005Fiscal developments in the euro area throughout 

2005 showed very little progress towards a 

position of sound public finances. According to 

the latest data available from Member States™ 

updated stability programmes, the euro area 

deficit shrank slightly to 2.5% of GDP, which 

was not sufficient to prevent a further increase in 
the average debt-to-GDP ratio (see Table 5). The 
estimated budgetary outcome for 2005 reflected 

some fiscal tightening in an environment of 

moderate economic growth. 
Several countries missed the budgetary targets 

set out in their updated stability programmes at 

the end of 2004 and in the first half of 2005. The 

expected outcomes fell short of the target values 

by an average of 0.2 percentage point of GDP, 

partly as a result of lower than expected economic 
63ECB Annual Report
2005growth, but also because of some consolidation 
shortfalls and spending overruns in certain 

countries. The estimated shortfalls were 

particularly pronounced in some of the countries 

which already had large deficits. The 

deterioration of budgetary positions in 2005 is 

also apparent in the increase in the number of 
countries that registered deficit ratios above the 

reference value of 3% of GDP as compared with 

the 2004 stability programme updates. Four 

countries™ deficits are estimated to have been 

above the reference value (i.e. those of Germany, 

Greece, Italy and Portugal), although the stability 

programmes had foreseen only two countries 

being above this level. With the exception of 

Portugal, where significant temporary measures 

were used to keep the deficit at or below 3% of 

GDP between 2002 and 2004, these countries 
have been recording deficits above the reference 
value for the greater part of the period since the 

introduction of the euro in 1999. Germany is 

expected to record a deficit ratio of 3.3% of 

GDP for 2005, while France is expected to post 

3.0%. The German deficit thus remained above 

3% of GDP for the fourth year in a row. Following 

substantial statistical revisions in 2004, it 

became apparent that, according to ESA 95 

methodology, Greece had been recording deficits 

above the reference value since 1997, and a 

deficit level of 4.3% of GDP is expected for 

2005. Italy also exceeded the reference value by 

a significant margin in 2005, estimating a deficit 

ratio of 4.3% of GDP. Portugal virtually doubled 

its deficit by comparison with 2004, reaching 

6.0% of GDP after its significant temporary 

policy measures had come to an end.

licences.64ECB Annual Report
2005The budgetary outcome for the euro area as a 
whole showed a somewhat restrictive fiscal 

policy stance. Estimated real GDP growth was 

below potential, implying that the business 

cycle had a negative impact on budgetary 

developments. Interest payments remained 

stable, reflecting historically low interest rates 

and a favourable financial environment. 
While consolidation needs varied widely across 
the euro area, with cyclically adjusted fiscal 

balances for individual countries estimated to 

have ranged from a surplus of around 2.5% of 

GDP to a deficit of around 5% of GDP, structural 

improvements in the public finance position 

continued to fall short of the required level in 

a number of countries. Deficit-reducing 

temporary measures and one-off effects blur 

the picture somewhat Œ although less than in 

previous years Œ and, by definition, have not led 

to sustained improvements. For the euro area as 

a whole, both government expenditure and 

revenue are estimated to have risen slightly as a 

percentage of GDP. Cuts in direct taxes and 

social contributions broadly offset the limited 

degree of spending restraint and the increases 

in indirect taxes observed in 2005. 
The euro area debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
have increased in 2005 for the third year in a row, 

standing at 71.0% of GDP. That increase was 

driven by a low primary surplus ratio, by the fact 

that economic growth was lower than the implicit 

average interest rate on public debt and, in some 

cases, by debt-increasing stock-flow adjustments. 

The majority of euro area countries recorded debt 
ratios above the reference value of 60% of GDP. 

In many cases, the debt-to-GDP ratio continued 

to rise. Italy, with debt estimated at 108.5% of 

GDP, had the highest ratio in the euro area. 

Greece™s debt ratio fell only marginally, with debt 

remaining above 100% of GDP in 2005. Three 

other countries above the reference value of 60% 

of GDP (i.e. Germany, France and Portugal) are 

not expected to have reduced their debt-to-GDP 

ratios. While Belgium is estimated to have 

recorded a balanced budget again in 2005, partly 

owing to temporary measures, the reduction in its 

debt ratio slowed considerably owing to sizeable 

deficit-debt adjustments. The continuation of 

significant budgetary imbalances and the adverse 

debt dynamics in the euro area were also reflected 

in the volume of issuance of general government 

debt securities (see Box 7).
Box 7
DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES ISSUANCE IN THE EURO AREA 
Issuance of general government debt securities continued to be strong in 2005, as governments™ 

financing needs to fund their budget deficits increased. By 1999, when Stage Three of EMU 

began, most euro area countries had only small budgetary imbalances, or even surpluses, and 

the borrowing needs of these countries were therefore low. However, from 2000 onwards 

budgetary positions started to deteriorate, partly as a result of worsening economic conditions, 

and consequently the gross borrowing requirements of euro area countries increased. This 

development is reflected in both the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and the annual growth

65ECB Annual Report
2005rate of debt securities issued by the general government sector in the euro area. The latter rate 
stood at around 4.5%, on average, in the last four years (see Table A).
An analysis of the structure of outstanding general government debt securities reveals that 
government debt issuance is predominantly undertaken by central government, which accounted 

for 93.8% of outstanding debt securities in December 2005, with other general government 

responsible for the remaining 6.2%. Nevertheless, the other general government sector has 

been becoming more active. Between 1998 and 2005 the share of debt securities issued by 

central government steadily declined, while the share of debt securities issued by other general 

government doubled (see Table B).
Countries continued to have a long-term orientation in their debt management. An important 
factor making the issuance of long-term debt securities by governments more attractive was the 

low level of interest rates. In fact, long-term debt accounted for 92.3% of outstanding debt 

securities at the end of 2005, while the share of short-term debt securities was only 7.7%. This 

is also consistent with the negative growth rate of short-term debt securities observed in 2005. 

The annual growth rate of long-term debt securities declined somewhat in 2005, to 4.8%, from 

5.7% in 2004. Table B indicates that the vast majority of long-term general government debt securities were 
issued at a fixed rate. Over time, the share of long-term floating rate debt securities has 

decreased substantially, from 11.9% in 1998 to 7.9% in December 2005. Underlying this 

development was the gradual decline witnessed towards the end of the 1990s in the term 

premium paid by some governments on long-term fixed rate securities in an environment of 

price stability. Nevertheless, the share of floating rate debt securities increased slightly in 

2005, to 7.9%, from 7.7% in 2004. The only country where the share of floating rate debt 

securities is significantly above the euro area average is Italy (21%), although this share has 

declined significantly since 1998. In the euro area, the rate of growth of long-term floating rate 

securities increased to 9.3% in 2005, mirroring developments in the issuance of debt securities 

in other segments of the market, such as MFIs (see Section 2.2 of this chapter). This increase 

may be related to the fact that floating rate securities were positively affected by the very low 

levels of short-term interest rates (see Table A).

66ECB Annual Report
2005Overall, recent trends in the structure of government financing reflect the fact that national 
debt management strategies have taken advantage of the favourable developments in financial 

market conditions that have resulted from more stability-oriented economic policies over the 

last decade. The most visible benefit for the public is the significantly lower proportion of 

governments™ budgets being spent on interest payments. 
Looking at the total amounts of general government debt outstanding in December 2005 (see 
Chart A), Italy is by far the largest issuer, with 27.2% of the total amount in the euro area. 

Germany and France follow with 23.2% and 20.8% respectively. The governments of 

these three countries alone account for more than two-thirds of all euro area sovereign debt. 

When comparing levels of net issuance in 2005, Germany has the largest amount, with 

65.8 billion. France and Italy follow with 
61.8 billion and 
35.4 billion respectively (see 
Chart B).

PROSPECTS FOR PUBLIC FINANCES IN 2006
The latest updates of the stability programmes 
suggest that targets represent consolidation 

progress that is in most cases broadly consistent 

with the revised Stability and Growth Pact. 

However, as in previous years, many governments 

do not have sufficiently concrete or credible 

plans to comprehensively address their fiscal 

imbalances. Some degree of intended spending 

restraint can be seen, but this is expected to be 

offset by tax reductions, resulting in government 

expenditure and revenue declining in tandem. 

As a consequence, it is to be feared that most 

countries will once again accomplish too little 
to contain budget deficits and will also fall 

short of comprehensive structural reforms. For 
2006 the stability programmes indicate a 
moderate decline of 0.2 percentage point in the 
average euro area deficit, to 2.3% of GDP, while 

economic growth is set to be close to potential. 

In these circumstances, the business cycle would 

exert a neutral effect on fiscal developments in 

2006, and interest payments would decrease 

slightly at the euro area level. The average debt 

ratio would remain broadly stable at close to 

71% of GDP. 
Of the countries with an excessive deficit, 

Greece aims to bring its deficit below the 3% 

threshold in 2006, while Germany and Italy 

plan to do so only in 2007, and Portugal expects 

to correct its excessive deficit in 2008. While

achieve fiscal positions in line with their 

medium-term objectives only beyond their 

programme horizons, all others will do so by 

2008 at the latest.FISCAL POLICY IN NEED OF A STRATEGIC 

TURNAROUND
Past and prospective fiscal developments, as 

recorded by the European Commission and 

outlined in the updated stability programmes, 

give rise to a number of serious challenges.
First, fiscal consolidation should be prioritised. 

The number of countries with severe fiscal 

imbalances is particularly worrying. The 

improving growth outlook provides a good 

opportunity for countries to progress towards 

the correction of excessive deficits and the 

achievement of sound public finances. However, 

it appears that, without additional measures, a 
number of countries may not live up to their 

consolidation commitments. This must be 

avoided, not least in order to rebuild the 

credibility of the revised Stability and Growth 

Pact. The European fiscal framework is an 

essential pillar of EMU which anchors 

expectations of fiscal discipline and thereby 

contributes to growth, stability and cohesion in 

the euro area. Second, in line with economic reasoning, the 

revised Pact places great emphasis on the 

sustained consolidation of budgetary balances 

rather than one-off and temporary measures to 

improve the fiscal situation. It would thus be 

very welcome if reliance on such measures 

were to be reduced, as foreseen by some 

governments. It is evident that temporary 

measures may delay the consolidation efforts 

required in order to address the structural 

budgetary challenges faced by many euro area 

countries. Furthermore, short-term gains on 

account of such measures may cause a further 

deterioration in the future. This could lead to a 

larger fiscal burden on later generations.
Third, most euro area countries are in need of 

a comprehensive reform strategy in order to 
support employment and growth. These reforms 
must include the pursuit of fiscal consolidation. 

Given that many countries want to reduce 

effective rates of tax on labour and capital 

income as part of such a strategy, control of 

public expenditure is crucial. Structural 

expenditure reforms are essential for healthy 

and growth-promoting public finances. In order 

to promote investment, innovation and 

employment, expenditure needs to be directed 

towards productive goals. At the same time, 

expenditure control mechanisms may need 

strengthening to avoid spending overruns, which 

often lead to an upward adjustment of budget 

deficit targets. In many cases, it will also be 

essential to review government commitments, 

with a view to improving the quality of public 

expenditure. This will allow countries to attain 

sound finances while adequately financing the 

core tasks of the public sector.

EURO DEPRECIATED IN 2005
Following its strong appreciation during the 
last three months of 2004, the euro declined in 

the first half of 2005. This depreciation was 

rather broad-based but most pronounced against 

the US dollar and several Asian currencies 

which were formally or de facto pegged to the 

US dollar. Thereafter, while the euro recovered 

its earlier losses against the Japanese yen, 

fluctuations in most other bilateral euro 

currency pairs were relatively modest. As a 

result, by the end of 2005 the euro had stabilised, 

in nominal effective terms, at about 6% below 

its level at the beginning of the year (see 

Chart 32). 
After reaching its highest level since its launch 
in 1999 at the end of 2004, both in nominal 

effective terms and against the US dollar, the 

euro started to lose ground amid shifting market 

perceptions about the forces affecting exchange 

rates. At that time, there were increasing signs 

of an improvement in economic activity in both 

the United States and Japan, while the prevailing 
68ECB Annual Report
2005perception concerning the euro area outlook 
continued to be more subdued. In the United 

States, in particular, news suggesting robust 

economic activity, coupled with signs of rising 

inflationary pressures, apparently switched the 

market™s attention from the large and persistent 

current account deficit towards expectations of 

higher interest rates in the United States, 

thereby supporting the US currency. This 

process paused only briefly between mid-

February and early March 2005, when the US 

currency came under temporary pressure amid 

speculation about possible foreign exchange 

reserve diversification by some central banks. 

From mid-March onwards, however, market 

sentiment towards the US dollar improved, 

whereas it turned more negative vis-à-vis the 

euro Œ a development which was further 

exacerbated in early June following the rejection 

in France and the Netherlands of the Treaty 

establishing a Constitution for Europe. The 

broad-based decline in the euro™s external value 

between mid-March and end-July was only 

partly offset by its appreciation against the 

currencies of the four largest new EU Member 

States. A temporary reduction in global risk 

appetite seems to have influenced investment 

decisions in central and eastern Europe,  

particularly between mid-March and early June, 

resulting in the rather broad-based weakness of 

the currencies in this region.
In the second half of 2005, foreign exchange 
markets continued to be dominated by cyclical 

factors, whereas structural factors appear to 

have remained in the background. In particular, 

the widening interest rate differential of the 

United States relative to other major economies 

appears to have continued to support the 

dollar. This was further helped by US corporate 

flows related to the Homeland Investment Act 
12 and news that foreign demand for US assets 

remained buoyant, thereby possibly dampening 

market concerns about the financing of the US 

current account deficit. However, signs of an 

improvement in the euro area™s business climate 

counterbalanced the dollar™s strength and, 

consequently, the euro declined only marginally 

against the US dollar between July and end-
December 2005. The improvement in the 
Japanese economic outlook was not apparently 

sufficient to counteract the downward impact 

on the Japanese yen emanating from higher oil 

prices and a widening yield differential between 

Japan and other major economies. As a result, 

the Japanese yen experienced a broad-based 

weakness in the second half of 2005. On 

21 July China abandoned the US dollar peg and 

moved to a managed floating exchange rate 

regime with reference to a basket of currencies. 

This change was felt mostly in Asia and did not 

appear to have a lasting direct impact on the 

euro exchange rate.
On 30 December 2005 the euro stood at 
USD 1.20. This was roughly 11% lower than at 

the beginning of the year. In 2005 the euro 

also weakened against the pound sterling (by 

3.9%), the Norwegian krone (by 2.5%) and the 

Australian and Canadian dollars (by 7.0% and 

14.4% respectively). It also depreciated against 

some of the currencies of the new EU Member 

States, namely the Polish zloty (by 5.4%) 

and the Czech koruna (by 4.7%). Over the 

same period, the euro was almost unchanged 

vis-à-vis the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
The euro™s depreciation against the above-
mentioned currencies was only partly 

counterbalanced by its moderate appreciation 

against the Hungarian forint and, more 

significantly, against the Swedish krona (by 

5.1%). In January 2006 the euro rebounded against 
most major currencies but retreated in February. 

During the first two months of 2006, euro 

exchange rate developments appear to have 

been mainly influenced by market expectations 

about the future course of monetary policy, 

particularly in the euro area, the United States 

and Japan. On 24 February 2006 the euro stood, 

in nominal effective terms, about 0.3% below 

its level at the beginning of the year. 
12 The Homeland Investment Act allows US companies to 
repatriate profits held offshore at a beneficial tax rate during 

their respective fiscal years.
69ECB Annual Report
2005The real effective exchange rate of the euro Œ 
based on different cost and price indices Œ also 

declined in 2005 in line with the decrease in the 

nominal effective exchange rate (see Chart 32). 

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the real effective 

exchange rate indices of the euro were slightly 

above the level observed in the first quarter of 

1999 and close to their average level over the 

past ten years.
CURRENT ACCOUNT DECLINED IN 2005, MOSTLY 

AS A RESULT OF HIGHER COST OF OIL IMPORTS 
In 2005 the current account of the euro area 

recorded a deficit of 
29.0 billion (or 0.4% of 
GDP), down from a surplus of 
43.5 billion in 2004 (0.6% of GDP). This decline was largely 

the result of a deterioration in the goods surplus 

and, to a lesser extent, in the income deficit, 

while the balances for services and current 

transfers remained broadly unchanged (see 

Chart 33).
The geographical breakdown of the euro area 
current account, which is available up to the 

third quarter of 2005, reveals that the sharp

transfersdecrease in the cumulated current account 
surplus in the 12-month period up to September 

2005 was mostly due to increases in oil trade 

deficits with oil-exporting countries. Over 

the same period the surplus with the United 

States remained roughly unchanged (at around 

41 billion), while the surplus with other 
countries in the EU rose by 
14 billion, mostly 
due to an increase in the surplus with the United 

Kingdom.In 2005 the goods surplus declined by 
47.6 billion, as import values grew more rapidly 

than export values. Export values of goods 

increased at roughly the same pace as in 2004, 

while the growth of import values of goods 

accelerated somewhat. The income deficit rose 

sharply, particularly towards the end of the 

year, reflecting a larger increase in income 

payments.
Developments in trade in goods can be better 
understood by using Eurostat™s external trade 

statistics, which break down the value of extra-

euro area exports and imports of goods into 
70ECB Annual Report
2005their price and volume components (the 
statistics available cover the period up to 

November 2005). On the imports side, the 

strong rise in import values of goods in 2005 

was mostly accounted for by the robust growth 

in import values of energy products, largely 

reflecting the rise in the price of oil. In addition, 

particularly in the second half of 2005, import 

volumes rose. After being flat during the 

first part of 2005, import volumes accelerated 

due to the pick-up in euro area total final 

demand, especially in the import-intensive 

categories of expenditure, such as investment 

and exports. 
On the exports side, both export prices and 
export volumes contributed to the growth in 

export values of goods in 2005. The rise in 

export prices was partly accounted for by the 

increase in costs associated with higher oil 

prices. In the course of the year export volumes 

of goods accelerated mostly due to developments 
in euro area foreign demand. Having been weak 
in the first quarter, growth in euro area foreign 

demand increased robustly during the rest of 

the year, albeit less rapidly than in the previous 

year. In particular, exports to Asia (especially 

China) and the new EU Member States grew 

fast, reflecting the strength of economic activity 

in these regions in 2005. Euro area exports 

also benefited from the recycling of oil 

export revenues by oil-exporting countries (see 

Box 8). In terms of products, exports of capital 

goods registered the strongest growth, while 

exports of consumer goods were more subdued. 

With regard to price competitiveness, export 

volumes were negatively affected at the start 

of the year by the lagged effects of the 

euro appreciation. However, its subsequent 

depreciation may have helped export volumes 

to exceed the growth rate of foreign demand in 

the second and third quarters of 2005.
Box 8
OIL-BILL RECYCLING AND ITS IMPACT
Oil price increases and rising production volumes have generated substantially higher oil 

export revenues for oil-exporting countries since 2002. This box focuses on export revenues 

accruing to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the 

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which together produce approximately 70% of 

internationally traded oil. Combined OPEC and CIS revenues are estimated to have increased 

from USD 250 billion in 2002 to around USD 630 billion in 2005 (see Chart A). The box 

reviews the feedback effects stemming from rising oil revenues (ﬁoil-bill recyclingﬂ) and, in 

particular, the two main channels Œ financial markets and international trade Œ through which 

the oil export revenues are transmitted to the oil-importing countries. 
One possible scenario associated with the reallocation of wealth following a period of sustained 
high oil prices is that oil-exporting countries increase their deposits with international banks 

and/or purchase foreign equity and debt instruments. Traditionally, and particularly in the 

aftermath of the second oil price shock in the early 1980s, OPEC countries have mainly 

invested in US assets and markets and have made their banking deposits almost exclusively in 

US dollars. Similarly, the rise in oil prices from mid-1998 to end-2000 was accompanied, with 

a slight lag, by a near doubling of the stock of OPEC™s net assets held in international banks Œ a 

measure of the net channelling of OPEC funds into deposits with international banks. However, 

this was not the case in the most recent period of surging oil prices, as the stock of OPEC™s net 
71ECB Annual Report
2005assets vis-à-vis BIS reporting banks has remained broadly flat since the first quarter of 2001 
(see Chart B).
1 The investment pattern that can be observed by monitoring banks™ balance sheet 
positions may, however, not give the full picture. Indeed, looking at cross-border capital flows, 

the US Department of the Treasury reports an increase of 92% in OPEC holdings of US 

Treasury securities between January 2001 and September 2005 (from USD 28.5 billion to 

USD 54.6 billion). In addition, oil export revenues may also have been channelled into US 

Treasury securities through offshore markets. 
There are some visible changes in the currency composition of oil-exporting countries™ 
assets. OPEC economies gradually increased the share of euro-denominated deposits from 12% 

at the beginning of 1999 to over 28% at the end of the first quarter of 2004. This was accompanied 

by a steady fall in the share of US dollar-denominated deposits. Since 2004, however, OPEC 

economies have gradually shifted their deposits back into US dollars, despite the relatively 

strong appreciation of the euro during that year. This increased the share of deposits denominated 

in US dollars, from a low of 51% at the end of the first quarter of 2004 to 65% in the second 

quarter of 2005. This development coincided with a similar decline, in terms of magnitude, in 

the share of deposits denominated in euro, which was 17% in the second quarter of 2005. 
Net assets held by Russia, the largest oil producer in the CIS and the world™s largest non-OPEC 
oil exporter, rose considerably during the most recent oil price increases and also changed in 

terms of their currency composition (see Chart C). Russia has been a net creditor to BIS 

reporting banks since 2002. The share of euro-denominated deposits more than tripled between 

mid-2002 and the second quarter of 2005, rising from 11% to 36%. This fairly sharp increase 

over the past three years also reflects, to a certain extent, the strong appreciation of the euro 

against the US dollar during the period and the growing use of the euro as a reserve currency

72ECB Annual Report
2005by Russia™s monetary authorities. As explained 
below, this move towards a more balanced 

deposit portfolio, in terms of currencies, may 

signal a desire by oil producers to safeguard 

their purchasing power when their imports are 

shifting away from the United States towards 

Europe and other countries. International trade represents the second 
potential recycling channel for increased oil 

revenues. During the first and second oil price 

shocks in the 1970s, OPEC™s oil export 

revenues persistently exceeded, to a relatively 

large extent, its total imports, giving rise to 

ﬁoil-dependent trade surplusesﬂ. These 

surpluses turned into small deficits in the 

mid-1980s when the price of oil plunged back 

to around USD 15 per barrel. The large surplus 

appeared again in 2000 when oil prices started 

to pick up sharply. However, since 2001, OPEC™s oil-dependent trade surpluses have remained 

relatively moderate compared with previous periods of high oil prices, despite the strong rise 

in both oil prices and oil export volumes. This implies that the rising oil export revenues that 

have accrued to OPEC have coincided with rising OPEC imports. A similar trend can be 

observed in the case of the CIS. The oil-dependent trade deficits recorded by the CIS declined 

sharply after the surge in oil prices in 1999 and 2000. The strong increase in oil prices, however, 

coincided with a deterioration in the CIS™ oil-dependent trade balance between 2001 and 2004. 

This implies that the rising oil export revenues that have accrued to the CIS in those years also 

coincided with rising imports. In the first half of 2005, however, the oil-dependent trade deficit 

recorded by the CIS again declined significantly.
Total OPEC and CIS imports registered average annual increases of 18% and 21% respectively 
between 2001 and 2004 in nominal US dollar terms. The euro area seems to have benefited 

from the strong demand originating from oil-exporting countries. The average annual growth 

rates of OPEC and CIS imports from the euro area were 21% and 26% respectively between 

2001 and 2004, resulting in an increase in the euro area™s market share in both oil-exporting 

regions (see table). Non-Japan Asia also succeeded in increasing its relative share in total

2005OPEC and CIS imports. These figures contrast sharply with those of the United States, which 
saw its market share fall significantly over the same period. In 2005 the euro area continued 

benefiting from rising imports in oil-exporting countries. OPEC and CIS imports in the first 

half of 2005 (the latest available data) stood, respectively, 22% and 25% higher than in the same 

period one year earlier.
Overall, since 1999, different patterns have emerged in the allocation of additional oil export 
revenues by oil-exporting economies, particularly the OPEC economies. In the aftermath of the 

substantial rise in oil prices in 1999, the OPEC countries deposited large percentages of their 

oil revenues in international banks while import spending remained low. However, since 2001 

both the OPEC economies and the CIS economies have substantially increased their imports. 

The euro area seems to have benefited from this recent increase in import activity. Thus, while 

the elevated price of oil should have dampened economic activity in the euro area, it appears 

that the feedback effects associated with oil-bill recycling have, to a certain extent, mitigated 

the negative first-round effects of surging oil prices recently.
NET OUTFLOWS IN COMBINED DIRECT AND 

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN 2005
In the financial account, the euro area 

experienced net outflows of 
13 billion in combined direct and portfolio investment in 

2005, compared with net inflows of 
24 billion 
in 2004. This was mainly the result of increased 

net inflows in equity portfolio investment, 

which were offset by net outflows in direct 

investment and lower net inflows in debt 

instruments (see Chart 34).
The larger deficit in direct investment in 2005 is 
due to an increase in foreign direct investment 

(FDI) by the euro area, largely in the form of 

equity capital investment. This pick-up may 

partly reflect the renewed interest by euro area 

corporations in enhancing competitiveness 

through foreign affiliates, as well as the 

exceptional restructuring operation of Royal 

Dutch Shell. At the same time, FDI inflows into 

the euro area stabilised at low levels in 2004. 

Expectations that the rest of the world would 

experience stronger economic growth than 

the euro area might have accounted for the 

developments observed.
The rise in net inflows in portfolio investment 
emanated from an increase in net purchases of 
euro area equity securities by non-residents. 
These purchases were driven in part by the 
equities acquired in the context of the 

restructuring of Royal Dutch Shell, but also by 

expectations of relatively higher returns in the 

euro area stock markets. Market survey data 

also indicated that foreign investors were 

interested in euro area equities, which they find 

to be more attractively priced than equities in 

other markets. 
Turning to debt instruments, cross-border flows 
rose sharply in 2005, with most transactions in 

bonds and notes. There were two distinct trend 

movements in the course of 2005: in the early 

part of the year, there was a steady rise in net 

inflows in euro area debt instruments, which 

reached a peak in early summer. Subsequently, 

this trend reversed into net outflows in the 

second half of the year. This may have reflected 

the fact that the yield differentials between US 

and euro area government bonds and notes 

became fairly sizeable, particularly over the 

summer.
Based on cumulated flows over the first three 
quarters of 2005, the United Kingdom and the 

new EU Member States were the main recipients 

of euro area direct investment. The new EU 

Member States were also the main investors in 

the euro area over this period. The geographical

large net purchasers of US bonds and notes, but 

were net sellers of US equities and money 

market instruments. 
The new EU Member States as a whole received 
considerable euro area foreign investment. A 

positive trend is clearly evident, implying that 

euro area investors may have found this region 

to be relatively profitable and that financial 

integration between the euro area and the new 

EU Member States has possibly strengthened 

during this period (see Chart 35).
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION 

DETERIORATED FURTHER IN 2005
Data on the international investment position 

(i.i.p.) of the euro area vis-à-vis the rest of the 

world, available up to the end of the third 

quarter of 2005, indicate that the euro area 

recorded net liabilities of 1,049 billion  
(representing 13.2% of euro area GDP), 
compared with net liabilities of 946 billion (12.4% of GDP) at the end of 2004 and 
809 billion (11.0% of GDP) at the end of 2003 (see 

Chart 36). The higher net liabilities in 2005 

largely resulted from an increase in the net 

liability positions in portfolio investment (from 

1,071 billion to 1,350 billion), which was 
partly offset by an increase in the net asset 

position in direct investment (from 
89 billion

2005ECONOMIC ACTIVITY In 2005 real GDP growth in the non-euro area 
EU Member States moderated compared with 

2004, but remained stronger than in the euro 

area (see Table 6). As in previous years, output 

growth was highest in the Baltic States, where 

growth was higher than 7%, and in Slovakia 

and the Czech Republic, which both had growth 

rates of 6%. The robustness of domestic demand was 
sustained in most countries by strong growth in 

private consumption, which remained at high 

levels in 2005, particularly in the majority of 

the new Member States. Household spending 

was supported by significant growth in real 

disposable income, as well as expansionary 

fiscal policies and rising house prices in some 

countries. In addition, increasing credit growth 

to the private sector in a number of non-euro 

area EU countries, especially the Baltic States, 

backed a continuing increase in real estate 

investment and household spending. 

Consumption growth was subdued in 2005 in 

Malta (reflecting low growth in disposable 

income), Poland (owing to wage restraint and

the back of higher interest rates and a cooling 
of the housing market). Domestic demand was 

further supported by continued strength in 

investment growth in many of the non-euro area 

Member States, in particular the Baltic States, 

Hungary, Malta, Slovakia and Sweden. Low 

interest rates, recovering industrial confidence, 

a high degree of capital utilisation and a positive 

outlook for sustained demand contributed to 
the strong growth in investment, while financial 

resources stemming from EU funds also 

supported investment growth in the new 

Member States. As regards external demand, exports were a 
main driver of real GDP growth in most new 

Member States, notably the Baltic States, the 

Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. However, 

the contribution of net exports to real GDP 

growth varied significantly across the non-euro 

area EU countries and was broadly neutral for 

the group as a whole. Both export and import 

growth remained rather high in 2005 in the 

new Member States, suggesting that the long-

standing process of trade integration had gained 
77ECB Annual Report
2005further momentum with the removal of trade 
barriers, primarily on food products, following 

EU accession. The labour market situation continued to 
improve in most non-euro area Member States 

in 2005, particularly in the Baltic States, Poland 

and Slovakia. While unemployment rates fell 

only gradually, employment growth strengthened 

markedly in the new Member States, notably in 

the countries with the highest unemployment 

rates. In Poland and Slovakia, the unemployment 

rate remained particularly high, around twice 

as high as in the euro area. In Cyprus, Denmark 

and the United Kingdom, the labour markets 

were relatively tight, with unemployment rates 

of below 6%. 
PRICE DEVELOPMENTS In 2005 HICP inflation was lowest Œ below the 

euro area average Œ in Sweden, the Czech 

Republic, Denmark and the United Kingdom. 

In most other non-euro area EU countries, 

HICP inflation was just above the euro area 

average, although in Latvia, Estonia and 

Hungary it was above 3% (see Table 7). 

Compared with 2004, most of the new Member 

States, with the exception of the Baltic States, 

recorded lower HICP inflation rates in 2005,

while Denmark and the United Kingdom, 
starting from low levels, recorded higher 

inflation rates. Inflation developments in the non-euro area 
Member States were partly driven by common 

factors. In several of the new Member States, a 

deceleration of inflation in the first half of 2005 

reflected the base effect of price increases in 

2004 related to EU accession. In addition, 
78ECB Annual Report
2005strong competition appears to have exerted 
downward pressure on price developments in 

most non-euro area Member States, particularly 

in industrial goods and food. By contrast, the 

rising price of oil exerted upward pressure on 

inflation. Its precise impact, however, varied 

across countries, largely reflecting differences 

in consumption patterns, market structures and 

the energy intensity of production. Moreover, 

as energy prices are largely administered in 

many non-euro area EU countries, the pass-

through of higher oil prices to inflation may not 

have fully materialised in 2005. Inflationary 

pressures also emerged as a result of continued 

strong domestic demand in some of the new 

Member States. Exchange rate developments and their lagged 
pass-through to overall inflation also affected 

inflation developments in 2005. In a number of 

countries, particularly the Czech Republic, 

Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, currency 

appreciation had a dampening impact on 

inflation. FISCAL POLICIES 
On the basis of the latest updates of convergence 

programmes submitted in late 2005 and early 

2006, the general picture of fiscal policies in 

the non-euro area EU Member States was 

heterogeneous in 2005. Three non-euro area 

Member States (Denmark, Estonia and Sweden) 

recorded a fiscal surplus, whereas the other ten 

countries registered fiscal deficits. The 

estimated budgetary outcomes for 2005 were 

either broadly in line with, or better than, the 

targets of the convergence programmes, with 

the exceptions of the Czech Republic, Hungary, 

Malta and Slovakia. General government 

balances deteriorated in six of the thirteen non-

euro area EU Member States over the year (see 

Table 8), although the convergence programmes 

in some cases contain relatively conservative 

estimates. The deteriorations occurred despite 

the fact that fiscal balances were supported by 

a favourable economic environment, which 

resulted in higher than expected revenues in a 

number of countries. The cyclical contribution to the budget was 
mostly positive or neutral. Nevertheless, the 

only countries with a tightening fiscal stance 

were Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, Poland and the 

United Kingdom. In Cyprus and Hungary, 

temporary measures had a decreasing impact of 

more than 0.5% of GDP on the deficit in 2005. 

By contrast, the deficit of Slovakia increased in 

2005 on account of one-off expenditures. 
Expenditure execution was mostly kept close to 
planned spending paths. However, as in 2004, 

some governments, including those of the 

Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and 

Slovakia, used some of the excess revenue to 

finance additional expenditure rather than to 

improve their fiscal balances. 
Based on the decisions of the ECOFIN Council 
of 5 July 2004, six non-euro area Member 

States (the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, 

Malta, Poland and Slovakia) were found to be 

in a situation of excessive deficit. Of these 

countries, Cyprus reduced its deficit to below 

3% of GDP in 2005, as required by the 

corresponding Council decision. By contrast, 

according to the latest updates of convergence 

programmes, the deficits increased in the Czech 

Republic, Hungary and Slovakia (albeit, in the 

case of Slovakia, on account of a one-off debt 

remission of a magnitude of 0.8% of GDP). 

Cyprus, Malta and Poland complied with the 

consolidation benchmark of a positive change 

in the cyclically adjusted budget balance of at 

least 0.5% of GDP, net of one-off and other 

temporary measures. Hungary again showed 

significant slippage relative to its budget target 

for 2005, which was revised upwards from 3.6% 

to 6.1% of GDP. The Council decided twice, in 

accordance with Article 104(8) of the Treaty, 

that no effective action had been taken by 

Hungary to correct the excessive deficit (see 

also Section 1.1 of Chapter 4). The United 

Kingdom recorded a deficit ratio above the 

3% of GDP reference value for the third 

consecutive year. The ECOFIN Council decided 

on 24 January 2006 that an excessive deficit 

existed in the United Kingdom and issued a 
79ECB Annual Report
2005recommendation in accordance with Article 
104(7) of the Treaty, calling for the excessive 

deficit to be corrected as soon as possible and 

by the financial year 2006/07 at the latest. 
In 2005 the debt ratio of most non-euro area EU Member States remained well below the euro 

area average. Only Cyprus and Malta continued 

to record ratios above the 60% of GDP reference

80ECB Annual Report
2005BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS 
The combined current and capital account of 
the non-euro area EU Member States continued 

to vary considerably across countries in 2005 

(see Table 9). While Sweden and Denmark 

reported sizeable surpluses, the United 

Kingdom and the new EU Member States 

recorded deficits. The deficits in Estonia, 

Latvia and Malta remained very high Œ at 

around or above 10% of GDP Œ albeit declining 

in the former two countries, while Cyprus, 

Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia recorded 

current and capital account deficits of more 

than 5% of GDP. The Czech Republic, Poland, 

Slovenia and the United Kingdom reported 

more moderate deficits in their current and 

capital accounts. Although large current account deficits in some 
countries could signal risks to the sustainability 
of external positions, such deficits are, to some 

extent, also a normal feature of catching-up 

economies, such as the new Member States, 

where capital inflows allow financing of high-

return investments that it would not have been 

possible to undertake solely on the basis of 

domestic savings. Although external imbalances 
in most countries originated mainly from 
deficits in goods, income deficits Œ often linked 

to the repatriation of profits from foreign-

owned firms and thus to past FDI inflows Œ 

were another important source in a number of 

cases. The recent developments in the current 

account should be interpreted with some 

caution, as they are influenced to some extent 

by methodological changes in the compilation 

of trade data following EU accession. 
In most new EU Member States, FDI Œ partly 
associated with privatisation programmes Œ 

continued to be an important source of external 

financing. Net FDI inflows increased slightly 

in 2005, compared with 2004, for this group of 

countries as a whole (see Table 9). Net FDI 

inflows (in terms of GDP) were particularly 

sizeable in Estonia, where they were strongly 

affected by one large transaction. They also 

continued to be rather strong in the Czech 

Republic and Malta. Net FDI inflows were 

positive in all the new Member States apart 

from Slovenia, which recorded rather balanced 

net FDI flows in 2005. As regards the other 

non-euro area EU Member States, Sweden and 

Denmark witnessed net outflows of FDI, which

2005were rather sizeable in the case of Sweden, 
whereas net FDI inflows to the United Kingdom 

were strongly positive. Overall, although net 

FDI flows constituted an important source of 

financing for a number of the non-euro area 

Member States in 2005, in most cases these 
inflows were not sufficient to cover the deficit 

in the combined current and capital account. 
Net portfolio investment flows also contributed 
significantly to the financing of current account 

deficits in 2004 and 2005 in Cyprus, Hungary 

and Poland, compared with rather moderate 

inflows in previous years. This development 

reflected mainly higher net debt inflows Œ 

which, in some cases, could have been partly 

related to yield differentials Œ but net equity 

inflows also gained in importance. Partly as a 

result of the additional financing provided by 

net inflows in portfolio investment and also 

other investment, the external indebtedness of 

some countries relative to GDP also rose. 
ERM II AND EXCHANGE RATE-RELATED ISSUES
In 2005 four new EU Member States joined 

Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Denmark in 

ERM II: Cyprus, Malta and Latvia entered the 

mechanism on 2 May 2005 and Slovakia on 
28 November 200
5, all with a standard 
fluctuation band of ±15% around their central 

rates against the euro. Prior to ERM II entry, 

both the Cyprus pound and the Latvian lats had 

already been unilaterally pegged to the euro. 

While the Cyprus pound had been pegged to the

of the IMF, whose value is based on a basket of

2005 and retained a ±1% fluctuation band. 
Following ERM II entry, the Latvian authorities 

announced that they would unilaterally maintain 

the exchange rate of the lats at the central rate 

against the euro with a fluctuation band of ±1%. 

Upon joining the mechanism, the Maltese lira 

was re-pegged to the euro from a basket 

arrangement which included the euro, the pound 

sterling and the US dollar. Moreover, the 

Maltese authorities declared that they would 

unilaterally maintain the exchange rate of the 

Maltese lira at the central rate against the 
euro. In the case of the Slovak koruna and 

the Cyprus pound, the authorities did not 

undertake any formal unilateral commitment 

to a narrower band. Unilateral commitments 

place no additional obligations on the ECB.

the participating countries have committed

2005rates since joining the mechanism. The Danish 
krone also continued to trade close to its central 

rate in 2005. Following ERM II entry, the 

Cyprus pound strengthened somewhat against 

the euro in the first two months, before 

stabilising about 2% stronger than the central 

rate in the second half of 2005. The Latvian lats 

remained unchanged on the strong side of the 

standard fluctuation band and close to the upper 

limit of its unilaterally announced band. 

Since joining ERM II, the Slovak koruna has 

exhibited greater volatility than the other 

ERM II currencies and has traded up to 3.2% 

stronger than its central rate (see Table 10). 
Most of the currencies of the non-euro area 
Member States outside ERM II strengthened 
against the euro in 2005, but less so on a trade-

weighted (effective) basis, as this was partially 

counterbalanced by their depreciation against 

the US dollar and the currencies linked to the 

US dollar. In the first half of 2005 the Polish 

zloty and the Czech koruna experienced a 

partial reversal of their strong appreciation in 

2004, but resumed their appreciation in the 
second half of the year. On 24 February 2006 

these currencies had strengthened significantly 

against the euro compared with their levels at 

the beginning of 2005, implying a depreciation 

of the euro of 7.2% and 6.6% respectively (see 

Chart 37). The Hungarian forint, by contrast, 

depreciated amid significant exchange rate 

fluctuations, which were mainly related to a 

deteriorating fiscal outlook, over the year as a 

whole. On 24 February 2006 the forint was 

trading at almost 3% lower than its level at the 

beginning of 2005. Movements in interest rate 

differentials seem to have affected the Swedish 

krona and the pound sterling. Whereas the 

Swedish krona depreciated rather strongly 

against the euro throughout most of 2005 on 
account of a widening negative interest rate 

differential vis-à-vis the euro area, the pound 

sterling strengthened against the euro in 2005 
and early 2006 Œ by almost 4% Œ amid notable 

fluctuations. Chart 37

MONETARY POLICY 
The primary objective for monetary policy in 
all non-euro area EU Member States is price 

stability. Monetary policy strategies differ 

considerably from country to country, reflecting 

the heterogeneity among them in nominal, real 

and structural terms (see Table 11). In 2005, 

with the exception of the entry of Cyprus, 

Latvia, Malta and Slovakia into ERM II, the 

monetary policy and exchange rate regimes of 

the non-euro area EU countries remained 

largely unchanged, although some refinements 

were made to the monetary policy frameworks 

in a few countries with a view to future 

monetary integration. 
Regarding monetary policy decisions in 2005 in 

countries with an exchange rate objective, 

Danmarks Nationalbank increased its key policy 

rate by 25 basis points to 2.4% as a consequence 

of the ECB™s interest rate increase on 1 December 

2005. It raised its rate further Œ by 10 basis 

points to 2.5% Œ on 17 February 2006 owing to 

an outflow of foreign exchange in February, 

among other things as a result of Danish 

institutional investors™ purchases of foreign 

shares and other securities. The Central Bank of 

Cyprus decreased its minimum bid rate by a 

total of 125 basis points to 3.25% by the end 

of 2005, in order to help curb appreciation 

pressures arising from improved investor 

confidence in the economic outlook, which 

resulted from the improvement in public finances 

and the Cyprus pound™s entry into ERM II.

84ECB Annual Report
2005Turning to the non-euro area EU countries with 
an inflation-targeting framework in place, most 

countries reduced their key policy rates in 2005. 

In light of the improved inflation outlook 

Hungary, Poland and Slovakia reduced their 

policy rates by a total of 350, 200 and 100 basis 

points to 6%, 4.5% and 3% respectively. In 

Slovakia, the interest rate decisions were also 

motivated by the currency appreciation. In 

Poland, the key policy rate was further decreased 

by 25 basis points to 4.25% in January 2006. In 

Sweden and the United Kingdom, key policy 

rates were lowered in 2005 by 50 and 25 basis 

points to 1.5% and 4.5% respectively, reflecting 

weakening output growth and lower prospective 

inflation. However, in Sweden, policy rates 

were raised by 25 basis points to 1.75% in 

January 2006 and by a further 25 basis points to 

2.0% in February 2006. The decisions were 

based on the December 2005 and February 

2006 Inflation Reports™ forecasts (given a rising 

path for short-term interest rates). In the Czech 

Republic, policy rates were reduced by a total 

of 75 basis points in the first half of 2005 in 

light of a favourable inflation outlook and the 

appreciating koruna, although they were raised 

again by 25 basis points, to 2%, towards the end 

of October in line with the latest inflation 
forecast and the related risks. 
FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSIn 2005 movements of long-term bond yields in 

the majority of the non-euro area EU Member 

States followed those of similar rates in the 

euro area and showed a general decline until 

September, after which they increased 

somewhat, particularly in Hungary and Poland. 

In Lithuania and Slovenia, long-term interest 

rates declined gradually to the euro area level, 

whereas in Malta and the United Kingdom they 

were somewhat more stable. Overall, for most 

of the countries, long-term interest rates were 

between 20 and 55 basis points lower at the end 

of 2005 than at the beginning of the year, with 

stronger declines recorded for Latvia, Poland, 

Slovakia and, in particular, Cyprus (of more 

than 200 basis points). With euro area long-

term interest rates declining by around 

30 basis points during 2005, bond yield spreads 
vis-à-vis the euro area remained stable or 
narrowed. However, spreads vis-à-vis the euro 

area increased rather markedly in Hungary and 

Poland in the final quarter of the year. Market 

reaction reflected unfavourable fiscal trends in 

Hungary and uncertainty concerning fiscal 

developments and economic policy after 

parliamentary elections in Poland. 
Stock markets in the non-euro area EU countries 
continued to perform favourably in 2005 and, 

with the exceptions of Slovenia and the United 

Kingdom, outperformed the average stock price 

developments in the euro area, as measured by 

the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index. At the end 

of 2005, stock prices in the new EU Member 

States, with the exception of Slovenia, were 

between 25% and 65% higher than at the 

beginning of the year.

CHAPTER 2CENTRAL BANK OPERATIONS
AND ACTIVITIES88ECB Annual Report
20051.1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS
The operational framework for the 
implementation of the single monetary policy
1 continued to work effectively in 2005. Very 

short-term money market interest rates were 

stable throughout the year. The EONIA 

registered very low levels of volatility in 2005. 

The standard deviation of the spread between 

the EONIA and the minimum bid rate stood at 

5 basis points, as compared with 9 basis points 
in 2004 and 16 basis points in 2003.
Developments in late 2005 provided the first 
opportunity to test, to some extent, the 

capability of the operational framework Œ as 

amended in March 20042 Œ to neutralise within a maintenance period the impact of a change in 
expectations regarding the key ECB interest 

rates. After more than two years of anticipating 

no change in interest rates, the money market 

was affected in November 2005 by expectations 

of an interest rate increase. Following a 

statement by the President of the ECB on 

18 November prior to the Governing Council 

meeting of 1 December, the overnight rate rose 

by up to 12 basis points. However, it started to 

fall a few days later and, following a liquidity 

allotment above the benchmark
3 in the last main 
refinancing operation (MRO) of the maintenance 

period, which was accompanied by an 

explanatory statement, it moved closer to its 

former levels. It therefore seems that, despite 

the initial reaction, the alignment of the start of 

the maintenance period with the implementation 

of interest rate change decisions effectively 

helped to avoid significant and lasting 

interference from expectations of interest rate 

changes during the preceding maintenance 

period. ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY 

CONDITIONSThe Eurosystem™s liquidity management relies 

on the daily assessment of the liquidity 

conditions in the euro area banking system in 
order to determine the liquidity needs of the 

system and thus the volume of liquidity to be 

allotted in the weekly MROs, in the monthly 
1 MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS, FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENT 

ACTIVITIESlonger-term refinancing operations (LTROs) 
and potentially through other open market 

operations such as fine-tuning operations. The 

liquidity needs of the banking system are 

defined by the sum of reserve requirements 

imposed on banks, by funds held in excess of 

these requirements on credit institutions™ 

current accounts with their NCBs (excess 

reserves) and by autonomous factors (see 

Chart 38). The latter are a set of items on the 

Eurosystem™s balance sheet which have an 

impact on banks™ liquidity needs but are 

not normally under the direct control of 

the Eurosystem™s liquidity management 

(e.g. banknotes in circulation, government 

deposits and net foreign assets).Chart 38

found in the ECB publication entitled ﬁThe implementation of 

monetary policy in the euro area: General documentation on 

Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and proceduresﬂ, 

February 2005.
2  Two changes were introduced in March 2004: i) the timing of 
the reserve maintenance periods was adjusted so that these 

periods always start on the settlement date of the main 

refinancing operation (MRO) following the Governing Council 

meeting at which the monthly decision on the monetary policy 

stance is scheduled, and ii) the maturity of the MROs was 

shortened from two weeks to one week. See the ECB™s Annual 

Report 2004, pp. 82-83.
3  The benchmark amount is the allotment amount normally 
required to establish balanced conditions in the short-term 

money market, given the Eurosystem™s complete liquidity 

forecast. The published benchmark allotment is rounded to the 

nearest 500 million.Source: ECB.
89ECB Annual Report
2005In 2005 the daily liquidity needs of the euro 
area banking system amounted to 377.4 billion 
on average, representing an increase of 21% 

compared with 2004. On average, reserve 

requirements stood at 146.5 billion, excess 
reserves at 
0.8 billion and autonomous factors 
at 230.1 billion. Among the autonomous 
factors, banknotes continued to show the 

strongest annual rate of growth. The average 

amount of banknotes recorded an annual growth 

rate of around 15%, which was similar to that in 

2004. Banknotes reached an all-time high of 

568 billion on 24 December 2005.MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS
The MROs are weekly liquidity-providing 
operations with a maturity of one week, 

conducted as variable rate tenders with a 

minimum bid rate following the multiple rate 

auction procedure. The MROs are the most 

important open market operations conducted by 

the Eurosystem as they play a pivotal role in 

steering interest rates, managing the liquidity 

situation in the market and signalling the stance 

of monetary policy through the level of the 

minimum bid rate.To help credit institutions to prepare their bids 
in the MROs, the ECB continued in 2005 to 

publish a forecast each week of the daily 

average autonomous factors and the benchmark 

amount. The purpose of this communication 

policy is to avoid misperceptions in the market 

as to whether or not the allotment decisions in 

MROs aim to balance liquidity conditions.
In 2005 the amounts allotted in MROs ranged 
from 259.0 billion to 333.5 billion. The 
average number of bidders in an MRO was 351, 
thus remaining at similar levels to those 

observed in 2004 after the changes to the 

framework had been implemented. The liquidity 

provided through MROs represented 77% of 

the overall net liquidity supplied by the 

Eurosystem through monetary policy 

operations. The average spread between the 

marginal rate and the minimum bid rate 

amounted to 5.3 basis points, compared with 

1.6 basis points in 2004 and 4.7 basis points in 
2003. The spread remained generally stable at 

5 basis points for the first three quarters of 

2005, but started to drift upwards in September, 

reaching 7 basis points in mid-October. At that 

point the ECB communicated its uneasiness 
with regard to the rise and initiated a policy of 

allotting slightly more than the benchmark 

amount, while still aiming for balanced 

conditions at the end of the reserve maintenance 

period. This ﬁloose allotment policyﬂ effectively 

led to the stabilisation of the spread between 

the marginal rate and the minimum bid rate at 

5 basis points.FINE-TUNING OPERATIONS
As a consequence of the changes to the 

operational framework implemented in March 

2004, the scope increased for liquidity forecast 
errors to accumulate during the eight-day 

period between the last MRO of a maintenance 

period and the end of that maintenance period. 

The absolute difference between the forecast 

and the actual outcome over eight days reached, 

on average, 
7.16 billion in 2005. In order to 
prevent these errors from triggering significant 

recourse to standing facilities, and to avoid 

large spreads between the overnight rate and 
90ECB Annual Report
2005the minimum bid rate, the ECB carried out 
fine-tuning operations on the last day of the 

reserve maintenance period whenever it 

expected a notable liquidity imbalance. In total, 

nine fine-tuning operations were carried out, 

three of them liquidity-providing (18 January, 

7 February and 6 September) and six liquidity-

absorbing (8 March, 7 June, 12 July, 9 August, 

11 October and 5 December). They all aimed at 

restoring balanced liquidity conditions and 

contributed to stabilising the overnight rate at 

the end of the reserve maintenance periods.
LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS
The LTROs are liquidity-providing operations 

conducted on a monthly basis. They are usually 

allotted on the last Wednesday of the month and 

have a three-month maturity, thereby giving 

banks the opportunity to cover their liquidity 

needs for a longer period of time. In contrast to 

the MROs, the LTROs are not used to signal the 

Eurosystem™s monetary policy stance. They are 

conducted as pure variable rate tenders with a 

pre-announced allotment volume, and the 

Eurosystem therefore acts as a rate-taker.
LTROs accounted for around 23% of the total 
net liquidity provided through open market 

operations in 2005. The allotment volume for 

each operation increased from 25 to 
30 
billion in January 2005 and to 
40 billion in 
January 2006.
STANDING FACILITIES
The two standing facilities offered by the 

Eurosystem, i.e. the marginal lending facility 

and the deposit facility, provide and absorb 

overnight liquidity at interest rates which form 

a corridor for the interbank overnight rate. In 

2005 the width of the corridor remained 

unchanged at 200 basis points, centred around 

the minimum bid rate of the MROs.
In 2005 the average daily recourse to the 
marginal lending facility amounted to 
106 million, while the average daily recourse to 

the deposit facility totalled 
122 million. The 
low recourse to the standing facilities in 2005 

was in line with previous years and reflects the 
high efficiency of the interbank market, as well 
as the lower liquidity imbalances observed on 

the last day of each reserve maintenance period. 

This reduction in liquidity imbalances is 

consistent with the more frequent recourse in 
2005 to fine-tuning operations in the event of 

notable liquidity forecast errors.
MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM
Credit institutions in the euro area must hold 
minimum reserves on accounts with the NCBs. 

The minimum reserves amount to 2% of a credit 

institution™s reserve base, which is determined 

in relation to elements of the institution™s 

balance sheet. The minimum reserve obligation 

must be fulfilled on average over a reserve 

maintenance period. The system has two 

functions: first, to stabilise short-term money 

market rates through the averaging provision, 

and second, to enlarge the liquidity deficit, 

i.e. banks™ overall need for refinancing from the 

Eurosystem. The amount of reserve requirements 

gradually increased in 2005, reaching 
153 billion during the last maintenance period of 
the year.
ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY 

OPERATIONS 
With the aim of protecting the Eurosystem from 

incurring losses, all Eurosystem credit 

operations are required to be based on adequate 

collateral. Owing to the special nature of 

European financial markets and the 

Eurosystem™s operational framework for 

monetary policy, a broad range of assets are 

accepted as collateral. The average amount 

of eligible marketable collateral was 
8.3 
trillion in 2005, which was 7% higher than in 

2004 (see Chart 39). General government debt 

comprised 53% of the total, with the remainder 
taking the form of covered (i.e. Pfandbrief-

style) or uncovered credit institution bonds 

(29%), corporate bonds (9%), asset-backed 

securities (5%), and other bonds, such as those 
issued by supranational organisations, (4%). 

The average value of marketable assets 

deposited by counterparties as collateral against 

Eurosystem credit operations stood at 
866 91ECB Annual Report
2005billion in 2005, compared with 
787 billion in 
2004 (see Chart 40).
Chart 41 illustrates the difference between the 
assets eligible to be used as collateral and those 

actually put forward as collateral in Eurosystem 

credit operations, broken down by asset type. 

Government debt accounted for 53% of the 

available marketable collateral, but only 34% 

of collateral put forward. However, credit 

institution uncovered bonds accounted for 14% 

of available marketable collateral, but for 27% 

of the amount of collateral put forward. Asset-

backed securities accounted for 5% of available 

collateral, but for 10% of the collateral used. There were a number of important developments 
with regard to the Eurosystem™s collateral 

policy during 2005. First, the Eurosystem 

finalised its reformulation of the eligibility 

criteria for asset-backed securities. This was 

necessary as asset-backed securities are 

becoming an increasingly important source of 

collateral in Eurosystem operations, and 

counterparties were calling for greater 

transparency regarding the types of asset-

backed securities which are accepted. The 

amended criteria were announced in January 
2006 and will be applicable from May 2006. 
The asset-backed securities which are currently 

on the list of eligible assets but do not comply 

with the criteria will be phased out by October 

2006.The Eurosystem also made explicit the 
minimum credit standard that has consistently 

been applied when accepting assets as collateral 

since the single currency was introduced Œ 

namely, at least a ﬁsingle Aﬂ credit rating from 

one of the three major international rating 

agencies. The ﬁsingle Aﬂ credit rating is 

equivalent to a long-term rating of at least A- 

from Standard & Poor™s or Fitch Ratings, or at 

least A3 from Moody™s. It was also clarified 

that this requirement applies in the same way to 

private and public sector issuers.
Progress was also made in the move towards 
establishing a single list of collateral which 

will gradually replace the present two-tier 

collateral system. It is expected that the single 

list will increase the availability of collateral, 

enhancing the level playing-field in the euro 

area, further promoting equal treatment for 

counterparties and issuers, and increasing the 

overall transparency of the collateral framework.

92ECB Annual Report
2005list Œ the inclusion of bank loans Œ would take 
place according to the following time frame: 
Œ Bank loans will be eligible as collateral for 
Eurosystem credit operations in all euro 

area countries from 1 January 2007, when 

common eligibility criteria and the 

Eurosystem credit assessment framework 

(ECAF) will be implemented. The ECAF is 

a set of procedures and rules establishing 

the Eurosystem™s requirement that all 

eligible collateral in the future single list 

meet high credit standards (see below). 
Œ Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 
2011 an intermediate regime will be in 

place, allowing each euro area NCB to 

determine the size threshold above which 

loans will be eligible for collateral purposes 

and to decide whether a handling fee should 

be applied.Œ As from 1 January 2012 a unified regime 
will be in place for the use of bank loans as 
collateral with a common minimum 

threshold of 500,000. In July 2005 the Governing Council approved 
the general eligibility criteria that bank loans 
will have to fulfil and, in November 2005, also 

approved the core elements of the ECAF, which 

will ensure that debtors meet the Eurosystem™s 

high standards of financial soundness. 

Implementation work for the bank loans 

framework is under way. The final technical 

and operational details regarding the inclusion 

of bank loans will be announced during the first 

half of 2006.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
When conducting credit operations for monetary 

policy or payment system purposes, the 

Eurosystem incurs both credit and market risks 

associated with potential counterparty default. 

These risks are mitigated by the requirement to 

provide adequate collateral, as laid down by 

Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, in 

conjunction with an appropriate valuation of 

collateral and risk control measures. 
The first two main measures towards 
implementing the single list entered into force 

in 2005:Œ First, the list of non-regulated markets 
acceptable to the Eurosystem from a 

collateral management point of view was 

published on 30 May. The list is available on 

the ECB™s website and will be updated at 

least once a year. Assets listed, quoted or 

traded only on non-regulated markets that 

are not included in this list will remain 

acceptable until May 2007, after which date 

they will become ineligible.
Œ Second, a new category of previously 
ineligible collateral, namely euro-

denominated debt instruments issued by 

entities established in those G10 countries 

that are not part of the EEA, was introduced 

into the tier one list on 1 July. The total 

amount of new eligible collateral amounted 

to 137 billion at the end of 2005. The use 
of these new instruments gradually increased 

throughout the second half of 2005, reaching 

5.3 billion by the end of December. 
In February 2005 the Governing Council 
announced that the next step towards the single

93ECB Annual Report
2005The ECAF will be effective as of 1 January 
2007. It relies on four sources of credit quality 
assessment: external credit assessment 

institutions, NCBs™ in-house credit assessment 

systems, counterparties™ internal ratings-based 

systems and third-party providers™ rating tools. 

Consistency, accuracy and comparability will 

be the core principles underpinning the ECAF.
In order to ensure that these core principles are applied, all credit quality assessment sources 

will have to fulfil certain eligibility criteria. In 

addition, a set of technical specifications and 

tools Œ including a credit quality threshold and 
a credit assessment performance monitoring 

and reporting procedure Œ will be used to 

guarantee that eligible collateral meets the 

minimum creditworthiness standards.
As regards the benchmark for credit risk, the 
Eurosystem will in principle only accept the 

debt instruments of borrowers:
Œ with at least a ﬁsingle Aﬂ rating from one of 
the three major international rating agencies; 

orŒ with a probability of default of no more than 
0.10%, which includes borrowers belonging 

to a risk bucket with an expected one-year 

probability of default of no more than 

0.10%.This definition applies equally to private and 
public issuers as required by Article 102 of the 

Treaty, which prohibits the ECB from granting 

more favourable terms to public sector debt 

instruments.
1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS 
In 2005 the ECB did not undertake any 

interventions in the foreign exchange market for 

policy reasons. Its foreign exchange transactions 

were exclusively related to investment activity. 

Furthermore, the ECB did not undertake any 

foreign exchange operations in the non-euro 

area currencies that participate in ERM II.
The standing agreement between the ECB and 
the IMF to facilitate the initiation of special 

drawing rights (SDR) transactions by the IMF 

on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders 

was activated on five occasions in 2005.
1.3 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES 
The ECB™s investment activities are organised 

in such a way as to ensure that no insider 

information about central bank policy actions 

may be used when making investment decisions. 

A set of rules and procedures, known as the 

Chinese wall, separates the ECB business units 

involved in investment activities from other 

ECB business units.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENT
The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio reflects 

transfers of foreign reserves from the euro area 

NCBs to the ECB, as well as past foreign 

exchange and gold operations of the ECB. The 

main purpose of the ECB™s foreign reserves is 

to facilitate intervention by the ECB in the 

foreign exchange market. The objectives for the 

management of the ECB™s foreign reserves are, 

in order of importance, liquidity, security and 

return. In 2005 the ECB™s foreign reserves were 

managed in a decentralised way, with each NCB 

holding and actively managing a fraction of the 

ECB™s portfolio.
94ECB Annual Report
2005The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio mainly 
consists of US dollars, but also includes 

Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. Gold and SDR 

holdings were not actively invested in 2005. 

The ECB carried out gold sales amounting to 

47 tonnes of gold in total. These sales were in 

full conformity with the Central Bank Gold 

Agreement of 27 September 2004, of which the 

ECB is a signatory. The value of the ECB™s 

official foreign reserve assets at current 

exchange rates and market prices increased 

from 35.1 billion at end-2004 to 41.0 billion at end-2005. The change in the value of the 

portfolio during 2005 mainly reflected the 

appreciation of the US dollar and gold vis-à-vis 

the euro as well as the positive returns 

(comprising capital gains and interest income) 
generated by portfolio management activities.
In January 2006 a new operational framework 
was implemented for the ECB™s foreign reserve 

management. The changes to the framework 

were introduced in order to increase the 

efficiency of the decentralised execution of 

investment operations within the Eurosystem. 

In the area of the operational management of 
the ECB™s foreign reserves (i.e. the carrying-

out of operations to invest those funds), each 

euro area NCB may now as a rule manage only 

one portfolio (i.e. either a US dollar or a 

Japanese yen portfolio). However, two NCBs 

each manage two portfolios. Furthermore, a 

euro area NCB may choose to opt out of the 

operational management of the ECB™s foreign 

reserves while still being involved in strategic 

portfolio management activities, such as 

strategic benchmark reviews and reviews of the 

risk control framework. Euro area NCBs that 

choose to take part in the operational 

management may also pool these activities. 
In 2005 work continued on extending the list of 
eligible instruments in which foreign reserves 

can be invested. In early 2006 foreign exchange 

swaps and US STRIPS
4 were added to this list. 
Preparatory work for the introduction of interest 

rate swaps was also carried out.
OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT 
The ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of the 

paid-up share of the subscribed capital and the 
general reserve fund of the ECB. The purpose 

of this portfolio is to provide the ECB with a 

reserve to meet possible losses. The objective 

of its management is to generate returns over 

the long term in excess of the average main 

refinancing rate of the ECB. In 2005 the list of 

issuers of instruments eligible for investment 

was further expanded in the very high-grade 

agency and covered bond segment. In early 

2006 senior unsecured bonds issued by financial 

sector firms with high credit ratings were added 

to the list of investment options.
The ECB™s own funds portfolio at current 

market prices grew from 
6.1 billion at 
end-2004 to 6.4 billion at end-2005, reflecting positive portfolio management returns in the 

form of capital gains and interest income.
RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES
The framework used by the ECB to mitigate the 

financial risks it incurs (such as market, credit and 

liquidity risk) is implemented, inter alia, via 

stringent policy requirements (such as restrictions 

in terms of duration, currency distribution and 

minimum portfolio liquidity) and a detailed limits 

system, whereby compliance is monitored and 

verified on a daily basis. In 2005 preparations 

were made for the implementation of Value-at-

Risk (VaR)
5 as the main tool for defining 
thresholds for the risks associated with portfolio 

managers™ trading positions relative to the ECB™s 

reference benchmark portfolios. VaR offers several 

conceptual advantages and, as a comprehensive 

risk measure, has gained wide popularity in the 

financial industry. This is also evidenced by the 

importance it has been accorded by the New Basel 

Capital Framework in relation to the calculation of 

capital requirements. 4  STRIPS stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and 
Principal of Securities, which are securities created by 

separating the bond principal from the interest payments in a 

US government bond.
5  VaR is defined as the loss amount that may be exceeded with a 
certain probability over a predefined time horizon. For instance, 

the one-year 99% VaR is the loss that will be exceeded within 

one year with only a 1% probability.
95ECB Annual Report
2005The Eurosystem has the statutory task of 
promoting the smooth operation of payment 

systems. Its main instrument for carrying out 

this task Œ besides the oversight function Œ is 

the provision of payment and securities 

settlement facilities. To this end, the Eurosystem 

has created the Trans-European Automated 

Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 

system, known as TARGET, for large-value 

payments in euro. TARGET has been subject to 

enhancements over the past few years, and work 

is under way to develop a second-generation 

system, TARGET2.
In August 2005 the ECB released a policy 
statement on ﬁCentral banks™ provision of retail 

payment services in euro to credit institutionsﬂ. 

While recalling the Eurosystem™s statutory 

backing for the provision of processing facilities 

for retail payments in euro for credit institutions, 

it noted, inter alia, that NCBs which offer retail 

payment services to credit institutions take due 

account of the requirements and competitive 

environment of the market concerned, including 

cost recovery.
With regard to securities settlement, the 
Eurosystem and the market offer a number of 

channels to facilitate the use of collateral across 

national borders.2.1 THE TARGET SYSTEM
The present TARGET system is a ﬁsystem of 

systemsﬂ made up of the national real-time 
gross settlement (RTGS) systems of 16 EU 

Member States, the ECB payment mechanism 

(EPM) and an interlinking mechanism that 

enables the processing of payments between the 

linked systems. 
In 2005 TARGET contributed further to the 
integration of the euro money market and, 

because the Eurosystem™s credit operations are 

processed via this system, continued to play an 

important role in the smooth implementation of 

the single monetary policy. On account of its 

real-time settlement service in central bank 
2 PAYMENT AND SECURITIES SETTLEMENT 
SYSTEMS
money and its broad market coverage, the 
TARGET system also attracts a variety of other 

payments. TARGET functioned smoothly and 

successfully in 2005 and continued its trend of 

settling an increasing number of large-value 

euro payments. This is in line with the 

Eurosystem™s policy objective of promoting 

settlement in central bank money as a uniquely 

safe means of payment. In 2005 89% of the 

total turnover of large-value payments in euro 

was executed via TARGET. TARGET is 

available for all credit transfers in euro between 

connected banks, without any upper or lower 

value limit. Such transfers may be made both 

between banks in the same Member State (intra-

Member State traffic) and between those in 

different Member States (inter-Member State 

traffic).
A survey conducted in 2005 revealed that as 
at 31 December 2004 there were 10,564 

participants in TARGET. Overall, around 

53,000 institutions, in particular branches of 

participants, can be addressed through TARGET 

using a Bank Identifier Code.
TARGET OPERATIONS
In 2005 the daily average of payments processed 

by TARGET increased by 10% both in volume 

and in value. Table 12 provides an overview of 

the payment traffic in TARGET in 2005, 

comparing it with the traffic in the previous 

year. 
In 2005 the overall availability of TARGET, i.e. 
the extent to which participants were able to 

use TARGET during its business hours without 

incident, reached 99.83% (see Table 13). On 

average, 95.59% of inter-Member State 

payments were processed within five minutes. 
96ECB Annual Report
2005CONTINGENCY MEASURES FOR SYSTEMICALLY 
IMPORTANT PAYMENTS IN TARGET
Owing to the TARGET system™s pivotal role in 

the market and its broad market coverage, 

suitable protection against a wide range of 

threats is essential for the reliable and smooth 

functioning of the system. It is of the utmost 

importance that systemically important 

payments Œ i.e. those that could cause a systemic 

risk if not processed when due Œ be carried out 

without delay, even in abnormal circumstances. 

The Eurosystem has established contingency 

measures to ensure that such payments are 

processed in an orderly manner, even in the 

event of TARGET malfunctioning. In 2005 a 

number of further trials were carried out by 

central banks (often involving commercial 

banks), and these proved the effectiveness of 

the TARGET contingency measures. They 

confirmed that the Eurosystem is in a good 

position to ensure that payment systems and 

financial markets can continue to function 

smoothly in a crisis situation.
TARGET CONNECTION FOR THE NEW EU MEMBER 

STATES
In October 2002 the Governing Council decided 

that, following EU enlargement, the NCBs of 

the new Member States would be allowed Œ but 

not obliged Œ to connect to the current TARGET 

system. Given the limited remaining lifetime 

of the current TARGET system, and in order 

to save costs, the Eurosystem developed 

alternatives to full integration which allow the 

NCBs of the new Member States to connect 

their systems to the current TARGET system.
Poland was the first new Member State to join 
TARGET. On 7 March 2005 Narodowy Bank 

Polski™s euro RTGS system (SORBNET-EURO) 

was connected to TARGET via the Banca 

d™Italia™s RTGS system (BI-REL).

97ECB Annual Report
2005RELATIONS WITH TARGET USERS AND REAL-TIME 
GROSS SETTLEMENT OPERATORS OF OTHER 

CURRENCY AREASThe ESCB maintains close relations with 

TARGET users in order to ensure that their 

needs are given due consideration and receive 

an appropriate response. In 2005, as in previous 

years, regular meetings were held between the 

16 NCBs linked to TARGET and the national 

TARGET user groups. In addition, joint 

meetings of the ESCB™s Working Group on 

TARGET2 and the TARGET Working Group of 

the European banking industry were held to 

discuss TARGET operational issues. Strategic 

issues were addressed in the Contact Group on 

Euro Payments Strategy, a forum in which the 

senior management of commercial and central 
banks is represented. The Eurosystem, as 

operator of one of the largest RTGS systems in 

the world, maintains close contacts with the 

RTGS operators of other currency areas. 

Increasing interrelations, such as those 

stemming from Continuous Linked Settlement 

operations, have created the need for joint 

discussions on operational issues. 2.2 TARGET2
 On 8 February 2005 the ECB published the first 
progress report on TARGET2. The report 

contained information about the decisions taken 

by the Governing Council in December 2004 on 

the TARGET2 service, the general pricing 

framework for the core service and the migration 

to TARGET2. It also provided an overview of 

the overall project planning.
The second progress report was published on 
21 October 2005. It presented the decisions 

made by the Governing Council mainly in 

respect of the planned start date of TARGET2, 

the dates for the different migration windows, 

and the pricing of the liquidity pooling service 

and ancillary system settlement. It also outlined 

a pricing scheme for the TARGET2 core service 

which will be discussed with the banking 

community before a final decision is taken. 

Finally, the report provided details on the 
timetable of the TARGET2 operational day and 

the ongoing work related to contingency 

arrangements.
The main preparatory work undertaken in 2005 
related to the finalisation of the functional 

specifications. An interim version of the User 

Detailed Functional Specifications (UDFS) was 

completed at the end of August 2005, in close 

collaboration with the TARGET user 

community. The final UDFS (version 2.0) were 

made available to users on 30 November. The 

finalisation allowed progress to be made on the 

development and technical implementation of 

the single shared platform for TARGET2, as 

well as on the adaptation of the internal systems 

of the individual participants for connection to 

the new system. 
With regard to the planned start date, the 
Governing Council communicated to the market 

on 17 June 2005 that the period of extensive 

user consultation had been concluded and that 
the go-live date for the first migration window 

would be during the second half of 2007. After 

a comprehensive assessment of the planning 

arrangements, 19 November 2007 was set as 

the go-live date for the first group of countries 

to migrate. All central banks participating in 

TARGET2, together with their national banking 

communities, are expected to be using the new 

system by May 2008. Sveriges Riksbank and 
98ECB Annual Report
2005the Bank of England have decided not to 
connect to TARGET2.
Another major area of work in 2005 focused on 
the preparations for the forthcoming testing 

and migration activities. The Eurosystem 

agreed to split the migration into four waves, 

with the last wave being reserved for 

contingency purposes only. Each wave will 

consist of a group of NCBs and their respective 

banking communities. The planned dates 

of each migration wave are as follows: 

19 November 2007, 18 February 2008, 19 May 

2008 and 15 September 2008 (in the event that 

the contingency window has to be used). In 

May 2005 the Eurosystem published national 

migration profiles describing the usage of the 

different modules from the date the central 

banks will migrate to TARGET2. Testing will 

be carried out with users according to migration 

waves. For each wave, tests will be split into 

different streams, for example at the institutional 

level, at the level of national banking 

communities and at the European level. Testing 

activities with central banks are planned to start 

in early 2007. At the end of October 2005 a 

general description of the planning and 

organisational aspects of the user testing 

activities was published on the websites of the 

NCBs.The envisaged pricing scheme for the core 
service aims to meet two main objectives. First, 

it should ensure broad access to the system, 

which means that it should not discourage 

smaller institutions from direct participation. 

Second, the pricing should be attractive to the 

major market participants, which account for a 

very large share of the current TARGET 

transactions. The scheme presented in the 

second progress report allows participants to 

choose between i) a small monthly fee of 
100 plus a flat rate of 0.80 per transaction and ii) a 
monthly fee of 
1,250 plus a volume-based 
degressive fee ranging from 
0.60 to 0.20 per transaction. The monthly fee is a fixed amount 

payable by each participant per settlement 

account. The average fees under the envisaged 
pricing scheme are, in almost all countries 
concerned, considerably lower than those of the 

existing TARGET system. All central banks, 

irrespective of their individual migration dates, 

will apply TARGET2 prices only when the 

countries in the third migration group have 

joined the shared platform, i.e. as from May 

2008. Work was also conducted on the contractual 
and other legal issues relating to TARGET2, 

as well as on the business framework 

(e.g. contingency arrangements and interaction 

with ancillary systems). The Eurosystem will 

continue its fruitful dialogue and close 

cooperation with the TARGET community for 

the remainder of the project and will report 

regularly on the progress made.
2.3 CROSS-BORDER USE OF COLLATERAL
Eligible assets may be used across national 

borders to collateralise all types of Eurosystem 
credit operation mainly by means of the 

correspondent central banking model (CCBM) 

or through eligible links between euro area 

securities settlement systems (SSSs). The 

CCBM is provided by the Eurosystem, while 

eligible links are a market-led solution. 
The amount of cross-border collateral held by 
the Eurosystem increased from 370 billion in December 2004 to 444 billion in December 
2005. Overall, at the end of 2005 cross-border 

collateral represented 49.1% of the total 

collateral provided to the Eurosystem. These 

figures confirm the trend observed in previous 

years of increasing integration of financial 

markets in the euro area and the growing 

willingness of counterparties to hold in their 

portfolios assets located in another euro area 

country.
THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODELThe CCBM has remained the main channel 
for transferring cross-border collateral 

in Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday 
99ECB Annual Report
2005credit operations. It accounted for 36.7% of the total collateral provided to the Eurosystem in 

2005. Assets held in custody through the CCBM 

increased from 298 billion at the end of 2004 to 353 billion at the end of 2005.Work on the review of the CCBM™s technical 
and operational set-up started in 2005 in view 

of the forthcoming implementation of the new 

Eurosystem collateral framework approved by 

the Governing Council in July 2005. This 

framework foresees a single list of eligible 

assets and allows bank loans to be used as 

collateral in any euro area country. Furthermore, 

initial steps have been taken to integrate some 

of the new EU Member States into the CCBM 

framework in view of the future enlargement of 

the euro area.As there is no comprehensive market alternative 
to the CCBM service, which was designed as an 

interim arrangement in the absence of a market 

solution throughout the euro area, the ECB 
started an analysis of possible ways to develop 

the operational framework for collateral 

management in the Eurosystem.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES 

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
National SSSs can be linked by means of 

contractual and operational arrangements to 

allow the cross-border transfer of eligible 

securities between systems. Once eligible 

securities have been transferred via such links 

to another SSS, they can be used through local 

procedures in the same way as any domestic 

collateral. 59 links are currently available to 

counterparties, of which only a limited number 

are actively used. Furthermore, these links only 

cover part of the euro area. Links become 

eligible for Eurosystem credit operations if 

they fulfil the Eurosystem™s nine user standards.
6 The Eurosystem assesses any new links or 

updates of eligible links against these standards. 

In 2005 three existing eligible links were 

updated and positively assessed. 
Collateral held through links increased from 72 billion in December 2004 to 91 billion in December 2005. This represented 8.6% of the 
total collateral, cross-border and domestic, held 

by the Eurosystem in 2005. 
In 2005 the Eurosystem decided that relayed 
links between SSSs could be used for the cross-

border transfer of collateral to the Eurosystem. 
A relayed link is a contractual and technical 

arrangement that allows two SSSs which are 

not directly connected to settle a transaction 

through a third SSS. To prevent the Eurosystem 

from being exposed to any unacceptable risks, 

a relayed link used by market participants will 

be considered eligible only if the link itself and 

the SSSs it links comply with the Eurosystem 

user standards. In this context, a methodology 

for the assessment of relayed links by the 

Eurosystem has been developed. A first wave 

of assessments of relayed links started in 

2005. 6 ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in

100ECB Annual Report
20053.1  THE CIRCULATION OF EURO BANKNOTES 
AND COINS AND THE HANDLING OF 

CURRENCYDEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINS
In 2005 the value of euro banknotes in 
circulation increased by 
63.9 billion to 
565.2 billion (see Chart 42). The annual growth rate 

declined to about 12.8%, from 15.0% in 2004. 

The number of banknotes in circulation 

increased to 10.4 billion at the end of 2005, at 

an annual growth rate of 7.4%, compared with 

6.8% in 2004 (see Chart 43). Statistical analyses 

indicate that the continuing increase in demand 
for euro banknotes originates to some extent 

from markets outside the euro area. It is 

estimated that, in value terms, between 10% 

and 20% of the euro banknotes in circulation 

are held by non-euro area residents, mainly as a 

store of value or as a parallel currency.
The value of the euro banknotes in circulation 
continued to grow more strongly than the 

number in 2005, as it has done every year since 

the cash changeover. This indicates a lasting 

strong demand for high-denomination euro 

banknotes. The growth patterns of the individual 

denominations were similar to those in 2004: 

the circulation of 5, 10, 20 and 200 
banknotes rose moderately at rates between 

3.1% and 3.9%, while the circulation of 
50, 100 and 500 banknotes increased strongly, at 
3 BANKNOTES AND COINS
11.4%, 10.8% and 20.9% respectively (see 
Chart 44).
The euro coins in circulation have continued to 
increase in terms of both volume and value 

since January 2003. In 2005 the value of euro 

coins in circulation (i.e. the net circulation 
excluding stocks held by NCBs) increased by 

8.5%, from 
15.3 billion to 16.6 billion. The 
number of euro coins in circulation grew by 

12.1%, from 56.2 billion to 63.0 billion. The 

strong increase in the number of coins was 

mainly driven by a growing demand for low-

value coins. 
BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEM
2005 saw a continuation of the slight upward 

trend in euro banknote issuance and deposits 

seen in previous years. The total number of 

euro banknotes issued amounted to 31.3 billion, 

while 30.6 billion were returned to the NCBs.
All euro banknotes returned from circulation to 
the euro area NCBs are authenticated and 

checked for circulation fitness using fully 

automated banknote-processing machines. 

Approximately 1 billion more banknotes than 

in the previous year were checked in this way 

in 2005. Some 4.3 billion banknotes were 

destroyed because they were soiled or worn and 

thus no longer fit for circulation.

20053.2 BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITING AND 
COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCECOUNTERFEIT EURO BANKNOTES 
The number of reported counterfeit euro 
banknotes remained stable in 2005. From the 

beginning of 2004 until the end of 2005, around 

49,000 counterfeits per month were removed on 

average from circulation. The total number of 

counterfeits received by National Analysis 

Centres7 in 2005 was around 582,000. This is 
very similar to the figure for 2004 (594,000). 

The public can be confident in the security of 

the euro: it is a well-protected currency, in 

terms of both the sophistication of its security 

features and the effectiveness of European and 

national law enforcement authorities. However, 

the ECB™s advice to the public is to be alert and 

to remember the ﬁfeel-look-tiltﬂ test.8 Chart 45

intervals since the euro banknotes were 
launched. Table 14 shows that the 
50 banknote has been the most frequently counterfeited; 

since 2004 the proportion of 
50 counterfeits 
has risen, whereas the proportion of 
100 
counterfeits has shown a corresponding fall. 
COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCEThe ECB continues to work closely with the 

euro area NCBs, Europol and the European 
Commission (in particular the European Anti-

Fraud Office, OLAF) in the fight against 

counterfeiting of the euro. The Eurosystem is 

active, both in the EU and beyond, in training 

cash-handling professionals in the recognition 

and handling of counterfeit banknotes. 
The International Counterfeit Deterrence 
Centre (ICDC) evaluates new reproduction 

equipment and counterfeit deterrence systems 

and supports the Central Bank Counterfeit 

Deterrence Group (a group of 27 central banks 

collaborating under the auspices of the 

governors of the G10 central banks). The growth 

in the deployment of counterfeit deterrence 

systems has resulted in a significant increase in 
7 Centres established in each EU Member State for the initial 
analysis of counterfeit euro banknotes at the national level.

2005framework, taking into account the national 
situation (e.g. the economic environment, the 

banking structure, the existing NCB branch 

network and the role of the NCB in the cash 

cycle), at the latest by the end of 2006. In 

addition, there will be a transition period of 
two years Œ finishing no later than the end 

of 2007 Œ for the adaptation of procedures 
and machines currently in operation by 

credit institutions and other professional cash handlers. A key element of the framework is the obligation 
of credit institutions and other professional 
cash handlers to check for authenticity and, 

according to minimum sorting standards, for 

fitness all euro banknotes received from 

customers and reissued to other customers. 
Where credit institutions and other professional 
cash handlers decide against the recycling of 

banknotes, they will continue to have the option 

of having their euro banknote requirements met 

by the NCBs. 
Banknotes dispensed by credit institutions 
through automated teller machines (ATMs) will 

be checked using banknote-handling machines 

which have been tested for their compliance 

with the framework by euro area NCBs. Other 

organisations which operate ATMs, particularly 

retailers, are also expected to check banknotes 

in accordance with these standards. The 

Eurosystem will follow developments in this 

area.The framework also stipulates that credit 
institutions and other professional cash handlers 
are to provide NCBs with information regarding 

their cash-handling activities to enable the 

Eurosystem to monitor compliance with the 
framework. The Governing Council decided in 

December 2004 that the details of this data 

collection would be developed by the 

Eurosystem in consultation with the banking 

sector. To this end, the Eurosystem set up a joint 

task force in 2005 with representatives from the 

European Payments Council™s Cash Working 

Group and the European Security Transport 

Association. In a cost-effective approach, a

3.3 BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION
FRAMEWORK FOR THE DETECTION OF 
COUNTERFEITS AND FITNESS SORTING  
In order to ensure that the banknotes in 

circulation are genuine and in good condition, 

the ECB in January 2005 published a framework 

for the detection of counterfeits and fitness 

sorting by credit institutions and other 

professional cash handlers. The framework sets 

out a common policy for the recycling of 

banknotes received by credit institutions and 

other professional cash handlers from their 
customers. In addition, it provides these 

institutions with assistance in fulfilling their 

obligations as laid down in Article 6 of Council 

Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 regarding the 

detection and withdrawal of counterfeit euro 

banknotes. In order to safeguard consistency in 

the implementation of the framework across the 

Eurosystem, the Governing Council adopted a 

manual of procedures in December 2005. The 

NCBs will be responsible for implementing  the 
103ECB Annual Report
2005limited amount of key information concerning 
the cash-handling infrastructure and operational 

data on banknote processing will be collected 
from institutions that recycle euro banknotes 

through ATMs. 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EXTENDED 

CUSTODIAL INVENTORY PILOT PROGRAMME
The ECB is considering the establishment of an 

extended custodial inventory (ECI) pilot 

programme for euro banknotes to facilitate 

their international distribution and to improve 

the monitoring of their circulation outside the 

euro area, given that between 10% and 20% of 

the total value of euro banknotes in circulation 

is estimated to be held outside the euro area. An 

ECI is a cash depot maintained by a private 

bank (ECI bank) that holds currency on a 

custodial basis. Under such a programme, ECI 

banks would report on the destination and 

origin of banknotes traded, collect information 

on counterfeits seized and identify any 

banknotes unfit for circulation, thereby 

providing the Eurosystem with data on the use 

of the euro outside the euro area and on 

counterfeiting. ECI banks could also channel 
information concerning the introduction of a 

new series of euro banknotes and facilitate 

replacement of an old series. Before taking a 
final decision on the establishment and 

functioning of such a programme, the ECB 

will consider launching a one-year ECI pilot 

programme with two banks located in Asia.
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS
A total of 3.63 billion euro banknotes were 

produced in 2005, compared with 1.6 billion in 

2004. The production growth in 2005 reflected 

the following factors: i) the depletion of NCBs™ 

stock levels in 2004, ii) an increase in circulation 

in 2005, iii) a rise in the number of banknotes 
in circulation requiring replacement and iv) the 

decision to produce in 2005 a share of future 
banknote requirements. This decision should 

reduce expected future production peaks and 

allow a more efficient use of the production 

capacity over the coming years.
The allocation of euro banknote production continued in 2005 to be based on the 

decentralised production scenario with pooling 
adopted in 2002. Under this arrangement, each 

euro area NCB is responsible for the 

procurement of an allocated share of the total 
requirement for certain denominations. 

Table 15 summarises the 2005 production 

allocation. THE SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTES
Following the Governing Council™s approval of 

the master plan for the development, printing 

and issuance of a second series of euro 

banknotes, work on this project has started and 

is progressing well. The main phases of the

and technical requirements of different groups 

of banknote users, industrial validation to 

identify potential problems in large-scale 

printing, design and origination, pilot 

production, large-scale printing and phased 

issuance.Basic functional requirements for the new 
banknotes, including a shortlist of security 

features, are being established on the basis of 

market research and consultations with 

European consumer associations and the 

European Blind Union. The consultation 

process has also involved the European banking, 

security transport, retail and vending machine 

sectors, as well as the association of banknote 

equipment manufacturers.
The first banknote in the new series is expected 
to be issued towards the end of this decade. The 

exact timing and sequence of issuance will 

depend on the progress made in the security 

feature innovation process and on the 

counterfeiting situation. The current 

denominational range of the euro banknotes 
will be maintained in the second series and 

the design will be based on the ﬁages and stylesﬂ 

theme of the present series. 105ECB Annual Report
2005The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, collects, 
compiles and publishes a wide range of statistics 

which support the monetary policy of the euro 

area as well as various tasks of the ESCB. In 

2005, as in previous years, the provision of 

statistics proceeded smoothly. In addition, 

new statistics became available in accordance 

with the ECB™s medium-term strategy for 

statistics, and the ECB continued to contribute 

to the harmonisation of statistical concepts 

and the promotion of their observance in 

cooperation with Community institutions and 
other international organisations. 
4.1 GENERAL STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN 
THE EURO AREA
Over the last few years significant results have 

been achieved in developing statistics for the 

euro area. The statistical framework for the 

euro area aims to accommodate in a forward-

looking manner ongoing changes in financial 

markets and the economy in general, while 

addressing remaining statistical gaps identified 

by users inside and outside the ECB. In 

fulfilling these objectives, the ECB is firmly 

committed to being cost-effective and to 

keeping the reporting burden to a minimum. 

Proposals for new or substantially changed 

statistics are thus subject to a cost-benefit 

assessment involving reporting agents and 

compilers as well as users. 
Highest priority is being given to the design 
and compilation of a system of quarterly 

financial and non-financial accounts by 

institutional sector for the euro area, which the 

Eurosystem is preparing together with the 

European Commission (Eurostat) and the 

national statistical institutes (NSIs). This 

integrated system of accounts is expected 

to be ready in 2007. It will show the 

interaction among various sectors of the 

economy, namely non-financial corporations, 

financial corporations, government and 

households, as well as the interaction between 

these sectors and the rest of the world. It will 

provide a framework for analysing the links 
4 STATISTICS
between the financial and non-financial 

developments in the economy, in particular 

with respect to balancing items such as 

household and corporate savings and investment, 

government deficit and GDP. Over time, it 

should thus be possible to gain further insights 

into the various transmission channels of 

monetary policy and to better analyse the 

impact of economic shocks on the euro area. 
Ultimately, the quarterly euro area accounts 

will allow the monitoring of a wide range 

of statistics and key indicators within a single 

and coherent macroeconomic accounting 

framework. 
The ECB is also developing a framework for 
the collection of harmonised statistics on non-

monetary financial intermediaries (excluding 

insurance corporations and pension funds), 

with a particular focus on investment funds, 

thereby addressing the increasingly important 

role of these institutions in euro area financial 

markets.
Preparing for the future enlargement of the euro 
area constitutes another core element of the 
ECB™s medium-term strategy for statistics. The 

ECB has been working closely with the NCBs 

of the non-euro area Member States to ensure 
that the wide range of data for which the ECB 

is primarily responsible are reported from the 

date those countries join the euro area. A 

general policy has been adopted for the 

transmission of relevant back data by all EU 

Member States in order to ensure that 

sufficiently long time series will be available 

for any enlarged euro area. 
The ECB cooperates closely with Eurostat and 
other international organisations and is actively 

involved in the ongoing update of global 

statistical standards such as the System of 

National Accounts (SNA 93) and the IMF 

Balance of Payments Manual. The further 

development and application of internationally 

agreed statistical standards, as well as 

governance rules in the field of statistics, 

enables the compilation of meaningful euro 

area aggregates, allows cross-country 
106ECB Annual Report
2005comparisons and contributes to the reliability and independence of official statistics. 
4.2 NEW OR ENHANCED STATISTICS
The amended ECB Regulation concerning the 

consolidated balance sheet of MFIs entered into 
force on 1 January 2005. This Regulation 

obliges credit institutions and money market 

funds to continue to report data on deposits and 

loans at nominal value, regardless of the 

application of International Financial Reporting 

Standards on financial instruments, thus 

ensuring that the conceptual basis of monetary 

statistics is preserved.
Since January 2005 the ECB has published a 
geographical breakdown of the euro area 

balance of payments and international 

investment position. Since April 2005 the 

international investment position has been 

released on a quarterly basis. These new 

statistics provide greater insight into the effects 

of cross-border transactions and positions on 
the euro area economy.
In September 2005 the ECB started publishing 
statistical indicators measuring the degree of 

integration in the main financial markets of the 

euro area, namely the money, bond, equity and 

banking markets. These indicators range from 

retail lending to wholesale equity trading (see 

Section 3 of Chapter 3).Some further changes were made to the ECB™s 
legal framework to enable the publication of 

new statistics in the future. As part of the above-

mentioned strategy to compile an integrated set 

of quarterly euro area financial and non-

financial accounts by institutional sector, the 

Governing Council amended the ECB Guideline 

on quarterly financial accounts. This will 

ensure a more comprehensive and timely 

provision of quarterly financial accounts from 

2006, with a complete breakdown by sector and 

instrument, as well as counterpart sector 

information for deposits and loans (from 2008). 

Moreover, the adoption of the ECB Guideline 
on government finance statistics facilitated the 
integration of government sector statistics into 

the quarterly euro area accounts by institutional 

sector. Quarterly figures for both the euro area 

public debt and the deficit-debt adjustment 

have been published since November 2005.
In line with the ECB™s commitment to improve 
the availability and quality of statistics for the 

euro area, the Governing Council adopted 

measures in 2005 to permit, for statistical 

purposes only, the exchange of confidential 

statistical information between statistical 

authorities. Sharing information Œ under terms 

of strict confidentiality Œ avoids multiple 

requests for the same information from 

reporting entities. 
In order to facilitate the achievement of 
the Single Euro Payments Area (see Chapter 3), 

the Governing Council also endorsed the 

European Commission™s intention to increase 

the threshold for balance of payments reporting 

of euro-denominated payments within the EU. 

The proposal would imply that, from January 

2008, banks will no longer have to report cross-

border customer payments in euro below 

50,000. Further improvements were made in 2005 
regarding the dissemination and accessibility 

of statistics. For some statistics, tables 

containing both euro area aggregates and all 

national contributions to these aggregates 

became available on the ECB™s website and on 

the websites of most euro area NCBs. Work 

also continued on providing policy-makers, the 

media, analysts, academics and other users of 

statistics with easier access to the statistical 
information on the ECB™s website. This work is 

scheduled to be completed in the second half of 

2006. 4.3 STATISTICS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF 
CONVERGENCE The Treaty states that convergence reports have 

to be prepared by the ECB and the European 
107ECB Annual Report
2005Commission at least once every two years, or at 
the request of a Member State not participating 

in the euro area. The next convergence reports 

will be released in 2006.
The statistical data needed to examine the 
extent to which Member States have fulfilled 

the convergence criteria on prices, fiscal 

positions, exchange rates and long-term interest 

rates are provided by Eurostat. The ECB, 

together with the NCBs of the Member States 

concerned, assists Eurostat with the provision 

of long-term interest rate statistics and collects 

and compiles additional statistical data which 

supplement the four primary indicators. 
As the assessment of the convergence process 
crucially hinges on the quality and integrity of 

the underlying statistics, recent developments 

in the compilation and reporting of statistics, 

particularly government finance statistics, have 

been closely monitored by the ECB. In this 

context, the ECB welcomes the initiatives 

carried out by the European Commission in 

2005 regarding the implementation of a Code 

of Practice for Eurostat and the NSIs. Adherence 

to this code is expected to reinforce the 

independence, integrity and accountability of 

the national and Community statistical 

authorities, which is crucial for the production 

of high quality and reliable statistics in the 

EU. 
108ECB Annual Report
2005The objective of economic research at the ECB, 
as well as in the Eurosystem as a whole, is to 

provide a strong conceptual and empirical basis 

for policy-making. Economic research within 

the Eurosystem thus focuses on increasing 

knowledge of the functioning of the euro area 

economy and providing analyses, models and 

other tools relevant to the conduct of the euro 

area™s monetary policy and the fulfilment of 

other tasks of the Eurosystem.5.1 RESEARCH AGENDA
The research agenda in 2005 can be broken 

down into six main areas: macroeconomics and 

monetary economics; international economics 

and finance; financial stability; financial 

integration; macroeconometric modelling and 

forecasting tools; and general economic and 
structural issues. 
In the area of macroeconomics and monetary 

economics, projects finalised in 2005 focused 

on explaining risk premia in bond yields with 

economic fundamentals, thus allowing more 

precise market-based inflation expectations to 

be extracted, as well as on analysing non-

Ricardian households and financial market 

imperfections, such as credit constraints and 
their role in the monetary transmission 

mechanism. Further topics examined were the 

relevance of asset price movements for monetary 

policy, the identification of appropriate policy 

rules, the role of money, the importance of 

central bank communication and differences in 

economic developments across the euro area.
In the area of international economics and 

finance, the focus was on the exchange rate 

pass-through, the international transmission of 

shocks, risk-sharing in a monetary union, the 

determinants of global imbalances and the 

information obtained from the yield curve. 
Research on financial stability issues 
concentrated on developing new techniques to 

measure the risk of bank instability. In the area 

of financial integration, major research was 
5 ECONOMIC RESEARCH
carried out on the design and calculation of 

indicators of financial integration in both 

the euro area and the new EU Member States 

(see Box 10). Research was also completed on 

the public good factor of TARGET2. 
Significant progress was made in the field of 
macroeconometric modelling in 2005 with 

respect to the ECB™s new area-wide model. The 

model has been built in line with recent 

developments in macroeconomic theory. By 

comparison with earlier models, the new 

generation of macroeconometric models, known 

as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 

(DSGE) models, are based to a much larger 

extent on microeconomic foundations and allow 

a more detailed analysis of economic 

disturbances. The results of the technical work 

on the new area-wide model, together with the 

first empirical results of another DSGE model 

incorporating monetary and financial variables, 

were presented at a joint conference with the 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System and the IMF in December 2005. 
Further work has been undertaken to improve 
the short-term projections of euro area inflation 

and GDP growth. This has involved analysing 

the transmission of shocks across countries, 

sectors and industries, examining the predictive 

power of ﬁglobalﬂ inflation trends and 

investigating the appropriate model selection 

procedures. Additional research explored 

the comparative advantages of forecasting 

aggregate and disaggregate series and examined 

the informational content of high frequency 

data. In the area of general economic and structural 
issues, research in 2005 shed light on the impact 

of labour market institutions, the factors 

underlying labour supply and the national 

differences in job-flow dynamics and real 

wages. Further research was conducted on the 

effects of fiscal reform, especially with regard 

to the new EU Member States. 
Most of the results of the research activities 
carried out within or in cooperation with the 
109ECB Annual Report
2005ECB were presented in the ECB™s Working 
Paper series and Œ to a lesser extent Œ the ECB™s 

Occasional Paper series, as well as at various 

conferences and workshops. 145 ECB Working 

Papers were published in 2005 (as compared 

with 126 in 2004). Of these, 68 (72 in 2004) 

were compiled with the involvement of ECB 

staff, while 77 (54 in 2004) were written by 

non-ECB staff in the context of research visitor 

programmes or conferences organised by the 

ECB. A considerable number of the Working 

Papers produced by ECB staff since the series 

was launched in 1999 have been published or 

are forthcoming in academic journals (123) or 

books (22). Given the long lags in publication 

resulting from the peer review process, this 

already significant proportion will increase in 

2006. Chart 46 illustrates the clear focus on 

policy-relevant research at the ECB. It 

categorises ECB Working Papers by topic, 

using the Journal of Economic Literature 

classification types. ﬁMacroeconomics and 

monetary economicsﬂ is the most common topic 

covered in the series, followed by ﬁmathematical 

and quantitative methodsﬂ, ﬁfinancial 

economicsﬂ and ﬁinternational economicsﬂ.
Throughout the year the ECB hosted a number 
of conferences and workshops, such as the 

workshop on ﬁMonetary policy implementation 

in the euro area: lessons from the past and 
challenges aheadﬂ; the third conference of the 

International Research Forum on Monetary 

Policy; a conference entitled ﬁWhat effects is

5.2 RESEARCH NETWORKS
ECB research is often conducted within the 

framework of organised networks. These are 

groups of researchers jointly engaged in broad, 

multi-purpose projects and may include 

economists from the ECB, euro area NCBs, 

other central banks and policy-making 

organisations, as well as academics. The ECB 

provides coordination and organisational 

support for these networks, alone or with other 

institutions.The Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network, 
which brought together researchers from all 

Eurosystem central banks, was created in 2003 

for the purpose of analysing the dynamics of 

inflation in the euro area and in the national 
economies. The network finalised its work in 

2005. A wide range of data was used to study 

the phenomena of inflation persistence and 
price-setting, including individual and sectoral 

data on consumer and producer prices, 

macroeconomic inflation rates and survey 

results. 23 research papers related to the 

network™s activities appeared in the ECB™s 

Working Paper series in 2005. Feedback from 

the academic community was collected in 

presentations at the Annual Meeting of the 
American Economic Association and the 
Annual Congress of the European Economic 

Association (see Box 4 for further details). 
The Euro Area Business-Cycle Network, 
organised in collaboration with CEPR, provides 

a forum for the study of the euro area business 

cycle. It brings together researchers from 

academia, central banks and other policy 

institutions. In 2005 the network organised a 

third training school, hosted by the Banca 

d™Italia, which addressed topics in the areas of 

applied time series and forecasting. Two 

workshops were also organised, one on the need 

for a real-time database for the euro area, hosted 
by the Nationale Bank van België/Banque 

Nationale de Belgique, and the second on 

productivity and the business cycle in the euro 

area and the United States, hosted by Suomen 

Pankki Œ Finlands Bank. The research output of 

the network is available in an online research 

paper database (251 papers) and in a discussion 

paper series jointly published with CEPR.
The Research Network on Capital Markets and 
Financial Integration in Europe, launched in 

2002 by the ECB and the Center for Financial 

Studies (CFS), aims to stimulate policy-relevant 

research on the integration of the financial 

systems in Europe and their international links. 

The ECB and the CFS decided to continue the 

activities of the network until 2007, adding 

three priority areas: (i) the relationship between 

financial integration and financial stability, (ii) 

EU accession, financial development and 

financial integration and (iii) financial system 

modernisation and economic growth in Europe. 

The ﬁLamfalussy Fellowshipﬂ research 

programme, established within the framework 

of the network, was also extended to these 

areas. In 2005 the Oesterreichische 

Nationalbank hosted and co-organised an ECB-

CFS research network conference in Vienna on 

financial development, integration and stability 

in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe 

(see Box 10 for further details).
111ECB Annual Report
20056.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITION OF 
MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED 

ACCESSPursuant to Article 237(d) of the Treaty, the 

ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring 

the compliance of the 25 EU NCBs and the 

ECB with the prohibitions implied by Articles 

101 and 102 of the Treaty and Council 

Regulations (EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. 

Article 101 prohibits the ECB and the NCBs 

from providing overdraft facilities or any other 

type of credit facility to governments and 

Community institutions or bodies, as well as 

from purchasing debt instruments directly from 

them. Article 102 prohibits any measure, not 

based on prudential considerations, which 

establishes privileged access by governments 

and Community institutions or bodies to 

financial institutions. In parallel with the ECB, 

the European Commission monitors Member 
States™ compliance with the above provisions. 
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ 
secondary market purchases of debt instruments 

issued by both the domestic public sector and 

the public sector of other Member States. 

According to the recitals of Council Regulation 

(EC) No 3603/93, the acquisition of public 

sector debt instruments in the secondary market 

must not be used to circumvent the objective of 

Article 101 of the Treaty. Such purchases 

should not become a form of indirect monetary 

financing of the public sector.
In 2005 the Governing Council identified two 
cases of non-compliance with the above Treaty 

requirements and the associated Council 

Regulations. The Banca d™Italia and the 

Oesterreichische Nationalbank reported 

primary market purchases of debt instruments 

issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB). 

On 13 October 2005 the Banca d™Italia bought 
USD-denominated EIB securities amounting 
to USD 10 million for the purpose of 

foreign exchange reserve management. On 

14 September 2005 the Oesterreichische 

Nationalbank bought EUR-denominated EIB 

securities amounting to 200 million. Since the 6 OTHER TASKS AND ACTIVITIES
EIB is a Community body, such purchases 
constitute a breach of the monetary financing 

prohibition according to Article 101 of 

the Treaty and Council Regulation (EC) 

No 3603/93. In the case of the Banca d™Italia, 

the EIB debt instruments purchased in the 

primary market were sold on 8 March 2006. 

The Oesterreichische Nationalbank sold the 

EIB debt instruments purchased in the primary 

market at the end of October 2005. Moreover, 

both NCBs took immediate measures to avoid 

the occurrence of such events in the future.
In 20049 the Governing Council found one case 
of non-compliance by an NCB with the above 

Treaty requirements and the associated Council 

Regulations. In the context of the strong reflows 

of national coins to the NCBs as a result of the 
introduction of the euro banknotes and coins 
on 1 January 2002, Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands 

Bank from October 2001 to February 2004 

exceeded the limit of 10% of coins in circulation  

laid down in Article 6 of Council Regulation 

(EC) No 3603/93. The situation was fully 

corrected in March 2004, however, and the 

Treaty provisions have been respected since 

that date.6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS
Article 105(4) of the Treaty requires that the 

ECB be consulted on any proposed Community 

or national legislation which falls within the 

ECB™s fields of competence.
10 All ECB opinions 
are published on the ECB™s website. Since 

January 2005 opinions on draft national 

legislation have, as a rule, been published 

immediately after their adoption and subsequent 

transmission to the consulting authority, 

following the procedure already in place for 

opinions on proposed EU legislation. In June 
9 The reference to the events concerning 2004 in this Annual 
Report is explained by the fact that the corresponding 

monitoring exercise by the ECB ended after the cut-off date for 

the Annual Report 2004.
10 In accordance with the Protocol on certain provisions relating to 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as 

annexed to the Treaty, the obligation to consult the ECB does 

not extend to the United Kingdom.
112ECB Annual Report
20052005 the ECB published a ﬁGuide to consultation 
of the European Central Bank by national 

authorities regarding draft legislative 

provisionsﬂ, which is designed to provide 

practical assistance and information to national 

authorities. The ECB adopted 61 opinions in 2005, 13 in 
response to consultations by the EU Council 

and 48 in response to consultations by national 

authorities. This compares with 39 opinions in 

2004, with the increase being due to a higher 
number of consultations from the new Member 

States in their first full year of EU membership. 

A list of the opinions adopted in 2005 is annexed 

to this Annual Report. 
In its opinions on the new EU Council 
regulations on surveillance and on the excessive 

deficit procedure reforming the Stability and 

Growth Pact,
11 the ECB emphasised that sound fiscal policies were fundamental to the success 

of EMU and a prerequisite for macroeconomic 

stability, growth and cohesion in the euro area. 

In addition, the ECB considered it necessary to 

maintain a credible excessive deficit procedure 

including a strict time frame (see also Section 

1.1 of Chapter 4). The ECB was also consulted 

on the Council regulation regarding the future 

adoption of the euro by new Member States.
12 The ECB considered that the maximum length 

for the transitional period between the 

introduction of the euro as the currency of new 

Member States and the introduction of euro 
banknotes and coins should be no more than 

three years, and that even shorter transitional 

periods should be encouraged. The ECB also 

emphasised the importance of the requirement 

that the name of the single currency be the same 

in all official EU languages, taking into account 

the existence of different alphabets.
13 The ECB continued to be consulted by national 
authorities on issues pertaining to the independence 

of NCBs Œ including those of Italy, Lithuania, 

Slovakia and Spain Œ as members of the ESCB,
14 as well as on amendments to the Estonian, Latvian, 

Lithuanian, Slovak and Swedish central bank 
statutes, which arose in the context of the ECB™s 
Convergence Report 2004.
15 The ECB was also 
consulted by national authorities on matters 

relating to compliance with the prohibition of 

monetary financing under Article 101 of the 

Treaty, including a draft law authorising the 

Oesterreichische Nationalbank to make a deposit 

on a special account with the IMF for the benefit 

of Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility 

countries affected by natural disasters
16, and a draft law authorising the Banca d™Italia to extend 

a credit line to the Republic of Lebanon
17. The ECB concluded that the Austrian draft law 

complied with the prohibition on monetary 

financing, as it fell within the scope of the 

Community law exemption for the financing by 

NCBs of public sector obligations vis-à-vis the 

IMF.
18 In the case of the Italian draft law, however, 
the ECB concluded that the proposed financing 

would constitute a form of monetary financing 

prohibited by the Treaty. The draft law was 

subsequently withdrawn by the Italian authorities. 
The ECB was consulted by national authorities 
on legislative proposals relating to the financial 

supervisory framework.
19 In its opinion on a 
draft law establishing 
eská národní banka as the sole financial supervisory authority in the 

Czech Republic, the ECB expressed the view 
11  CON/2005/18 and CON/2005/17 of 3 June 2005.
12  CON/2005/51. The ECB was also consulted by national 
authorities in some new Member States, including Lithuania 

and Slovenia, on national legislation facilitating the future 

introduction of the euro in those Member States (see 

CON/2005/38 and CON/2005/57).
13  The ECB was also consulted on other significant draft EU acts 
which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. These 

include the proposal for a capital adequacy directive 

(CON/2005/4) and the proposal for a Council decision 

concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on securities 

held with an intermediary (CON/2005/7). For more details, see 

Section 2 of Chapter 3.14  CON/2005/25; CON/2005/30; CON/2005/34; CON/2005/38;

2005that, faced with the increasing blurring of 
traditional borders between the banking, 

securities and insurance sectors and the 

resulting challenges to prudential supervision 

and the stability of the financial system, an 

NCB with overall responsibility for the financial 

markets was likely to cope better than several 

supervisors with individual limited competence 

for a particular financial sector. In a separate 

consultation on a Czech draft insolvency law,
20 the ECB welcomed the fact that the draft 

law acknowledged 
eská národní banka™s 
responsibility for supervising banks in financial 

difficulties and for deciding when insolvency 

proceedings should be started against such 

banks.6.3 ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING AND 
LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN 

COMMUNITY In accordance with Article 123(2) of the Treaty 

and Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 

332/2002 of 18 February 2002, the ECB 

continues to have responsibility for the 

administration of the borrowing and lending 

operations of the European Community under 

the Medium-Term Financial Assistance 

mechanism. In 2005 the ECB did not perform 

any administration tasks. There was no 

outstanding balance at the end of 2004 and no 

new operations were initiated during 2005. 
Box 9
EUROSYSTEM RESERVE MANAGEMENT SERVICES
In January 2005 a new framework was introduced for the management of Eurosystem customers™ 

euro-denominated reserve assets. The new framework Œ which is available to central banks, 

monetary authorities and government agencies located outside the euro area, as well as to 

international organisations Œ provides a comprehensive range of services enabling eligible 

customers to manage their euro-denominated reserve assets in an efficient manner. The services 

range from the provision of custody accounts and related custodian (safekeeping) and settlement 

services to cash and investment services. They are offered under harmonised terms and 

conditions in line with general market standards by individual Eurosystem central banks (the 

Eurosystem service providers) acting as dedicated service providers. Eligible customers can 

access the complete set of services covered by the new framework through any one of these 

service providers. 
There are currently six Eurosystem service providers, namely the Deutsche Bundesbank, the 
Banco de España, the Banque de France, the Banca d™Italia, the Banque centrale du Luxembourg 

and De Nederlandsche Bank. The remaining Eurosystem central banks may offer some of the 

services covered by the new framework. Furthermore, both Eurosystem service providers and 

the other central banks of the Eurosystem may offer additional reserve management services in 

euro on an individual basis. The ECB performs an overall coordination role, ensuring the 

smooth functioning of the framework.
The new framework has been well received by eligible customers. On the basis of information 
collected by the ECB, the number of customers who have established a business relationship 

with one of the Eurosystem central banks appears to be representative of the population of 

eligible customers to which the new framework is addressed. With respect to the services 

themselves, customers™ total cash balances and/or securities holdings with Eurosystem central 

banks have increased by comparison with the situation prior to the introduction of the new 
20  CON/2005/36.
114ECB Annual Report
2005framework. This is particularly the case with respect to customers™ holdings of non-domestic 
government securities (i.e. securities issued by governments of countries other than that of the 

central bank with which the securities are deposited). Customers are also appreciative of the 

automatic overnight investment facility available under the new framework, which allows the 

investment of funds directly with the respective service provider and/or in the market at 

attractive remuneration rates.
In line with the way in which reserve management services have been provided for many years, 
the new framework is based on the core principles characterising the management of official 

reserves, such as financial and legal security and, most importantly, confidentiality. The reserve 

management services under the new framework are offered to traditional central bank customers, 

thus meeting the special needs and concerns of those institutions that operate in the same area 

of central banking activity as the Eurosystem itself.

CHAPTER 3FINANCIAL STABILITY 
AND INTEGRATION 
118ECB Annual Report
2005The Eurosystem contributes to the smooth 
conduct of policies pursued by the competent 

national authorities relating to the prudential 

supervision of credit institutions and the 

stability of the financial system. It also offers 

advice to these authorities and the European 

Commission on the scope and implementation 
of Community legislation in these fields. 
1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING 
The ECB, in collaboration with the ESCB™s 

Banking Supervision Committee (BSC), 

monitors risks to financial stability in order to 

assess the financial system™s shock-absorbing 

capacity.
1 The focus of the monitoring is on 
banks, as they continue to be the main 

intermediaries in the channelling of funds from 

depositors to borrowers in the euro area and as 

such are an important channel through which 

risks may spread to the rest of the financial 

system. However, owing to the increasing 

importance of other financial institutions and 

markets and their interlinkages with banks, 

vulnerabilities in these components of the 

financial system may spread to banks. The 

monitoring thus also covers developments in 

these other components.CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2005 the resilience of the euro area financial 

system strengthened. Financial institutions 

benefited from the expansion of global 

economic activity, which continued at a fairly 

robust pace despite further oil price rises, and 

from a continued improvement in the balance 

sheets of large euro area firms. In this 

environment, the profitability of euro area 

banks improved further and the balance sheets 

of insurance companies strengthened. However, 

looking ahead, financial institutions face some 

risks stemming from, for instance, the 

possibility of an abrupt unwinding of global 

imbalances, the vulnerability to a correction of 

prices Œ which have been stretched by the 

ongoing search for yield Œ in some fixed income 

and credit markets, and the possibility of 

additional increases in oil prices. In addition, 1 FINANCIAL STABILITY
household balance sheets remain vulnerable to 

the possibility of corrections in house prices in 

some countries.In the euro area banking sector, the recovery of 
large banks™ profitability that had begun in 

2003 continued also in 2005, although for those 

banks that shifted to International Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2005, it is more 

difficult to draw comparisons with past 

indicators of profitability. Importantly, the 

recovery in profitability was broad based, 

extending also to those national banking sectors 

which had experienced below average 

performances in 2003. The main sources of 

increased profitability in 2005 were reduced 

provisions, sustained growth in lending to the 

household sector (mostly for house purchases) 

and an incipient recovery in lending to the 

corporate sector. Cost-cutting, which had 

contributed to banks™ profitability in 2004, 

lessened in 2005. Provisions for loan losses continued to fall in 
2005. This was due to the low number of 

insolvencies in the household and corporate 

sectors and an only marginal deterioration in 

the quality of banks™ assets, while significant 

write-offs or write-downs of credit overdue 

from previous years, at least in some euro area 

countries, reduced the impact of credit risk on 

banks™ balance sheets. In addition, there is some 

evidence that the coverage ratio, i.e. the ratio of 

provisions to non-performing assets, fell in 

2005. However, it cannot be ruled out that the 

reduced flows, and in some countries stocks, of 

provisions could result in inadequate provisions 

in the event of an unexpected deterioration in 

the credit cycle.
The pick-up in the growth of corporations™ 
borrowing seen in 2004-05, if it continues, could 

provide banks with a desirable diversification of 
1 Since the end of 2004 the ECB has published a biannual report 
on the stability of the euro area financial system entitled 

ﬁFinancial Stability Reviewﬂ. In 2005 it also published the 

fourth edition of ﬁEU banking sector stabilityﬂ, which presents 

the main findings of the regular monitoring by the BSC of 

banking sector stability. These publications are available on the 

ECB™s website.
119ECB Annual Report
2005their sources of income away from the household 
sector. However, notwithstanding the increase in 

lending volumes, net interest income Œ the core 

component of banks™ profitability Œ continued to 

decline in 2005 due to interest rate margin 

erosion. This decline was driven by the flattening 

of yield curves, persistently low interest rates 

and the strength of competition among banks for 
loans and deposits. With regard to net non-

interest income, banks generally reported 

increased income both from fees and commissions 

and from trading activity. In some cases, these 

revenues were sufficiently large to more than 

offset reduced income from maturity 

transformation, which is banks™ core business.
Despite further improvements in some 
countries, the key regulatory solvency ratios 

for the euro area banking sector remained 

broadly unchanged in 2004, the latest year for 

which consolidated data are available. Non-

consolidated data available for a set of large 

euro area banks show some improvement in 

solvency indicators in 2005. 
The euro area insurance industry further 
improved its profitability and capital base in 

2005, although investment income remained 

subdued in an environment of low interest rates. 

The strengthening of non-life insurers™ balance 

sheets was driven by an improvement in the 

profitability of the underwriting business, 

which was the result of strict pricing discipline. 

In the life insurance sector, lower guaranteed 

rates of return on savings products contributed 

to the improvement in profitability, as did cost 

savings. Furthermore, ongoing reforms of 

public pension schemes in the euro area 

favoured the placement of private savings in 

life insurance products. In the reinsurance 

sector, a decline in the value of policies sold 

contributed to a decrease in profitability.
The global hedge fund and private equity 
industry continued to grow in 2005. Inflows 

into hedge funds proceeded throughout 2005, 
with some moderation in the second and third 
quarters linked to weaker returns in the sector. 

In particular, certain credit strategies suffered 
in spring 2005 after the downgrading of the 
credit ratings of two large US car manufacturers 

to sub-investment grade. Moreover, given the 

increasing presence of hedge funds in the 

markets for relative value instruments and 

complex structured credit products, it cannot be 

ruled out that, should credit markets endure 

further volatility, banks could be exposed to 

future losses from their activities with hedge 

funds. However, a recent survey on EU banks™ 

exposures to hedge funds
2 found that, in most 
countries, the existing direct exposures were 

generally moderate in relation to the size of 

banks™ balance sheets and by comparison with 

the exposures of similar US banks. This reflects 

the fact that the global prime brokerage market 

remains largely dominated by US financial 

institutions. Nevertheless, it remains important 

that adequate management by banks of risks 

associated with hedge funds be put in place.
STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS Structural changes in the banking industry 

can affect financial stability in the longer 

term, for instance through changes in 

competitive conditions or through increased 

internationalisation. Important structural 

developments are ongoing in the euro area 

banking sector with regard to consolidation, 

internationalisation, financial intermediation 
2  ﬁLarge EU banks™ exposures to hedge fundsﬂ, ECB, November 
2005.120ECB Annual Report
2005and funding structures. Although banking 
market structures across the euro area continue 

to differ in terms of concentration, ownership 

structure, foreign presence, and size and 

importance of delivery channels, this may 

change as a result of increased merger and 

acquisition (M&A) activity in the sector and 

other structural developments.
3The pace of consolidation at both the national 

and cross-border levels has declined over recent 

years, as illustrated by the low number of 

M&As and the slowdown in the decrease of the 

number of credit institutions.4 In the course of 
2005, however, a number of large cross-border 

M&A deals took place, confirming the 

indications of renewed interest in cross-border 

consolidation that had emerged in 2004. In 

some Member States, domestic consolidation 

among large banks may gradually be coming to 

an end, since the respective banking markets 

are already very concentrated. Therefore, apart 

from organic growth, cross-border consolidation 

has become the main expansion strategy in 

these Member States, despite the remaining 
barriers. 
There have also been signs of a gradual change 
in bank balance sheet structures, with the pace 

of lending growth exceeding that of deposit-

taking growth. This trend may reflect the 

reduced attractiveness of deposits for 

households in an environment characterised 

by persistently low interest rates and changing 

risk/return trade-offs, as well as structural 

factors, such as the changing demographic 

environment, which raises the importance of 

private pension and insurance products. It also 

implies that banks increasingly resort to funding 

through interbank markets and capital market-

based instruments.
Euro area banks also appear to be transferring 
more risks to other sectors of the economy, 

rather than solely mediating between lenders 

and borrowers, and some seem to be moving 

away from the integrated provision of financial 

services. Nevertheless, bank financing remains 
the predominant form of financial intermediation 
in the euro area.5Finally, banks are increasingly adopting more 

flexible types of organisation, outsourcing non-

core parts of their value chain and specialising 

in a specific stage of the service cycle, be it the 

origination, production, distribution or 

settlement stage. All in all, the role of banks in the euro area is gradually evolving. Direct capital market 

financing is gaining in importance and non-

traditional financial service providers may gain 

further ground in specific fields of banking, 

thus increasing the efficiency of the euro area 

financial system and transforming the risk 

landscape.1.2 COOPERATION IN FINANCIAL CRISIS 
SITUATIONS
The EU framework for cooperation between the 

competent authorities in the area of financial 

crisis management was further enhanced in 

2005. First, in May the banking supervisors, central 
banks and finance ministries of the EU agreed 

on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 

cooperation in financial crisis situations, which 

entered into force on 1 July. The MoU Œ which 

was adopted under the aegis of the Economic 

and Financial Committee Œ applies to crisis 

situations with a potential for both cross-border 
and systemic consequences affecting credit 

institutions, banking groups or banking 
3  A more detailed analysis of structural developments in the EU 
and euro area banking sectors can be found in the BSC report 

entitled ﬁEU banking structuresﬂ, October 2005, and in the 

article entitled ﬁConsolidation and diversification in the euro 

area banking sectorﬂ in the May 2005 issue of the ECB™s 

Monthly Bulletin.
4  The number of credit institutions decreased by 2.8% in 2004 
and by 2.3% in 2005 (annualised figure from information up to 

the third quarter), falling to slightly below 6,300.

2005components of financial groups, as well as to 
other systemic disturbances with cross-border 
implications in the financial markets, including 

those affecting payment systems or other market 

infrastructures. The principles and procedures 

contained in the MoU deal with the sharing of 
information, views and assessments among 

authorities and with cooperation at the national 
and cross-border level. In order to further 

support the enhanced cooperation between 

authorities, the MoU also includes arrangements 

for the development of contingency plans for 

the management of crisis situations, along with 

stress-testing and simulation exercises. The 

MoU itself will be tested in a crisis simulation 
exercise planned for 2006. 
Second, further enhancements of the crisis 
management framework, in terms of central 

banking and supervisory practices for handling 

financial crises at the cross-border level, were 

jointly considered by the BSC and the 

Committee of European Banking Supervisors 

(CEBS). 122ECB Annual Report
20052.1 GENERAL ISSUES
In July 2005 the European Commission released 
for public consultation a Green Paper on 

Financial Services Policy (2005-2010). In its 

contribution to this consultation, the Eurosystem 

underlined that an improvement to the EU 

framework for financial supervision should 

seek to exploit the potential of the Lamfalussy 

framework to the greatest extent possible.
6 The 
Eurosystem also expressed its preference for a 

further rationalisation of financial rules through 

use of the main elements of the Lamfalussy 

framework. A clearer distinction could be made 

between core principles (Level 1 legislation) 

and technical details (Level 2 legislation). This 

should be supported by further convergence in 

supervisory practices, which also plays an 

important role in ensuring a consistent 

enforcement across Member States. It also 

noted that robust and consistent cooperation 
arrangements between home and host authorities 

were particularly important for financial groups 

that are active across borders. As regards 

financial stability arrangements, the Eurosystem 

identified the monitoring of financial stability 

across borders and financial sectors, the 

management of financial stress and deposit 

insurance as areas for potential enhancement.2.2 BANKINGFollowing the release in June 2004 of the 

revised framework for the ﬁInternational 

Convergence of Capital Measurement and 

Capital Standardsﬂ, commonly known as 

Basel II, the focus of the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision (BCBS) shifted to key 

implementation issues. The BCBS has also 

pursued work in a number of technical areas. 
At the European level, Basel II has been 
introduced into EU legislation by amending the 

Codified Banking Directive and the Capital 

Adequacy Directive. The European Parliament 

and the EU Council adopted the final legislative 

texts in September and October 2005 

respectively. Member States will have to amend 
2 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
national law to incorporate the new rules, which 

will become applicable from 2007 onwards. In 

addition, at the end of 2005 the BCBS undertook 

a fifth quantitative impact study (known as the 

ﬁQIS5ﬂ) of the new capital rules. The results 

will become available in spring 2006 and may 

lead to further quantitative adjustments of the 

framework. The CEBS was also involved in the 

study. 
The ECB continues to support the work of the 
BCBS and contributes to it through its 

participation as an observer in the committee 

and its main sub-structures. In addition, the 

ECB issued an opinion on the new EU capital 

framework in which it supported the general 

thrust of the new rules.
The ECB also analysed the possible policy 
implications of increased cross-border banking 

in the EU in the context of safeguarding 

financial stability. This analysis, which was 

mainly pursued through the BSC, covers the 

areas of financial supervision, crisis 

management, financial stability monitoring and 

deposit guarantee arrangements. The results 

obtained in the latter area have proved to be 

useful for the European Commission™s review 

of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive 

that is currently under way.
7 2.3 SECURITIESIn 2005 activities in the securities sector mainly 

focused on completing the EU regulatory 

framework by adopting the outstanding Level 2 

implementing measures concerning the Market 

in Financial Instruments Directive and the 

Transparency Directive. Given the importance 

of these measures for the integration of 

European financial markets and the enhancement 

of financial stability, the ECB has closely

flows.
9 The supervisory guidance is not intended to set additional 
accounting requirements.followed, and contributed to, the work in this 
area through its participation in the European 

Securities Committee. The Eurosystem contributed to the debate on 
the review of the Lamfalussy process by 

replying to the preliminary assessment 

published by the European Commission for 

public consultation. The Eurosystem confirmed 

its positive stance with regard to the Lamfalussy 

framework. In particular, it emphasised that the 

Lamfalussy process should be used in such a 

way as to streamline existing regulatory 

requirements and develop a common set of 

harmonised technical rules that would satisfy 

the needs of both regulators and market 

participants. This common set of harmonised 

rules should provide market participants 

offering cross-border services with a single 

source of rights and obligations in the areas 

concerned.
Finally, the Eurosystem contributed to the 
debate on the enhancement of the EU framework 

for investment funds, launched by the European 

Commission™s Green Paper published on 

12 July 2005 for public consultation. The 

Eurosystem highlighted the fact that further 

efforts to remove remaining regulatory and 

legal barriers might lead to further consolidation 

in the European investment fund industry and a 

rationalisation of the products offered, with 

consequent benefits for investors and for the 

EU financial market. With regard to hedge 

funds, the Eurosystem supported the approach 

taken so far at the international level to address 

the financial stability concerns created by 

hedge funds primarily through their interaction 

with regulated firms, in particular banks.
2.4 ACCOUNTINGOn 1 January 2005 Council Regulation (EC) 

No 1606/2002 came into force, requiring all 
listed companies, including banks, to prepare 

their consolidated financial statements in 

accordance with IFRS. Given the importance of 

sound accounting standards from a financial 
stability perspective, the ECB continued to 
contribute to the work related to the 

implementation of the new accounting 

framework in the EU. 
During the first half of the year the focus was 
on the introduction in International Accounting 

Standard 39 (IAS 39) of a new option allowing 

the use of fair values
8 for all types of financial 
instrument, generally known as the fair value 

option. Progress was made in a constructive 

dialogue between the ECB, the BCBS and the 

International Accounting Standards Board 

(IASB), culminating with a letter from the 

President of the ECB to the IASB in April 2005 

supporting the proposed amendments to 

IAS 39. These amendments were subsequently 

incorporated by the IASB in June 2005. 
In this context, the ECB, via its participation as 
an observer in the Accounting Task Force of the 

BCBS, also contributed to the supervisory 

guidance developed by this task force. In July 

2005 the BCBS released for consultation a 

document entitled ﬁSupervisory guidance on 

the use of the fair value option by banks under 

International Financial Reporting Standardsﬂ, 

which mainly links Œ from a supervisory 

perspective Œ the use of the fair value option to 

sound risk management practices.
9The trustees of the International Accounting 

Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF) 

concluded a review of their constitution in April 

2005. In response to comments received during 

the consultation period, including from the ECB, 

the IASCF decided to set up a new restructured 

Standards Advisory Council for the provision of 

broad strategic advice, as well as a Trustee 

Appointments Advisory Group which is to be 

consulted before new trustees are appointed. The 

ECB is represented in both bodies.  
124ECB Annual Report
2005In the second quarter of 2005 the BSC launched 
work on an analysis of the links between 

accounting and financial stability. The work 

focuses on the financial stability implications 

of the introduction of IFRS and on whether 

these standards effectively contribute to a 

further strengthening of financial stability.
125ECB Annual Report
2005Against the background of its core tasks, the 
Eurosystem has a keen interest in financial 

integration in Europe, in particular in the euro 

area. First, a well-integrated financial system 

enhances the smooth and effective transmission 

of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro 

area. Second, financial integration has 

implications for the Eurosystem™s task of 

safeguarding financial stability. It is also 

important for the effective operation of payment 

systems and the smooth functioning of settlement 
systems. Furthermore, in accordance with 

Article 105 of the Treaty, the Eurosystem 

supports, without prejudice to the objective of 

price stability, the general economic policies in 

the Community. Financial integration, as a 

priority Community objective, can help to 

promote the development of the financial system, 

raising the potential for economic growth.
3 FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
The Eurosystem generally distinguishes 

between four types of activity through which it 

contributes to enhancing financial integration: 

(i) raising awareness of and monitoring the 

progress of European financial integration, 

(ii) acting as a catalyst for private sector 

activities by facilitating collective action, 

(iii) giving advice on the legislative and 

regulatory framework for the financial system 

and (iv) providing central banking services that 

also foster European financial integration. 

Throughout 2005 the ECB continued to pursue 

initiatives in all four areas, as described below. 

More generally, the ECB also continued its 

research activities on financial integration 

(see Box 10).
Box 10
RESEARCH NETWORK ON CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE
The ECB and the Center for Financial Studies (CFS) in Frankfurt have continued the activities 

of their research network on capital markets and financial integration in Europe.
1 The current 
second phase of research activity has been extended to include three priority areas: (i) the 

relationship between financial integration and financial stability, (ii) EU accession, financial 

development and financial integration and (iii) financial system modernisation and economic 

growth in Europe.
The first conference of the second phase of the network™s activities was hosted by the Nationale 
Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique in Brussels in May 2005 and co-organised with 

the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR). The conference was entitled ﬁCompetition, 

stability and integration in European bankingﬂ and addressed in particular the network™s 

priorities with regard to bank competition and the geographical scope of banking, as well as 

financial integration and financial stability.
One of the main topics discussed at the conference was cross-border banking in Europe. 
Analyses on foreign bank entry in emerging markets, which considered central and eastern 

European countries, Russia and Ukraine, suggested that lending by foreign-owned banks in 

these countries stimulates growth of firms in terms of sales and assets.
2 This applies even to 
smaller firms, although they still lose market share in relative terms. Moreover, foreign bank 

presence has beneficial effects on credit availability, as domestic firms face lower interest

2005rates, increase their debt-to-asset ratios and lengthen their maturity structures on the liabilities 
side. Finally, foreign bank entry appears to foster industry dynamics or ﬁcreative destructionﬂ, 

as firm entries and exits increase.
The second conference of the second phase was co-organised with the Oesterreichische 
Nationalbank, which also hosted the conference in Vienna in November 2005. The conference 

focused on ﬁFinancial development, integration and stability in central, eastern and south-

eastern Europeﬂ and addressed, in particular, the network priority on EU accession, financial 

development and financial integration. A body of results suggest that the (still small) stock 

markets of larger central and eastern European countries (CEECs), namely the Czech Republic, 

Hungary and Poland, are increasingly integrated with euro area stock markets. This is not the 

case for the stock markets of smaller CEECs. There is relatively little evidence to suggest that 

CEEC government bond markets have integrated with those of the euro area. 
The network will continue its activities in 2006 with a conference hosted by the Deutsche 
Bundesbank addressing the priority area of financial system modernisation and economic 

growth in Europe, and another hosted by the Banco de España addressing financial integration 

and financial stability.
MONITORING FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
In September 2005 the ECB published its first 

report and first set of indicators on financial 

integration. These provide an overall assessment 

of the degree of financial integration in the 

main segments of the euro area financial 

market. When assessing financial integration, a 

market for a given set of financial instruments 

or services is considered fully integrated if all 

economic agents with the same relevant 

characteristics acting in that market face a 

single set of rules, have equal access and are 

treated equally. Two broad categories of 

indicators were considered, price-based and 

quantity-based indicators. The indicators were 

either computed (in the case of standard 

deviations and ratios) or model-based (derived 

from econometric models). The range of 

indicators will be further developed, in 

particular by adding indicators related to 

financial institutions and market 

infrastructures. 
The available evidence suggests that the degree 
of integration varies greatly between market 

segments. The unsecured money market has 

been fully integrated since shortly after the 

introduction of the euro. The integration of the 

repo market is also making clear progress. 

Government bond markets became considerably 

integrated even before the start of Monetary 

Union, although some yield differentials still 

remain, reflecting, among other things, 

differences in issuers™ credit ratings and the 

liquidity of bonds. The corporate bond market 

also shows a high degree of integration, and 

progress has been made in the integration of 

equity markets. Banking markets, in particular 

the retail segment, are generally much less 

integrated. Overall, some cross-country 

differences in bank lending and deposit 

rates are still observed in the euro area 

(see Box 11).
127ECB Annual Report
2005Box 11
INTER-REGIONAL COMPARISON OF MORTGAGE RATES IN THE EURO AREA AND IN THE UNITED 
STATES 
This box analyses the degree of heterogeneity across euro area countries in the rates on loans 

to households for house purchase. The finding that euro area mortgage rates are overall more 

dispersed across countries than US rates are across regions may suggest that the euro area 

mortgage market is less integrated. In this context, it should be noted that the US data used in 

the analysis do not include dispersion within regions (i.e. across states). 
Differences in the structure of the funding of mortgage loans, which are likely to have an 
impact on the type of product provided, may explain some of the differences in the rates on 

loans for house purchase within the euro area. The euro area mortgage market is still fragmented

Notes: In order to avoid any spurious behaviour in the rates owing to low/volatile volumes, the euro area dispersion has been c
alculated including only those countries where volumes are substantial. The US data measure the dispersion across the five US regions (No
rtheast; 
Southeast; North Central; Southwest; West). It cannot be ruled out that some of the dispersion within the regions (i.e. across 
the states) is not captured and hence that the US dispersion measures would be somewhat higher if the intra-regional dispersion were includ
ed. Furthermore, the size of the respective samples may influence the degree of dispersion.

2005ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR 
ACTIVITIESThe Short-Term European Paper (STEP) 

initiative, set up and led by ACI Œ the Financial 

Markets Association, promotes convergence of 

standards in the fragmented European short-

term securities markets through market players™ 

compliance with the STEP Market Convention, 

covering disclosure, documentation, settlement 

and the provision of data. Since May 2005 the 

European Banking Federation (FBE) has been 

supporting ACI in this initiative and it will 

directly contribute to the functioning of the 

STEP market. The first STEP-labelled 

programme is expected in early 2006. 
The ECB supports this initiative by acting as a 
catalyst, for example by providing a discussion 

forum and hosting ACI™s public consultation on 

its website. The Eurosystem will also provide 

operational support. In July 2004 the Governing 

Council decided to support, in principle, the 

activities pertaining to the introduction of a 

STEP label for the first two years after its 

launch. The STEP Secretariat, managed by the 

FBE, will perform the STEP labelling with the 

support of several euro area NCBs. The 

Governing Council also decided, following an 

efficiency check regarding the collection 

process, to accept the request to produce and 

publish STEP statistics on yields and volumes 

on an ongoing basis. 
In 2005 the ECB provided continued support to 
the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, 

primarily promoting the timely achievement of 

the first SEPA milestone, which would mean 

that euro area citizens, by 1 January 2008, will 

be able to use SEPA payment instruments for 

credit transfers, direct debits and card 

transactions in parallel with existing national 

payment instruments. In addition, the ECB 

followed the work of the banking industry to 

reach a second milestone, which involves the 

establishment of a fully fledged SEPA 

infrastructure for credit transfers, direct debits 

and card transactions by the end of 2010. The 

ECB actively supported the European Payments 

Council (EPC), and high-level coordination 

between the Eurosystem and the EPC took place 

at meetings of the Contact Group on Euro 
Payments Strategy. To ensure the involvement 

of all stakeholders, the Eurosystem arranged a 

number of meetings with SEPA end-users, 

including consumer organisations, small and 

medium-sized enterprises, retailers and 

corporate treasurers. It subsequently entered 

into a dialogue with banks on how best to 

integrate the expectations and requirements of 

these groups into the SEPA project. The ECB 

recognised as a major achievement the EPC™s 

work on defining standards and business rules 

for SEPA cards, credit transfers and direct 

debits, while noting the large amount of work 

still ahead in order to overcome national 

barriers and to meet different end-users™ 

requirements. In view of the migration of 
in terms of funding practices, varying from deposit funding to mortgage (covered) bonds and 

mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage rates may also differ owing to variations in product 

characteristics, interest rate fixation periods and customer preferences (exemplified by different 

loan maturities and loan-to-value ratios), as well as in the role of government and market 

regulation.
Against this background, the cross-country dispersion of rates on loans to households for house 
purchase in the euro area was significantly higher than the cross-regional dispersion of 

mortgage rates in the United States over the period from January 2003 to October 2005 (see 

Charts A and B). 
129ECB Annual Report
2005national payments to SEPA instruments from 
2008, the ECB initiated a high-level dialogue 

between Eurosystem central banks and major 

credit institutions in the euro area to ensure a 
commitment to SEPA investments and project 

delivery.
The ECB carried out a legal and an economic 
analysis of interchange fees applied by card 

payment schemes within the euro area. 

Moreover, in close cooperation with NCBs, the 

ECB also conducted a survey covering more 

than 100 different e-payment schemes in the 

EU, gathering information on innovative 

e-payments, the results of which will be made 

available in 2006.
In the field of securities clearing and settlement, 
there is competition between the market 

participants offering different integration 

solutions. While the Eurosystem maintains a 

neutral stance towards solutions, it strongly 

supports further integration. In this context, 

biannual meetings were held with the Contact 

Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures, 

bringing together representatives from the 

banking and securities settlement industries of 
the euro area to discuss the integration of the 

euro securities settlement industry. Meetings 

were also held with industry organisations. In 

addition, the ECB participated in the Clearing 

and Settlement Advisory and Monitoring 

Experts Group as well as the Legal Certainty 

Group, set up by the Commission in 2004 and 

2005, respectively, with a view to supporting 

the removal of the 15 barriers to integration 

identified by the Giovannini Group relating to 

technical or market practices, tax procedures 

and legal issues.
The European Master Agreement (EMA) is an 
initiative to permit cross-border trading on the 

basis of a legal master agreement. This is a 

multi-lingual, multi-jurisdictional, multi-
product agreement covering, in particular, 

trading in repurchase agreements, foreign 

exchange, derivatives and securities loans. The 

ECB, which participated in the drafting of the 

EMA, has used it since 2001 with all its 
European foreign reserve management and own 
funds repo counterparties, as well as since 

June 2005 for its derivatives operations in 15 

European jurisdictions.ADVICE ON THE REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE 

FRAMEWORK OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
The Eurosystem contributed to the European 

Commission™s public consultations on the 

Green Paper on
 the priorities for financial 
services policy
 over the next five years (see 
Section 2.1 of this chapter), the enhancement of 

the EU framework for investment funds (see 

Section 2.3 of this chapter), mortgage credit in 

the EU and securities clearing and settlement 

systems. The ECB also took part in the 

Commission™s work on a New Legal Framework 

for Payments, which aims to increase the 

efficiency and security of payments by removing 

technical and legal barriers and to improve 

consumer protection.In March 2005 the ECB adopted an opinion 
regarding a proposal for a Council decision 

concerning the signing of the Hague Convention 

on securities held with an intermediary. The 

ECB noted that the Hague Convention offered 

one possible approach to identifying the 

location of a securities account for conflict-of-
law purposes and said that it would welcome a 

comprehensive prior assessment of the impact 

of the Convention in the EU. Such an assessment 

should not prejudice the Community™s initiatives 

in the area of clearing and settlement or the 
need for substantive reform and harmonisation 

of book-entry securities law. Furthermore, the 

ECB participated in the activities of UNIDROIT, 

the International Institute for the Unification of 

Private Law, regarding a draft international 

convention on harmonised rules for 

intermediated securities. 
PROVIDING CENTRAL BANKING SERVICES 

CONDUCIVE TO FINANCIAL INTEGRATION
In 2005 work continued on TARGET2, the 

next generation of the TARGET system (see 

Section 2.2 of Chapter 2). The Eurosystem also 

took the first steps for the gradual introduction 

of a single list in the collateral framework of 
130ECB Annual Report
2005the Eurosystem (see Section 1 of Chapter 2). At 
the global level, the ECB took part in work 

related to the analysis of cross-border collateral 

arrangements. This work was carried out by a 

working group commissioned by the G10 

Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems 

(CPSS).131ECB Annual Report
2005One of the statutory roles of the Eurosystem is 
to exercise oversight over payment and clearing 

systems. This oversight aims to ensure that the 

general organisation of payment flows within 

the economy is efficient and safe. The 

Eurosystem also takes a general interest in 

securities clearing and settlement systems 

because failures during the settlement and 

custody of collateral could jeopardise the 

implementation of monetary policy and the 

smooth functioning of payment systems. The 

ECB contributed to the international debate on 

oversight in two reports published by the CPSS 

in May 2005.
104.1 OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO 
PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURES 
The oversight role of the Eurosystem extends to 

all euro payment systems, including those 

managed by the Eurosystem itself. The 

Eurosystem applies the same oversight 

standards to both its own systems and those that 

are privately operated. These standards are the 

Core Principles for Systemically Important 

Payment Systems adopted by the Governing 

Council in 2001. TARGET 
The oversight framework for the existing 

TARGET system has been fully implemented. 

As regards the oversight of the future TARGET2 

system, the general organisational framework is 

in place. The ECB will lead and coordinate the 

TARGET2 oversight activities of the central 

banks in TARGET2. The NCBs will have 

primary responsibility to perform oversight 

activities on the local features of the system Œ 

whenever such features are only relevant for the 

domestic environment Œ and will participate in 

the central oversight activities. The development 

of the TARGET2 system is being monitored by 

the TARGET overseers and, in the same way as 

any other large-value euro payment system in 

the euro area, TARGET2 will have to comply 

with the Eurosystem™s oversight standards. A 

comprehensive preliminary oversight 
4 OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
assessment of TARGET2 in its design phase is 

currently being performed. 
In early 2005 the TARGET overseers carried 
out an oversight assessment of SORBNET-

EURO, Narodowy Bank Polski™s euro real-time 

gross settlement (RTGS) system, in anticipation 

of its connection to TARGET via the Banca 

d™Italia and its BI-REL system. A further 

extension of the current TARGET system is 

expected to take place in the context of EMU 

enlargement. The RTGS systems intending to 

connect to the current TARGET system, 

together with all other systemically important 

euro infrastructures in the Member States 

concerned, will be subject to oversight 

assessments in accordance with the Eurosystem™s 

common oversight policy. 
EURO1 
EURO1 is a large-value net settlement system 

for euro payments, owned and operated by a 

private entity, the EBA Clearing Company. In 

2005 the oversight of EURO1 focused on the 

legal soundness of the system. In order to 

prepare EURO1 for the joining of banks from 

the new EU Member States, the system operator 

commissioned legal opinions under the relevant 

jurisdictions in order to verify that EURO1 

would continue to comply with Core Principle I 

(ﬁlegal soundnessﬂ). These legal opinions were 

reviewed by the ECB in its capacity as overseer 

of EURO1. The review highlighted some 

general shortcomings in the national legislation 

of the countries concerned, which could thus 

also have an impact on the soundness of other 

payment systems in those countries. These 

issues have been followed up by the ECB in 

close cooperation with the relevant NCBs. 
CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) 

system settles foreign exchange transactions in 

15 currencies on a payment versus payment 

basis, thus eliminating foreign exchange 

settlement risk to a very large extent. 
10  See the BIS reports entitled ﬁCentral bank oversight of payment 
and settlement systemsﬂ and ﬁNew developments in large-value 

payment systemsﬂ.
132ECB Annual Report
2005In December 2005 CLS settled an average of 
194,000 transactions per day with an average 

daily value equivalent to USD 2.6 trillion.
11 
After the US dollar, the euro is the most 

important currency for settlement. In December 

2005 euro settlements in CLS averaged 
429 billion per day and accounted for 20% of total 

settlements in terms of value (US dollar 

settlements represented 47%). The share of the 

euro decreased slightly by comparison with 

December 2004 as a result of the higher number 
of currencies settled in CLS.
In 2006 the BIS will launch a study among major foreign exchange market participants in 

order to identify the risk mitigation methods 
they use to reduce foreign exchange settlement 

risk. The results of this study will form the 

basis of a central bank assessment of the G10 
strategy to reduce foreign exchange settlement 

risk, as defined in the 1996 BIS report entitled 

ﬁSettlement risk in foreign exchange 

transactionsﬂ. The measures implemented since 

1996 will be assessed to establish whether they
 can be considered successful or whether 

regulatory measures may be needed to achieve 

acceptable levels of foreign exchange settlement 

risk. SWIFTThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial 

Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a limited 

liability cooperative company which provides 

secure messaging services to more than 7,500 

financial institutions.
In 2005 the central banks cooperating in the oversight of SWIFT further strengthened the 

practical oversight arrangements. The two core 

concepts in the initial set-up of the oversight of 

SWIFT remain valid, i.e. the concept of 

cooperative oversight with the Nationale Bank 

van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique as 

lead overseer, and that of moral suasion to bring 

about changes. As part of these arrangements, 

in February 2005 the ECB and the Nationale 

Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique 

formally agreed on their cooperation in the 

oversight of SWIFT.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY On 10 May 2005 the ECB published for public 

consultation an issues paper entitled ﬁPayment 

systems business continuityﬂ. The paper 

contains implementation guidelines with regard 

to business continuity for systemically 

important payment systems based on Core 

Principle VII. It focuses on key elements of 

business continuity, such as strategy, planning, 

crisis management and testing. The comments 

received will be considered in the finalisation 

of the paper scheduled for 2006. Once finalised, 

the paper is expected to be applied to the design 

and operation of business continuity 

arrangements for systemically important 

payment systems and to oversight assessments 

conducted by the Eurosystem.
4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES
OVERSIGHT OF RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS 
The 15 euro retail payment systems identified 
as being of systemic or prominent importance 

(on the basis of the ﬁOversight standards for 

euro retail payment systemsﬂ adopted by the 

Governing Council in 2003) were assessed 

against the applicable Core Principles by the 

Eurosystem in 2004 and 2005. Two systemically 

important systems and one prominently 

important system observed all applicable Core 

Principles. The other systems were found to 

have shortcomings with respect to one or more 

Core Principles. However, the assessments 

reflect the status as at end-June 2004, and the 
shortcomings Œ which vary in severity Œ are in 

the process of being rectified.
124.3 SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT 
The Eurosystem has a particular interest in the 

smooth functioning of securities clearing and 
11  Each foreign exchange trade consists of two transactions, 
one in each currency involved. Thus, in December 2005 CLS 
settled trades with an average daily value equivalent to USD 1.3 

trillion (around 1.1 trillion).12  See the ECB report entitled ﬁAssessment of euro area retail 
payment systems against the applicable Core Principlesﬂ, 

August 2005.133ECB Annual Report
200513  In the absence of harmonised EU oversight standards, the 
Eurosystem user standards have been regarded as de facto 

common standards for EU SSSs and, therefore, are dealt with in 

this chapter. Nevertheless, the user standards are not intended to 

be a comprehensive set of standards for the oversight or 

supervision of SSSs.
14  Available on the ECB™s website.
15  Available on the ECB™s website.
settlement systems and their oversight. First, it 
assesses the compliance of securities settlement 
systems (SSSs) in the euro area with the 

ﬁStandards for the use of EU securities 

settlement systems in ESCB credit operationsﬂ 
(known as the ﬁEurosystem user standardsﬂ)
13, as well as links between those SSSs. Second, it 

cooperates with the authorities responsible for 

the regulation and oversight of securities 

clearing and settlement systems at the EU 

level. 
ASSESSMENT OF SECURITIES SETTLEMENT 
SYSTEMS AGAINST USER STANDARDS
In the context of its regular assessments of 

SSSs, the Eurosystem in 2004 recommended 

that a new arrangement be implemented for the 

issuance, safe-keeping and settlement of 

international debt securities. Such securities, 

issued jointly in the two international central 

securities depositories (ICSDs), Euroclear 

Bank (Belgium) and Clearstream Banking 

Luxembourg, account for a significant 

proportion of securities eligible for Eurosystem 

credit operations. In 2005 the ICSDs, together 

with other market participants, started work in 

preparation for the implementation of the ﬁNew 

Global Noteﬂ (NGN) arrangement. In this new 

structure, a new form of global bearer certificate 

Œ the NGN Œ will represent the securities issue. 
Under the terms of the NGN, the legally relevant 

record of the issuer™s indebtedness will be 

maintained by the ICSDs. Further information 

about the NGN arrangement can be obtained, 

for example, from the websites of the ICSDs. 

The implementation of the new arrangement is 

scheduled for 30 June 2006. 
COOPERATION WITH THE COMMITTEE OF 

EUROPEAN SECURITIES REGULATORS 
In 2001 the Governing Council approved a 

framework for cooperation on securities 

clearing and settlement systems between the 

ESCB and CESR. A working group was set up, 

composed of a representative from each central 

bank of the ESCB and from each securities 
regulator in CESR. Using as a basis the 

recommendations for SSSs made by the 

International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO) and the CPSS (known 
as the ﬁCPSS-IOSCO Recommendationsﬂ), this 
working group drew up a consultative report on 

ﬁStandards for securities clearing and settlement 

in the European Unionﬂ14, which was approved 
for release for public consultation by both the 

Governing Council and CESR in October 2004. 

The consultative report contains 19 standards
15 that aim to increase the safety, soundness and 

efficiency of securities clearing and settlement 

in the EU. In comparison with the CPSS-IOSCO 

Recommendations, the ESCB-CESR standards 
seek to deepen and strengthen requirements in 
some areas on account of the specific features 

of the European markets. The overall objective 

of the ESCB-CESR standards is to promote the 
safety and efficiency of market infrastructures, 

thus fostering the integration and 

competitiveness of EU capital markets. The 

European Commission™s work in this area has 

been taken into account. 
134ECB Annual Report
2005Since October 2004 the working group has 
continued its work in the following four fields: 

(i) developing the assessment methodology for 

the standards for SSSs, (ii) developing standards 

and a methodology for the assessment of central 

counterparties, (iii) analysing issues relating to 

custodian banks and (iv) analysing the topics of 

interest with regard to cooperation among 

regulatory, supervisory and oversight 

authorities.The working group has conducted its work in 
an open and transparent manner. In 2005 it had 

a large number of meetings with representatives 

of the banking and securities clearing and 

settlement industries to discuss specific issues 

and to foster better mutual understanding of 
industry practices and the risk concerns of 

authorities. Furthermore, there has been 

increased cooperation between central banks 

and securities regulators on the one hand and 

banking supervisory authorities on the other.

CHAPTER 4EUROPEAN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS
138ECB Annual Report
2005In 2005 the ECB maintained its regular contacts 
with EU institutions and bodies. The President 

of the ECB attended meetings of the ECOFIN 
Council when matters relating to the tasks and 

objectives of the ESCB were discussed. The 

President of the Eurogroup and a member of the 

European Commission participated in meetings 

of the Governing Council when they deemed 

it appropriate. The President and the Vice-

President of the ECB also participated in 

meetings of the Eurogroup, which has continued 

to serve as a particularly important forum for 

an open and informal policy dialogue between 

the ECB, the finance ministers of the euro area 

countries and the Commission.1.1 POLICY ISSUES
THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
In 2005 an excessive deficit existed in 12 EU 
Member States (see also Section 2.5 of 

Chapter 1). In the euro area, excessive deficit 

procedures were initiated or ongoing for 

Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Portugal, 

while the procedure for the Netherlands was 

abrogated. In January 2005 the ECOFIN Council 

agreed that, in the light of an analysis carried 

out by the European Commission, additional 

initiatives vis-à-vis Germany and France under 

the excessive deficit procedure were not 

necessary at that stage. The ECOFIN Council 

gave notice to Greece in February 2005, 

requesting that it put an end to its excessive 

deficit situation as rapidly as possible, and at 

the latest by 2006. In July 2005 the ECOFIN 

Council requested that Italy correct its excessive 

deficit by 2007 at the latest, granting an 

extended deadline in view of special 

circumstances. For Portugal, the ECOFIN 

Council in September 2005 set an extended 

deadline of 2008 at the latest, also in the light 
of special circumstances. In January 2006 the 

ECOFIN Council decided on the existence of an 

excessive deficit in the United Kingdom and 

requested that it put an end to the excessive 

deficit situation as soon as possible and by the 

financial year 2006/07 at the latest. Among the 

new Member States, the Czech Republic, 
1 EUROPEAN ISSUES 
Cyprus, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia 

were also subject to excessive deficit procedures. 

The budgetary situation in Hungary deteriorated 

rapidly throughout the year, and on 8 November 

the ECOFIN Council stated that the action taken 

by Hungary was inadequate. Further steps 

regarding Member States™ excessive deficit 

procedures will depend on the budgetary 

outcomes for 2005 as well as on the countries™ 

consolidation plans and actions compared with 
their commitments for 2006 and beyond.
The procedural rules laid down in the Stability 

and Growth Pact were reformed in the course of 

2005. Following technical discussions which 

had been ongoing since mid-2004, the ECOFIN 
Council reached political agreement on 

20 March 2005 and issued a report to the 

European Council entitled ﬁImproving the 

implementation of the Stability and Growth 

Pactﬂ. After political endorsement by the 

European Council, the ECOFIN Council 

concluded the formal review of the Pact and 

amended the Council Regulations related to the 

Stability and Growth Pact.
1 In October 2005 the 
ECOFIN Council also endorsed a revised 

Code of Conduct, which contains procedural 

specifications and guidelines for the 

implementation of the Pact. The European 

Commission and relevant EU fora continued to 

work on procedural and methodological issues 

related to the reformed Pact throughout the year. 
The changes to the Pact include the introduction 

of country-specific medium-term budgetary 

objectives with adjustment paths that place the 

emphasis on consolidation efforts during 

economically good times. This is part of the 

preventive arm of the Pact. Changes have also 

been introduced in the framework for excessive 

deficit procedures, i.e. the corrective arm. A 

severe economic downturn, which exempts a

Council Regulation (EC) No 1055/2005 amending Council 

Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the 

surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and 

coordination of economic policies, and Council Regulation 

(EC) No 1056/2005 amending Council Regulation (EC) 

No 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation 

of the excessive deficit procedure.
139ECB Annual Report
2005country from an excessive deficit procedure, is 
now defined as a negative annual real GDP 

growth rate or an accumulated loss of output 

during a protracted period of very low annual 

real GDP growth relative to potential growth. 

Furthermore, if a deficit remains close to the 

3% of GDP reference value and the excess is 

temporary, other relevant factors can be taken 

into account when assessing whether the deficit 

is excessive and when setting the initial deadline 

for correcting it. The adjustment path required 

for the correction of an excessive deficit is to 

be set in accordance with a benchmark of a 
minimum annual improvement in the country™s 

cyclically adjusted balance of 0.5% of GDP, 

net of one-off and temporary measures. The 

deadline can be revised if a Council 

recommendation or a notice is reissued in the 
light of unexpected adverse economic events 

with major unfavourable budgetary effects, 

provided that effective action has been taken by 

the Member State concerned. In addition, a 

number of procedural deadlines have been 

extended. With respect to governance, the 

reformed Pact invites closer cooperation as well 

as improved peer support and peer pressure 

among Member States, the European 

Commission and the EU Council. It also calls 
for the development of national budgetary 
rules, the continuity of budgetary targets when 

a new government takes office, and greater 

involvement of national parliaments in the 

overall European fiscal framework. Finally, it 

stresses that the implementation of the fiscal 

framework and its credibility rely crucially on 

realistic macroeconomic forecasts and reliable 

budgetary statistics (see also Section 4.3 of 

Chapter 2).The ECB is not a signatory to the Stability and 

Growth Pact and it does not have a formal role 

in the definition and implementation of the 

Pact™s procedures. Nevertheless, the ECB 

participated in the reform debate and consistently 

voiced the need for a sound fiscal policy 

framework in EMU, geared towards fiscal 

discipline. The ECB argued that the Pact had 

been appropriate in its original form and that it 

was unwise to change the legal texts with regard 

to the corrective arm of the Pact. The ECB also 

pointed out that the preventive arm of the Pact 

could be improved. The Governing Council of 

the ECB released a statement on the reform 

agreement in March 2005 and issued opinions 

on the European Commission™s legislative 

proposals in June 2005 (see Box 12). 
Box 12
ECB PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE REFORM OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT
Statement of the Governing Council of 21 March 2005 
ﬁThe Governing Council of the ECB is seriously concerned about the proposed changes to the 

Stability and Growth Pact. It must be avoided that changes in the corrective arm undermine 

confidence in the fiscal framework of the European Union and the sustainability of public 

finances in the euro area Member States. As regards the preventive arm of the Pact, the 

Governing Council also takes note of some proposed changes which are in line with its possible 

strengthening. Sound fiscal policies and a monetary policy geared to price stability are 

fundamental for the success of Economic and Monetary Union. They are prerequisites for 

macroeconomic stability, growth and cohesion in the euro area. It is imperative that Member 

States, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union implement the 

revised framework in a rigorous and consistent manner conducive to prudent fiscal policies. 

More than ever, in the present circumstances, it is essential that all parties concerned fulfil 

their respective responsibilities. The public and the markets can trust that the Governing 

Council remains firmly committed to deliver on its mandate of maintaining price stability.ﬂ
140ECB Annual Report
2005The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact 
creates an opportunity for renewed commitment 

to the conduct and enforcement of sound fiscal 

policies that meet both shorter and longer-term 

budgetary challenges. However, it is essential 

that Member States, the European Commission 

and the EU Council implement the revised 

framework in a rigorous and consistent manner 

that is conducive to sound fiscal policies. 
THE LISBON STRATEGY
In March 2005 the European Council concluded 
its mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy, the 

EU™s wide-ranging programme of economic, 

social and environmental reform. The review 

came at the mid-point between 2000, when the 

strategy was adopted, and 2010, which was set 

as the target date for transforming the EU into 

ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-

based economy in the world, capable of 

sustainable economic growth with more and 

better jobs and greater social cohesionﬂ. Against 

the backdrop of such an ambitious goal, coupled 
with a relatively poor implementation record up 

to that point, the spring 2005 European Council 

decided to relaunch the strategy and refocus its 

priorities on growth and employment. It also 

endorsed a new governance framework with the 

aim of improving the delivery of reforms.
The content of the strategy was largely kept 
intact. Nevertheless, while maintaining the 

economic, social and environmental dimensions 

of the strategy, the Heads of State or Government 

and the President of the European Commission 
identified four overall policy priorities for 
pushing forward with reforms: promoting 
knowledge and innovation, making the EU an 

attractive area to invest and work in, fostering 

growth and employment on the basis of social 

cohesion and promoting sustainable 

development.
Given that the main shortcoming of the Lisbon 
strategy has been the insufficient delivery of 

structural reforms, the European Council placed 

greater emphasis on improving the governance 

framework of the strategy. Thus, changes were 

made to the rules and procedures governing the 

formulation and implementation of the strategy, 

aiming to streamline policy coordination 

processes over time, across policy areas and 

between the EU and the national level. This 

new governance framework also aims to 

improve the consistency of national programmes, 

reporting and assessment. 
In practical terms, these changes mean that the 
Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the 

Employment Guidelines will be incorporated 

into a single package known as the ﬁIntegrated 

Guidelines for Growth and Jobsﬂ. The first 

package was adopted in June 2005 and will 

remain broadly valid for a three-year period 

(2005-2008). In autumn 2005 the Member 

States adopted national reform programmes 

based on the Integrated Guidelines and 

appointed national Lisbon coordinators, high-
level government figures whose task is to 

enhance the internal coordination of actions 

related to the strategy. The programmes provide 

a detailed plan of Member States™ reform 
Excerpt from the ECB opinions of 3 June 2005 on the amended Council Regulations
ﬁSound fiscal policies are fundamental to the success of Economic and Monetary Union. They 

are prerequisites for macroeconomic stability, growth and cohesion in the euro area. The fiscal 

framework enshrined in the Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of 

EMU and thus key to anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline. This rules-based framework, 

which aims to secure sustainable public finances while allowing the smoothing of output 

fluctuations through the operation of automatic stabilisers, needs to remain clear, simple and 

enforceable. Compliance with these principles will also facilitate transparency and equal 

treatment in the implementation of the framework.ﬂ
141ECB Annual Report
2005policies up to 2008, taking into account their 
particular needs and situation. They also cover 

the implementation of reforms, bringing 

together into a single document the former 

national reports on employment and on 

structural reforms in product and capital 

markets (the ﬁCardiff reportsﬂ), among others. 

In addition, the European Commission adopted 
a Community Lisbon Programme in July 2005, 

which covers all Lisbon-related action to be 

undertaken at the Community level over the 

following three years. Progress is to be assessed 

in a more integrated manner, in the form of an 

annual progress report by the Commission. The 

first such progress report was adopted by the 

Commission in January 2006. The report 

welcomed the national reform programmes and 

called for their rigorous implementation.The most notable feature of the new governance 
framework is its emphasis on increasing 

national responsibility for delivering reforms. 

This is seen as essential to the implementation 
of the strategy, since the design of structural 

reforms and, to an even greater extent, their 

implementation are for the most part the 

prerogative of the Member States. Member 

States thus need to be fully committed to the 

policies they endorse at the national and EU 

levels. They must consult, as they did with their 

national reform programmes, the stakeholders 

involved, such as national parliaments and 

social partners, in drawing up and implementing 

these policies at the national level. This national 

ﬁownershipﬂ of the reforms to be undertaken 

should, in turn, improve the implementation 

records of the Member States. The ECB attaches great importance to the 
implementation of the Lisbon strategy and 

contributes to its success by pursuing a stability-
oriented monetary policy. The ECB has always 
stressed the benefits of structural reform and 

welcomes the efforts undertaken by governments 

and social partners in this regard. By acting on 

the Lisbon agenda with a high degree of 

commitment, the Member States can set in 

motion a virtuous cycle of reforms. Well-

designed structural reforms in goods, services, 

labour and capital markets, as envisaged by the 

strategy, will increase the flexibility of the euro 

area economy, making it more resilient to 

economic shocks and ultimately resulting in a 

higher sustainable long-term growth rate and a 

higher level of employment. The mid-term 

review was an important step in revitalising the 

strategy. With a mixed overall implementation 

record so far, greater efforts are needed to 

achieve the goals that have been set in order 

to face the challenges of globalisation, 

technological change and an ageing 

population. 1.2 INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES 
THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION
Following the signing of the Treaty establishing 
a Constitution for Europe (European 

Constitution) by the Heads of State or 

Government on 29 October 2004 in Rome, 

Member States started the ratification procedure 

in accordance with their respective constitutional 

requirements. So far, 15 Member States, 

representing more than 50% of the EU™s 

population, have ratified the European 

Constitution or are very close to formal 

completion: Belgium, Germany, Estonia, 

Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, 

Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Slovenia 

and Slovakia. 
142ECB Annual Report
2005In France and the Netherlands, where the 
European Constitution was put to a referendum 

(a binding one in the case of France and a non-

binding one in the case of the Netherlands), it 

failed to achieve majority support by about 

5 percentage points in France and about 

12 percentage points in the Netherlands. Since 

then, a number of Member States have 

suspended the ratification process.
Against this background, the European Council 
considered the ratification of the Constitution 

at its meeting on 16-17 June 2005, during which 

the Heads of State or Government adopted a 

declaration recalling that the Constitution was 

ﬁdesigned to provide the appropriate response 

to ensure that an enlarged European Union 

functions more democratically, more 

transparently and more effectivelyﬂ.
 Noting the outcome of the referendums in France and the 

Netherlands, the European Council did not 
think that the results called into question 

citizens™ attachment to the construction of 

Europe. At the same time, it was felt that they 

revealed the concerns of citizens and that a 

period of reflection was warranted during which 

broad debates should take place in all Member 

States. The European institutions were invited 

to contribute to the debate. Although the 

European Council agreed that the timetable for 

ratification in the individual Member States 

could be altered if necessary, the developments 

were not considered to undermine the validity 

of continuing with the ratification process. The 

European Council intends to come back to this 
issue during the first half of 2006 to establish a 

clearer perspective for the future and agree on 

how to proceed. 
In the view of the ECB, the European 
Constitution clarifies the legal and institutional 

framework of the EU and enhances the Union™s 

ability to act at both the European and the 
international level, while confirming the 

existing monetary framework. The ECB 

therefore supports the Constitution. However, it 

should be stressed that the Constitution™s 

ratification process will have no bearing on the 

functioning of Monetary Union and will not 
affect the stability of the euro. The ECB, 
whether operating under the current Treaty or 

the European Constitution, will continue to 

secure the value of the euro and contribute to a 

non-inflationary macroeconomic environment 

conducive to growth and employment. 
1.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN AND RELATIONS WITH 
EU ACCEDING AND ACCESSION COUNTRIES
A key objective of the ECB in its relations with 

the central banks of EU acceding and accession 

countries is to contribute to a smooth monetary 

integration process that complies with Treaty 

procedures. Consequently, relations between 

the ECB and the central banks of these countries 
naturally intensify in parallel with the overall 

progress of the countries towards EU 

membership.Since Bulgaria and Romania signed the 
Accession Treaty in Luxembourg on 25 April 

2005, the governors of the central banks of 

these two countries have been attending the 

meetings of the General Council of the ECB as 

observers, while experts from the two central 

banks have been participating as observers 

in the meetings of ESCB committees (see 

Section 1.4 of Chapter 7). The ECB further strengthened its bilateral 
relations with the central banks of Bulgaria and 
Romania in order to contribute to their smooth 

integration into the ESCB upon EU accession. 

The Eurosystem as a whole continued to support 

their preparations with technical assistance 

projects in the form of EU-financed twinning 

schemes. These activities focused primarily on 

statistics, legal issues, payment systems, 

monetary policy and operational issues, but 

also covered other areas, such as financial 

stability and supervision, banknotes, internal 

audit and information technology. 
The date for Bulgaria and Romania to enter the EU is set for 1 January 2007; however, the 

Accession Treaty includes a ﬁsafeguard clauseﬂ 

which allows for the postponement of accession 
143ECB Annual Report
2005by one year if there is clear evidence that the 
progress of preparations is insufficient to meet 

the requirements of EU membership. The 

European Commission published a monitoring 

report in October 2005 which indicated that, 

despite the progress made, there remained a 

certain number of areas of serious concern. 

These include the fight against corruption and 

issues linked to the functioning of the internal 

market and to the security of the EU (e.g. food 

safety and the control of external borders). The 

European Commission continued its intensive 

monitoring of Bulgaria and Romania and is 
expected to make its final recommendation in 

the spring of 2006. On the basis of this 

recommendation, the European Council will 

then make a decision on the date of EU entry. 
In accordance with the European Council 
decision of December 2004, accession 

negotiations with Turkey were opened on 

3 October 2005 after the framework for 

negotiations had been adopted by the EU 

Council. The ECB continued its long-standing 

high-level policy dialogue with the Central 

Bank of the Republic of Turkey, including 

annual meetings at the Executive Board level. 

In this context, the Vice-President led an ECB 

delegation to Turkey in July 2005. The 

discussions focused on Turkey™s macroeconomic 

stabilisation and structural reform process, the 

Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey™s 

monetary and exchange rate policy, the 

economic situation in the euro area and central 
banks™ role in financial stability. 
On 13 December 2004 the EU Council decided 
that accession talks with Croatia would start on 

17 March 2005, on condition of the country™s 

full cooperation with the International Criminal 

Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). As 

cooperation was judged insufficient, the EU 

postponed the start of accession talks. On 

3 October 2005 the EU judged that the Croatian 
authorities were now fully cooperating with the 

ICTY and decided to open negotiation talks. 

The ECB further strengthened its bilateral 

relations with the Croatian National Bank, with 
the first official visit by the ECB at the 
Executive Board level taking place in March 
2005. Bilateral meetings will be held annually 

in Frankfurt until Croatia signs the Accession 

Treaty. 
144ECB Annual Report
20052.1 KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
SURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY Given the euro area™s economic and financial 

integration in the global economy, the 

Eurosystem closely monitors and analyses 

macroeconomic policies and underlying 

developments in countries outside the euro 

area. It also participates in the multilateral 

surveillance conducted by international 

organisations and fora, which takes place 

mainly at meetings of the IMF, the Organisation 

for Economic Co-operation and Development 

(OECD), and the G7, G10 and G20 finance 

ministers and central bank governors, as well as 

at the BIS™s bi-monthly meetings of central 

bank governors. In some of the institutions and 

fora, the ECB has been granted either member 

status (for example, at the G20) or observer 

status (for example, at the IMF). The ECB 

assesses international economic policy 

developments with a view to contributing to a 

stable macroeconomic environment and sound 

macroeconomic policies. The international policy environment in 2005 
was dominated by the widening of global 

current account imbalances. The large current 

account deficit of the United States continued 

to increase in the course of the year. At the 

same time, current account surpluses in Asia 

remained substantial, reaching around 0.8% of 

world GDP, with a significant increase in the 

surplus of China offsetting a decline in the rest 

of emerging Asia and Japan. Oil-exporting 

countries also played an increasingly important 

role with regard to global imbalances owing to 

the spike in oil prices. In 2005 the current 

account surplus of these countries, which stood 

at around 1% of world GDP, surpassed that of 

Asia. Asian and oil-exporting economies also 

continued to accumulate considerable amounts 

of reserve assets. The accumulation of reserves 

was particularly large in the case of China, at 

around USD 200 billion (around 165 billion).2 INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
The Eurosystem continued to stress the risks 
and uncertainties related to the continuation of 

such imbalances on various occasions and 

maintained its full support for a cooperative 

approach on this issue, whereby all economies 

would contribute to an orderly adjustment of 

existing imbalances. This international policy 

agenda includes policies to increase savings in 

deficit countries, to implement structural 

reforms in countries with relatively low 

potential growth and to foster exchange rate 

flexibility in major countries and regions that 

lack such flexibility. In this respect, the ECB 

welcomed the decision of the Chinese 

authorities in July 2005 to shift to a new 

managed floating exchange rate. It considered 

the move towards greater flexibility desirable 

for a better functioning of the global economy, 

and expected the new managed floating 

exchange rate regime to contribute to global 

financial stability.
Capital flows to emerging market economies, 
which the ECB continuously monitors on 

account of their relevance for international 

financial stability, remained robust in 2005, as 

did the economic performance of these countries 

in general. Crucial external factors in these 

developments were favourable international 

financing conditions, high international prices 

of export commodities and strong real GDP 

growth in the United States and China. 

Strengthened domestic policies, accommodative 

financing conditions and increasing interest 

from international investors allowed some 

emerging market borrowers to tap the 

international bond markets by issuing securities 

in domestic currency for the first time. Having 

temporarily widened in April owing to, inter 

alia, fears of rising inflation in the United States 
and an increase in investor risk aversion 

resulting from the rating downgrade of certain 

US corporations, emerging market bond spreads 

returned to low levels by historical standards 

later in the year.
Finally, the euro area itself is subject to 
international policy surveillance exercises. 

Both the IMF and the OECD conducted their 145ECB Annual Report
2005regular reviews of the euro area, as a complement 
to their reviews of the individual euro area 

countries. The reviews examined the monetary, 

financial and economic policies of the euro 

area. The Article IV consultations of the IMF 

and the review by the OECD™s Economic and 

Development Review Committee provided an 

opportunity for useful discussions between 

these international organisations and the ECB, 

the Eurogroup presidency and the European 

Commission. Following these discussions, both 

the IMF and the OECD produced a report 

assessing the euro area policies.2 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE
The IMF is currently undertaking a strategic 

review which has been discussed not only 

within the IMF itself, but also in various 

international fora, such as the G7 and the G20. 

The ESCB is monitoring and contributing to 

these discussions. The aim of the strategic 

review is to set medium-term priorities for the 

work of the IMF. Important areas covered in the 

review include IMF surveillance, the IMF™s role 

in emerging market economies, and voice and 

representation. The Managing Director of the IMF highlighted, 
in particular, the need for the IMF to help 

members to tackle the challenges of 

globalisation. In the subsequent international 

policy discussions, members stressed the need 

for the IMF to place greater emphasis in its 

bilateral surveillance on exchange rate issues 

and international spillovers from national 
policy measures. The issue of adequate voice 
and representation in international fora, and in 

particular in the IMF, has been widely debated 

over the past year. Some IMF member countries, 

especially in Asia, feel that their quotas do not 

adequately reflect their growing weight in the 

world economy. The issue of quotas and voice 

will need to be discussed in parallel with the 
other aspects of the strategic review in the run-

up to the next IMF Annual Meetings, which 

will be held in Singapore in September 2006. 

The IMF is also conducting its 13th general 
review of quotas, which provides an opportunity 

to assess the extent to which the current 

distribution of quotas among IMF members is 
in line with agreed measures of member 

countries™ relative economic and financial 

importance. The review is to be concluded by 

January 2008.
The promotion of orderly crisis management 
has been high on the agenda of the international 

community for several years. The ESCB has 

continued to discuss issues related to crisis 

management and, in particular, the role that the 

private sector is expected to play in the 

resolution of financial crises. Although a 

number of steps have been taken to improve the 

framework for private sector involvement, 

critical challenges still remain, not least in 

terms of timely diagnosis of the actions needed 

by all stakeholders. To assess these challenges,

ﬁEconomic Survey of the Euro Areaﬂ, July 2005.
146ECB Annual Report
2005ESCB central banks prepared a report on private 
sector involvement which takes stock of past 

experience and identifies areas of possible 

improvement in the framework for crisis 

resolution. The report
3 suggests that improving 
the predictability of crisis resolution processes 

Œ by guiding the behaviour of debtors, creditors 

and the official sector Œ could lower the overall 

cost of financial crises and bring about a 

distribution of costs that would be likely to be 

seen as more appropriate from a general welfare 

perspective than is currently the case. 
INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO
In 2005 the role of the euro as an international 

currency continued to gradually expand in 

certain segments. In particular, the use of the 

euro in international debt securities, as an 

anchor and intervention currency and as a 

deposit currency in third countries continued to 

rise gradually. The increase in the use of the 

euro as an anchor and intervention currency 

took place largely in the new EU Member 

States, EU acceding and accession countries 

and other EU neighbouring regions. The share 

of the euro in the special drawing right (SDR) 

was increased from 29% to 34% on 1 January 

2006, following a decision announced by the 

IMF in December 2005. For the euro component 

of the SDR interest rate, the three-month 

EURIBOR was replaced by the three-month 

EUREPO rate. 
In other markets, such as those in international 
loans and deposits, foreign exchange and 

official reserves, as well as in international 

trade, the use of the euro remained largely 

stable. 
The ECB continued to develop the statistical 
coverage required for its monitoring and 

analysis of the euro™s international role. In 

particular, newly collected data on the currency 

breakdown of debt securities in the euro area 

balance of payments and international 

investment position contributed to the 

monitoring of the international use of the 

euro in capital markets (see Section 4.2 of 

Chapter 2). The ECB also began research on the 
factors behind the use of the euro in international 
trade.2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE 
THE EUThe Eurosystem continued to build up its 

contacts within the central banking community 
outside the EU, largely through the organisation 

of seminars and workshops, but also through 

technical assistance, which has become an 

important tool in supporting institution-

building and enhancing effective compliance 

with European and international standards. 

The objective of such contacts is to gather 

information and exchange views on economic 

and monetary developments in different regions 

of the world with a potential bearing on the 

global economic environment and the euro area. 

The Eurosystem has maintained its offer of 

cooperation with central banks in its 

neighbouring regions, and the ECB has 

established a small, permanent technical 

assistance unit.The Eurosystem held its second bilateral high-level seminar with the Central Bank of the 

Russian Federation (Bank of Russia) in October 

2005 in St Petersburg. The seminar focused on 

monetary and exchange rate policies in Russia 

and on the challenges for banking sector 

stability arising, among other things, from the 

rapid growth of bank lending and the expansion 

of cross-border borrowing. The issues of deposit 

insurance and banking sector development were 

also discussed. Similar events will continue to 

be organised on a regular basis, with the next 

Eurosystem seminar to be held in Dresden 
in 2006, with the support of the Deutsche 

Bundesbank. Central Banking Training III, the Eurosystem™s 
technical assistance project with the Bank of 

Russia in the area of banking supervision, was

which was funded by the EU, started in 

November 2003 within the EU™s framework for 

Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of 

Independent States (TACIS). The Eurosystem 

project was implemented by the ECB in 

partnership with nine euro area NCBs and three 

EU non-central bank supervisors.
4 The two-
year training project aimed to help the Bank of 

Russia to enhance its role in banking supervision 

by transferring knowledge relating to the sound 

practices employed by EU banking supervisors. 

The wider objective was to foster the stability 

of the Russian banking system. The project was 

executed mainly through courses and seminars 

in Russia, which were attended by 800 of the 

Bank of Russia™s banking supervisors. The 

publication entitled ﬁBanking supervision: 

European experience and Russian practiceﬂ
5, which is available in English and Russian, was 

an important part of the project, as it allows the 

dissemination of know-how.
The second and third high-level Eurosystem 
seminars with governors of central banks of the 

EU™s Euro-Mediterranean partners took place 

in, respectively, Cannes on 9 February 2005 

and Nafplion on 25 January 2006. Discussions 

focused on, among other things, central bank 
independence and remittances (Cannes), and 

the capital account liberalisation process and 

progress in the modernisation of monetary 

policy operational frameworks (Nafplion).
The Eurosystem also took on the responsibility of assisting the Central Bank of Egypt in the 
reform of its banking supervisory setting, 

against the background of an overall reform of 

the country™s financial sector. The ECB and 

four euro area NCBs (the Deutsche Bundesbank, 

the Bank of Greece, the Banque de France and 

the Banca d™Italia) have committed themselves 

to a two-year technical assistance programme, 

funded by the EU Delegation to Egypt under 

the Mediterranean aid programme (MEDA). 

The technical assistance programme started on 

1 December 2005. Since October 2005 the ECB 

has also extended Œ under the aegis of the IMF 

Œ technical assistance to the Central Bank of Egypt in the reform of its monetary policy 
operational framework.
The ECB continued to deepen its relations with 
countries in the western Balkans, given that 

they are potential EU candidate countries (the 

Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was 

granted candidate status in December 2005). 

Representatives from the ECB visited the 

National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia 

and the Bank of Albania in 2005. Following the 

adoption of a twin-track approach by the EU 

regarding accession negotiations with Serbia 

and Montenegro, a staff visit to the Central 

Bank of Montenegro also took place. 
In the Middle East, the ECB further developed 
its relations with the Secretariat General of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and GCC 
member states™ monetary agencies and central 

banks in view of their plan to introduce a single 

currency in the GCC member states
6 by 2010.
On 28 February 2005 the ECB held a regional 
meeting with the Committee of Central Bank 

Governors of the Southern African Development 

Community (SADC)7 to discuss experiences in 
regional integration and monetary integration 

processes.The ECB strengthened its direct relations with 
Asian central banks by organising, together 

with Bank Indonesia, a high-level seminar 

bringing together the 11 governors from the

seminar, which took place at the ECB in 

November 2005, discussed ways of moving 

towards more balanced global growth patterns 

and reviewed recent developments and related 

policy issues in both the euro area and the Asia-

Pacific region. The experience of the two 

regions with multilateral macroeconomic and 

financial surveillance was also assessed, 

together with cross-border financial integration 

at the global level and within both the Asia-

Pacific region and the euro area.
As regards institutional relations with Latin 
American countries, the ECB attended, with 

observer status, the Annual Meeting of the 

Inter-American Development Bank, which took 

place in Okinawa in early April. As a 

collaborative member of the Centre for Latin 

American Monetary Studies, the ECB continued 

to be involved in several activities hosted or co-

organised by this institution. These included 

the biannual meetings for central bank 

governors which took place in Cartagena and 

Washington, D.C. in April and September 

respectively, as well as a seminar on workers™ 

remittances in Latin America which took place 

in Mexico City in October. The ECB continued 

its efforts to further strengthen bilateral 

relations with monetary and other official 

authorities in the Latin American region, 

including visits to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. 

The ECB also welcomed to Frankfurt official 

delegations from a number of Latin American 

economies during 2005. Artist

CHAPTER 5ACCOUNTABILITY 
152ECB Annual Report
2005Over the past decades, central bank 
independence has emerged as an indispensable 

element of a monetary regime which gives 

priority to price stability. At the same time, it is 

a fundamental principle of modern democracies 

that any independent institution bestowed with 

a public function be accountable for its actions 

to citizens and their democratically elected 

representatives. For an independent central 

bank, accountability can be understood as the 

obligation to explain its decisions to citizens 

and their elected representatives, thus enabling 

them to hold the central bank responsible for 

achieving its objectives. 
Since its establishment, the ECB has recognised 
the fundamental importance of being 

accountable for its policy decisions and to 

this end has maintained a regular dialogue 

with EU citizens and the European Parliament. 

The ECB™s commitment in this respect is 

illustrated inter alia by the numerous 

publications it released in 2005 and the large 

number of speeches delivered by the members 

of the Governing Council during the year (see 

Section 2 of Chapter 6).The Treaty lays down precise reporting 
requirements for the ECB, which include the 

publication of quarterly reports, a weekly 

financial statement and an annual report. The 

ECB in fact exceeds these statutory obligations, 

for instance by publishing a Monthly Bulletin 

rather than a quarterly report, by holding 

monthly press conferences and by 

communicating on a monthly basis Governing 

Council decisions taken in addition to interest 

rate decisions. At the institutional level, the Treaty assigns a 
prominent role to the European Parliament with 

regard to the accountability of the ECB. In line 

with the provisions of Article 113 of the Treaty, 

the President presented the ECB™s Annual 

Report 2004 to the plenary session of the 

European Parliament in 2005. In addition, the 

President continued to report regularly on the 

ECB™s monetary policy and its other tasks 

during his quarterly appearances before the 
1 ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-À-VIS THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
Parliamentary Committee on Economic and 
Monetary Affairs (ECON). 
Other members of the Executive Board were 
also invited to appear before the European 

Parliament on a number of occasions. In April 

2005 the Vice-President presented the ECB™s 

Annual Report 2004 to ECON. In October the 

Committee invited Lorenzo Bini Smaghi to an 

exchange of views on the strategic review of 

the IMF (see Section 2.1 of Chapter 4). 
In line with established practice, a delegation 
of members of ECON visited the ECB to 

exchange views with the members of the 

Executive Board on a variety of issues. In 

addition, informal discussions took place with 

members of the European Parliament on issues 

related to securities clearing and settlement in 

the EU, as well as on euro communication 

issues with a specific focus on the new EU 

Member States planning to introduce the euro. 
The ECB also continued its voluntary practice 

of replying to questions submitted in writing by 

members of the European Parliament on issues 

falling within the ECB™s field of competence. 
Finally, Article 112 of the Treaty stipulates that 
the European Parliament give its opinion on 

candidates for the Executive Board prior to 

their appointment. In order to prepare its 

position, the Parliament invited Lorenzo Bini 

Smaghi to appear before ECON to present his 

views and answer questions from Committee 

members. Following this hearing, the Parliament 

endorsed his appointment.
153ECB Annual Report
2005In the course of the various exchanges between 
the ECB and the European Parliament, a wide 

range of issues were addressed, with monetary 

policy being the main focus during the 

President™s appearances before the European 

Parliament. Some of the other issues discussed 

are outlined below.
THE REFORM OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH 

PACT
A significant part of the exchange of views 

between the European Parliament and the ECB 

was dedicated to developments in public 

finances and the reform of the Stability and 

Growth Pact. In its resolution on public finances 

in EMU adopted in February 2005, the European 

Parliament warned that ﬁexcessive government 

expenditure puts at risk price stability, low 

interest rates and government investment levels, 

and in addition reduces the capacity to face the 

challenge of demographic changesﬂ. As regards 

the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, the 

Parliament welcomed the strengthening of the 

Pact™s preventive arm and the increased attention 

given to debt levels and the Lisbon objectives. 

At the same time, it expressed its concern about 

the lack of clarity in the rules of the corrective 

arm of the Pact and regretted that an opportunity 

had been missed to strengthen the role of the 

European Commission.The President of the ECB welcomed the high 
degree of convergence between the views of the 

two institutions on this issue. During his 

appearances before the Committee on Economic 
and Monetary Affairs, he stressed that sound 

fiscal policies were fundamental to the success 

of EMU. Against this backdrop, he indicated 

that the reform of the Pact created an opportunity 

for a renewed commitment to sound fiscal 

policies, provided that the revised framework 

was implemented rigorously and consistently 

(see Section 1.1 of Chapter 4).THE MID-TERM REVIEW OF THE LISBON 

STRATEGY
Another issue discussed regularly by the ECB 

and the European Parliament was the mid-term 

review of the Lisbon strategy. In its resolutions 
2 SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
on this issue, the Parliament welcomed the 
commitment made by the EU Council and the 

European Commission to inject new dynamism 

into the Lisbon strategy and expressed its 

support for the new governance framework. The 

Parliament also underlined that ﬁgrowth-

oriented, sustainable macroeconomic conditions 

must be guaranteed if (...) economic, social and 

environmental objectives are to be achievedﬂ. 

The Parliament regretted that the European 

Council had not endorsed the suggestion of the 
high-level group chaired by Wim Kok that the 

Commission should produce annual league 

tables of Member States™ progress towards 

achieving the Lisbon goals. 
The President of the ECB said that the revised 
Lisbon strategy constituted a good blueprint for 

unlocking Europe™s growth and employment 

potential. In addition, he concurred with the 

Parliament™s view that a stable macroeconomic 

environment was a precondition for increasing 

growth and employment. He also emphasised 

the need for ﬁbenchmarkingﬂ and peer support 

at the European level to improve the 

implementation of structural reforms (see 

Section 1.1 of Chapter 4). COMMUNICATION ON THE EURO AND EMU 
In 2005 the European Parliament also considered 

in close detail the communication policy on 

the euro and EMU vis-à-vis the citizens of 
current and prospective euro area countries. In 

March the European Parliament™s rapporteur on 

this issue visited the ECB to exchange views 

with Executive Board Member José Manuel 

González-Páramo and a number of ECB experts. 

In its resolution on the implementation of an 

information and communication strategy on 

the euro and EMU, the Parliament welcomed 

the benefits of EMU and called the euro 

ﬁpossibly the most successful European 

project ever launchedﬂ. In order to support the 

single currency and prepare the prospective 

members of the euro area for a smooth 

currency changeover, the Parliament called 

for a coherent, ambitious and long-lasting 

communication strategy on the euro and EMU. 

One of the measures suggested by the Parliament 
154ECB Annual Report
2005was that the ECB undertake a yearly quantitative 
analysis of the benefits of the single currency 

for citizens. During his appearance before the plenary of the 
European Parliament, the President emphasised 

that the ECB was considering all appropriate 

means to enhance communication on the 

benefits of the single currency. He explained 

that a wide-ranging quantitative analysis of the 

benefits of the euro may be subject to 

methodological problems and data constraints. 

In a letter to the Parliament, it was also pointed 

out that such an analysis may need to include 

issues which go beyond the realm of central 

banking. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION AND REGULATION
Issues related to financial integration and 

regulation again figured prominently in the 

exchanges between the ECB and the European 

Parliament. The Parliament paid particular 

attention to the activities of the ESCB and the 

Committee of European Securities Regulators 

(CESR) in the area of securities clearing and 
settlement. In the resolution it adopted on this 

topic in July 2005, the Parliament stated that 

the ESCB-CESR standards (see Section 4.3 of 

Chapter 3) must not predetermine EU legislation 

and stressed the need for a wide and open 

consultation of the affected parties on this 

issue. The President emphasised that the standards were an important contribution to a safe and 

integrated infrastructure in the field of 

securities clearing and settlement, and that the 
ESCB and CESR had taken their decisions in 

an open and transparent manner, following a 

broad consultation of market participants. He 

also said that the ESCB-CESR standards neither 

pre-empted nor precluded future legislative acts 

in this area.EURO COINS AND BANKNOTES
The possible issuance of very low-denomination 

euro banknotes was also discussed in 2005. In 

addition to submitting written questions to the 
President on this issue, the European Parliament 
adopted a declaration calling on the European 
Commission, the EU Council and the ECB to 

recognise the need to issue 
1 and 2 banknotes. The Governing Council had decided in 2004 
not to introduce very low-denomination euro 

banknotes in view of the fact that the arguments 

against the introduction of such banknotes 

outweighed the arguments in favour. The 

Governing Council™s decision was motivated by 

the insufficient popular demand for very low-

denomination banknotes, the practical problems 

posed for third parties by the introduction of 

such banknotes and the high costs of printing 

and processing. The President explained that no 

new evidence had emerged to change the 

Governing Council™s assessment.

CHAPTER 6EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION 
158ECB Annual Report
2005Communication is an integral part of the ECB™s 
monetary policy and the performance of its 

other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and 

transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication 

activities. Both contribute to the effectiveness, 

efficiency and credibility of the ECB™s monetary 

policy. They also support the ECB™s efforts to 

give full account of its actions, as explained in 

more detail in Chapter 5.The concept of real-time, regular and detailed 
explanations of the ECB™s monetary policy 

assessment and decisions, which was introduced 

in 1999, represents a uniquely open and 

transparent approach to central bank 

communication. Monetary policy decisions are 

explained at a press conference immediately 

after the Governing Council has taken them. A 

detailed introductory statement is made by the 

President and, together with the Vice-President, 

he is at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 

Since December 2004 decisions taken by the 

Governing Council other than those setting 

interest rates have also been published every 

month on the websites of the Eurosystem central 

banks.The ECB™s legal acts are made available in all 
20 official languages of the EU, as are the 

consolidated financial statements of the 

Eurosystem. The ECB™s other statutory 

publications Œ the Annual Report, the quarterly 

version of the Monthly Bulletin and the 

Convergence Report Œ are made available in 19 

of the 20 official EU languages.
1 For the 
purposes of accountability and transparency 

vis-à-vis European citizens and their elected 
representatives, the ECB also publishes other 

documentation in all official languages, in 

particular press releases on monetary policy 

decisions, staff macroeconomic projections and 

policy positions of relevance to the general 

public. The preparation, publication and 

distribution of the national language versions 

of the ECB™s key publications are undertaken in 

close collaboration with the NCBs.1 COMMUNICATION POLICY
1 A temporary exception applies to Maltese.
159ECB Annual Report
2005The ECB needs to address a variety of 
audiences, such as financial experts, the media, 

governments, parliaments and the general 

public, with varying levels of knowledge of 

finance and economics. Its mandate and policy 

decisions are therefore explained through a 

range of communication tools and activities 

which are constantly being refined in order to 

make them more effective.
The ECB publishes a number of studies and 
reports. The Annual Report presents a review of 

the ECB™s activities in the previous year and 

thus helps to hold the ECB accountable for its 

actions. The Monthly Bulletin provides regular 

updates of the ECB™s assessment of economic 

and monetary developments and the detailed 

information underlying its decisions. The ECB 

contributes to the dissemination of research 
findings by publishing working papers and 

occasional papers and by organising academic 

conferences, seminars and workshops.
In 2005 the ECB, in cooperation with the euro 
area NCBs, produced an educational tool to be 

used by young teenagers and their 

schoolteachers. This new tool aims to provide a 

broad and clear overview of the reasons why 

price stability is important in ensuring long-

term prosperity and of how the ECB™s monetary 

policy is geared towards achieving this 

objective. The information kit, which has been 

produced in the languages of the euro area and 
distributed to around 50,000 secondary schools 

in the euro area, contains an eight-minute film, 

leaflets for pupils and a teachers™ booklet. It 

can also be downloaded from the ECB™s website, 

where it is available in all official languages of 

the EU.
The ECB has also refined its method of 
communicating monetary policy decisions to 

financial markets and of making its 

announcements available to the public. Since 

February 2005 the monthly press conference 

has been webcast live via the ECB™s website. In 

addition, the related video and audio files are 

made available to the public shortly after the 

conference. 2 COMMUNICATION 
ACTIVITIESTogether with the BIS and the G10 central 
banks, the ECB launched a new publication 

entitled the ﬁInternational Journal of Central 

Bankingﬂ, the first quarterly issue of which was 

published on 19 May 2005. It features policy-

relevant articles on the theory and practice of 

central banking, with special emphasis on 

research related to monetary policy and 

financial stability.
All members of the Governing Council directly 
contribute to enhancing public knowledge and 

understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks and 

policies by giving testimonies before the 

European Parliament and national parliaments, 

making public speeches and providing 

information to the media. In 2005 the Executive 

Board members gave around 220 speeches and 

numerous interviews, as well as having articles 

published in journals, magazines and 

newspapers. 
The euro area NCBs also play an important role 
in ensuring the dissemination at the national 

level of information on the euro and the 

activities of the Eurosystem to the general 

public and interested parties. They address a 

variety of national and regional audiences in 

their own languages and environments.
160ECB Annual Report
2005The ECB also welcomes visitor groups to its 
premises in Frankfurt. In 2005 around 8,000 

visitors received first-hand information in the 

form of lectures and presentations given by 

ECB staff. University students and professionals 

from the financial sector made up the majority 

of visitors.All documents published by the ECB and its 
various activities are presented on the ECB™s 

website. Around 65,000 requests for information 

were received through various channels and 

handled in 2005.
The ECB holds an annual Cultural Days 
programme which aims to bring the cultural 

diversity and liveliness of the EU Member 

States closer to the public as well as to the 

ECB™s own employees. Each year this initiative 

highlights the richness of the culture of one 
country, thus fostering a better understanding 

of the nations in the EU. In 2005 the Cultural 

Days programme focused on Hungary, following 

on from Portugal in 2003 and Poland in 2004. 

The programme of events was organised in 

close cooperation with Magyar Nemzeti Bank 
and took place between 2 and 28 November.

CHAPTER 7INSTITUTIONALFRAMEWORK,
ORGANISATION AND
ANNUAL ACCOUNTS
165ECB Annual Report
2005The Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the 
NCBs of the 12 Member States whose currency 

is the euro. The Governing Council adopted the 

term ﬁEurosystemﬂ in order to facilitate 

understanding of the structure of central 

banking in the euro area. The term underlines 

the shared identity, teamwork and cooperation 

of all of its members. In January 2005 the ECB 

and the euro area NCBs published on their 

websites a mission statement for the Eurosystem 

together with strategic intents and organisational 

principles for the fulfilment of the functions of 

the Eurosystem by all of its members.
The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all EU Member States (currently 25), 

i.e. it includes the NCBs of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro. As long as 

there are Member States which have not yet 

adopted the euro, it will be necessary to make a 

distinction between the Eurosystem and the 

ESCB.
The ECB has legal personality under public 
international law. It was established as the core 

of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures 
that their respective tasks are carried out either 

through its own activities or via the NCBs.
Each NCB has legal personality according to 
the national law of its respective country. The 

euro area NCBs, which form an integral part of 

the Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred 

upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the 
rules established by the ECB™s decision-making

166ECB Annual Report
2005bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 
of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through their 

participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 

committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 

They may perform non-Eurosystem functions 

on their own responsibility, unless the 

Governing Council finds that such functions 

interfere with the objectives and tasks of the 

Eurosystem.The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by 
the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board. 

The General Council is constituted as a third 

decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 

as there are EU Member States which have not 

yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 

decision-making bodies is governed by the 

Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 

Rules of Procedure 1. Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 
However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 

jointly contribute, strategically and 

operationally, to attaining the common goals, 

with due respect to the principle of 

decentralisation in accordance with the Statute 
of the ESCB.
1.2 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL
The Governing Council comprises all the 

members of the Executive Board of the ECB 

and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 

States which have adopted the euro. Its main 

responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, 

are:Œ to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions 
necessary to ensure the performance of the 

tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem; 
Œ to formulate the monetary policy of the euro 
area, including, as appropriate, decisions 

relating to intermediate monetary objectives, 

key interest rates and the supply of reserves 

in the Eurosystem, and to establish the 

necessary guidelines for their 

implementation.The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 
a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am 

Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-

depth assessment of monetary and economic 

developments and takes related decisions 

specifically at its first meeting of the month, 

while the second meeting usually focuses on 

issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 

of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2005 two 

meetings were held outside Frankfurt: one was 

hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank in Berlin 

and the other by the Bank of Greece in Athens. 
When taking decisions on monetary policy and 
on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 

act as national representatives, but in a fully 

independent personal capacity. This is reflected 

by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 

applied within the Governing Council.

1.4 THE GENERAL COUNCIL
The General Council is composed of the 

President and the Vice-President of the ECB 

and the governors of the NCBs of all EU 

Member States. It mainly carries out those tasks 

taken over from the EMI which still have to be 

performed by the ECB on account of the fact 

that not all the Member States have adopted the 

euro. In 2005 the General Council met four 

times. The General Council decided in March 

2005 to invite the governors of the central banks 
of Bulgaria and Romania to attend, as from the 
date their countries signed the Accession Treaty, 

the meetings of the General Council in an 
observer capacity. This decision was taken in 

line with the approach applied to the then ten 
acceding country central banks (ACCBs) in 

2003 with a view to enhancing cooperation with 

the ACCBs in preparation for their entry into 

the ESCB. On 16 June 2005 the governors of 

the Bulgarian and Romanian central banks 
participated for the first time as observers in a 

meeting of the General Council.
171ECB Annual Report
2005The Eurosystem/ESCB committees have 
continued to play an important role in assisting 

the ECB™s decision-making bodies in the 

performance of their tasks. At the request of 

both the Governing Council and the Executive 

Board, the committees have provided expertise 

in their fields of competence and have facilitated 

the decision-making process. Membership of 
the committees is usually restricted to staff of 

the Eurosystem central banks. However, the 

NCBs of the Member States which have not yet 

adopted the euro take part in the meetings of a 

committee whenever it deals with matters that 

fall within the field of competence of the 

General Council. Where appropriate, other 

competent bodies, such as national supervisory 

authorities in the case of the Banking 

Supervision Committee, may also be invited. 

Since the signing of the Accession Treaty in 

April 2005, and in line with the decision to 
invite ACCB governors to attend the meetings 
of the General Council, experts from the central 

banks of Bulgaria and Romania have been 

invited to the meetings of ESCB committees in 

an observer capacity whenever they deal with 

matters that fall within the field of competence 

of the General Council. At present there are 12 

Eurosystem/ESCB committees, all of which 

were established under Article 9 of the Rules of 

Procedure of the ECB.
The Budget Committee, which was established 
under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, 

assists the Governing Council in matters related 

to the ECB™s budget. 
In November 2005 the Governing Council 
established a Human Resources Conference 

under Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure (see 

Section 2 of this chapter).1.5 EUROSYSTEM/ESCB COMMITTEES, THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES

172ECB Annual Report
20051.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In addition to the decision-making bodies, the corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 

a number of external and internal control layers, 

as well as rules concerning public access to 

ECB documents. EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The Statute of the ESCB provides for two 

external control layers, namely the external 

auditor 2, which is appointed to audit the 
annual accounts of the ECB (Article 27.1 of the 

Statute of the ESCB), and the European Court 

of Auditors, which examines the operational 

efficiency of the management of the ECB 

(Article 27.2). The annual report of the 

European Court of Auditors, together with the 

ECB™s reply, is published on the ECB™s website 

and in the Official Journal of the European 

Union.In August 2002 the Governing Council decided 
that, in order to reinforce public assurance as to 

the independence of the ECB™s external auditor, 

the principle of audit firm rotation should be 

applied. This decision was implemented as part 

of the procedure for the appointment of the 
ECB™s external auditor.
INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS
The internal control structure of the ECB is 

based on a functional approach. Each 

organisational unit (section, division, 

directorate or directorate general) is responsible 

for its own internal control and efficiency. In 

this respect, organisational units implement 

operational control procedures within their area 
of responsibility and determine the acceptable 

level of risk. For example, a set of rules and 

procedures Œ known as a Chinese wall Œ is in 

place to prevent inside information originating 

in the areas responsible for monetary policy 

from reaching the areas responsible for the 

management of the ECB™s foreign reserves and 

own funds portfolio. In addition to the controls 

implemented by each organisational unit, 

different divisions within the Directorate 

General Human Resources, Budget and 
Organisation monitor the control process and 
make proposals to improve the effectiveness of 

risk identification, assessment and mitigation 

in the ECB as a whole.  
Independently from the control structure and 
risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions are 

performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 

under the responsibility of the Executive Board. 

In accordance with the mandate defined in the 

ECB Audit Charter 
3, the ECB™s internal auditors 
evaluate, on an ad hoc basis, the adequacy and 

effectiveness of the ECB™s system of internal 

control as well as the ECB™s performance in 

carrying out assigned responsibilities. The 

ECB™s internal auditors adhere to the 

International Standards for the Professional 

Practice of Internal Auditing established by the 

Institute of Internal Auditors.
A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal 
Auditors Committee, which is composed of the 

heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 

NCBs, is responsible for the coordination of 

audit coverage for Eurosystem/ESCB joint 

projects and operational systems.
There are two Codes of Conduct in place at the 
ECB. The first is for the members of the 

Governing Council and reflects their 

responsibility to safeguard the integrity and 

reputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain 

the effectiveness of its operations.
4 It gives 
guidance to, and sets ethical standards for, the 

members of the Governing Council and their 

alternates when exercising their functions as 

members of the Governing Council. An adviser 

has also been appointed by the Governing 

Council to provide guidance to its members on 

some aspects of professional conduct. The 
2 Following a tender procedure in 2002, KPMG Deutsche 
Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft was 

appointed as the ECB™s external auditor with a five-year 

mandate covering financial years 2003 to 2007.
3 This Charter is published on the ECB™s website to foster the 
transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB.
4 See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing 
Council, OJ C 123, 24.5.2002, p. 9 and the ECB™s website.
173ECB Annual Report
2005second Code is the Code of Conduct of the ECB, which gives guidance to, and sets 

benchmarks for, the staff of the ECB and the 

members of the Executive Board, all of whom 

are expected to maintain high standards of 

professional ethics in the performance of their 

duties.5 In accordance with the Code of 
Conduct™s rules against insider trading, the 

ECB™s staff and the members of the Executive 

Board are prohibited from taking advantage of 

inside information when conducting private 

financial activities at their own risk and for 

their own account, or at the risk and for the 

account of a third party.
6 An Ethics Adviser 
appointed by the Executive Board ensures a 

consistent interpretation of these rules.
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
In 1999 the European Parliament and the EU 

Council adopted a regulation 
7 to step up the 
fight against fraud, corruption and any other 

illegal activity detrimental to the Communities™ 

financial interests. The regulation provides 

inter alia for the internal investigation of 

suspected fraud by the European Anti-Fraud 

Office (OLAF) within the Community 

institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. 
The OLAF Regulation foresees that each of 
the latter adopt decisions in order for OLAF to 

be able to carry out its investigations within 

each of them. In June 2004 the Governing 

Council adopted a decision 8 concerning the 
terms and conditions for investigations by 

OLAF of the ECB, which entered into force on 

1 July 2004. 
PUBLIC ACCESS TO ECB DOCUMENTS
The ECB™s Decision on public access to ECB 

documents 9 adopted in March 2004 is in line 
with the objectives and standards applied by 

other Community institutions and bodies with 
regard to public access to their documents. It 

enhances transparency, while at the same time 

taking into account the independence of the 

ECB and of the NCBs and ensuring the 

confidentiality of certain matters specific to 

the performance of the ECB™s tasks. 
In 2005 the number of public access requests 
remained limited.
5 See the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank in 
accordance with Article 11.3 of the Rules of Procedure of the 

European Central Bank, OJ C 76, 8.3.2001, p. 12 and the ECB™s 

website.

174ECB Annual Report
20052 ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.1 HUMAN RESOURCES 
STAFFING 
The total number of budgeted staff positions 
for 2005 was 1,369.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) 

positions. This compares with 1,362.5 FTE 

positions for 2004. At the end of 2005 the 

number of staff employed by the ECB on 

permanent or fixed-term contracts of at least 

12 months was 1,360, which corresponds to 

1,351 FTE positions.10 After 15 May 2005 the 
ECB started accepting applications from 

nationals of the two acceding countries, 

Bulgaria and Romania. All external recruitment 

to fill permanent positions was carried out on 

the basis of five-year fixed-term contracts 

for managerial and advisory positions and 

three-year fixed-term contracts for all other 

staff. 
In 2005 the ECB offered 106 short-term 
contracts of less than one year in order to fill 

temporary staffing needs (replacement for staff 

on maternity, parental or unpaid leave, etc.), 

compared with 123 in 2004. 
Additionally, in accordance with one of the 
Eurosystem organisational principles which 

states that ﬁthe exchange of personnel, know-

how and experience shall be promoted by and 

among all members of the Eurosystemﬂ, 80 

experts from the  NCBs of the ESCB, as well as 

from the Bulgarian National Bank and the 

Banca Naional a României, were recruited by 
the ECB for short periods of 3 to 11 months. 

These short-term assignments provided a very 

useful opportunity for ECB and NCB staff to 

gain from each other™s experience, thus fostering 

an ESCB-wide team spirit. They also contributed 

to the preparations for further EU enlargement 

and the future integration of the Bulgarian 

National Bank and the Banca Naional a 
României into the ESCB.
In 2005 the ECB provided internships for 158 
students and graduates with backgrounds in 

economics, statistics, business administration, 
law and translation. Of the 158 internships, 10 

were offered in the framework of the Graduate 
Research Programme, which is aimed at highly 
talented research students at an advanced stage 

of their doctoral studies. Under the Research Visitor Programme, which 
focuses on specific high-level research projects 

in the field of monetary policy, 19 research 

visitors were welcomed in 2005, compared with 

18 in 2004.
The ECB™s Graduate Programme, which is 
aimed at recent graduates with a broad 

educational background, was launched in 2005 

with a call for interest. The first intake is 

expected in 2006. 
INTERNAL MOBILITYInternal mobility represents an opportunity for 

staff to broaden their expertise and a means to 

increase synergies across business areas. In this 

respect, the internal recruitment policy, which 

places greater emphasis than in the past on 

broader competencies, aims to further facilitate 

internal staff mobility. Other initiatives, such as 

exchanges between staff and temporary internal 

transfers to new functions to cover for the 

absence of colleagues, also support internal 

mobility. In 2005 more than 100 members of 

staff moved internally to other positions.
EXTERNAL MOBILITYECB staff continued to be seconded to NCBs 

and to other relevant international and European 

institutions (e.g. the European Commission 

and the IMF) for periods of 2 to 12 months. 

15 members of staff participated in the external 

work experience scheme in 2005. In addition, 

the ECB continued to grant unpaid leave for up 

to three years for staff who wanted to take up 

employment at an NCB or other eligible 

financial organisation. 14 members of staff 

took advantage of this option in 2005. 
10 This compares with 1,314 staff employed on permanent or 
fixed-term contracts at the end of 2004, which corresponded to 

1,309 FTE positions.175ECB Annual Report
2005STRENGTHENING HUMAN RESOURCES The implementation of the new human resources 
(HR) strategy initiated in 2004 continued 

throughout 2005. In addition to promoting 

mobility, including managerial rotation, the HR 

strategy focuses on the development of ECB 

management. Managerial and leadership skills 
continued to be strengthened through training, 

individual coaching and a multi-source feedback 

exercise. This yearly exercise, which is 

mandatory for all managers, provides an 

assessment by relevant staff and feeds into the 

ECB managers™ annual performance assessment. 

In addition, the Advanced Management Training 

Programme was extended to cover the 

management of staff performance and 

organisational change.
Furthermore, the six ECB common values 
(competence, effectiveness and efficiency, 

integrity, team spirit, transparency and 

accountability, and working for Europe) 

identified in 2004 were gradually embedded in 

the human resources policies. The first steps in 

translating the values into the day-to-day 

behaviour and performance of staff involved 

encouraging initiatives to develop the values 

into concrete behavioural standards and actions 

and incorporating the values into the assessment 

of staff performance. 
The continuous acquisition and development of 
skills and competencies is one of the most 
important aspects of the ECB™s HR strategy. As 

a basic principle, learning and development are 

a shared responsibility. The ECB provides the 

budgetary means and training framework, 

managers define the training needs to ensure 

that staff maintain the high level of professional 

knowledge and skills required for their current 

position, and staff have the primary 

responsibility for learning and development. In 

addition to several in-house training 

opportunities, staff and managers can make use 

of external training opportunities to address 

individual specific training needs of a more 

ﬁtechnicalﬂ nature. They can also benefit from 

training opportunities organised as common 

ESCB programmes or offered by the NCBs. 
Additionally, under the Secondary Training 
Policy, the ECB offered support to 19 members 

of staff to acquire a qualification that would 

increase their professional competence beyond 

the requirements of their current position. 
THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE AND THE 

FOLLOW-UP TO THE EUROSYSTEM MISSION 

STATEMENT
With the aim of further promoting the 

cooperation and team spirit among Eurosystem/

ESCB central banks in the field of human 

resources management, the Governing Council 

established a Human Resources Conference 

(HRC), thus formalising the long-standing 

cooperation between the heads of personnel of 

the central banks of the EU. Without prejudice 

to the exclusive competence of the NCBs and 

the ECB in the area of human resources, the 

Governing Council gave the HRC a mandate for 

the exchange of experience, expertise and 

information on relevant human resources 

policies and practices. The HRC will contribute, 

inter alia, towards identifying opportunities for 

common training activities and developing 

measures to foster staff exchange. It will also 

coordinate activities of common interest in the 

human resources area.On 1 September 2005 the Governing Council 
decided on a number of concrete measures to 

promote the Eurosystem mission statement 

published in January 2005. The HRC and the 

Eurosystem/ESCB Communications Committee 

were subsequently mandated to implement the 

approved measures. Giving a concrete meaning 

to the mission statement for Eurosystem 

employees in their day-to-day work will be an 

ongoing process. DIVERSITY MANAGEMENTDiversity management seeks to harness 

differences among staff in order to create a 
176ECB Annual Report
2005productive and respectful working environment 
in which talents are fully utilised and 

organisational goals are met. Diversity 

management is important for the ECB as an 

institution that employs staff from the 25 EU 

Member States as well as the two acceding 

countries. The ECB has thus integrated diversity 

management into its day-to-day business so that 

the individual competencies of staff are 

recognised and fully utilised to enable the ECB 

to perform at the high level necessary to fulfil 

its tasks. A general diversity policy, a framework 

policy concerning dignity at work and a 

proposal for the monitoring of diversity issues 

were further developed in 2005. 
2.2 REVIEWING THE ECB™S EFFECTIVENESS AND 
EFFICIENCY  
As a public institution, the ECB is committed 

to delivering the best services at the lowest 

cost. As a complement to the existing internal 

and external control mechanisms that 

permanently monitor the ECB™s fulfilment of 

this commitment, the ECB decided to review its 

effectiveness and efficiency by conducting a 

zero-based budgeting assessment (ZBB) in 

which its staff and management were actively 

involved. The ZBB was a ﬁgreen fieldﬂ review 

of the effectiveness and efficiency of the 

activities of all ECB business areas, conducted 

through a survey of the activities and output of 

all ECB staff and management.
Based on the ZBB findings, the Executive 
Board decided that a substantial number of 

positions were to be saved, but without laying 

off staff. A temporary recruitment freeze was 

implemented for a few months of 2005 while 

the possible reassignment of some members of 

staff within the institution was assessed. The 

Executive Board adopted a number of other 

measures covering a wider range of 

organisational issues within and across the 

various business areas of the ECB. Such 

measures included: creating a Central 

Procurement Office within the Directorate 

General Administration; merging the Directorate 
Planning and Controlling with the Directorate 
Human Resources to form a new Directorate 

General Human Resources, Budget and 

Organisation; clarifying the allocation of 

responsibilities between the Directorate General 

Information Systems and other business areas 

of the ECB with regard to IT application; 

concentrating statistical work in the Directorate 

General Statistics; and enhancing the 

operational risk management function.2.3 NEW ECB PREMISES 
On 13 January 2005 the Governing Council 

reached a decision on the design for the ECB™s 

future premises. After careful consideration 

and extensive discussions based on the selection 

criteria for the competition, the Governing 

Council decided in favour of the revised design 

concept of COOP HIMMELB(L)AU, the 

architects who had won the international urban 

planning and architectural design competition. 
At the same time, the Governing Council 

launched an optimisation phase to review the 

functional, spatial and technical requirements 
with the aim of minimising costs and ensuring 
an optimal use of resources.On 15 December 2005 the Governing Council 
approved COOP HIMMELB(L)AU™s optimised 

design concept for the ECB™s new premises. 

The new concept fully met the requirements of 

the ECB. The building cost estimates were well 

within the envisaged cost frame of 
500 million. The building costs for the new premises cover 

the construction, technical infrastructure and 

landscaping, as well as certain necessary 

features and user-specific requirements which 

will ensure the proper functioning of the ECB 
as a modern central bank. The overall investment 

cost frame comprises not only the building 

costs but also all other cost elements which are 

necessary to complete the project. These other 

cost elements cover in particular the cost of 

purchasing the Grossmarkthalle site, the 

subsequent preparation and development of the 

site, all planning fees and other expenses 

covering items such as building permits, 
177ECB Annual Report
2005furnishings and IT. These costs are estimated to 
amount to a total of 350 million, of which 
around 80 million has already been invested in 
the purchase, preparation and development of 

the site as well as in the design competition. 

The overall investment cost, comprising 

building costs and all other costs, is therefore 
estimated to be 850 million. The cost estimates 
follow the methodology used for this type of 

project and are based on a constant 2005 price 

level.
The optimisation phase led to several changes 
in the design proposal. First, a new building 

element was introduced, which will intersect 

the Grossmarkthalle, connecting the hall to the 
towers and providing a distinctive entrance to 

the new ECB premises from the north. Second, 

the use of the Grossmarkthalle was intensified, 

while the view of the Grossmarkthalle from the 

south was improved. Within the optimised 

design proposal, the architectural aspects of the 
towers and their function of essentially 

providing office space remained unchanged. 
On 15 December 2005 the Governing Council 
also decided on the launch of the planning 

phase, which will commence in March 2006. It 

is envisaged that construction will begin 

towards the end of 2007, with an estimated 

completion date of the end of 2011.On 16 February 2006 the Governing Council 
approved the framework concept for the 

management, organisation, controlling and 

auditing of the planning phase of the new ECB 

premises project, including procurement and 

operational risk management. A memorial and information space to 
commemorate the Grossmarkthalle™s role in the 

deportation of Jewish citizens will also be 

constructed. A task force consisting of 

representatives of the City of Frankfurt, the 

Frankfurt Jewish Community and the ECB was 

set up to prepare an international competition 

for the design of the memorial and information 

space. The competition is expected to be 

launched in the first half of 2006.
178ECB Annual Report
20053 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE
The ESCB Social Dialogue is a consultative 
forum involving the ECB and employee 

representatives from all central banks of the 

ESCB and from European trade union 

federations. Its purpose is to provide information 

and an exchange of views on issues that may 

have a major impact on the employment 

situation at the central banks of the ESCB. 
Three meetings of the ESCB Social Dialogue 
were held in 2005. In addition to issues relating 

to banknote production and circulation, payment 

systems (TARGET2) and financial supervision, 

which are topics regularly addressed by the 

Social Dialogue, the discussions dealt with the 

Eurosystem mission statement, strategic intents 

and organisational principles and with their 

implications for the day-to-day work of 

Eurosystem staff.
The Governing Council acknowledged the staff 
representatives™ wish to be involved in 

discussions regarding further consequences of 

the Eurosystem mission statement for employees 

and consulted them before deciding on a number 

of initial implementation measures related to 
the mission statement. First, a decentralised 

consultation to be conducted locally with 

employee representatives was proposed to the 

euro area NCBs in May 2005. Second, following 

on from that initiative, a consultation of the 

employee representatives was carried out in the 

context of the Social Dialogue meeting of July 

2005. At that meeting, the European trade union 

federations made a joint declaration presenting 
their own vision of the Eurosystem mission 

statement, strategic intents and organisational 

principles. The ECB continued to issue, between meetings, 
a newsletter to keep employee representatives 

informed of the latest developments with regard 

to the above topics. Other ways of further 

enhancing the ESCB Social Dialogue and of 

increasing the involvement of staff 

representatives and trade unions of the NCBs of 

the ten new Member States were also agreed on 

at the 2005 meetings. 179ECB Annual Report

2005MANAGEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 
ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2005
1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The ECB™s activities in 2005 are described in 
detail in the relevant chapters of the Annual 

Report.
2 FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS
Under Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 

the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 

by the Executive Board, in accordance with the 

principles established by the Governing 

Council. The Accounts are subsequently 

approved by the Governing Council and then 

published.
3 PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, 
INTEREST RATE AND GOLD PRICE RISKS 
Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities 

are periodically revalued at current market 

exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s 

profitability is strongly affected by exchange 

rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, interest 

rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly 

from its holdings of foreign reserve assets held 

in US dollars, Japanese yen and gold, which are 

predominantly invested in interest-bearing 

instruments.  
Taking into account the ECB™s large exposure 
to these risks and the current size of its 

revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 

decided to establish a provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 

As at 31 December 2005, an amount of 

992 million was recorded in this provision, 
which had the effect of reducing net profit for 

the year to exactly zero.
This provision will be used to cover realised 
and unrealised losses, in particular valuation 

losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. 

Its size will be reviewed annually.
4 FINANCIAL RESULT 
Had the provision against foreign exchange 

rate, interest rate and gold price risks not been 

established, the ECB™s net profit for 2005 would 

have been 
992 million. In 2004, the ECB 
reported a net loss of 
1,636 million.The loss in 2004 was mainly due to the 
appreciation of the euro. This resulted in write-

downs in the euro value of the ECB™s holdings 

of US dollar-denominated assets, which were 

expensed in the Profit and Loss Account. The 

average cost of assets and liabilities denominated 

in US dollars in the books of the ECB was also 

adjusted to the year-end exchange rate.
In 2005, the depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis 
the US dollar and gold resulted in a substantial 

increase in the related revaluation accounts, but 

with no concomitant effect on the Profit and 

Loss Account. The harmonised accounting 

policies for the ECB and the Eurosystem, which 

are described in the notes to the Annual 

Accounts, are based primarily on the principle 

of prudence. In particular, they aim to ensure 

that unrealised gains arising from the revaluation 

of assets and liabilities are not recognised as 

income and are therefore not distributable as 

profit. Conversely, unrealised losses resulting 

from revaluations are expensed in the Profit 

and Loss Account at the end of the year.
In 2005 net interest income increased mainly 
due to a rise in US dollar interest rates, after 

historically low levels of domestic and foreign 

interest rates in 2004. Net interest income 

includes 868 million earned on the ECB™s 
share of euro banknotes in circulation.Total administrative expenses of the ECB, 
including depreciation, declined by 7% from 

374 million in 2004 to 348 million in 2005. Staff costs decreased primarily due to a change 

in the accounting treatment applied to the 

recognition of net actuarial gains/losses in 

respect of the ECB™s retirement plan and other 

post-employment benefits. The pension charge 

in 2004 was considerably higher due to the 
181ECB Annual Report
2005recognition of 
23.7 million in net actuarial 
losses in their entirety in the year in which they 

arose. From 2005 onwards, net actuarial gains 

and losses exceeding a prescribed limit are to 

be amortised over the expected average 

remaining working lives of the participating 

employees. 
This decrease in staff costs was, however, 
partially offset by the effect of an increase in 

staff numbers on total salaries. 
Other administrative expenses also declined, 
primarily due to a reduction in consultancy and 

professional fees.In 2005 the emoluments of the Executive Board 
amounted in total to 
2.1 million (2004: 
2.1 million).5 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND RISK 
MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserves portfolio consists 

of foreign reserve assets transferred to it by the 

Eurosystem NCBs in accordance with the 

provisions of Article 30 of the Statute of the 

ESCB, and the income thereon. Its purpose is to 

fund the ECB™s operations in the foreign 

exchange market for the purposes set out in the 

Treaty.
The ECB™s own funds portfolio reflects the 
investment of its paid-up capital, the general 

reserve fund and income accumulated on the 

portfolio in the past. Its purpose is to provide 

the ECB with a reserve to meet possible 

losses.The ECB™s investment activities and its 
management of the associated risks are 

described in greater detail in Chapter 2.
6 GOVERNANCE OF THE ECB
Information relating to the governance of the 

ECB is given in Chapter 7. 
7 EMPLOYEES
The average number of staff employed by the 

ECB rose from 1,261 in 2004 to 1,331 in 2005. 

For further details, see the notes on the Profit 

and Loss Account and Chapter 7, Section 2, 

which also describes the ECB™s human resources 

strategy.

185ECB Annual Report
2005ACCOUNTING POLICIES1FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The financial statements of the European 

Central Bank (ECB) have been designed to 

present fairly the financial position of the ECB 

and the results of its operations. They have been 

drawn up in accordance with the following 

accounting policies 2, which the Governing 
Council considers to be appropriate to the 
nature of central bank activity. 
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 

applied: economic reality and transparency, 

prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 

events, materiality, the accruals principle, going 

concern, consistency and comparability.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The accounts have been prepared on a historical 

cost basis, modified to include market valuation 

of marketable securities, gold and all other on-

balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and 

liabilities denominated in foreign currency. 

Transactions in financial assets and liabilities 

are reflected in the accounts on the basis of the 
date on which they are settled. 
GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND 

LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are converted into euro at the exchange 

rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. 

Income and expenses are converted at the 

exchange rate prevailing at the time of the 

transaction. The revaluation of foreign exchange 

assets and liabilities, including on-balance-
sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments, is 

performed on a currency-by-currency basis.
Revaluation to the market price for assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency is 

treated separately from the exchange rate 

revaluation. 
Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at 
the year-end. No distinction is made between 

the price and currency revaluation differences 

for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 
accounted for on the basis of the price in euro 
per fine ounce of gold, which, for the year 

ending 31 December 2005, was derived from 

the exchange rate of the euro against the US 

dollar on 30 December 2005.SECURITIES All marketable securities and similar assets are 

valued at the mid-market prices prevailing at 

the Balance Sheet date on a security-by-security 

basis. For the year ending 31 December 2005, 

mid-market prices on 30 December 2005 were 

used. Non-marketable securities are valued at 

cost.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 

period in which they are earned or incurred. 

Realised gains and losses arising from the sale 
of foreign exchange, gold and securities are 

taken to the Profit and Loss Account. Such 

realised gains and losses are calculated by 

reference to the average cost of the respective 

asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income 
but are transferred directly to a revaluation 

account.Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit and 
Loss Account if they exceed previous 

revaluation gains registered in the corresponding 

revaluation account. Unrealised losses in any 

one security, currency or in gold are not netted 

against unrealised gains in other securities, 
currencies or gold. In the event of an unrealised 

loss on any item at the year-end, the average 

cost of that item is reduced to the year-end 

exchange rate and/or market price.
1 The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in a 
Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 5 December 
2002 (ECB/2002/11), OJ L 58, 3.3.2003, pp. 38-59, as 

amended. 2 These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 
of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised 

approach to the rules governing the accounting and financial 

reporting of Eurosystem operations.
186ECB Annual Report
2005Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities are calculated and presented as part 

of interest income and are amortised over the 

remaining life of the assets.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 

the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 

agreement or conducts credit operations against 

collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are 
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to 

repurchase them from the counterparty at an 

agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised 

inward deposits on the liability side of the 

Balance Sheet and also lead to an interest 

expense in the Profit and Loss Account. 

Securities sold under such an agreement remain 

on the Balance Sheet of the ECB. 
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, 
securities are bought for cash with a 

simultaneous agreement to sell them back to 

the counterparty at an agreed price on a set 

future date. Reverse repurchase agreements are 

recorded as collateralised loans on the asset 
side of the Balance Sheet but are not included 

in the ECB™s security holdings. They give rise 

to interest income in the Profit and Loss 

Account.Reverse transactions (including security lending 
transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on 

the Balance Sheet only where collateral is 

provided to the ECB in the form of cash over 

the maturity of the transaction. In 2005 the 
ECB did not receive any collateral in the form 

of cash over the maturity of such transactions.
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 

forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 

exchange swaps and other currency instruments 

involving an exchange of one currency for 

another at a future date, are included in the net 
foreign currency position for the purpose of 
calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Interest rate instruments are revalued on an 

item-by-item basis. Outstanding interest rate 

futures positions are recorded in off-balance-

sheet accounts. Daily changes in the variation 

margin are recorded in the Profit and Loss 

Account. POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS
Assets and liabilities are adjusted for events 

that occur between the annual Balance Sheet 

date and the date on which the Governing 

Council approves the financial statements, if 

such events materially affect the condition of 

assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM 

BALANCESIntra-ESCB transactions are cross-border 

transactions that occur between two EU central 

banks. These transactions are processed 

primarily via TARGET Œ the Trans-European 

Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express 
Transfer system (see Chapter 2) Œ and give rise 

to bilateral balances in accounts held between 

those EU central banks connected to TARGET. 

These bilateral balances are then assigned to 
the ECB on a daily basis, leaving each NCB 

with a single net bilateral position vis-à-vis the 
ECB only. This position in the books of the 

ECB represents the net claim or liability of 

each NCB against the rest of the ESCB. 
Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBs 
with the ECB (except for the capital of the ECB 

and positions resulting from the transfer of 
foreign reserve assets to the ECB) are described 

as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities and are 
presented in the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a 
single net asset or liability position. 
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the 
allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystem are included as a single net asset 
under ﬁClaims related to the allocation of euro 

banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ (see 

ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 
accounting policies).187ECB Annual Report
2005Intra-ESCB balances of non-euro area NCBs (Danmarks Nationalbank, Sveriges Riksbank 

and the Bank of England) with the ECB are 

disclosed under ﬁLiabilities to non-euro area 
residents denominated in euroﬂ. 
TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets, with the exception of land, are 

valued at cost less depreciation. Land is valued 

at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-

line basis, beginning in the quarter after 

acquisition and continuing over the expected 

economic lifetime of the asset, as follows:
Computers, related hardware and 
software, and motor vehicles4 years
Equipment, furniture and plant in building10 years

Capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure25 years
Fixed assets costing less than 
10,000Written off 
in the year of 
acquisitionThe depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure relating to the 

ECB™s existing premises has been reduced in 

order to ensure that these assets are completely 

written off before the ECB moves to its new 

premises. THE ECB™S RETIREMENT PLAN AND OTHER 

POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The ECB operates a defined benefit scheme for 

its staff. This is funded by assets held in a long-

term employee-benefit fund. The ECB has 

modified its accounting policy with effect from 

1 January 2005. The effects on the financial 

statements are outlined below.
Balance SheetThe liability now recognised in the Balance 

Sheet in respect of the defined benefit plans is 

the present value of the defined benefit 

obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
less the 
fair value of plan assets used to fund the 

obligation, adjusted for unrecognised actuarial 

gains or losses. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value 
of the defined benefit obligation is determined 

by discounting the estimated future cash flows, 

using interest rates of high-quality corporate 

bonds that are denominated in euro and have 

similar terms of maturity to the term of the 

related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses can arise from 
experience adjustments (where actual outcomes 

are different from the actuarial assumptions 

previously made) and changes in actuarial 

assumptions.Until 2005 the ECB disclosed this defined 
benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 

assets separately (gross presentation). 

Moreover, all actuarial gains and losses were 

recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in 

the year in which they occurred. Consequently, 

the comparative figures for 2004 have been 

reclassified to bring them into line with the 

revised accounting policy. Since all actuarial 

gains and losses were previously recognised in 

their entirety in the year in which they arose, no 

prior year adjustment to the Profit and Loss 

Account was required in this respect.
Profit and Loss Account
The net amount now charged to the Profit and 

Loss Account comprises: 
(a) the current service cost of the benefits 
accruing for the year; 
(b) interest at the discount rate on the defined 
benefit obligation;
(c) the expected return on the plan assets; and 

(d) any actuarial gains and losses recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account, using a ﬁ10% 

corridorﬂ approach.
ﬁ10% corridorﬂ approach
Net cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains 

and losses which exceed the greater of (a) 10% 

of the present value of the defined benefit 

obligation and (b) 10% of the fair value of plan 
188ECB Annual Report
2005assets, are to be amortised over the expected 
average remaining working lives of the 

participating employees. 
Pensions of Executive Board members and 

other post-retirement obligations 
Unfunded arrangements are in place for the 

pensions of members of the Executive Board 

and disability benefit provisions for the staff. 

The expected costs of these benefits are accrued 

over the Executive Board/staff members™ terms 

of office/employment using an accounting 

approach similar to that of defined benefit 

pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses are 

recognised in the same manner as outlined 

above. 
These obligations are valued annually by 
independent actuaries to establish the 

appropriate liability in the financial 

statements.BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
The ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs, which 

together comprise the Eurosystem, issue euro 

banknotes.3 The total value of euro banknotes 
in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem 
central banks on the last working day of each 

month in accordance with the banknote 

allocation key
4. The ECB has been allocated a share of 8% of 
the total value of euro banknotes in circulation, 

which is disclosed under the Balance Sheet 

liability item ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ. The 

ECB™s share of the total euro banknote issue is 

backed by claims on the NCBs. These claims, 

which bear interest,
5 are disclosed under the 
sub-item ﬁIntra-Eurosystem claims: claims 

related to the allocation of euro banknotes 
within the Eurosystemﬂ (see ﬁIntra-ESCB 

balances/intra-Eurosystem balancesﬂ in the 

notes on accounting policies). Interest income 

on these claims is included within the item 

ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ. The Governing Council 

decided in 2002 that this income would be 

distributed separately to the NCBs in the form 

of an interim distribution after the end of each 

quarter.
6 It is distributed in full unless the 
ECB™s net profit for the year is less than its 
income earned on euro banknotes in circulation, 

and also after any decision by the Governing 

Council to make transfers to a provision for 

foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks, and subject to any decision by the 

Governing Council to charge against this 

income costs incurred by the ECB in connection 

with the issue and handling of euro banknotes.
OTHER ISSUES
Taking account of the ECB™s role as a central 

bank, the Executive Board considers that the 

publication of a cash flow statement would not 

provide the readers of the financial statements 

with any additional relevant information.
In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of 
the ESCB, and on the basis of a recommendation 

of the Governing Council, the EU Council has 

approved the appointment of KPMG Deutsche 

Treuhand-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft 

Wirt schaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the external 

auditors of the ECB for a five-year period up to 

the end of the financial year 2007.

banknotes (ECB/2001/15), OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, pp. 52-54, as 

amended.4 ﬁBanknote allocation keyﬂ means the percentages that result 
from taking into account the ECB™s share in the total euro 

banknote issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the 

NCBs™ share in that total. 
5 ECB Decision of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of 
monetary income of the national central banks of participating 

Member States from the financial year 2002 (ECB/2001/16), 

OJ L 337, 20.12.2001, pp. 55-61, as amended.
6 ECB Decision of 21 November 2002 on the distribution of the 
income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes in 
circulation to the national central banks of the participating 

Member States (ECB/2002/9), OJ L 323, 28.11.2002, pp. 49-50. 

This Decision was repealed by Decision ECB/2005/11, OJ L 

311, 26.11.2005, p. 41, which became effective on 18 November 

2005. From 2006, this distribution will occur at the end of the 

year only.
189ECB Annual Report
20051 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES
As at 31 December 2005 the ECB held 23.1 million ounces of fine gold (2004: 24.7 million 

ounces). The reduction was due to gold sales 

in accordance with the Central Bank Gold 
Agreement of 27 September 2004, of which the 

ECB is a signatory. The overall value of the 

holding increased compared with end-2004 due 

to a significant rise in the price of gold during 

2005 (see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets 

and liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies).2 CLAIMS ON NON-EURO AREA AND EURO 
AREA RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN 

CURRENCYReceivables from the IMF
This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of 

special drawing rights (SDRs) as at 31 December 

2005. It arises as the result of a two-way SDR 

buying and selling arrangement with the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF), whereby 

the IMF is authorised to arrange sales or 

purchases of SDRs against euro, on behalf of 
the ECB, within minimum and maximum 

holding levels. The SDR is defined in terms of 

a basket of currencies. Its value is determined 

as the weighted sum of the exchange rates of 

four major currencies (euro, Japanese yen, 

pound sterling and US dollar). For accounting 

purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency 

(see ﬁGold and foreign currency assets and 

liabilitiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies). Balances with banks and security investments, 

external loans and other external assets 
Claims on euro area residents denominated in

These claims consist of balances with banks 
and loans denominated in foreign currency, and 

investments in securities denominated in US

191ECB Annual Report
2005(a) Securities denominated in euro and reverse 
repurchase agreements in euro constitute 

the investment of the ECB™s own funds (see 

also note 12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ).(b) At end-200
4, the investment portfolios 
relating to the ECB™s retirement plan, 

amounting to 120.2 million, were classified 
under this item. These have now been 

reclassified as part of the pension scheme 

net liability under ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ (see 
ﬁThe ECB™s retirement plan and other post-

employment benefitsﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies).(c) In 2005 the ECB acquired 211 additional 
shares in the Bank for International 

Settlements (BIS). This brought the ECB™s 

total holding to 3,211 shares, which are 

included at the acquisition cost of 
41.8 million.Accruals and prepaid expenses
In 2005 this position included accrued interest 

receivable on the ECB™s claims related to the 

allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystem for the final quarter (see ﬁBanknotes 

in circulationﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies). Also included under this item is accrued interest 
on securities and other financial assets.
Sundry Included in this item is a claim against the 

German Federal Ministry of Finance in respect 

of recoverable value added tax and other 

indirect taxes paid. Such taxes are refundable 

under the terms of Article 3 of the Protocol on 

the privileges and immunities of the European 

Communities, which applies to the ECB by 

virtue of Article 40 of the Statute of the ESCB. 
7 BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
This item consists of the ECB™s share of the 

total euro banknotes in circulation (see 

ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in the notes on 

accounting policies).8 LIABILITIES TO OTHER EURO AREA 
RESIDENTS DENOMINATED IN EURO 
This item comprises deposits by members of 

the Euro Banking Association (EBA) which are 

used in order to provide the ECB with collateral 

in respect of the EBA™s payments settled through 

the TARGET system.
9 LIABILITIES TO NON-EURO AREA RESIDENTS 
DENOMINATED IN EURO 
These liabilities principally represent balances 

held at the ECB by non-euro area NCBs arising 

from transactions processed via the TARGET 

system (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/intra-

192ECB Annual Report
200511 INTRA-EUROSYSTEM LIABILITIES
These represent the liabilities to the euro area NCBs that arose from the transfer of foreign 
reserve assets to the ECB when they joined the 

Eurosystem. In 2004, two adjustments were 

made to these balances to reflect (a) the five-

yearly adjustment of the weighting in the ECB™s 

capital key on 1 January 2004 and (b) the 

accession of ten new Member States on 1 May 

2004, which also altered the ECB™s capital key 

weighting. The combined effect of the two 

adjustments was to reduce these balances from 

40.5 to 39.8 billion. No further adjustments 
took place in 2005.These balances are remunerated at the latest available marginal rate for the Eurosystem™s 

main refinancing operations, adjusted to reflect 

a zero return on the gold component (see note 

18, ﬁNet interest incomeﬂ). Capital key

13 PROVISIONS 
Taking into account the ECB™s large exposure 
to foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks, and the current size of its revaluation 

accounts, the Governing Council deemed it 

appropriate to establish a provision against 

these risks. As at 31 December 2005, an amount 

of 992 million was recorded in this provision, 
which had the effect of reducing net profit to 

exactly zero. 
The provision will be used to fund future 
realised and unrealised losses, in particular 

valuation losses not covered by the revaluation 

accounts. The size and continuing requirement 

of this provision will be reviewed annually, 

based on the ECB™s assessment of its future 

exposure to foreign exchange rate, interest rate 

and gold price risks. This assessment is based 

on generally accepted methods for estimating 

financial risks.
An appropriate provision against the contractual 
obligation of the ECB to restore its current 

premises to their original condition when they 

are vacated and the ECB moves to its final site 

and other provisions are included in this item.

capital as a contribution to the operational costs 

of the ECB. In 2004, this percentage was 

increased from 5% to 7%. Including the 

amounts received from the ten new non-euro 

area NCBs, this contribution amounted to a 

total of 111,050,988 at end-2004. There were 
no changes during 2005. Unlike the euro area 

NCBs, the non-euro area NCBs are not entitled 
to receive any share of the distributable profits 

of the ECB, including income arising from the 

allocation of euro banknotes within the 

Eurosystem, nor are they liable to fund any loss 

of the ECB.

Interest income increased significantly during 
2005 due to rising interest rates on US dollar- 

denominated assets. Interest income arising from the allocation of 

euro banknotes within the Eurosystem
This item consists of the interest income 

relating to the ECB™s 8% share in the total euro 

banknote issue. Interest on the claims of the 

ECB in respect of its share of banknotes is 
earned at the latest available marginal rate for 

the Eurosystem™s main refinancing operations. 

This income is distributed to the NCBs as 
outlined under ﬁBanknotes in circulationﬂ in 
the notes on accounting policies.Based on the ECB™s estimated financial result 
for 2005, the Governing Council decided in 

December 2005:(a) to recall the three quarterly interim 
distributions already paid to the NCBs 

during the year, amounting to 
634 million in total; (b) to withhold the final quarterly interim 
distribution of 234 million.Remuneration of NCBs™ claims in respect of 
foreign reserves transferred
Remuneration paid to euro area NCBs on their 
claims on the ECB in respect of the foreign 
reserve assets transferred under Article 30.1 of 

the Statute of the ESCB is disclosed under this 
item.Other interest income 
and Other interest 
expenseThese items include interest income of 1.6 billion (2004: 1.2 billion) and expenses of 
1.5 billion (2004: 1.1 billion) on balances 
arising from TARGET. Interest income and 

expenses in respect of other assets and liabilities 

denominated in euro are also shown here.

dollar security holdings to their end-of-year 

prices. 21 NET EXPENSE FROM FEES AND

Net expense 
from fees and 
commissions(182,373)(261,517) 79,144
Income under this heading arose primarily from 
penalties imposed on credit institutions for 
non-compliance with the minimum reserve 

requirements. Expenses primarily relate to fees 

payable on current accounts and in connection 

with the execution of foreign currency interest 

rate futures (see note 17, ﬁInterest rate 

futuresﬂ).22 OTHER INCOME
Other miscellaneous income during the year 

arose principally from the transfer of unused 

administrative provisions to the Profit and Loss 

Account. In particular, following changes in 

the ECB™s tenancy agreements, the reassessment 

and consequent reduction of the provision 

against its contractual obligation to restore its 
current premises to their original condition 
when they are vacated, led to an increase in this 

item.23 STAFF COSTS 
Salaries, allowances and staff insurance costs 

of 126.9 million (2004: 120.0 million) are included under this heading. The emoluments 

of the Executive Board amounted to a total of 

2.1 million (2004: 2.1 million). In 2005, 
transitional payments made to departing 

members of the Executive Board and pensions 

paid to former members or their dependants 

amounted to 0.4 million in total (2004: 0.5 million).Salaries and allowances, including the 
emoluments of holders of senior management 
positions, are modelled in essence on, and are 

comparable with, the remuneration scheme of 

the European Communities.Also included under this item is an amount of 25.6 million (2004: 41.9 million) recognised 
in connection with the ECB™s retirement plan 

and other post-employment benefits (see note 

12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). The reduction in the item ﬁStaff costsﬂ is 
primarily due to a change in the accounting 

treatment applied to the recognition of net 

actuarial gains/losses in respect of the ECB™s 

retirement plan and other post-employment 

benefits. The pension charge in 2004 was 

considerably higher due to the recognition of 

23.7 million in net actuarial losses in their 
entirety in the year in which they arose. In 

2005, since the 10% corridor approach now 

applies, no actuarial gains/losses were 

recognised in the Profit and Loss Account (see 

note 12, ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ). 197ECB Annual Report
2005At the end of 2005 the ECB employed 1,351 
staff, of whom 131 held managerial positions. 

The change in the number of staff during 2005 

was as follows:
20052004
As at 1 January1,3091,213
New staff82137

Resignations4041
As at 31 December1,3511,309
Average number of staff employed
1,3311,261
24 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
These cover all other current expenses relating 
to the renting and maintenance of premises, 
goods and equipment of a non-capital nature, 
professional fees and other services and 

supplies, together with staff-related expenses 

including recruitment, relocation, installation, 

training and resettlement.
25 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION SERVICES
This expense relates to costs arising from cross-

border transportation of euro banknotes between 

NCBs to meet unexpected fluctuations in 

demand for banknotes. These costs are borne 

centrally by the ECB.

2005NOTE ON PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/
ALLOCATION OF LOSSES
This note is not part of the financial statements 
of the ECB for the year 2005.
INCOME RELATED TO THE ECB™S SHARE OF TOTAL 

BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION
In 2004, following a decision by the Governing 

Council, income of 733 million earned on the 
ECB™s share of total banknotes in circulation 

was retained to ensure that the ECB™s total 

profit distribution for the year did not exceed 

its net profit for the year. Similarly, in 2005 an 

amount of 868 million was retained. Both 
amounts represented the full income earned on 

the ECB™s share of total euro banknotes in 

circulation in the years in question.
PROFIT DISTRIBUTION/COVERAGE OF LOSSES
Pursuant to Article 33 of the Statute of the 

ESCB, the net profit of the ECB shall be 

transferred in the following order:
(a) an amount to 
be determined by the Governing 
Council, which may not exceed 20% of the 

net profit, shall be transferred to the general 

reserve fund subject to a limit equal to 100% 

of the capital; and (b) the remaining net profit shall be distributed 
to the shareholders of the ECB in proportion 

to their paid-up shares.In the event of a loss incurred by the ECB, the 
shortfall may be offset against the general 

reserve fund of the ECB and, if necessary, 

following a decision by the Governing Council, 

against the monetary income of the relevant 

financial year in proportion and up to the 

amounts allocated to the NCBs in accordance 

with Article 32.5 of the Statute.
1 In 2005 the establishment of a provision against 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and gold 

price risks for the amount of 992 million had the effect of reducing net profit to exactly zero. 

Consequently, no transfers to the general 
reserve fund or profit distribution to the 
shareholders of the ECB took place. There was 

also no requirement to offset a loss.
The treatment of the ECB™s net profit/loss 
arising in 2004 and 2005 can therefore be 
summarised as follows:
20052004Net profit/(loss) for the year0(1,636,028,702)
Withdrawals from the general 
reserve fund0296,068,424
Transfer from NCBs™ pooled 
monetary income01,339,960,278
Total00
1 Under Article 32.5 of the Statute of the ESCB, the sum of the 
NCBs™ monetary income shall be allocated to the NCBs in 

proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB.

200513 JANUARY 2005
The Governing Council of the ECB decides that 
the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing 

operations and the interest rates on the marginal 

lending facility and the deposit facility will 

remain unchanged at 2.0%, 3.0% and 1.0% 

respectively.
14 JANUARY 2005
The Governing Council of the ECB decides to 

increase the allotment amount for each of the 
longer-term refinancing operations to be 

conducted in the year 2005 from 
25 billion to 
30 billion. This increased amount takes into 
consideration the higher liquidity needs of the 

euro area banking system anticipated in 2005. 

The Eurosystem will however continue to 

provide the bulk of liquidity through its main 

refinancing operations. The Governing Council 

may decide to adjust the allotment amount 

again at the beginning of 2006.

respectively.
1 DECEMBER 2005The Governing Council of the ECB decides to 

increase the minimum bid rate on the main 

refinancing operations by 0.25 percentage point to 

2.25%, starting from the operation to be settled on 

6 December 2005. In addition, it decides to increase 

the interest rates on both the marginal lending 

facility and the deposit facility by 0.25 percentage 

point, to 3.25% and 1.25% respectively, both with 

effect from 6 December 2005. 
CHRONOLOGY OF MONETARY POLICY
MEASURES OF THE EUROSYSTEM
116 DECEMBER 2005The Governing Council of the ECB decides to 
increase the allotment amount for each of the 
longer-term refinancing operations to be 

conducted in the year 2006 from 
30 billion to 
40 billion. This increased amount takes two 
aspects into consideration. First, the liquidity 

needs of the euro area banking system are 
expected to increase further in the year 2006. 

Second, the Eurosystem has decided to increase 

slightly the share of the liquidity needs satisfied 

by the longer-term refinancing operations. The 

Eurosystem will, however, continue to provide 

the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing 

operations. The Governing Council may decide 

to adjust the allotment amount again at the 
beginning of 2007.
12 JANUARY AND 2 FEBRUARY 2006
The Governing Council of the ECB decides that 

the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing 

operations and the interest rates on the marginal 

lending facility and the deposit facility will 

remain unchanged at 2.25%, 3.25% and 1.25% 

respectively.

219ECB Annual Report
2005This glossary contains selected terms that are used in the Annual Report. A more comprehensive 
and detailed glossary can be found on the ECB™s website.
Acceding countries: 
countries which have signed the Accession Treaty. Bulgaria and Romania 
did so on 25 April 2005. 
Accession countries: countries with which negotiations for accession to the EU have begun. 
Negotiations were started with Croatia and Turkey on 3 October 2005. 
Balance of payments (b.o.p.): 
a statistical statement that summarises, for a specific time period, 
the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world. The transactions considered 

are those involving goods, services and income; those involving financial claims on, and liabilities 

to, the rest of the world; and those (such as debt forgiveness) that are classified as transfers.
Benchmark portfolio:
 in relation to investments, a reference portfolio or index constructed on 
the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of, as well as the return on, the investments. 

The benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual 

portfolio.
Bond market:
 the market in which longer-term 
debt securities are issued and traded.
Central counterparty:
 an entity that interposes itself between the 
counterparties 
to trades, 
acting as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.
Central government: 
the government as defined in the 
European System of Accounts 1995 
but excluding regional and local governments (see also 
general government
).Central securities depository (CSD):
 an entity that holds and administrates securities and 
enables securities transactions to be processed by book entry. Securities can be held in physical 

(but immobilised) or dematerialised form (i.e. so that they exist only as electronic records). In 

addition to the safekeeping and administration of securities, a CSD may incorporate clearing and 

settlement functions.Collateral:
 assets pledged or otherwise transferred (e.g. by 
credit institutions
 to central banks) as a guarantee for the repayment of loans, as well as assets sold (e.g. by credit institutions to 

central banks) under repurchase agreements
.Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector: 
a balance sheet obtained by netting out inter-
MFI positions (e.g. inter-MFI loans and deposits) in the aggregated MFI balance sheet. It provides 
statistical information on the MFI sector™s assets and liabilities vis-à-vis residents of the 
euro 
area
 not belonging to this sector (i.e. 
general government
 and other euro area residents) and vis-
à-vis non-euro area residents. It is the main statistical source for the calculation of monetary 

aggregates, and it provides the basis for the regular analysis of the counterparts of 
M3.Corporate governance: 
rules, procedures and processes according to which an organisation is 
directed and controlled. The corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rights 

and responsibilities among the different participants in the organisation Œ such as the board, 
GLOSSARY
220ECB Annual Report
2005managers, shareholders and other stakeholders Œ and lays down the rules and procedures for 
decision-making.Corporate profitability:
 a measure of the earnings performance of corporations, mainly in 
relation to their sales, assets or equity. There are a number of different corporate profitability 

ratios based on company financial statements, such as the ratio of operating income (sales minus 

operating expenses) to sales, the ratio of net income (operating and non-operating income, after 

tax, depreciation and extraordinary items) to sales, the return on assets (relating net income to 

total assets) and the return on equity (relating net income to shareholders™ funds). At the 

macroeconomic level, the 
gross operating surplus 
is often used as a measure of profitability, 
based on national accounts, for instance in relation to GDP or value added.
Cost of the external financing of non-financial corporations (real):
 the cost incurred by non-
financial corporations when taking up new external funds. For 
euro area
 non-financial 
corporations, it is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of 
debt securities and the cost of equity, based on the amounts outstanding (corrected for valuation 
effects) and deflated by inflation expectations.
Counterparty:
 the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any party transacting with a 
central bank).Credit institution:
 (i) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable 
funds from the public and to grant credit for its own account; or (ii) an undertaking or any other 

legal person, other than those under (i), which issues means of payment in the form of electronic 

money.
Credit risk:
 the risk that a 
counterparty
 will not settle an obligation at full value, either when it 
becomes due or at any time thereafter. Credit risk includes replacement cost risk and principal 

risk. It also includes the risk of settlement bank failure.
Debt security: a promise on the part of the issuer (i.e. the borrower) to make one or more 
payments to the holder (the lender) at a specified future date or dates. Such securities usually 

carry a specific rate of interest (the coupon) and/or are sold at a discount to the amount that will 

be repaid at maturity. Debt securities issued with an original maturity of more than one year are 

classified as long-term.
Deposit facility: a 
standing facility
 of the 
Eurosystem
 which 
counterparties
 may use to make 
overnight deposits, remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate, at an NCB (see also 
key ECB 
interest rates
).Direct investment:
 cross-border investment for the purpose of obtaining a lasting interest in an 
enterprise resident in another economy (assumed, in practice, for ownership of at least 10% of the 

ordinary shares or voting power).
ECOFIN Council: the EU Council meeting in the composition of the ministers of economy and 
finance. 
Economic analysis:
 one pillar of the 
European Central Bank
™s framework for conducting a 
comprehensive analysis of the risks to 
price stability
, which forms the basis for the 
Governing 
221ECB Annual Report
2005Council™s monetary policy decisions. The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of 
current economic and financial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price 

stability from the perspective of the interplay between supply and demand in goods, services and 

factor markets at those horizons. Due attention is paid to the need to identify the nature of shocks 

affecting the economy, their effects on cost and pricing behaviour and the short to medium-term 

prospects for their propagation in the economy (see also 
monetary analysis
).Economic and Financial Committee (EFC): a consultative Community body which contributes 
to the preparation of the work of the
 ECOFIN Council. Its tasks include reviewing the economic 
and financial situation of the Member States and of the Community, and budgetary surveillance. 
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU):
 the process that led to the single currency, the euro, and 
the single monetary policy in the 
euro area
, as well as to the coordination of the economic 
policies of the EU Member States. This process, as laid down in the Treaty, took place in three 

stages. Stage Three, the final stage, started on 1 January 1999 with the transfer of monetary 

competence to the European Central Bank
 and the introduction of the euro. The cash changeover 
on 1 January 2002 completed the process of setting up EMU. 
Effective exchange rates (EERs) of the euro (nominal/real):
 weighted averages of bilateral euro 
exchange rates against the currencies of the 
euro area
™s important trading partners. The 
European 
Central Bank
 publishes nominal EER indices for the euro against two groups of trading partners: 
the EER-23 (comprising the 13 non-euro area EU Member States and 10 main trading partners 

outside the EU) and the EER-42 (composed of the EER-23 and 19 additional countries). The 

weights used reflect the share of each partner country in euro area trade and account for competition 

in third markets. Real EERs are nominal EERs deflated by a weighted average of foreign, relative 

to domestic, prices or costs. They are thus measures of price and cost competitiveness.
EONIA (euro overnight index average):
 a measure of the effective interest rate prevailing in the 
euro interbank overnight market. It is calculated as a weighted average of the interest rates on 

unsecured overnight lending transactions denominated in euro, as reported by a panel of 

contributing banks. Equities: securities representing ownership of a stake in a corporation. They comprise shares 
traded on stock exchanges (quoted shares), unquoted shares and other forms of equity. Equities 

usually produce income in the form of dividends.
Equity market:
 the market in which 
equities are issued and traded. 
ERM II (exchange rate mechanism II):
 the exchange rate arrangement that provides the 
framework for exchange rate policy cooperation between the 
euro area
 countries and the EU 
Member States not participating in Stage Three of 
Economic and Monetary Union.EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate):
 the rate at which a prime bank is willing to lend funds 
in euro to another prime bank, as reported by a panel of contributing banks, computed daily for 

interbank deposits with different maturities of up to 12 months.
Euro area:
 the area encompassing those Member States which have adopted the euro as the single 
currency in accordance with the 
Treaty 
and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under 
the responsibility of the Governing Council
 of the 
European Central Bank
. The euro area 
222ECB Annual Report
2005currently comprises Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. 
European Central Bank (ECB):
 the ECB lies at the centre of the 
Eurosystem

(Article 107(2)). It ensures that the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem
 and the ESCB are implemented either through its own activities or through those of the NCBs, pursuant to the 

Statute of the ESCB. The ECB is governed by the 
Governing Council
 and the 
Executive Board
, and, as a third decision-making body, by the 
General Council
. European Monetary Institute (EMI): 
a temporary institution established at the start of Stage 
Two of 
Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1994. It went into liquidation following the 
establishment of the 
European Central Bank
 on 1 June 1998. 
European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95):
 a comprehensive and integrated system of 
macroeconomic accounts based on a set of internationally agreed statistical concepts, definitions, 

classifications and accounting rules aimed at achieving a harmonised quantitative description of 

the economies of the EU Member States. The ESA 95 is the Community™s version of the world 

System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93). 
European System of Central Banks (ESCB):
 composed of the 
European Central Bank (ECB)
 and the NCBs of all 25 EU Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the 
Eurosystem
, the NCBs of those Member States that have not yet adopted the euro.
 The ESCB is governed by the 
Governing Council
 and the 
Executive Board
 of the ECB, and, as a third decision-
making body of the ECB, by the 
General Council
. Eurosystem:
 the central banking system of the 
euro area
. It comprises the European Central 
Bank and the NCBs of the Member States that have adopted the euro in Stage Three of 
Economic and Monetary Union. Excessive deficit procedure:
 the provision set out in Article 104 of the 
Treaty
 and specified in 
Protocol No 20 on the excessive deficit procedure requires EU Member States to maintain 

budgetary discipline, defines the criteria for a budgetary position to be considered an excessive 

deficit and regulates steps to be taken following the observation that the requirements for the 

budgetary balance or government debt have not been fulfilled. Article 104 is supplemented by 

Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the 

implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 

1056/2005 of 27 June 2005), which is one element of the 
Stability and Growth Pact
. Executive Board:

Governing Council:
 the supreme decision-making body of the 
European Central Bank (ECB)
. It comprises all the members of the Executive Board
 of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs

Gross operating surplus:
 the surplus (or deficit) on the value of output of production activities 
after the costs of intermediate consumption, compensation of employees and taxes less subsidies

borrowing/renting or owning of financial and non-produced assets have been taken into account. 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP):
 a measure of consumer prices that is compiled

Lisbon strategy:
 a comprehensive agenda of structural reforms aimed at transforming the EU 
into ﬁthe most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldﬂ, launched in 

2000 by the Lisbon European Council.
Longer-term refinancing operation:
 a regular 
open market operation
 executed by the 
Eurosystem
 in the form of 
reverse transactions
. Such operations are carried out through a 
monthly standard tender and normally have a maturity of three months.

2005M1: a narrow monetary aggregate that comprises currency in circulation plus overnight deposits 
held with 
MFIs and 
central government
 (e.g. at the post office or treasury).
M2: an intermediate monetary aggregate that comprises 
M1 plus deposits redeemable at a period 
of notice of up to and including three months (i.e. short-term savings deposits) and deposits with 

an agreed maturity of up to and including two years (i.e. short-term time deposits) held with 
MFIs and central government
.M3: a broad monetary aggregate that comprises 
M2 plus marketable instruments, in particular 
repurchase agreements
, money market
 fund shares/units, and 
debt securities with a maturity 
of up to and including two years issued by 
MFIs.Main refinancing operation:
 a regular 
open market operation
 executed by the 
Eurosystem 
in the form of 
reverse transactions
. Such operations are carried out through a weekly standard 
tender and normally have a maturity of one week. 
Maintenance period: the period over which 
credit institutions
™ compliance with reserve 
requirements
 is calculated. The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the first 
main refinancing operation
 following the meeting of the 
Governing Council
 at which the 
monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled. The 
European Central Bank
 publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of 

the year. 
Marginal lending facility:
 a 
standing facility of the 
Eurosystem
 which 
counterparties
 may use 
to receive overnight credit from an NCB at a pre-specified interest rate against eligible assets (see 

also key ECB interest rates
). MFIs (monetary financial institutions):
 financial institutions which together form the money-
issuing sector of the euro area
. These include the 
Eurosystem
, resident credit institutions
 (as 
defined in Community law) and all other resident financial institutions whose business is to 

receive deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and, for their 

own account (at least in economic terms), to grant credit and/or invest in securities. The latter 

group consists predominantly of 
money market
 funds. 
MFI credit to euro area residents:
 MFI loans granted to non-MFI 
euro area
 residents (including 
general government
 and the private sector) and MFI holdings of securities (shares, other equity 
and debt securities) issued by non-MFI euro area residents.
MFI interest rates:
 the interest rates that are applied by resident 
credit
 institutions and other 
MFIs, excluding central banks and 
money market
 funds, to euro-denominated deposits and loans 
vis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations resident in the 
euro area
.MFI longer-term financial liabilities:
 deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years, 
deposits redeemable at a period of notice of over three months, 
debt securities
 issued by 
euro 
area MFIs
 with an original maturity of more than two years and the capital and reserves of the 
euro area MFI sector.
MFI net external assets: 
the external assets of the 
euro area
 MFI sector (such as gold, foreign 
currency banknotes and coins, securities issued by non-euro area residents and loans granted to 
225ECB Annual Report
2005non-euro area residents) minus the external liabilities of the euro area MFI sector (such as non-
euro area residents™ deposits and 
repurchase agreements
, as well as their holdings of 
money 
market
 fund shares/units and
 debt securities
 issued by MFIs with a maturity of up to and 
including two years).
Minimum bid rate:
 lower limit to the interest rates at which 
counterparties 
may submit bids in 
the variable rate tenders of the 
main refinancing operations
. This is one of the 
key ECB interest 
rates 
reflecting the stance of monetary policy. 
Monetary analysis:
 one pillar of the 
European Central Bank
™s framework for conducting a 
comprehensive analysis of the risks to 
price stability
, which forms the basis for the 
Governing 
Council™s monetary policy decisions. Monetary analysis helps to assess medium to long-term 
trends in inflation, in view of the close relationship between money and prices over extended 

horizons. The monetary analysis takes into account developments in a wide range of monetary 

indicators including M3, its components and counterparts, notably credit, and various measures 
of excess liquidity (see also 
economic analysis
).Monetary income: income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the 
Eurosystem
™s 
monetary policy function, derived from assets earmarked in accordance with guidelines established 

by the 
Governing Council
 and held against banknotes in circulation and deposit liabilities to 
credit institutions
.Money market: 
the market in which short-term funds are raised, invested and traded using 
instruments which generally have an original maturity of up to and including one year.
Open market operation:
 an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in the financial 
market. With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, 
Eurosystem
 open market operations 
can be divided into four categories: 
main refinancing operations
; longer-term refinancing 
operations
; fine-tuning operations
; and structural operations. As for the instruments used, 
reverse transactions
 are the main open market instrument of the Eurosystem and can be employed 
in all four categories of operations. In addition, the issuance of debt certificates and outright 

transactions are available for structural operations, while outright transactions, 
foreign exchange 
swaps
 and the collection of fixed-term deposits are available for the conduct of fine-tuning 
operations. Option: a financial instrument that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
specific assets (e.g. a bond or a stock) at a predetermined price (the strike or exercise price) at or 

up to a certain future date (the exercise or maturity date). 
Other financial intermediary (OFI): 
a corporation or quasi-corporation other than an insurance 
corporation or pension fund that is engaged mainly in financial intermediation by incurring 

liabilities in forms other than currency, deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits from 

institutional entities other than MFIs, in particular those engaged primarily in long-term financing, 

such as corporations engaged in financial leasing, financial vehicle corporations created to be 

holders of securitised assets, financial holding corporations, dealers in securities and derivatives 

(when dealing for their own account), venture capital corporations and development capital 

companies.226ECB Annual Report
2005Portfolio investment:
 euro area
 residents™ net transactions and/or positions in securities issued 
by non-residents of the euro area (ﬁassetsﬂ) and non-residents™ net transactions and/or positions in 

securities issued by euro area residents (ﬁliabilitiesﬂ). Included are equity securities
 and debt securities (bonds and notes, and 
money market
 instruments), excluding amounts recorded in 
direct investment
 or reserve assets. 
Price stability:
 the maintenance of price stability is the primary objective of the 
Eurosystem
. The Governing Council
 defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the 
Harmonised Index 
of Consumer Prices for the 
euro area 
of below 2%. The Governing Council has also made it clear 
that, in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over 

the medium term.
Primary balance: 
government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments on 
consolidated government liabilities.
Projections:
 the results of exercises conducted four times a year to project possible future 
macroeconomic developments in the 
euro area
. Eurosystem
 staff projections are published in 
June and December whereas 
European Central Bank (ECB)
 staff projections are published in 
March and September. They form part of the 
economic analysis
 pillar of the monetary policy 
strategy of the ECB and are thus one of several inputs into the 
Governing Council
™s assessment 
of the risks to price stability
. Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system: 
a settlement system in which processing and 
settlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously) (see 

also TARGET
).Reference value for M3 growth:
 the annual growth rate of 
M3 over the medium term that is 
consistent with the maintenance of price stability
. At present, the reference value for annual M3 
growth is 4½%.
Repurchase agreement:
 an agreement whereby an asset is sold while the seller simultaneously 
obtains the right and obligation to repurchase it at a specified price on a future date or on demand. 

Such an agreement is similar to collateralised borrowing, with the difference that ownership of the 

securities is not retained by the seller. 
Reserve base: 
the sum of the eligible balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) that constitute 
the basis for calculating the reserve requirement
 of a 
credit institution
.Reserve ratio: 
the ratio defined by the central bank
 for each category of eligible balance sheet 
items included in the 
reserve base
. The ratio is used to calculate 
reserve requirements
.Reserve requirement:
 the minimum amount of reserves a 
credit institution
 is required to hold 
with the Eurosystem
. Compliance is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances 
over a 
maintenance period
.Reverse transaction: 
an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under a 
repurchase agreement
 or conducts credit operations against 
collateral
.227ECB Annual Report
2005Securities settlement system (SSS):
 a system which permits the holding and transfer of securities, 
either free of payment or against payment (delivery versus payment) or against another asset 

(delivery versus delivery). It comprises all the institutional and technical arrangements required 

for the settlement of securities trades and the safekeeping of securities. Such a system can operate 

on a real-time gross settlement, gross settlement or net settlement basis. A settlement system 

allows for the calculation (clearing) of the obligations of participants.
Settlement risk: a general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer system will 
not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both 
credit
 and 
liquidity risk.Stability and Growth Pact:
 the Stability and Growth Pact is intended to serve as a means of 
safeguarding sound government finances in Stage Three of 
Economic and Monetary Union in 
order to strengthen the conditions for price stability
 and for strong, sustainable growth conducive 
to employment creation. To this end, the Pact prescribes that Member States specify medium-term 

budgetary objectives. It also contains concrete specifications on the 
excessive deficit procedure
. The Pact consists of the Resolution of the Amsterdam European Council of 17 June 1997 on the 

Stability and Growth Pact and two Council Regulations, namely (i) Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 

of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance 

and coordination of economic policies as amended by Regulation (EC) 1055/2005 of 27 June 

2005, and (ii) Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the 

implementation of the excessive deficit procedure as amended by Regulation (EC) 1056/2005 of 

27 June 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is complemented by the ECOFIN Council™s report 

entitled ﬁImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ, which was endorsed by 

the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005. It is also complemented by the new 

Code of Conduct entitled ﬁSpecifications on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact 

and Guidelines on the format and content of Stability and Convergence Programmesﬂ, which was 

endorsed by the ECOFIN Council on 11 October 2005. 
Standing facility: 
a central bank facility available to 
counterparties
 on their own initiative. The 
Eurosystem
 offers two overnight standing facilities: the 
marginal lending facility
 and the 
deposit facility.Straight-through processing (STP): 
the automated end-to-end processing of trades/payment 
transfers including the automated completion of generation, confirmation, clearing and settlement 

of instructions.
Systemic risk: 
the risk that the inability of one institution to meet its obligations when due will 
cause other institutions to be unable to meet their obligations when due. Such a failure may cause 

significant liquidity or credit problems and, as a result, could threaten the stability of or confidence 

in markets.
TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system):
 the real-time
 gross settlement (RTGS) system
 for the euro. It is a decentralised system consisting 
of 16 national RTGS systems, the ECB payment mechanism (EPM) and the interlinking 

mechanism. TARGET2:
 a new generation of the 
TARGET
 system in which the current decentralised 
technical structure will be replaced by a single shared platform offering a harmonised service 

with a uniform pricing scheme.
