xOverviewEconomic activity in the euro area and the EU decelerated in the second 
half of last year. Neverthel
ess, supported by the continued buoyancy of 
global growth and trade, the pace of growth averaged 2% in the euro area 
and 2.4% in the EU for the year as a whole.  As a result of the unexpected 
deceleration experienced in the second half of last year, due in part to the 
oil price hike and the strength of the euro, the carryover into this year is 

lower than projected six
 months ago.  But growth
 is projected to return to 
potential during the course of this year - reaching 1.6% in the euro area and 
2% in the EU - before accelerating to 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively, in 

2006.  The main factors behind the outlook include accommodative 
macroeconomic policies, low inflation, suppo
rtive financial conditions, widening profit margins, progress in
 structural reforms, and a supportive 
global environment.The consolidation of the recovery over the forecast horizon is driven by an 
acceleration of domestic demand.  The pace of investment expenditure, in 

particular, is expected to pick up and this is accompanied by a more 
gradual recovery of private consump
tion.  The labour market responds to 
stronger economic activity.  This is supported by wage moderation and the 

restoration of confidence among cons
umers and entrepreneurs following 
the completion of structural reforms. 
 Accordingly, employment growth in 
the euro area is expected to accelerate from 0.6% in 2004 to 0.7% in 2005 
and 0.9% in 2006.  For the EU as a whol
e, the profile is similar, although 
the rise in employment is projected
 to be slightly lower in 2006.
World trade growth is estimated to have peaked at over 10% in 2004.  
With indications of a slowdown in mo
mentum in the second half of last 
year, the near-term outlook is for a moderation to around 8% this year and 
somewhat lower in 2006, as the global growth cycle matures. 
Current estimates suggest that the pace of world GDP growth climbed to a 
vigorous 5% last year, the fastest pace since the seventies.  Economic 
activity is projected to ease to a still-ro
bust 4.2% this year and marginally 
lower in 2006.  The surg
e in growth has been
 driven by a number of 
factors, including supportive macroeconomic policies, historically low real 
interest rates, housing-market-induced wealth effects, and particularly 

strong growth in certain emerging economies, such as China, India and, to 
a lesser extent, Brazil. The regional distribution 
of global growth contin
ued to widen last year, 
with stronger contributions coming 
from the EU, the 
candidate countries, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, while the US and some Asian 

emerging economies improved their already-strong performance.  In the 
US, helped by monetary and fiscal po
licy stimuli and solid underlying 
productivity growth, economic activity realised a growth rate of 4.4% in 
2004.  Nonetheless, in view of the 
high current account deficit and the 
large general government deficit, this pace of economic expansion is 

viewed as unsustainable, and accordingly the growth rate is expected to fall 
to 3.6% this year and to around trend at 3% in 2006. 
Modest recovery to 
continue in the euro area and the EU 
Global trade set to remain vibrant, as 

world economic activity 
moderates 
1Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 After sliding into technical recession
 in the middle of last year, the 
Japanese economy record
ed a marginally positive growth rate in the final 
quarter.  However, the weakness is exp
ected to be short-lived as a rebound 
in domestic demand, especially investment
, is set to yield a modest pace of 
1.1% this year, before momentum is
 restored once again next year.  
Deflation is still present in the econom
y but is projected to diminish over 
the forecast horizon.  The general government deficit is projected to edge 
lower to around 6% of GDP in 
2006.  The econom
ic outlook for Asia 
(excludingJapan) remains bright, with growth in the vicinity of 7% this 
year and next.  Over the forecast horizon, the pace of China™s growth is 
expected to moderate somewhat to ar
ound 8.4%, while India™s growth rate 
continues its upward trend.  Among th
e other emerging regions, economic 
activity in Latin America is set to dimini
sh but remain robust in 2005-6, 
while growth should accelerate in Africa.  In the candidate countries, the 
strong performa
nce of last year is expected to be followed by lower, but 
still robust, growth of around 5%
 in 2005 and 2006. 
The strong growth dynamic at the gl
obal level has sustained the demand 
for primary commodities. 
In view of the surge in 
oil prices to record highs in
 the first quarter of this 
year, the assumed profile for oil prices has been revised upwards compared 
to the autumn forecasts.  From an average of USD 47 per barrel (Brent 
crude) in the first quarter of this year, the price of oil is assumed to rise to 
USD 52.5 in the second 
and third quarters before 
declining gradually to 
USD 46.5 per barrel at the end of next year.  This implies an average of 

USD 50.9 per barrel for this year and 
USD 48 per barrel next year.  After a 
rise of 32% last year, this profile imp
lies a further increase of 34% this 
year, followed by a decline of almost 6% in 2006. 
Although the oil price hike is lower 
in real terms than during previous 
shocks and most industrialised oil-
importing economies have reduced their 
dependence on oil, last year™s sharp 
rise dented world growth.  The 
persistence of higher oil prices and 
their increased volatility have adverse 
implications for the growth outlook over the forecast horizon. 
The major stock market indices either remained unchanged or edged 
upwards during the course of last year. The recent easing of prices has not 

altered these broad trends.  Actual and
 implied mark
et volatility across most asset classes is historically low.  After rising modestly in the first half 
of last year, long-term
 government bond yields 
diminished once again in 
the second half as fears of an acceleration of inflation and the likelihood of 
a tightening of monetary policy in som
e countries receded. Such yields are 
low by historical standards in bo
th nominal and real terms. Emerging 
market and corporate bond spreads continued to narrow. Overall, these 
financial market trends 
are consistent with a benign view of the prospects 
for world economic activity. 
Rising oil prices and 
historically low bond yields2OverviewAfter gathering momentum in the fi
rst half of last 
year, the growth 
performance in both the euro area and the EU was less inspiring in the 
second half of the year.  In assessing the quarterly data outturn, it is worth 

noting that the working-day adjustm
ent had a negative impact on the data 
for the fourth quarter, which ma
y be exaggerated. In Germany, for 
example, when measured by the non-working-day-adjusted GDP data, the 

economy grew by 0.4% q-o-q in the fourth quarter of 2004, while the 
adjusted figure was -0.2%.  In any case, for the year as a whole, growth is 
estimated to have reached 
potential for the first time in four years, at 2% in 
the euro area and 2.4% in the EU.  
During the course of last year, the main driver of growth in the euro area 
shifted from the external 
sector in the first half of
 the year to internal 
demand in the second half.  The strong growth in imports of goods and 
services, which emerged in
 the second quarter and 
was maintained in the 
third quarter, diminished 
in the last quarter.  This failed
 to be matched by a 
parallel performance of exports in the second half of the year, leading to a 
negative contribution to
 growth from the external 
sector in the 
third and 
fourth quarters.  On the domestic si
de, the change in gross fixed capital 
formation moved into positive territory in 
the second quarter and sustained 
a solid pace of growth throughout the rest of the year.  The surprisingly 

healthy growth of private consumption 
in the first quarter proved to be 
transitory as the subsequent two quart
ers revealed no impulse to growth 
from this source.  However, the fourth quarter data showed an encouraging 
pick-up in consumer expenditure.  Overa
ll, the momentum achieved in the 
first half of the year could 
not be sustained since the stimulus from internal 
demand in the second half of th
e year was not strong enough to 
compensate for the negative impact from the external sector.  
The outcome for the EU reveals a 
similar picture in terms of the 
composition of growth, although the

3Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 demand was stronger than that of external demand on average during the 
year.  As in the euro area, the pace of the rebound in the second half of last 
year did not live up to expectations 
in the autumn forecast.  Nevertheless, 
the outcome for the year as whole was only marg
inally less than envisaged, 
at 2.4% rather than 2.5%.  
Following the positive readings at th
e turn of the year, survey indicators 
have been sending out mixed signals once 
again during the first quarter of 
this year concerning the prospects for 
the strength and sustainability of the 
recovery.  The Commission™s overall econo
mic sentiment indicator for the 
euro area, which was broadly flat in the second half of last year, dropped 
below its long-term average in February of this year.  After an encouraging 

rise in January, the composite Purchasi
ng Managers Index (PMI) stalled in 
February.  In general, although the 
trends are similar, the confidence 
indicators for the EU tend to exceed those for the euro area. 
Last year™s downwards trend in euro-area business confidence was 
interrupted by positive readings fro
m a number of leading indicators, 
including the PMI for manufacturing, th
e IFO and the NBB in January.  
However, somewhat weaker survey data for February have cast a shadow 
over the outlook and the recent surge in oil prices appears to have taken a 

toll on business confid
ence.  In the services sector, confidence remains 
lethargic.  Although there was some evidence of a change for the better at 
the turn of the year, the flat trends in the Commission™s confidence 
indicator and the PMI for services for the eu
ro area have been maintained 
so far in the first quarter of this 
year.  Nevertheless, the levels of the PMI 
for both manufacturing and services remai
n consistent with a continuation 
of economic growth.   
Consumer confidence, which had been on
 a gradual rising path since the 
turnaround in 2003 app
ears to have stabilised sin
ce the third quarter of last 
––lower-than-
expected average 
growth this year, while 

momentum builds up

4Overviewyear. However, country-specific indicators suggest that there are 
considerable differences across Member States in the level of consumer 
confidence.  
The anticipated recovery in household and business spending in the 
coming months stems in part from the 
particularly low real interest rates, 
both short-term and long-term.  The la
tter have contributed to a relaxation 
of the balance-sheet constraints of 
households and businesses through a 
reduction in debt servicing costs.  
Corporate profit margins have also 
widened.  The real disposable income of 
households should be sustained 
by the projected rise in employment and real wages.  The completion of 
structural reforms in some Member States, the decline in inflation and the 

effect on wealth of buoyant housing markets in several countries should 
also provide a positive impetus to consumption. 
The tempered labour market response in 
the prolonged downturn has been 
followed by a slow response in the 
upturn. The rise in the unemployment 
rate was quite subdued in comparison to previous cycles. The euro-area 
unemployment rate peaked at 9% 
in the first quarter of last year, after 
increasing by one percentage point duri
ng the slowdown 
in the current 
cycle. This contrasts with a rise of over three percentage points to above 

10% in the trough of the early nine
ties. On the employment side, the 
picture is also more encouraging insofar as job losses are concerned. No 
jobs were lost in net terms in th
e recent downturn, while more than 2.5 
million jobs disappeared 
in the 1992-93 recession. 
In line with the usual lagged respon
se of the labour 
market, around one 
million jobs are expected to be created this year in the euro area and 1.3 
million in the EU. These figures 
should improve further 
in 2006 as growth 
regains momentum. The unemployment rate is expected to remain stable at 
9% in the euro area and 8.8% in the EU this year, before diminishing in 
2006. Boosted by such factors as energy price hikes as well as the temporary 
impact of rises in indirect taxes and administered prices, headline inflation 

in the euro area remained sticky last year. From an average rate of 2.1% in 
2003 and 2004, h
eadline inflation is expected to
 fall to 1.9% this year, as a 
result of weak domestic price pressures. 
A further fall to 1.5% is foreseen 
for next year. 
For the EU as a whole, the projected profile over the forecast horizon is 
flatter.  After an initial fall from 2.1% in 2004 to 1.9% this year, a further 
decline to 1.7% is projected for 
next year.  The falling inflation rates 
anticipated for the recently-acceded Member States means that inflation 

dispersion is falling in the EU, although 
it still remains higher than in the 
euro area this year. 
Against the background of a slightly
 widening negative output gap, the 
general government deficit for the euro area is expected to post a marginal 

improvement this year to 2.6% of GDP fr
om 2.7% in 2004.  This reflects a 
slightly restrictive fiscal policy stance. For the EU25, the deficit is

situation  5Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 projected to remain unchanged at 2.6% 
of GDP this year.  On a ﬁno-policy 
changeﬂ basis, this broad trend
 should be maintained 
for both the euro area 
and the EU in 2006. 
The four countries in 
the euro area that are in excessive deficit, namely 
Germany, Greece, France and the Netherlands, are expected to narrow 

their deficits significantly in 2005.  Howev
er, only in th
e Netherlands 
would the deficit be reduced to below the 3% of GDP reference value, 
while the deficit for France is forecast to be 
at the reference value.  In 
2006, on a ﬁno-p
olicy changeﬂ assumption, the deficit is expected to be 
below 3% of GDP also in Germany, whil
e it is projected to rebound in 
France and to continue to exceed the reference value in Greece.  For Italy 

and Portugal, where the 2004 deficit 
was at or just below 3% of GDP, a 
sharp widening to well above the reference
 value is forecast in both 2005 
and 2006, reflecting a diminished 
recourse to one-off measures.  The 
projected increase in the Austrian deficit 
to around 2% of GDP in 2005 
reflects the implementation of tax cu
ts.  The remaining euro-area Member 
States (Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Luxemb
ourg and Finland) are expected to 
remain broadly in a balanced
 or surplus position. 
Outside the euro area, fiscal consolidation in the six recently-acceded 
Member States that were found to be in excessive deficit last year is 
proceeding at an uneven pace.  Cyprus and Malta are set to reduce the 
deficit by more than 2 percentage poin
ts of GDP between 2004 and 2006 Œ 
to below the 3% of GDP reference value from 2005 in Cyprus and from 
2006 in Malta, both in lin
e with the governments™ 
plans.  In the other 
Member States - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - the 
deficit is still projected to stand at so
me 4% of GDP in 2006.  Deficits of 
around 2% of GDP are forecast for 2
005-2006 in Latv
ia, Lithuania and 
Slovenia.  The United K
ingdom, which recorded 
a deficit in excess of 3% 
of GDP in both 2003 and 2004, is 
projected to gradually reduce its deficit 
to 2.7% of GDP in 2006.  Finally, Denmark, Estonia and Sweden are 

expected to maintain a surplus over the forecast period, albeit a 
diminishing one. 
The general government gross debt ratio is
 projected to rise by about half a 
percentage point in 2005 in both the euro area and the EU25, to almost 
72% and just over 64% of GDP, respectively.  Debt developments are quite 

diverse among the high-debt countries.  With debt ratios well above 100% 
of GDP, Greece and Italy are the most indebted countries.  In Italy, the 
debt ratio is foreseen to be half a pe
rcentage point higher in 2006 
compared to 2004, while Greece should succeed in reducing the ratio by 
1.5 percentage points over the same 
period.  Cyprus and Belgium are 
projected to bring down their debt levels 
by at least 4 percentage points of 
GDP, while Austria is set to record a more modest fall.  At the other end of 
the spectrum, the Portuguese debt ratio is foreseen to rise by more than 6 

percentage points of GDP, with 
less significant increases in France, 
Germany and Malta. 
6OverviewAlthough moderating, the momentum of 
global growth remains strong and 
trade growth is still vigorous.  In add
ition, there is evidence in some 
Members States that domestic demand has 
started to recover, thus reducing 
the susceptibility of growth
 dynamics to the an
ticipated reduction of the 
external stimulus.  
Nevertheless, the outlook 
is not without its risks.  On
 the external side, the 
recent surge in oil prices has once again put the spotlight on the potential 
dampening effects of higher and more volatile oil prices on global growth 

and trade.  The risk of abrupt exchange rate adjustments remains in place 
in view of the ongoing glob
al imbalances.  More specifically, the US 
current account deficit remains large and
 it is financed ma
inly through the 
accumulation of official holdings of dollar-denominated assets in Asia. 
Although financial market development
s to date may be interpreted as 
being consistent with a be
nign outlook for the 
world econom
y, there is still 
some cause for concern over the 
sustainability of this outlook.  In this 
context, the possible risks include a 
more aggressive tightening of interest 
rates should inflation pressu
res intensify in some countries, a sharp 
correction of asset prices and the 
repricing of credit risk as investors 
become increasingly sensitive 
to risk exposure.   
On the domestic side, in view of the projected reliance of the growth 
forecast on domestic demand, a slower return of consumer confidence 
poses the main downside risk.  Survey 
indicators suggest that consumers in 
some Member States are still hesita
nt about committing themselves to 
purchases of larger consumer durable good
s.  Should the continued rise in 
oil prices become more visible in dom
estic inflation, this 
would also lead 
to an adverse effect on consumer confidence.  Furthermore, it may take 

longer for structural reforms implemented in several Member States to feed 
through to confiden
ce.  Finally, the deteriorating competitive positions of 
some Member States may also pose a down
side risk, especially in those 
countries that rely on external demand 
as an important source of growth.   
The above downside risks are, to some extent, offset by a few upside risks. 
In view of the fact that the pace of
 investment has to date been lower than 
might be expected from favourab
le financing conditions and positive 
developments in earnings and profitab
ility, stronger growth in investment 
cannot be excluded.  The effect of the pr
olonged rise in house prices in a 
number of EU countries on household
 wealth could underpin a stronger 
acceleration in consumer spending in these countries.   
The labour market reforms undertaken by Member States represent an 
upside risk for consumer confidence and accordingly for the release of 

pent-up consumer demand, which could be
 financed through a reduction in 
the savings rate.  Such reforms include the recent changes in Germany, as 
well as the past reforms in other Member States, which have led to greater 
labour market resilience and a decline in the non-accelerating-inflation rate 
of unemployment (NAIRU).  In additio
n, the working-day adjustment, 
already mentioned above, may underestimate the strength of the underlying 
Upside and downside 
risks to the forecast 
7Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 dynamics in the fourth quarter of 
last year, thereby leading to a stronger-
than-expected carryover of momentum into this year. 
Overall, however, the balance of risk
s is tilted towards the downside. 
Candidate countries are expected to cont
inue to enjoy relatively strong 
growth over the forecast horizon.  In Romania and Turkey, the pace of 
economic activity is projected to decelerate slightly in 2005 and 2006, after 
a particularly strong performance in 2004.  Growth is set to accelerate in 

Croatia, whereas output expansion in 
Bulgaria is likely to
 peak this year, 
reflecting election-related public spending. 
 Rising labour productivity and 
an expanding and modernised capital stock are the main sources of this 

continued expansion.  Private consum
ption and, in particular, investment 
are also important driving forces beh
ind the projected sustained growth 
over the next two years. 
Overall, inflation is forecast to decline in candidate countries.  Turkey and 
Romania, in particular, are set to tak
e a further important step towards 
price stability, as their inflation rates are expected to fall to around 6½% in 
2006.  The main factors behind this ou
tlook are a strengthening supply side 
of these economies, driven by high investment, and overall prudent fiscal 

and monetary policies, combined with some real appreciation of the 
currencies of some countries.  Only in 
Croatia are rises in administered 
prices projected to lead to a slight acceleration of inflation. 
It is envisaged that labour markets will benefit from strong output growth, 
which - despite su
stained gains in 
labour productivity Œ 
should lead to 
employment gains and falling unemploym
ent.  In Romania, the ongoing 
restructuring in industry a
nd agriculture is expected
 to more than offset job 
creation in other sectors, leading to minor declines in employment and 
increasing unemployment. 
In Romania and, more particularly, in Bulgaria, general government 
deficits are set to remain quite moderate.  This is supported by a projection 
of strongly rising revenues
 against a backdrop of st
rong economic growth.  
Existing higher deficits in Croatia and 
especially in Turkey 
are expected to 
narrow further. 
In all candidate countries, current account balances are forecast to remain 
fairly high, driven by strong do
mestic demand and higher world 
commodity prices.  Rising trade deficits will only be partly offset by 

growing surpluses in other parts of the current account balance. 
The Candidate 
Countries8Chapter 1 The world economy 1. Global growth and trade to remain 
robustThe global recovery is expected 
to continue, but at a 
somewhat slower pace. After growing briskly by 
about 5% last year, the fastest pace in decades, the 

world economy is set to expand 
by just over 4% in 
both 2005 and 2006. The deceleration in activity is 
expected to be accompanied by a somewhat slower 

expansion of global trade. The large global current 
account imbalances are projected to continue, while 
stabilising towards the end of the forecast period. 

High oil prices, driven by
 the strong growth in 
demand and the low level
 of spare oil production 
capacity, are likely to have contributed to slower 

global growth. Financial co
nditions, with low interest 
rates and low risk premia on corporate and emerging 
market debt, remain supportive for growth. While 

global economic activity is exp
ected to stay robust, 
important downside risks exist, in particular the risk 
of disorderly adjustment of the large global current 

account imbalances. Furthermore, high oil prices 
remain a source of risk, 
in view of strong growth in 
oil demand and con
tinued geopolitical risks. 
World growth remains robust after peaking in 
early 2004 Growth in the global economy peaked in the first half 
of 2004, with particularly high rates recorded in the 

first quarter in China, Japan and the United States. 
Subsequently, the pace of growth slowed to more 
normal levels in the Un
ited States, whereas Japan  
experienced slight decreases in real GDP in the 
second and third quarters of 2004, according to 
revised national accounts data.

In China, after very robust growth in 2003 and in the 
first quarter of 2004, GDP growth decelerated 
considerably in the 
second quarter of last year, but 
picked up again in the last two quarters of the year. 
The moderation of the global expansion during the 
course of 2004 was reflected in the easing of world 
trade growth. After having grown at a very brisk pace 

between mid-2003 and mid-2004, the growth of trade 
decelerated in the third and fourth quarters. Growth in 
industrial production in 
the industrialised economies 
paused in the second half of last year, whereas 
consumer demand held up more strongly. This is 
evidenced by growth in
 retail sales for the OECD as a 
whole, due to strong 
US consumer demand. 
Despite the easing of the gl
obal expansion, which was 
to be expected following the above-trend pace 
experienced in the second half of 2003 and beginning 

of last year, world growth should continue to be 
robust over the forecast horizon. The rate of change of 
the OECD leading ind
icator picked up 
slightly in the 
final quarter of 2004 and this trend was maintained in 
January. Furthermore, purch
asing manager indices are 
also continuing to indicate a solid rate of expansion at 
the start of this year.

Oil prices have continued to 
be very volatile. After a 
brief respite from the upward trend towards the end of

trading at around 55 USD/bl

have risen by about 70% in

in EUR (about 60%).

The renewed surge in prices is caused by the fact that 
the oil market remains very tight as a result of high 
demand growth and low spare production capacity. 
According to the latest figur
es from the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), total world oil demand is 
estimated to have increased by 
2.7 million barrels per 
day (mb/d) in 2004 (3.4%)
, a historically very rapid 
expansion. This has pushed oil production close to 

full capacity, which has made the price of oil more 
vulnerable to concerns about supply and demand 
imbalances. 
The International Energ
y Agency recently raised its 
demand forecast for this year, estimating that global 
demand will increase by 1.8 mb/d. This is 
significantly lower than the 
rise in 2004, but still a 
sign that oil demand remains strong. Demand in the 
importing regions of Europe, North America and 
China was stronger than ex
pected in the 
fourth quarter 
of last year. Market participants expect a tight oil 
market, with futures prices indicating a medium-term 

price of around USD 45 per barrel. In view of these 
factors, oil prices are likely to remain high over the 
forecast period. The price of Brent is assumed to 

average USD 50.9 per barrel this year, which is 34.4% 
higher than the 2004 average. Next year, prices are 
expected to fall back sli
ghtly to USD 48 per barrel, a 
decline of 6% compared to 2005
. This corresponds to a quarterly profile of gra
dually falling prices from the 
third quarter of this year onwards. 
Given the tightness of th
e oil market, there is a risk 
that prices could increase even further. Ongoing  
concerns about the security of supply and political 
uncertainties in a number of oil-producing countries 

continue to underpin oil pr
ices, while demand growth 
has repeatedly proved stronger than expected.  
Financial conditions still suppo
rtive to growth 
Despite the apparent soft patch in growth in many 
countries in the second quar
ter of 2004, and the 
continued increases in oil prices, financial market 
developments have been characterised by stability.

In the US, the Federal 
Reserve started to raise short-
term interest rates in the summer of 2004, in view of 
the maturing recovery and some concern about the 

future path of inflation. Nevertheless, the monetary 
policy stance is still accommodative and the gradual 
removal of monetary stimulus 
is expected to continue 
in 2005.  12Chapter 1 The world economy 
While short term rates have increased in the US, long 
term yields stayed surprisingly 
low into early 2005. 
Inflation has increased somewhat but remains 

relatively low, and foreign investors continue to 
finance the US current account deficit, implying 
overall low pressure on long yields. 
For the euro area, the yield curve is virtually 
unchanged compared to the autumn forecast, with 
slightly lower long-term interest rates. Despite 
somewhat lower inflation, real interest rates remain 

accommodative to growth. Furthermore, financing 
conditions facing firms have continued to improve 
with corporate bo
nd spreads remaining very low (see 
also section 2.2).  
Low risk premia are also benefiting emerging market 
economies. However, a disorderly adjustment of 
international imbalances could expose investors to 

sharp exchange rate movements and sharper-than-
expected interest rate in
creases. Housing markets, 
which have underpinned consumer demand in a 

number of countries, may also pose a risk in this 
respect.406080100

roughly unchanged or having gained slightly in the 

last year, on the basis of strong profit growth.  
After a period of general stability in the middle of last

greater variability towards

mid-October onwards, the dollar depreciated against 
major currencies, with the euro reaching a record high 
of over 1.36 USD in late 
December 2004. Overall, the 
trend remains one of dollar weakness against the 
background of a large US current account deficit. The 
Japanese yen also depreciated in recent months,

Risks remain on the downside 
Despite the positive outlook for growth in the world 
economy, some risks are nevertheless apparent. The 
moderation of world economic growth in the second 
half of 2004 could prove to be more pronounced than 

expected, particularly in view
 of rising oil prices.  
Imbalances in the US economy remain the most 
important source of risk for the global economy. The 
current account deficit is expected to remain very 
large. A more abrupt adjustment of these imbalances 
would imply significantly
 lower growth in the US 
economy and would have consequences for the world 
economy through finan
cial markets as well as lower 
trade growth and lower consumer and business 

confidence. Low risk premia on emerging market and 
corporate debt and housing prices in certain countries, 
could represent elements of particular vulnerability, 

should US long-term interest rates move up sharply. 
However,  US growth has conti
nued to surprise on the 
upside, and the projected slowdown in the second half 
of 2005 might be smaller than expected, due to 

resilient consumer 
spending and 
strong corporate investment, possibly he
lped by still-low long-term 
interest rates and strong corporate finances. 
132. Outlook for major economies and 
selected regions The forecast for the 
US economy foresees annual 
GDP growth decelerating to 3.6% and 3.0% in 2005 
and 2006, respectively. Th
is represents an upward 
adjustment compared
 to the autu
mn forecast, but is 
still a slowdown from last
 year™s above-potential 
growth rate of 4.4%. Growth in consumer spending, 

which has remained surprising
ly strong, should start 
to decelerate as a result of a gradual rise in short and 
long-term interest rates and a weaker fiscal stimulus. 

Investment is expected to conti
nue to rise, although at 
a somewhat slower pace than the 10% annual rate 
observed over the past year and a half. As a 

consequence of the lagged effect of the dollar 
depreciation in 2002-2004, the growth rates of exports 
are now projected to outstrip those of imports. This 

should lead to a stabilisation 
of the trade and current 
account deficits as a share of GDP in 2006. 
GDP growth in 
Japan
 has been revised downward 
considerably compared to the autumn forecast, mainly 

due to revised national accou
nts data. It now appears 
that the Japanese economy went through a technical 
recession in the second an
d third quarters of 2004, 
with a slight rebound in the fourth quarter. Despite 
this weakness, annual growth reached 2.7% in 2004, 

because of the strong first quarter performance and 
the carryover from the healthy growth in the second 
half of 2003. Looking ahead, most indicators point to 

a rebound in the first quarter 
of this year. On the back 
of continued, albeit less 
vigorous, global growth, 
sustained investment growth and a slight rebound in 

private consumption, GDP growth is expected to 
reach 1.1% and 1.7% in 2005 and 2006, respectively. 
Given the very slow decele
ration in underlying 
deflation and the lower gro
wth projections, the year-on-year change in the consumer price index may turn 
positive only towards the end of this year. Growth in 
the rest of Asia
 also gathered momentum 
in 2004, reaching 7.8% on the back of a strong global 
recovery and strengthening domestic demand. Largely 
due to an expected cooling 
of export demand, notably 
in the IT sector, the region is forecast to experience a 
deceleration in GDP growth to around 7.1% in 2005 
and 2006. The m
acroeconomic impact of the tsunami 
on the Asia region is exp
ected to be limited and 
relatively short-lived.  
Within the rest of Asia, after growing by 9.5% in 
2004, the 
Chinese
 economy is expected to enter a 
phase of more sustainable gr
owth. Following very 
robust growth in 2003 and in 
the first quarter of 2004, 
and the concerns about overinvestment and 
overheating in some sectors (such as steel, aluminium, 

cement, automobiles and real estate), GDP growth
decelerated markedly in the second quarter of last 
year. This was partly the resu
lt of administrative 
measures, in particular restrictions on land use and 
credit rationing, gradually introduced by the 
authorities since mid-
2003 to rein in 
investment in the 
overheating sectors. However, economic activity 
picked up pace again in the third and fourth quarters 
of the year, implying a modest acceleration in GDP 

growth for 2004 as a whole (to 9.5%, from 9.3% in 
2003). The source of GDP growth has partially shifted 
away from investment to
wards net exports and 
consumption. A mild slowdown of economic growth 
is expected in 2005 and 2006, with growth projected 
to reach about 8.6% this year and 8.4% next year.  
In the EFTA-countries, growth has also been fairly 
strong. In Norway, economic activity continued to 
expand briskly last year, led by a further surge in 
private consumption. Real 
GDP growth is estimated 
to have reached 3% in 2004 and is expected to 
accelerate to 3.8% in 2005, before falling back to 

2.9% in 2006. The recovery of the 
Swiss economy, 
which began in the second half of 2003, continued in 
2004, with GDP growth of
 1.7%. E
xpansionary 
monetary and fiscal policies have underpinned 
domestic demand growth. GDP growth is forecast to 
reach 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively, in 2005 and 2006. 
Thefour Candidate Countries are expected to benefit 
from strong domestic demand, driven by robust 
consumer confidence, declining inflation and strong, 
largely FDI-financed, investment growth. However, in 
spite of this, GDP growth is expected to slow down 
over the forecast period, to around 5% for the group 
as a whole. The decline in inflationary pressures is in 

general expected to continue, especially in the two 
high-inflation countries, Turk
ey and Romania. With 
the exception of Romania, 
the situation of public 
finances is expected to improve furt
her, with Bulgaria 
being close to balance, wh
ile the deficits in Croatia 
and Turkey are expected to diminish towards 3% of 
GDP. The demand-driven growth is accompanied by 
significant current account deficits, which Œ with the 
exception of Turkey Œ have so far largely been 
financed by FDI inflows. 
14Chapter 1 The world economy 
Despite persistently high h
ydrocarbon prices, growth 
in Russia 
decelerated at the end of last year, partly 
due to lower business confi
dence resulting from the 
slow pace of structural reforms and government 
intervention in th
e economy. As in previous years, 
Russia™s healthy macroeconomic performance was 

mainly driven by the external sector, although both 
domestic consumption and in
vestment continued their 
gradual recovery.
 In 2005-2006, gr
owth is likely to 
decelerate slightly further. The current account 
surplus should increase and stay above 10% in 2005, 
although the expected 
gradual fall in oil prices later 
this year and in 2006 should lead to a slight reduction 
of the surplus over time. 
Growth was even higher in 
other CIS countries. For instance, Ukraine™s GDP growth 
was above 12% and that of Belarus exceeded 11%. All these countries 
benefit from sustained external demand, as well as 
strong domestic demand fuelled by growth in 

disposable income. High 
commodity prices and large 
investment flows in natur
al resource sectors also 
boosted growth. Over the forecast period, overall 
GDP growth in the CIS countries, excluding Russia, 
is expected to slow down somewhat to 7.5% and 
7.0%, respectively, in 2005 
and 2006, (from 10% in 
2004).  The economies of 
Latin America
 also grew strongly 
last year. Growth is estimated to have reached 5.6% 
as a result of strong global demand, higher 

commodity prices and a return 
of foreign investors™ 
confidence. While external demand growth is 
expected to cool down some
what, sustained growth of 
domestic demand is set to lead to annual GDP growth 
rates for 2005 and 2006 in 
the range of
 3.6-3.9%. InBrazil
, real GDP expanded by
 a 5.2% in 2004, the 
fastest rate of growth the coun
try has seen since 1994. 
The significant upward revisi
on reflects a stronger-
than-expected pick-up in 
investment and exports. 
Domestic consumption also gathered momentum. As 

a result of the envisaged 
slowdown in external 
demand and ongoing monetary tightening, growth is 
forecast to decelerate to 3.7% this year and to remain 

at that level in 2006.

15Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 1. Growth entered a soft patch in the 
second half of 2004 Growth lost momentum in the second half of 2004 
After surprising on the upside during the first half of 
last year, with growth rates at or above potential, the 
pace of expansion of economic activity in the EU 

decelerated unexpectedly below potential in the 
second half of the year.  Quarter-o
n-quarter (q-o-q) 
growth in the EU slowed from 0.6% in the second 

quarter to 0.3% in third and 
fourth quarters 
of 2004.  
In the euro area, the slowdown was from 0.5% in the 
second quarter to 0.2% in 
the last two quarters of 
2004 (table 2.1). 
 This outturn 
was one tenth of 
percentage point lower than expected last autumn for 
the EU and two tenths of 
a percentage point lower for 
the euro area.  The slowdown was due to a significant 
drag from net exports.  A particularly strong inventory 
build-up prevented nega
tive growth in the third 
quarter, while a rebound in
 private domestic demand 
offset the negative contri
butions of inventories and 
net exports in the fourth quarter.

Table 2.1 
Quarter-on-
quarter GDP 
growth in the euro area        
% change on previous period
At the country level, 
the lower-than-anticipated outcome in the final 
quarter of last year was due, in 
particular, to unexpected declines in GDP in Germany 
(-0.2%) and Italy (-0.3%), 
while growth in France and 
Spain was robust (both 0.8%)
.  In assessing the 
outturn for this quarter, it 
is worth noting that the 
working-day adjustment had a negative impact on the 
data, which may be exaggerated.  In Germany, for 
example, when measured by the non-working-day-

adjusted GDP data, the economy grew by 0.4% q-o-q 
in the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The composition of growth in the euro area gradually 
changed from a predominantly external-driven growth 
in the first quarter of 2004 to
 a negative impulse from 
net trade in the last two quarters.  Encouragingly, the 
underlying dynamics of growth in the fourth quarter 
showed a pick-up in cons
umption expenditure growth 
and strong investment gr
owth.  Altho
ugh quarterly 
data show that growth entered
 a soft patch in the 
second part of last year, in terms of annual averages, 

growth reached 2% in the euro area and 2.4% in the 
EU.  Hence, both regions showed a considerable pick-
up compared to the previous year, when growth was 

0.6% and 1.0%, respectively. 
Fading net exports 
After contributing 0.4 and 0.
2 pp, respectively, in the 
first two quarters of 2004, net exports subtracted 0.7 
and 0.2 pp, respectively, from overall euro-area q-o-q 

GDP growth in the subsequent two quarters.  The 
sizable negative contribution of net exports in the 
third quarter was due to a deceleration of export 

growth, from 2.7% in the second quarter to 1.3%, 
coupled with a rise in impor
t growth, from 2.4% in 
the second quarter to 3.1%. 
 In the last quarter, the 
drag from net export was
 less strong, since both 
export and import growth declined
 markedly, to 0.5% 
and 1.0%, respectively.

To a large extent, the deceleration of export growth 
reflected the adverse impact on euro-area foreign 

demand from the softening of global growth around 
the middle of 2004.  In addition, the appreciation of 
the euro since 2002 appears to have been gradually 

and increasingly weighing on external 
19Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 competitiveness.  Indeed, in the last quarter of 2004, 
the euro real effective exchange rate (REER) moved 
to its highest level in the last six years, which implied 

a deterioration of euro-area co
st competitiveness.  
However, at the country level, the performance in 
terms of cost competitiveness has varied greatly, with 

Germany and the Netherlands seeing an improvement 
over the four quarters of last year, while Greece, 
Spain, Italy and Ireland recorded considerable losses.  
Private consumption expenditure still sluggish Following a robust 0.8%
 (q-o-q) growth rate in the 
first quarter of last year, which was the highest in 
three years, private consump
tion growth in the euro 
area slowed significantly in the middle of the year.  It 

stagnated in the second quarter and grew by a mere 
0.1% in the third quarter. 
 However, in the final 
quarter, private consumption staged a recovery, 

growing by 0.5%.  While the latest figures are 
encouraging, it still seems unclear whether private 
consumption is on the verge of re-establishing itself in 

a sustained manner as a motor of the domestic 
recovery.-0.4

The lacklustre performance of private consumption in 
this recovery primarily reflects 
stagnating consumer 
confidence, which 
in turn has been affected by such 
factors as the slow deceleration of headline inflation, 

persisting uncertainties related 
to developments and 
reforms in the labour 
market, as well as the budgetary 
situation in some Member States.  Consumer 

confidence in the euro area, as measured by the 
consumer sentiment indicator
 of the EU Harmonised 
surveys, was unchanged in December from the 
previous month, at a level
 still below its historical 
average.  Moreover, this level was broadly maintained 
throughout last year.  
As explained in
 section 5 of this 
chapter, headline HICP inflation was slow in 
decelerating last year, with strong rises in energy 
prices playing an important role.  Most probably, 

these developments have dented purchasing power, 
and have had a larger-than-expected effect on real 
disposable income.  The labour market, as discussed 

in section 4 of the pr
esent chapter, while not 
deteriorating, did not im
prove significantly either 
during the co
urse of 2004.

The observed behaviour of private consumption raises 
questions about the relatively h
igh level of liquidity 
and robust credit growth in the euro area economy.  
Monetary data for the beg
inning of this year 
confirmed the persistence of stronger monetary 
dynamics observed since mid-2004, with M3 growth 
increasing to 6.6% in the year
 to January 
2005.  This 
strengthening of monetary dynamics was driven, on 
the counterpart side, ma
inly by robust credit 
expansion to the private sector.  This can be seen as a 
response to the historically ve
ry low levels of interest 
rates in the euro area.  The annual rate of growth of 

Monetary and Financial Institutions (MFI) loans to 
the private sector rose to 7.3% in the year to January 
2005.  The main contribution to the expansion came 

from lending to househ
olds for house purchase, which 
grew at an annual rate of 10.1% in January.  Such 
developments would suggest that continued robust 

credit expansion to households is contributing to 
strong house price dynamics 
in several parts of the 
euro area.  Buoyant housing markets can be a source 
20Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
of wealth effects, which pr
ovide support to consumption at an opportune time in the cycle.  
However, set against a combi
nation of ample liquidity 
and strong credit growth, such developments could 
also generate concerns about 
whether th
e conditions might not be contribu
ting to unsustainable price 
increases in property markets in some parts of the 
euro area. 
At the same time, the savings rate of households in 
the euro area is estimated to have remained nearly 

unchanged last year at just above 15% of gross 
disposable income.  This 
development, however, 
conceals different behaviour across Member States.  

For instance, in German
y, the household savings rate 
continued to in
crease in 2004, while 
it maintained a 
declining path in France.

Over the forecast horizon, the 
savings rate in the euro 
is projected to decline only slightly, falling to 
somewhat below 15% in 2006.  A relevant concern 
here is the point at wh
ich the structural reforms 
implemented in several Member States will start to 
have the expected positive impact on the confidence 
of economic agents, thereby affecting consumption 

and savings behaviour in a growth-supportive manner. 
Investment provides encouragement 
After contracting at the begi
nning of last year (-0.1% 
q-o-q), investment gradually
 picked-up speed again.  
Gross fixed capital formation rose by 0.5% in the 
second quarter and by 0.6% in
 the last two quarters of 
the year.  This upward movemen
t, in line with some 
indicators typically correlated with investment, 
indicate that capital spending might be on a more 
sustained recovery pat
h, thus providing a brighter spot 
in an otherwise subd
ued domestic-demand picture. 
Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector was 
up by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of last year compared 

to the previous qu
arter and, for the first time in nearly 
three years, just above its historical average (over the 
period 1993-2004). New orde
rs for investment goods 
were also up in December, increasing markedly by 
8.8% compared to the previous month, by far the 
highest monthly growth rate in the year.  Moreover, as 

in the case of households, the annual growth of MFI 
loans to non-financial corporations increased further 
in January 2005, to 5.7%
, thereby confirming the upward trend observed since early last year.

Investment in the euro area
With interest rates remaining at historically low 
levels, and productivity 
and corporate balance sheets 
having improved, the conditions seem to be in place 
for continued strength in investment over the forecast 
horizon.  However, the level of confidence and 
sluggish domestic demand remain potential 

constraining factors.  During
 2004, business sentiment 
indicators provided no clear
 indications of improving 
confidence, although towards the end of the year 

some general upward movements were observed.  It 
seems also plausible that the lack of sustained 
improvements on the consum
ption side led to a 
cautious approach by firms with regard to capital 
spending and employment deci
sions, thus reinforcing 
the mechanics of the curre
nt period of subdued 
economic activity.

Inventories also picked-up 
sharply in the third quarter 
of 2004, surging to 0.8% of GDP, after 0.1% in the 

previous quarter.  The rise in
 inventories contributed 
0.7 pp to GDP growth, offsetting the drag from net 
exports in the same quart
er.  Altho
ugh declining slightly, inventory accumulation remained at a high 
level in the last quarter of 
2004.  Conse
quently, the contribution to GDP growth turned negative in that 

quarter.  Since the change in inventories is treated as a 
ﬁresidualﬂ item in the nation
al accounts, it is difficult 
to explain the sharp increase in the second half of 
2004.  On the basis of some evidence at Member State 
level on the breakdown of imports by type of goods, 

the rise may partly mask 
imported capital goods still 
recorded as inventories.  On the other hand, it may 
also reflect a mini inventory cycle, with firms 

accumulating unsold goods as a consequence of the 
unanticipated slowdown in demand.  
Domestic demand remained soft 
Reflecting the developments described above, q-o-q 
growth in domestic demand 
(excluding inventories), 
in the euro area rose only m
odestly, from 0.2% in the 
second quarter to 0.3% in th
e third quarter and 0.4% 
in the fourth quarter.  Th
e pick-up in investment 
explained the acceleration in the third quarter, while 
in the fourth quarter the encouraging recovery in 
consumption was also a cont
ributory factor.  Given 
the unexpected slowdown in the second half of last 
year, a key issue at the current juncture is its likely 
impact on the future trajectory of the economy, and 
particularly on the point 
at which the recovery will 
regain momentum in 2005.  This is discussed below 
in section 3 of 
the present chapter. Growth dispersion across Member States 
Divergence in GDP growth within the euro area 
widened somewhat in the 
course of last year.  This 
was particularly noticeable between the four largest 
Member States.  In the first quar
ter of 2004, there was 
only a 0.3 pp difference between in the growth rates 

of these four countries.  By 
the last quarter of 2004, 
the difference had surged to over a full percentage 
point, with Spain and France 
registering a robust 0.8% 
growth and Italy contracting
 by 0.3%. An important 
element influencing 
the widening intra-area growth 
dispersion among the four 
largest economies is the behaviour of private consumption.  In France and 
Spain, consumption has been growing at robust pace, 
while consumer expenditur
e has been rather weak in 
Italy and Germany.

22Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
Box 2.1:
  Some specificities behind the forecasts  
Exchange rates 
For currencies in ERM II, constant nominal exchange rates 
are assumed. This means that the central rate of these 
currencies against the euro will remain constant over the 
forecast period. The currencies are: the DKK (Danish 
kroner), the EEK (Estonian kroon), the LTL (Lithuanian 
litas) and SIT (Slovenian tolar). For the CYP (Cyprus 
pound), and the HUF (Hungarian forint) constant nominal 
exchange rates vis-à-vis the euro are also assumed.  Constant 
real exchange rates (that is nominal rates adjusted for 
changes in GDP deflators) are assumed for the PLN (Polish 
zloty), the CZK (Czech koruna), the SKK (Slovakian 
koruna), the SEK (Swedish krona) and the GBP (sterling). 
Constant real exchange rates are also assumed for non-EU 
currencies.For currencies pegged to a basket (the Latvian lat and the 
Maltese lira), the future rate is deduced from the evolution of 
the currencies constituting the basket. 
The reference period used for the exchange rate constancy 
assumption is the first quarter of 2005, calculated on the 
basis of historical values up to 10 March 2005 and the 
average of the two-week period from 24 February to 10 
March 2005 for the remainder of the period. The average 
USD/EUR rate for the first quarter of 2005 was 1.31 and the 
JPY/EUR rate 136.9.  This leads to implied average 
USD/EUR rates of 1.31 in 2005 and 1.32 in 2006, and 
average JPY/EUR rates of 135.4 and 132.3 in 2005 and 2006 
respectively.  
Interest rates 
Short-term interest rates are set in order to reflect the price 
stability objective of monetary policy.  Long-term interest 
rate assumptions are based on developments in short-term 
rates and an assessment of economic conditions.  Attention is 
paid to international financial linkages, market expectations 
and budgetary developments. 
Commodity prices 
Commodity prices are forecas
t taking into account market 
conditions. In the case of oil prices special attention is paid 
to futures prices. Prices for Brent oil are, accordingly, 
projected to be 50.9 USD/bl in 2005 and 48.0 USD/bl in 
2006.Prices of primary commodities, excluding fuels, are assumed 
to increase by 1.3% in 2005 and to decline by approximately 
1% in 2006.  In 2005, the prices of all groups, except for 
agricultural products, are expect
ed to increase compared to 
2004.Budgetary data Data for 2004 are based on government debt and deficit data 
transmitted by Member States to the European Commission 
in March 2005. In publishing these data, Eurostat has 
indicated that, for certain Member States (namely Greece 
and Italy), it "has to undertake further examination of deficit 
and debt data before the figures can be validated", while 
there are ﬁongoing discussionsﬂ with the national statistical 
authorities of Latvia, Lithuania and Portugal, ﬁwhich may 
lead to a subsequent revision of the dataﬂ (see Eurostat news 
release N° 39 of 18 March 2005). For 2005, budgets adopted 
or presented to parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 2006, the 
"no-policy change" assumption used in the forecasts implies 
the extrapolation of revenue and expenditure trends and the 
inclusion of measures that are known in sufficient detail at 
the time of the completion of the forecast. 
The general government balances reported by Member States 
to the European Commission may be different from those 
published in the national accounts, because of an amendment 
to ESA95. According to Regulation (EC) N° 2558/2001 on 
the reclassification of settlements under swaps agreements 
and forward rate agreements, interest flows under swaps have been reclassified from ﬁincome propertyﬂ to ﬁfinancial 
accountﬂ. However, the Regulation states the need for 
specific treatment of these flows for data transmitted under 
the excessive deficit procedure (EDP), allowing for interest 
expenditure to include swaps, contrary to ESA95 new rules. 
In the forecasts, it is the EDP definition of the general 
government balance that is presented.  
Calendar effects on GDP
 growth and output gaps 
Last year was a leap year. Compared to the average number 
of working days, there were 2.8 additional working days in 
2004. This translates to an estimated impact of 0.24 pp on 
the GDP growth rate for the euro area in 2004. On the other 
hand, for 2005, the effect is estimated at a negative 0.13 pp. 
Annual GDP figures are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, while quarterly national accounts figures of 
most countries are. The calculation of potential GDP, from 
which the output gap is derived, does not involve any 
adjustment for the number of working days in the leap year, 
because this is considered to be temporary, which should not 
affect the cyclically-adjusted balances. 
232. Financial conditions for firms and 
households still growth-supportive This section reports on balance sheets and financing 
flows in the corporate and household sectors, with a 
view to their potential implications for investment and 

consumption spending.  
Non-financial corporations   
The cost of market financing and bank lending has 
fallen further in recent months. Euro area share prices 
have risen by about 9% compared to the autumn 

forecasts (late-September), in line with the main 
world equity indexes. Eu
ro area short-term and long-
term bank lending rates remain low in absolute levels 

and in real terms, and euro area banks have reported 
an easing of credit standards in the last two quarters of 
2004 (cf. January 2005 ECB Bank Lending Survey). 

Spreads between euro
-denominated corporate bonds and comparable government bonds have narrowed 
further and are historically low.

The most recent data confirm that, so far, companies 
have used the availability of
 cheap funding
 mainly to 
restructure their balance sheets and reduce financing 
costs. The ratio of debt to GDP in the euro area non-
financial corporate sector stabilised last year after 
declining somewhat fro
m the peak in the second half 
of 2003. The average matu
rity of corpo
rate liabilities 
has been lengthened, and the debt/equity ratio has 

declined substantially fro
m the high in early-2003 
(though only to 
the levels of 
mid-2002). Balance 
sheets have also been strengthened by the revaluation 

of companies™ large stock of share holdings, as well as 
by the accumulation of cash balances. As a result of 
such restructuring, the interest burden on bank loans 
to companies has decreased, from •145bn in January 
2003 to •131bn in September 2004, according to ECB 
estimates.

A corollary of these developmen
ts is that, in spite of 
the low cost of external 
funding in 2004, overall 
financing flows to non-fi
nancial corporations have 
continued to grow at a moderate pace. However, there 
was a noteworthy, albeit slight, acceleration in the 
recourse of companies to ex
ternal financing in the 
second half of 2004. The acceleration was due mainly 
to stronger loan growth, whereas issuance of debt 
securities and shares remai
ned subdued.  The expansion in the cash 
balances of non-financial 
corporations, in a context of stronger profitability  and 
low cost of funds, woul
d suggest that credit 
constraints are not a factor 
holding back investment in 
the euro area. This is supported
 by the reportedly still 
negative net loan demand by ent
erprises at the end of 
last year. The major factors contributing to the decline 

in net loan demand were weak fixed investment, 
increased use of non-
bank sources of external 
financing (such as corporate bonds or trade credit) and 

the enhanced availability of intern
al finance. 
Interestingly, however, the January 2005 ECB Bank 
Lending Survey showed a 
pick up in demand for 
loans by SMEs.  
All in all, given the favourab
le financing conditions, 
improved profitability and corporate restructuring, the 
continuing sluggishness of in
vestment growth is more 
likely to be related to unc
ertainties over the demand 
outlook, both domestic (a hesitant recovery and an

unclear outlook for structural reforms in some 
Member States) and external factors (appreciation of 
the euro and high commodity prices).

In the UK, where capital investment has continued to 
grow at a robust rate in 2
004, capital gearing levels (debt as a proportion of assets) remain high but there 

is little evidence that companies, on the aggregate, are 
seeking further reductio
n in gearings.   
Households  
In the euro area, as men
tioned in section 1 of this 
chapter, household borrowing continued to accelerate 

in the final part of 2004, 
in an environment of low 
interest rates and rising ho
use prices. The growth of 
loans for house purchase, in particular, reached a 10% 

annual rate at the end of the year. There was also a 
marked pick up in the growth rate of consumer credit 
(from 2.4% at the end of 
2003 to above 6% at the end 
of 2004), facilitated by a progressive easing of credit 

standards by euro-area banks.   
Euro-area household debt now exceeds 55% of GDP. 
However, low interest rates have 
kept interest gearing 
at a low level: according to ECB estimates, the ratio 

of interest payments to di
sposable income fell 
between 2000 and 2003, in sp
ite of the rise in the 
stock of debt.

In most recently-acceded Member States, private 
sector debt continued to expand rapidly. This trend is 
likely to continue in the fu
ture, as financial structures 
converge towards the rest of 
the EU. Most household 
debt is used for house purchase. In spite of the 
impressive growth rates, hous
ehold debt levels in 
recently-acceded Member States are typically 

between 5-10% of GDP, well below the rest of the EU 
(Malta, where household debt is 35% of GDP, is the 
exception).A prolonged period of fast credit growth and rising 
house prices is a potential concern as it may lead to
 the build up of fina
ncial imbalances. However, the 
impact of such a configuration on private 
consumption is unclear. Diff
erent consumer groups 
are affected in opposite ways by higher house prices. 
For instance, home owners gain but future buyers and 
tenants (if the higher house prices feed to rents) lose 

out. In general, in mo
st euro-area countries, the 
structures of housing and mortgage markets are 
thought to be less conduci
ve to strong wealth effects 
than in the UK or the US. 
Even in the latter countries, 
survey-based studies of th
e utilisation of withdrawn 
housing equity suggest that
 only a minor part has been 
used for consumption, with the rest being used for 
financial investment 
or house improvement. 
Overall, the available evid
ence suggests only limited short-term risks to consumption growth and banking 

sector stability from moderate movements in house 
price inflation or interest rates. However, the higher 
debt accumulated by households in some Member 

States has increased their vuln
erability to abrupt 
adverse changes in these variables.

263. A return of confidence is key to the 
growth outlook A return to potential growth during the course of 
this year Following the unexpected deceleration experienced in 
the second half of last 
year mainly as a result of the 
oil price hike and the strength of the euro, the 
carryover into this year is lower. Nonetheless, growth 
is projected to return to
 potential during the course of 
this year - reaching 1.6% in the euro area and 2% in 
the EU - before accelerating to 2.1% and 2.3%, 
respectively, in 2006. Insofa
r as the quarterly profile 
for euro-area
1 growth is concerned, after an 
acceleration to 0.5% q-o-q in the first quarter, this 
pace is projected to prevail for the remaining quarters 

of this year and to increase to 0.6% q-o-q in the first 
half of 2006. 
In an extension of the pattern that emerged towards 
the end of last year, growth over the forecast horizon 

is driven by an acceleration of domestic demand, 
while the net trade contribu
tion to growth is projected 
to remain close to zero in both the euro area and in the 

EU. The pace of investment expenditure, in particular, 
is expected to pick up in view of the historically low 
real interest rates, the improvement in corporate 
balance sheets and the widening of profit margins. 
This acceleration of investment is to be accompanied 

by a more gradual recovery 
of private consumption.

At the turn of the year, several survey indicators 
provided more encouraging signals regarding the 
economic outlook. However, recent data releases have

been somewhat less encouraging where business 
confidence is concerned, probably as a result of 
higher oil prices and the strong euro. Consumer 

confidence, which had been on a gradual rising path 
since the turnaround in 2003
, appears to have 
stabilised. Country-specific i
ndicators suggest that 
there are considerable differences across Member 
States in the level of consumer confidence.  
The completion of structural reforms in some Member 
States has laid the foundation for the restoration of 

confidence among entrepreneurs and consumers. The 
performance of the labour market is also expected to 
play an important role in
 underpinning consumer 
confidence. Real compensation per head is projected 
to grow marginally in the 
euro area this year and to 
pick up pace next year. Stronger increases are forecast 

for the EU as a whole. Similarly, it is envisaged that 
employment growth will be a supportive factor, 
reaching 0.7% this year and 0.9% next year in the 

euro area. Finally, housing market wealth is also 
expected to boost private consumption in some 
Member States.

Growth rates of Member States to converge 
While the divergence between Member States™ growth 
rates increased during 2004, a rapid convergence of 
GDP growth dynamics is 
projected from the 
beginning of this year on. The convergence of overall 
GDP growth will continue to hide differences in 
growth composition across Member States. 
RisksThe risks to the outlook for the EU economy are tilted 
to the downside over the forecast horizon. 
On the external side, global imbalances continue to 
pose a downside risk. In the forecast, the US current 
account balance deficit is set to widen to 5.9% of 

GDP in 2005 Œ before stabilising at 5.8% of GDP in 
2006. There is a risk that the unwinding of such 
imbalances could lead to 
disorderly movements in 
exchange rates, which w
ould also impact on 
confidence and real activity, including world trade. In 
this respect, an associated global downside risk is the 

potential for misallocation of cap
ital as a result of the 
low risk premia on emerging market bonds and other 
risky assets.  
A further risk is linked to the development of

28Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
commodity prices, specifically oil prices. Higher-
than-expected oil prices could curb the vigour of EU 
export markets. However, 
on the positive side, a 
strong euro can shelter th
e euro area partially from the 
increases in oil prices. Moreover, higher oil prices 
increase the wealth of o
il-exporting countries that 
typically have a close tr
ading relationship with the 
EU.For private consumpti
on, lower-than-expected 
inflation, for example as a result of the favourable 

base effects, represents an upside risk. Such a 
development would boost r
eal disposable income of 
households. On the other hand, consumption could be 

held down by a slower-than-expected increase in 
disposable income, in th
e event of disappointing 
labour market developments. Moreover, consumer 

confidence may not pick up quickly, as it can take a 
while for structural reforms 
to have a positive effect 
on consumption. A final downside risk to 

consumption is overheatin
g in specific housing 
markets, which carries a potential for adverse 
corrections in consumer sentiment and spending. 
Gross fixed capital formati
on appears to be the only 
area of economic activity for wh
ich risks are tilted to 
the upside. As explained in the Section 2, the 

development of corporate investment has been 
subdued, when judged by the favourable financing 
conditions, improved profitability and the progress 
made in corporate restructuring. A more dynamic 
profile for investment (than foreseen in the central 

scenario), as a result of the release of pent-up demand, 
cannot be excluded. More
over, the past weakness of 
investment should be supportive of replacement 

investment due to deterioratio
n of the capital stock.  
The EU has apparently been slow in reaping the 
productivity-enhanc
ing benefits of 
information and 
communication technology (ICT) in a range of ICT-

using industries, specifically wh
en compared to the 
US. While assessments in this field are seriously 
hampered by measurement issues, a sudden jump in 

productivity, as a result of past implementation of 
ICT, could materialise. Such an increase in 
productivity, which could 
result from progress on 
reform of product and labour markets, would boost 
investment in the EU.  
The main downside risk for gross fixed capital 
formation is a disappointing development of overall 

demand. Another downside risk could be an 
unfavourable development in financing conditions 
involving rising risk premia and real interest rates. 
Finally, a further deteriorati
on in competitiveness in 
some Member States, which would dampen their 
growth performance, is also
 a downside risk for the 
aggregate regional growth performance. 
294. Modest employment growth 
A more resilient labour market in the downturn 
The euro-area labour mark
et proved quite resilient 
during the economic slowdown in 2001-2003. 
Although labour market 
conditions worsened in 
general, the rise in the annual unemployment rate by 
almost one percentage point (from 7.8% to 8.7% of 
the labour force) was more li
mited than witnessed in 
earlier slowdowns (e.g. +3 percentag
e points in the 
early 1990s). This is par
tly explained by more 
pronounced labour hoarding in several Member 

States. Structural reforms appear to have improved the 
functioning of the labo
ur market, as manifested by, 
for example, lower long-t
erm unemployment rates, 
shorter average duration of unemployment spells and 
improved matching. 
Limited improvement in the upturn so far 
As a result of labour hoarding, employment creation 
has been relatively limited in the economic upturn 

since the middle of 2003, as many enterprises had a 
certain ‚reserve™ of employees already at their 
disposal. Employment (measured in terms of job 
holders) increased by 0.2% in the third quarter of 
2004, extending the period of a broadly flat (or low) 

employment growth to two 
and a half years. At the 
sectoral level, net job creation continued to be limited 
to the services sector, whereas employment in the 

agriculture and industry sectors declined.

(Quarterly percentage change, seasonally adjusted)
Employment expectations in the European 
Commission™s business and consumer survey 
deteriorated somewhat in the euro area towards the 
end of 2004 and in the beginning of 2005 in both the 

manufacturing and the services sectors. The PMI 
indicator (February 2005) revealed more or less 
unchanged employment expe
ctations in the services 
sector, and slightly deteriorating expectations in 
manufacturing industry.  
Unemployment peaked at around 9% 
Given the moderate employment creation in 2003-04, 
the standardised unempl
oyment rate stabilised at 
around 9% in the euro area last year. The latest 

available figure (from January 2005) was 8.8%. 
Differences continue to be sizeable across Member 
States with the annual unemployment rate last year 

ranging from around 4½% in
 Ireland, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands and Austria to around 9½% or more 
in Germany, Greece, Spain and France. 
A similar pattern may be observed for the EU as a 
whole. Despite modest employment growth, which is 
estimated to have been 0.5% in 2004, the 
unemployment rate increased marginally to 9% of the 

labour force. Differences across Member States are 
even more pronounced when account is taken of some 
of the recently-acceded Member States. For example, 

unemployment rates are estimated 
to have been 18-
19% of the labour force in Poland and Slovakia in 
2004.   
A modest pick-up in employment 
Employment growth is expected to continue its 
gradual pick-up to 0.7% in 2005 and 0.9% in 2006 in 
the euro area, despite 
somewhat lower GDP growth 
(compared both to the estim
ated growth recorded in 
2004 and to the autumn forecast for 2005). Several 
factors are important in e
xplaining why the job-
content of growth is increasing. 
Firstly, the general trend of rising importance of the 
services sector is expected to continue (at the expense 
of the agriculture sector an
d manufacturing industry). 
With lower labour productivity in the services sector 
on average, GDP growth tends to become more labour 
intense. However, it must 
be noted that sectoral 
restructuring is partly a st
atistical phenomenon, given 
that certain services functions are outsourced from 
enterprises in (manufacturing) industry.  
Secondly, employment growt
h is higher in some of 
the euro-area Member States, no
tably Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg, particul
arly in the services sector 
(as well as in the construction sector in the cases of 
Spain and Ireland).   
Thirdly, job creation also stems from measures taken 
to stimulate employment in some Member States, 

such as the so-called mini-jobs in Germany. The latter 
measures tend to increase the number of new part-
30Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
time jobs in particular. The full-time equivalent 
employment growth is more limited.  
In the EU as a whole, empl
oyment growth is foreseen 
to pick-up to 0.7% in 2005 and 0.8% in 2006. The 

outlook is unchanged compared to the autumn 
forecast, although GDP growth has been revised 
downwards somewhat for this year suggesting a 

similar, more job-rich, growth pattern. 
A limited impact on unemployment 
Although employment w
ill increase by 1 million 
persons this year, unemployme
nt is set to grow by 
0.1 million in the euro area. The unemployment rate is 

thus expected to remain at or below 9% this year in 
both the euro area and the EU25. This is explained in 
part by the traditional gr
owth of the labour force as 
the labour market situation 
improves (and latent job-
seekers return to the regular labour market to actively 
seek employment). Howeve
r, it is also the result of 
statistical revisions in Greece and the merging of the 
social benefit and the unemployment schemes in 
Germany, both of which have inflated the number of 
registered unemployed.

forecast
Employment is anticipated to
 grow in 2006 by 
1.3 million persons in the euro area and by 1.7 million 
in the EU25, facilitating a 
decline in un
employment. 
The unemployment rate is exp
ected to fall to 8.5% in 
2006 in the euro area and 8.7% in the EU25. This 
corresponds to a reduction in number of unemployed 
persons by 0.4 million and 0.5 million, respectively.  
Falling labour productivity growth 
Labour productivity growth is e
xpected to fall to 0.9% in the euro area in 2005 (down from 1.4% in 2004), as 
a consequence of the more job-rich growth. 

Productivity growth is particul
arly low (at 0.1%) in 
Germany, partly reflecting the impact of the mini-
jobs. A markedly better p
erformance is anticipated for 
Ireland and Finland, as well as 
in many of the 
recently-acceded Member States. In the EU as a 
whole, labour productivity gr
owth is still likely to be 
limited to 1.3% this year.  
A pick-up in labour productivity growth is expected in 
2006 to 1.2% in the euro ar
ea and 1.5% in the EU25. 
Wage growth does not always seem to reflect the 
degree of labour market tightness 
Wages responded only modestly 
to the slowdown in 
2001-2003, partly reflecting the greater resilience 
shown in the euro-area labour market. Annual wage 
growth, measured by co
mpensation of employees per 
head, was broadly unchanged compared to 2000 (at 
2½-2¾%), despite the fall 
in GDP growth.  
It was not until 2004 that wage growth eased more 
markedly (it is estimated to 
have been 2.1%), albeit 
with sizeable differences across Member States. For 
instance, euro-area wage growth ranged from around 

0% in Germany to around 6% in Greece and Ireland 
in 2004.  In general, wage growth seems to reflect local labour 
market conditions relatively well in most Member 

States, with higher wage growth observed in Greece, 
Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg, where employment 
growth has been above the euro-area average. 

Similarly, lower wage growth was recorded especially 
in Germany and, more recently, the Netherlands, 
where economic activity and employment were 

markedly weaker. However, in the cases of France, 
Portugal, and Finland, aver
age wage increases in 2004 were higher than might be expected from the weak 

demand for labour. This 
may be explained partly by 
the continued imp
act of multi-annual wage 
agreements (Portugal and Finland) or the 
harmonisation of minimum wages in France. 
Persistent and relatively high 
wage increases in some 
Member States, combined with low labour 

productivity growth, have started to take their toll on 
competitiveness. Nominal unit labour cost rose by 
31Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 more than 3% in 2004 in Greece, Spain and Ireland 
and around 2% in Italy and Portugal, with an adverse 
effect on these countries™ export performance. On the 

other hand, the responsive
ness of wage formation in 
Germany and the Netherlands, as reflected in falling 
unit labour costs, has contributed to an improved 

export performance and rising market shares.  
The forecast implies a small increase in euro-area 
wage growth to 2.2% in 2005 and 2.4% in 2006, 
while the sizeable differences across Member States 

are maintained. 
In view of a higher pace of wage growth in several of 
the recently-acceded Member States, notably the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, 

Slovenia and Slovakia, average wage growth in the 
EU as a whole is estimated 
at 2.8% in 2004. Labour 
productivity growth is generally also higher than in 

the euro area, limiting the negative impact on nominal 
unit labour cost (besides for Latvia and Hungary). 
This also reflects the catching-up process in several of 

these countries. Wage growth 
is anticipated to remain 
at 2.8% in 2005 before accelerating modestly to 3.1% 
in 2006 in the EU25. 
The Lisbon targets The overall employment rate (defined as the share of 
employed persons aged 15-64 in the total population 
of the same age group) stood
 at 63% in 2003. Even 
with the more job-rich growth described in this 
forecast, the employment rate is likely to increase 

only modestly to 63.6% in 2006, thereby missing the 
intermediate employment rate target of 67% to be 
achieved by the end of 2005, as agreed by the 

European Councils in Lisbon and Stockholm. 
Differences across Member States remain wide, with 
the employment rate expected to surpass the threshold 

level in Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom, while being 
markedly lower (less than 55%) in several other 
Member States, notably Greece, Italy, Malta and 
Poland. Given the current 
GDP growth and labour 
market performance, a rise in the average employment 

rate to 70% by the end of 2010 seems increasingly 
challenging. 
Somewhat better progress has been made as regards 
the employment rate for 
women, which stood at 
55.1% in 2003, even if it remains below the 
intermediate target of 57% or
 the 60% target to be 
achieved by 2010.  
In contrast, the employment 
rate for older workers, 
i.e. those aged 55-64, was 
at 40.2% in 2003, still very 
far from the target of 50% by 2010.

325. Inflation below 2% in 2005 and 2006 
Specific factors put upward pressure on inflation 
In 2004, the annual rate of headline inflation (HICP) 
was 2.1% (year-on-year) in the euro area, just above 
the ECB target ceiling of 2%. HICP inflation 

averaged 2.1% also in the EU as a whole. Specific 
factors rather than underlying inflationary trends put 
upward pressure on headline inflation during the year. 

One main factor was the sharp increase in a wide 
range of indirect taxes and administrated prices, 
which was particularly apparent in tobacco and 

health-care prices.  Another dominant factor was the 
rise in oil prices, which 
translated into higher prices 
for energy and related fuel products. 
Demand-sensitive inflation was steady  
Overall, tobacco, health care and energy added about 
1 pp to euro-area head
line inflation in 2004. If these 
components, representing about 15% of the HICP 
basket, are excluded, the 
resulting demand-sensitive 
measure of core inflation would have been just 1.1% 
in 2004. By contrast, th
e core-inflation measure, 
which excludes the two volatile components of energy 
and unprocessed food from the HICP basket, averaged 
2.1% in 2004 (2% in the EU).

Underlying inflation pressures were limited 
Despite rising input prices during most of 2004, 
particularly for industrial intermediate goods, 
underlying inflation pre
ssures were limited by the 
stronger euro and strong competitive pressures, amid 

a relatively mild recovery in domestic demand in 
some large EU countries. 
In addition, wage 
moderation continued in the euro area and ﬁsecond-
roundﬂ inflationary effects 
stemming from high oil 
prices were limited. 
On the cost side, producer price inflation peaked at 
4% in the year to Octob
er 2004, reflecting the feed-
through from higher oil prices, but subsequently eased 
in the following two months
 to average 2.3% over the 
year. As expected, producer prices excluding energy 
were more subdued, rising by only 1.9%. This 
occurred despite the pressure from earlier increases in 

prices of raw materials, which translated into a 3.5% 
rate of inflation for intermediate producer prices. 
Given the weakness of private domestic demand, the 

annual rate of inflation was 
much lower in the 
consumer and capital goods industries, averaging 
1.3% and 0.7%, respectively, in 2004. The latest 

(January) data showed some acceleration in producer 
price inflation due to 
higher energy prices. 
The cost of labour has been acting as a moderating 
factor for euro-area inflation. Growth in unit labour 

cost was 0.1% in the third 
quarter of 2004 (latest 
available data), compared to 2.3% one year earlier. 
While these developme
nts mainly reflect the cyclical pick-up of labour productivity, which accelerated 
from 0.2% to 1.4% over the same period of time, 

wage growth also slowed down from 2.5% to 1.5% in 
this period. Although 
the sharp decline in 
compensation per head in th
e third quarter of 2004 is 
distorted by the timing 
of payments in the public 
sector in Italy, correcting for this factor does not alter 
the assessment of moderate wage developments. 
More moderate impact on inflation from fiscal 
measures but energy remains a concern 
The contribution of indirect 
taxes and administrated 
prices to HICP inflation is exp
ected to return to more 
normal levels after the sub
stantial increases recorded 
in 2004. Tobacco-price inflation reached a record high 
of more than 12% in 2004 in the euro area (10% in the 
EU), as several EU Member States faced with 

deteriorating fiscal balances 
took advantage of this 
means of raising revenues. Health-care inflation 
jumped to 7.9% in the euro area (6.7% in the EU), 
with the largest contribu
tion stemming from health-
care reform in Germany, under which the costs are 

initially paid by househol
ds and later reimbursed by 
the government.  
33Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 Tobacco and health-care inflation added 0.6 pp to 
headline inflation in 2004 in the euro area, compared 
to an average contribution of less than 0.2 pp between 

1999 and 2003. If other government-regulated 
services, e.g. education, social protection and postal 
services, were included in 
the basket, this would 
further increase the impact of indirect taxes and 
administrated prices on 
headline inflation. While 
additional increases cannot be ru
led out in view of the 
current state of government balances, fiscal measures 
are expected to have a lower impact on inflation 
compared to last year. 
In addition, since the release of the autumn forecast, 
the euro exchange rate has been stronger than 
assumed in that forecast. This is likely to translate into 
stronger disinflationary pressures in the first few 

months of 2005 than initially
 envisaged. On the other 
hand, despite the strength of the euro against the 
dollar, which partly dilutes th
e impact of high crude 
oil prices in euro terms, o
il prices increased by 20% in 2004 and by a further 16% in the first quarter of 2005. 
As a result, energy inf
lation rose to 4.5% in 2004 
(contributing 0.4 pp to
 headline inflation) and 
accelerated to around 7% in the first quarter of this 

year. While oil price developments remain uncertain, 
it would appear that there 
is potential for the energy 
contribution to HICP inflation to increase compared 

to 2004. -10

Both domestic and external price pressures are 
expected to remain relatively low 
The level of eu
ro-area output is projected to remain 
below potential in both 2005 and 2006. The resulting 

negative output gap Œ estimated at 1.2% in the euro 
area in both 2005 and 2006 (1% in the EU in 2005 
and 0.9% in 2006) - should help to keep underlying 

inflation under control. At the same time, the 
unemployment rate is projected to remain unchanged 
at 8.8% this year in the euro area (9% in the EU) and 

to improve only moderately in 2006. Employment is 
set to accelerate from about 0.5% growth in 2004 in 
both regions to around 0.8% over the forecast horizon. 

This is unlikely to be 
a significant source of pressure 
on wage costs and inflation, given evidence of a 
lengthening of the working week in exchange for job 

security in some parts of the euro area.  
Wages play a key role in 
driving inflationary trends as 
they represent by far the mo
st important part of firms™ 
costs. Moderate wage growth, which has been 

observed for some time now
, is expected to continue 
over the forecast horizon. 
Growth of compensation of 
employee per head has been revi
sed downwards in 
both the euro area and the EU compared to the 
autumn forecast and is now 
projected at 2.2% in 2005 
in the euro area (2.8% in th
e EU) and 2.4% in 2006 
(3.1% in the EU). In the context of a maturing 
economic recovery and cyclical developments in 

labour productivity, un
it labour costs are set to accelerate from 0.7% in the euro area in 2004 (0.9% 
in the EU) to about 1.2% over the forecast horizon 

(1.5% in the EU). However, provided wage growth 
remains moderate, unit labour 
costs are likely to have 
a dampening effect on inflation trends.  
Finally, inflation is expected 
to benefit from relatively 
low import prices during the forecast period, mainly 
as a result of the lagged effects of the appreciation of 
the euro and generally lower pressure on non-oil 

commodity prices stemming from the envisaged 
deceleration in world GDP growth. From an annual 
growth rate of almost 15% in 2004, non-oil 
commodity prices are set to increase by just 1.3% this 
year and to contract slightly in 
2006. Oil prices, on the 
34Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
other hand, are expected to be almost 35% higher in 
2005 compared to last year and to decelerate only 
moderately (-6%) in 2006. All 
in all, the external 
price pressure on HICP inflation is forecast to remain 
broadly unchanged in 2005 compared to last year, 
both in the euro area and the EU, before easing in 

2006. The annual growth rate in import prices for 
goods was 1.5% in 2004 in the euro area and is 
projected at 1.7% in 2005 and 0.7% in 2006 (1.5% 

and 0.8% in EU25 resp
ectively), while the annual rate of change in the GDP deflator is forecast at 1.7% in 
both 2005 and 2006. The corr
esponding figure for the 
EU is 1.9% in both years.

Overall, HICP inflation is projected to decline from 
the current levels to around 1.5% by the end of the 
forecast horizon in both the euro area and the EU. In 

annual average terms, HICP inflation is estimated at 
1.9% in 2005 for both regions. The forecast for 2006 
is 1.5% for the euro area and 1.7% in the EU. The 
projected low inflation rate in 2006 is due in part to 
the shift of some health-care components of the HICP 
basket from the private sector to the public sector in 

the Netherlands. This translates into an estimated 
deflation rate of 3% (and a 
negative contribution of 
about -0.2 pp to
 euro-area inflation). Excluding this 
effect, the projections for inflation are broadly in line 
with inflation expectations 
from most surveys. 
Consensus Economics and
 Euro-zone Barometer 
expect inflation in the euro area to be 1.8% in 2005 
and 1.7% in 2006. 
Inflation expectations reported by 
the ECB™s Survey of Professional Forecasters in 

February 2005 are slightly higher, at 1.9% this year 
and 1.8% in 2006.  At the Member State level, HICP inflation in 2005 
and 2006 is forecast to remain low in Germany at 

around 1.2%, held down
 by very subdued wage 
pressures and low import co
sts. In France, inflation is 
expected to fall below 2%
 this year and to average 
1.8% in 2006, helped 
by the strong euro and 
competitive pressures on uni
t labour costs. Inflation in 
Italy is projected to remain above the euro-area 
average this year, although falling below 2% in 2006. 
Services inflation and unit 
labour costs remain 
relatively high compared to the rest of the euro area 
with potential implications for 
the competitiveness of 
Italian exports. In Spain, a relatively high projected 

inflation rate Œ at 2.9% this 
year and 2.7% in 2006 Œ 
due to strong growth in unit labour costs, should also 
make exports less competitive
 in world markets. By 
contrast, inflation in the Netherlands is forecast at 
1.3% in 2005 and -3% in 2006, benefiting from a 
sharp contraction in unit labour costs and the 

statistical effect mentioned above.

356. Broadly unchanged budgetary situation 
No major changes in the aggregate budget deficit 
Against the background of a slightly widening 
negative output gap, the general government deficit in 
the euro area is expected to post a slight improvement 

of 0.1 percentage point to 2.6% of GDP in 2005. In 
cyclically-adjusted terms, an improvement of around 
¼ percentage point is forecast, 
leading to a deficit of 
2.1% of GDP. A marginal deterioration is foreseen to 
occur in 2006 in both nominal
 and cyclically-adjusted 
terms. In the EU25, th
e deficit is set to remain 
unchanged in 2005 and to improve subsequently by 
0.1 percentage point of GDP, reaching 2.5% of GDP 
in 2006. The envisaged changes in the deficits are 

mirrored by those in government gross savings. 
It should be recalled that these figures, and those that 
follow, are based on a ﬁno-policy changeﬂ 
assumption. Specifically, they incorporate the 

measures announced with the budgets for 2005 and 
subsequently adopted measures up to the cut-off date 
for the forecasts, but do not include possible further 

measures for 2005 or
 measures for 2006
 beyond those 
resulting from decision
s already taken. The projected deficit of the euro area and of the EU25 
in 2005 is 0.3-0.4 of a percentag
e point of 
GDP higher than envisaged in the na
tional plans as reflected in the 
most recent updates of the Member States™ stability 

and convergence programmes, which were generally 
submitted at the end of
 2004. This difference is 
mainly explained by a more favourable growth 

outlook in the programm
es, which foresee a combined 
real GDP growth of 2.3% in the euro area (against 
1.6% in this forecast and 2.0% in last autumn™s 

forecast) and 2.6% in the EU25 (versus 2.0% and 
2.3% respectively). The 
significantly larger gap in 
2006 between the deficits projected in the forecasts 

and those planned in th
e stability and convergence 
programmes (about ¾ percentage points of GDP) 
reflects lower growth assumptions and, more 

importantly, the no-po
licy-change assumption 
underlying the forecasts, while national programmes 
often incorporate consolidation measures that are not 
yet specified. Euro area: persistent high deficits in five Member 
StatesThe slight improvement for the euro area as a whole 
in 2005 masks diverg
ing developments across 
countries. Of the six Member States with high deficits 
in 2004 (at 2.5% of GDP or more), four, namely, 
Germany, Greece, France and the Netherlands are 
projected to narrow their deficits significantly, 

specifically by at least half a percentage point, 
although this reflects the impact of one-off measures 
in the case of France and, to a lesser extent, Germany, 

where there is also a significant 
cut in the expenditure 
ratio. In Greece, the larg
e deficit reduction benefits 
from a post-Olympics fall in public investment. In 

spite of this improvement, the deficits in these three 
countries would still be at or above 3% of GDP in 
2005. By 2006, based on current policies, only 

Germany would record a defic
it below 3% of GDP, 
while the deficit would stabilise in Greece and rise in 
France. By contrast, the Netherlands would see the 

deficit fall to 2% of GDP in 2005, reflecting decisive 
corrective action by the government. 
The remaining two high
-deficit countries, Italy and 
Portugal, have relied to 
a significant extent in recent 
years on one-off operations. 
Following deficits at or 
just below 3% of GDP in 2004, in the absence of 
further measures, the deficits are expected to widen to 
above 4.5% of GDP by 
2006, also reflecting a 
reduced reliance on one-off measures. 
Turning to the six remaining euro-area countries, five, 
namely Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg and 
Finland are expected to remain broadly in a position 
of close-to-balance over the forecast horizon. The step 

increase in the deficit in 
Austria in 2005, towards 
almost 2% of GDP, reflects the full implementation of 
enacted income tax reform. 
Uneven pace of consolidation outside euro area 
Outside the euro area, six of the recently-acceded 
Member States are estimated to have recorded deficits 
of at least 3% of GDP in 2004. A fall below the 3% of 
GDP threshold is predicted to
 occur in Cyprus in 2005 
and in Malta in 2006, in line with government plans. 
These two countries are forecast to reduce their deficit 
by more than 2 percentage points of GDP between 

2004 and 2006. In the remaining four countries 
(Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia), the 
deficit would remain close to
 4% of GDP by the end 
of the forecast horizon. 
The other high-deficit count
ry outside the euro area, 
namely the United Kingdom, is projected to gradually 

reduce its deficit from the expenditure-induced peak 
36Chapter 2 The economies of the euro area and the EU 
at 3.4% of GDP in 2003, to reach, on a no-policy 
change basis, 2.7% of
 GDP by 2006. 
Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia are expected to record 
smaller deficits, of around 2% of GDP in both 2005 

and 2006. Finally, Denmark, Estonia and Sweden are 
the only countries outside the euro area that are 
expected to maintain a su
rplus on the general 
government balance in 2
005-2006, although lower as a percentage of GDP than in 2004. 
Debt ratios not yet declining 
The moderately upward trend in the euro-area debt 
ratio since 2003 is expected to continue, bringing 

government debt to 71¾% of GDP in 2005. In the 
EU25, where the debt ratio stood at 63.8% of GDP in 
2004, an increase of similar magnitude (around half a 

percentage point) is foreseen. In
 both cases, this is due 
to the snowball effect (i.e. 
the interplay between the 
average interest rate on the debt stock and nominal 
growth) slightly outweighing th
e impact of the small 
primary surplus on the 
debt ratio. On a no-policy 
change basis, the debt ratios in the euro area and 

EU25 are projected to 
stabilise in 2006. 
Focussing on the nine hi
gh-debt countries in the EU 
(i.e. those with 2004 debt 
ratios in excess of the 60% 
of GDP reference value), four are forecast to reduce 

their debt ratios over the forecast horizon, albeit to 
varying degrees: Cyprus would succeed in reducing 
the ratio by some 5 pe
rcentage points, Belgium by 
around 4 pps, Greece, which, at some 110% of GDP, 
had the highest debt ratio in
 the EU in 2004, by 1½ 
pps and Austria by ½ pp. A further increase is 

foreseen in the remaining five countries, by between 
½ pp (Italy) to 6½ percentage 
points (Portugal), with 
France, Malta and Germany somewhere in between.

average (compared to 1.3% in 2003).  
The recovery was led by do
mestic demand (which 
contributed to GDP growth by 2.3 percentage points), 
compared to a 0.2 percentage point negative 

contribution from the external balance. Private 
consumption rose by 2.3%
 in 2004, supported by 
strong consumer confi
dence. Government 
consumption is estimated to
 have increased by 3.3% 
in real terms, partly as a result of high expenditure in 
health care. After two consecutive years of negative 

growth, gross capital formation picked up by 1.6%, 
supported by improved cor
porate balance sheets, low 
interest rates and strong dome
stic and external 
demand. Both imports and exports rose strongly in 
2004, led by robust domestic demand and buoyant 
external market growth. 
Cumulated losses in 
competitiveness due to a 
strong euro in the last two 
years partly explain the s
lightly higher growth in 
imports.  
After a reduction in employm
ent in 2002, followed by 
a standstill in 2003, employmen
t picked up in 2004 by 
an estimated 0.7%. However, the effect on the 

unemployment rate was limited due to an increase in 
the labour force. The strong growth in economic 
activity, accompanied by a moderate increase in 

employment led to increased pr
oductivity, as is usual 
in the first stage of an upswing. Inflation increased in 
the second half of 2004, mainly as a result of higher 
oil prices. However, the overall increase in HICP was 
limited to 1.9% in 2004.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
The slowdown of economic activity in the fourth 
quarter of 2004 (accompanied by increasing oil prices 

and lower growth in other EU countries, particularly 
Germany), is expected to 
result in lower economic 
growth in 2005 (2.2%). Ho
wever, the underlying 
fundamentals of domestic demand remain fairly 
strong.Consumer confidence was relatively high throughout 
2004. Consumption is sup
ported by the ongoing 
income tax reform and seems to benefit from the 
government™s increased credibility in terms of fiscal 
consolidation. The evolution of the Belgian household 

savings rate, which has been on a downward trend 
since 1993, shows a positiv
e correlation with the debt 
ratio (see graph 3.1).  
Gross capital formation is exp
ected to be quite strong 
in 2005 and 2006, as suggested by the results of 
investment surveys and 
in view of the high 
profitability and sound fin
ancial position of Belgian 
enterprises. Public investmen
t in particular should 
increase markedly in 
2005 and the first half of 2006 in 
the run-up to the 2006 local elections. On the other 
hand, government consumption is expected to 
decrease as a result of ongoing fiscal consolidation 

and the expected higher control over health care 
expenditure.  
In view of robust GDP growth and continued wage 
moderation, further increases in employment in 2005 

and 2006 are expected. In line with the expected 
average wage evolution in the three main 
neighbouring countries (G
ermany, France and the 
Netherlands), the new national wage agreement for 
2005Œ2006 foresees a 
cumulated indicative 4.5% 
nominal wage increase over the two years, lower than 

the previous 5.3% for 2003Œ2004. 
Public finances: Still some challenges ahead In 2004, the government accounts reached a small 
surplus of 0.1% of GDP. This was the result of 
higher-than-expected tax in
come, mainly VAT, direct 
taxes and the proceeds of the tax amnesty law, which 
more than outweighed the overrun in health 

expenditure.

For 2005, a small deficit of 0.2% of GDP can be 
expected, mainly due to lower economic growth and 
less income from one-off 
measures (particularly the 
discontinuation of the 
tax amnesty and lower sales 
from real estate). There is also some uncertainty 
regarding the impact of measures to control spending 

in health care. As for 2006, a somewhat more 
substantial deficit of 0.6% of GDP can be expected in 
a no-policy-change scenario and in the absence of 

one-off receipts. Although less than in 2004 (0.7% of 
GDP), one-off measures still account for some 0.3% 
of GDP in the 2005 budget, whereas nothing is 

planned at this stage for 2006. Moreover, the 
implementation of the 2001 direct tax reform will 
have its main impact in 2006, with direct tax proceeds 

being reduced by an additio
nal 0.3% of GDP. So far 
the government has not yet announced any new 
measures that could compensate for these income 
losses in 2006. 
The debt ratio, which fell to
 95.6% of GDP at the end 
of 2004, is expected to remain on a downward trend 
until the end of the fo
recast period, as a result of 
primary surpluses and d
eclining interest payments. 
However, the decrease in interest payments is slowing 
down and the primary surpluses are expected to 
remain on a downward trend. In 2005, the debt 

reduction is expected to slow 
down as a result of the 
anticipated assumption of a EUR 7.4 billion debt 
(2.5% of GDP) from the national railway company

current account
The economy in 2004 
In 2004, real GDP growth 
was solid, reaching 4%. 
Economic activity was driven 
mainly by net exports 
and investment. Investment grew 
by 9.1%. Exports of 
goods and services increased by 20.9%, in spite of a 
substantial appreciation of the Czech koruna. Imports 
rose by 18.5% and the trade balance improved 

considerably. The significant increase in foreign trade 
volumes was mainly due to the elimination of the 
remaining trade barriers with the key trading partners 

after EU accession. Growth of private consumption 
decelerated to 2.5% against the backdrop of slowing 
real wage growth and higher taxes. Government 

consumption fell by 3.2%, which was a considerable 
change compared with the 4.2% increase in 2003. 
Inflation in 2004 was low, as the increase of raw 
material and oil prices was of
fset by the strengthening 
domestic currency. HICP inflation reached 2.6%; 
about half of the price increase was caused by 
administrative measures (mainly indirect tax 

increases). The labour market was slow to react to the 
pick-up in economic activ
ity. Employment continued 
to decline (-0.5%) and the rate of unemployment was 
8.3%. The 2004 trade deficit 
of -0.8% of GDP was the 
lowest since 1993. The improving balance in goods 

and services more than outwei
ghed the increase in the 
deficit in the income ba
lance, so that the current 
account deficit fell to 5.2% of GDP. 
Outlook for 2005-2006 
GDP growth is expected to remain
 at 4% in 2005 and 
to slightly accelerate to 4.2% in 2006, being still 
driven mainly by investment
, notably foreign direct 
investment and reinvested 
profits of established 
foreign firms. Improving
 competitiveness of the 
industrial sector will stimulate exports. Growth of 

private consumption is projected to somewhat 
accelerate owing to the slightly higher growth of 
disposable income. Public consumption is forecast to 

grow in 2005 and to further accelerate in 2006, mainly 
in the run-up to 
the general election. On the external side, the trend of increasing deficits in 
the income balance is expected to continue in 2005 

and 2006. This trend is projected to be more than 
offset by the improving balance of goods and 
services. The surplus in the service balance should 

rise, but only slightly, wh
ile the negative trade balance is forecast to turn into 
a small surplus in 2005 
(0.1% of GDP) which sh
ould further increase in 2006 
(0.5% of GDP). Exports should be further boosted by 
the launch of production at a new car plant. All in all, 
the current account deficit is projected to decrease to 

4.7% of GDP in 2005, rem
aining broadly stable in 
2006. The capital balance is expected to further 
improve, mainly due to 
capital inflows from the EU 
funds. Labour market, costs and prices 
Despite a relatively strong economic performance 
which is expected to accelerate, the unemployment 

rate is projected to remain at ab
out 8.3% in 2005 and 
in 2006. The trend of falling employment is forecast 
to slow down. Developmen
ts in the labour market are 
shaped by both ongoing re
structuring, reflected in 
strong productivity gains, main
ly in the industrial 
sector, and by difficulties 
in finding employment for 
some segments of the labour force, partly due to 
insufficient incentives to take up jobs. 
At the beginning of 2005, inflation again dropped 
below the inflation target 
band and a return is 
expected only in the second half of the year (the target 
is CPI inflation of 2-4% y-o-y by the end of 
December 2005). As the risks of cost push inflation 

have faded and demand pressures are expected to be 
very weak, the central bank cut the base rate at the 
end of January from 2.5% to 2.25%. Average HICP 
inflation is expected to attain 
1.9% in 2005. In 2006, 
inflation should accelerate, reaching 2.6% on average, 

broadly in line with th
e monetary policy target (of 3% 
y-o-y with a tolerance of
 +/-1 pp as of 2006).

Public finances 
Developments in public finances in 2004 were better 
than expected, partly as a resu
lt of stronger growth 
and partly as a result of the change in the budgetary 

rules in mid-2004 which made it possible for the first 
time to roll-over unspent fund
s into 2005. The general 
government deficit was 3% of GDP, far below the 

target foreseen in the last 
convergence programme 
(5.2% of GDP). As a consequence, the budgetary 
outcome in 2005 has become very uncertain, since 

expenditures in 2005 will 
be influenced by how the 
unspent funds rolled over from 2004 (totalling about 
1% of GDP) are allocated.  
Given a record of expenditure overestimation and 
revenue underestimation in the Czech budget, the 
forecast for the 2005 general government deficit is 
4.5% of GDP, slightly below the target set in the 

convergence programme (4.7% of GDP). This 
projection assumes that half 
of the funds rolled over 
from 2004 will be spent in 200
5 and it also takes into 
account one-off military expenditures. If, however, 
the budget is implemented
 rigorously and the room 
for spending, as foreseen 
in the 2005 budget, is not 
fully used, like in 2004
, the deficit could be lower. 
In the absence of specific measures which are 
necessary to reach the target of 3.8% of GDP in the 

election year 2006, the projection for that year is 
based on the no-policy change assumption. Therefore, 
the expenditure ceilings are 
not taken in
to account for 
2006, and the deficit is pr
ojected to reach 4% of GDP. 
Gross public debt is expected
 to decline 
in 2005 to 
36.4% of GDP, mainly thanks to privatisation 
proceeds. In 2006, debt is projected to reach 37% of 

GDP. 433. Denmark Consumer spending booms, net exports burden GDP growth

Forecast
The economy in 2004 
The recovery of economi
c activity in Denmark was 
confirmed in 2004. GDP growth was driven by 
domestic demand, in particular private consumption, 

which reached its highest growth rate since 1994. 
Backed by strong consumer confidence, household 
spending was boosted by the March 2004 fiscal 

package. This resu
lted in substan
tial increases in real 
disposable incomes due to
 income tax cuts, as well as 
the suspension (in 2004 and 2005) of the 

contributions to a mandatory pension savings scheme. 
Robust increases in car sales 
contributed notably to 
the strength of private consumption. Public 

consumption grew only m
odestly, in line with the 
government™s targets. Investment growth accelerated 
in the second half of the year, in particular for 

equipment investment. Ex
ports grew moderately, 
leading to a sizeable loss of market share. The surge 
in domestic demand entailed 
a sharp rise in imports 
resulting in a markedly nega
tive growth contribution 
from net exports. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
The strong growth in domestic demand is expected to 
continue in 2005, albeit decelerating. Domestic 
demand continues to drive economic activity and 
should lead to GDP grow
th of 2¼%, somewhat higher 
than in 2004. A
lso in 2005, private consumption is 
expected to be boosted by the tax cuts and the 
continued suspension of the special pension savings, 

which frees funds for consumption. Against the 
background of positive industr
y confidence indicators, 
investment growth is set to 
remain robust as foreign 
demand remains high and capacity utilisation 
increases. In particular, housing investment will 
benefit from rising house prices and favourable 

financing conditions and is set to expand vigorously. 
While strengthening mode
rately in 2005, export 
growth is still set to be lower 
than that of export 
markets. A loss of market shares in an upswing is a 

recurrent phenomenon in Denmark and in part linked 
to the composition of 
exports. Moreover, the strength 
of the krone vis-à-vis
 the US dollar and relatively 
high wage increases in recent years have put pressure 
on competitiveness. Imports are expected to grow 
strongly in 2005 though less so than in 2004, with the 

negative growth contribution from net exports 
decreasing. As a consequence of the relatively strong 
imports, the current account 
surplus should weaken. In 2006, private consumption growth is expected to 
dampen as the special pension saving scheme is 
reinstated after its two-year suspen
sion. Though still 
losing market shares, exports will grow at a fairly 

robust pace against the background of sustained 
export market growth. Import growth is expected to 
decelerate due to lower domestic demand and the 
contribution to growth 
from net exports will turn 
slightly positive. On this basis, GDP growth is 

expected to be just abov
e 2%, around the level assessed to be sustainable in the medium term. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
The labour market started to im
prove in 2004, but the 
recovery has so far been hesitant. Employment fell in 

the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for 2004 as a 
whole. However, as the labour force also increased, 
average unemployment was higher than in 2003. In 

seasonally adjusted terms, unemployment edged down 
in the last part of 2004 an
d in the beginning of 2005. 
In view of the present strength of domestic demand, it 

is expected that the labour 
market will turn and 
unemployment fall at a more sustained pace. The 
improvement in the labour market is expected to 

continue through the period, with unemployment 
reaching 4½% in 2006. Private sector wage growth 
has been decelerating, particularly as a result of the 
weak labour market and low inflation, declining to a 
yearly growth rate of below 3%
 in early 2005. Over 
the forecast period, wage growth is expected to rise 
moderately as the labour market tightens.

Consumer price inflation was markedly subdued in 
2004, with average HICP inflation at 0.9%, the lowest 
rate since the 1950s. The dampened inflation was due 

to reductions in excise duties and falling import prices 
as well as to decelerating wage growth. In the forecast 
period, consumer price inflation is set to increase as 

the effects of the reduction in excise duties fall out of 
the yearly comparisons, a
nd import and energy prices 
are expected to rise in 2005. In 2006, inflation is 

expected to further edge somewhat higher as capacity 
pressure in the economy increase. 
Public finances  
Public finances are set to remain sound over the 
forecast period. The surplus in 2004 was 2¾% of 
GDP due to an exceptional increase in revenues from 

mainly corporate and pension fund yield taxes. In 
2005 and 2006, a surplus of around 2% of GDP is 
expected. The general governme
nt balance is boosted 
by lower labour-market-related expenditure and 
interest payments, as well as to higher revenues from 
oil-related activities. The gr
owth of real public 
consumption in 2004 was below the target for that 
year, as the instruments applied by the government to 
limit local government spend
ing, including the tax

The situation in 2004 
After relatively strong quarterly 
growth rates of 0.5% 
and 0.4%, respectively, in the first two quarters, 
activity remained flat in the second half of the year, 

even recording a slight decline in the fourth quarter
i.In spite of this, with a 1.6% increase Germany 
registered the highest annual GDP growth in four 

years, helped by a substantial working day effect 
estimated at ½ pp.  
Net exports contributed over one percentage point to 
overall growth. Germany benefited from lively global 

demand, even gaining market shares as unchanged 
nominal wages translated into a competitive 
advantage despite the appreciation of the euro.  
Wage stagnation and weak em
ployment growth, on 
the other hand, made for a slight decline in final 
domestic demand, extending
 to both private 
consumption and investment. Because of this, and as 

demonstrated by the sluggishness of the last two 
quarters, the upswing therefore remains fragile and 
failed to become self-sustaining. Prospects in 2005 and 2006 
The risk of a slide-back into recession is low, as there 
are signs that growth will resume already in the first 
quarter of 2005 with the same strength as a year 

before. Indicators of consumer and business rose at 
the beginning of the 
year, partly related to the 
successful introduction of the ﬁHartzﬂ-reforms and the 

road toll system as well as 
a reduction in tax rates. 
Likewise, industrial order volumes both domestically 
and from abroad indicate a solid increase in demand 
in the near future. Nevert
heless, as the starting level at 
the beginning of 2005 is low, a high annual growth 

rate can no longer be achieved in spite of an expected 
solid increase in economic 
activity over the course of 
the year.Private consumption, which
 still remains below levels 
attained four years ago, is starting to pick up again. 
Growth, however, will be limited by the slow increase 
in disposable income and employment, although a 

certain momentum could be 
achieved via a reduction 
in the savings 
rate, which has gone
 up substantially 
since the mini-boom in 2000.  
Lower saving could also be a response to an increase 
in employment, even though
 this is so far only due to 
the sharp rise in so-called mini-jobs under the 
ﬁHartzﬂ- reforms. While the reform also increased 

unemployment in the national definition to over 5 
million in January, as a st
atistical revision added some 
375 000 people, the IL
O-calculated unemployment 
rate used in this forecast remains largely unaffected 
and reflects the underlying trend: Unemployment is 
likely to remain stable until 
the middle of the year and 
start falling thereafter. Falling unit labour costs should boost profits and 
ultimately lead to
 a turnaround in investment, which 
has been falling precipitously over the last few years. 
By contrast, construction activity will continue to fall, 
as housing construction remains weak and the poor 

state of public finances constraints infrastructure 
projects. The building sector should benefit, however, 
46Chapter 3 Member States, Germany from an increase in commercial construction.  
Low wage growth should also 
lead to a continuing 
strong export performance over the forecast period, 
despite the strong euro. Germany has gained 

competitiveness in particular 
vis-à-vis other euro-zone members with higher inflation rates. Nevertheless, 
export growth rates should co
me down from their 
high 2004 levels as th
e international demand for 
investment goods slows down, for which Germany 
enjoys a comparative advantage. Furthermore, as 

import volumes should increase at a faster pace in line 
with domestic demand, the 
net export contribution to 
growth should be close to zero.  
As nominal wages have hardly increased, inflationary 
pressures in Germany also re
main very low, despite 
the rise in energy prices. Indeed, a full percentage 
point of the 2004 
CPI inflation was due to 
administered price increases (health care and tobacco 
taxes) and a further 0.2 
pp due to energy prices, 
leaving less than half a percen
t of core inflation and a 
GDP deflator well below 1%. This situation looks set 
to remain largely unchanged in the near term. 
Public finances 
The general government deficit edged down to 3.7% 
of GDP in 2004, from 3.8% in 2003. Government 
revenues fell by 0.4%. This reflects the sizeable 
income tax cuts worth 0.7% of GDP that were 

implemented at the beginning of 2004 as part of the 
tax relief laws passed in 20
00, which were only partly 
financed by a broadening of the tax base. In addition, 

lacklustre domestic demand has kept consumption tax 
revenues low, in particular fro
m oil taxes in the wake 
of rising oil prices. The increase in the tobacco tax 

rate in March 2004 did not generate as much revenue 
as expected by the government. A tax amnesty, aimed 
at repatriating savings currently deposited undeclared 

abroad, contributed about •1bn to government 
revenues, far less than 
planned. However, the 
unexpected decline in GDP 
in the fourth quarter did 
not translate into correspondingly lower tax revenues, 
partly as a result from the 
working-day-adjustment 
overdoing the decline, but also suggesting that the 
composition of growth could become more tax-
friendly. General government expenditure fell by 0.5% in 
nominal terms. The health sector reforms introduced 
in the beginning of 2004 
substantially reduced public 
spending on health care 
by •3.7bn (worth almost 
0.2% of GDP) compared with
 2003, which enabled 
the statutory health insu
rance providers to run a 
surplus in 2004, reducing the accumulated debt. 
Pension expenditure rose only slightly, reflecting the 
freeze of individual pension benefits. Lower 

employment and continued 
cuts in bonus payments 
lowered the general government wage bill by 0.9%. 
However, the ongoing weakening of the labour 

market led to rising expend
iture on transfers such as 
unemployment and social assistance.  
In cyclically-adjusted terms, 
the deficit remained 
broadly unchanged in 2004. Thus, with growth close 

to potential, fiscal policy was not contractionary in 
Germany in 2004. However, all levels of government 
continued to face budgetary c
onstraints that would not 
have permitted any di
scretionary loosening. 
In 2005, the general governme
nt deficit is projected to 
fall to 3.3% of GDP. This central estimate leaves the 
chance to avoid a fourth consecutive breach of the 

3%-of-GDP ceiling. In cyclically-adjusted terms, the 
deficit is expected to narrow 
by ½ percentage point in 
2005. General government revenue is expected to 
grow by about 1% despite the implementation of the 
last stage of the tax relief law 
from the year 2000, not 
least as rising profits will lead to higher corporate 
taxes. In addition, subsidy repayments by several 
Landesbanken
 and the introduction 
of the road toll 
will add to revenues. Slow growth of the gross wage 
sum weakens the contribution base of the social 
security system. It is thus assumed that the total social 

security contribution rate 
will fall only slightly in 
2005, despite the 20
04 surplus in th
e health sector. 
Pressure on health insurers to lower the contribution 

rates further instead of 
continuing running surpluses 
to reduce their debt may lead to a deficit higher than 
projected.Expenditures will grow only by
 0.3%. in 2005 Wage 
agreements in the public sector are moderate and 
provide budgetary relief also
 in 2006. The dampening 
effect of the health sector reforms will abate already 
in 2005. The implementation of the new social benefit 
system (Hartz IV-package) is 
projected to result in 
expenditure savings 
after 2005. Subsidies are 
projected to continue falling
, while the share of public 
investment in GDP is proj
ected to remain constant.

cash settlement office for the former postal civil 
servants was going to 
securitise future transfer income 
from the post office™s successor companies, so that 

the federal government would no longer have to make 
an annual transfer of 0.25% of GDP to the cash office. 
It is assumed that this transaction reduces government 

expenditure compatible 
with ESA95 accounting rules, 
a specific Eurostat decision still pending.  
The main budgetary risks for 2005 are a continuing 
stagnation of private consump
tion translating into tax 
shortfalls, and the labour market developing more 
unfavourably than projected. Possible budgetary 
implications resulting from 
the ﬁjobs summitﬂ 
between government and
 opposition on 17 March 
2005 are not considered here. 
On unchanged policies, the general government 
deficit is projected to fall below 3% of GDP in 2006 

by a small margin. Growing private consumption is 
expected to bolster tax revenues, while the forecast 
assumes no further tax cuts. 
Tax revenue effects from 
growth shifting towards domestic demand will be 
reflected in a reduction of the cyclically-adjusted 

deficit. Expenditure growth is expected to accelerate 
moderately. A recovering labour market in 
combination with the leg
islated labour market reforms 
are expected to provide relief for social transfers.  
Nonetheless, the expenditure restraint of 2004 and 
2005 has been achieved partly by one-off measures 
that will become a future 
burden on the budget; 
moreover, without further structural measures, health 
care spending may return to
 pre-2004 high growth 
rates. Thus, in order to put 
the public finances onto a 
sustainable path, further 
medium-term consolidation 
measures on the expenditure side are needed.

%Forecast
The situation in 2004 
In 2004, real GDP growth accelerated to 6.2%. The 
main driver of growth in 
2004 was net exports, 
supported by good results in foreign tourism and 

buoyant domestic demand. I
nvestment grew by over 
8%. Construction did particularly well, on the back of 
a housing boom, but has abated somewhat since last 

summer. Credit demand grew by over 30%, mostly in 
mortgage loans and business investment. The full-
year HICP remained below expectations at 3%, since 

low core inflation largely offset temporary EU-
accession-related price hikes. The unemployment rate 
declined further, to 9.2%, while employment 

continued to increase, albeit at a very modest rate of 
just 0.2%. Following
 EU accession last May, strong 
demand for Estonian workers in other EU countries 

has led to shortages of qu
alified labour, mainly in the 
health care sector but also 
in construction, triggering 
significant wage increases in both sectors. However, 

for the economy as a whole, higher inflation coupled 
with considerable wage moderation led to a slowing 
of real wage growth, whic
h remained comfortably 
below significant labour productivity gains of around 
6%. The fiscal position surprised 
on the positive side, 
with a general government surplus of 1.8% of GDP. 
The external deficit remained high, at 
around 12% of 
GDP, but recent trade data corrections finally appear 

to indicate an improvement of the external account. 
Overall, the situation in 200
4 was strongly marked by 
various EU accession effec
ts, most of which were 
temporary and have already started to abate.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Growth is forecast to remain around 6% throughout 
the forecast period. One factor that is expected to keep 
demand for Estonian expo
rts high is the positive 
growth outlook for Estonia™s 
main trading partners, 
Sweden and Finl
and. Trade with 
third countries is 
also expected to accelerate. With exports and 

investment picking up stro
ngly, and the pace of both 
private and government consumption expected to 
expand slower than overall GDP, growth should 

become somewhat more balanced. Investment is 
expected to remain strong
, fuelled also by public 
infrastructure spending a
nd smooth absorption of EU 
transfers, co-financing of which is increasingly also 
provided by the private sector. The methodological 
changes in recording required upon EU accession 

have made the external trade data temporarily less 
reliable. However, even if 
the levels and growth rates 
are uncertain, recently revised trade data suggest that 

the projected correction of the external imbalance 
may have finally started in 2004. The external deficit 
is projected to come down to around 10% of GDP by 
2006. The trade balance is expected to improve over 
the forecast period, while the 
income balance will 
remain in substantial 
deficit. The latter largely reflects 
repatriated profits, often in th
e form of reinvested 
earnings, roughly two thirds of which come back onto 

the capital account as FDI. The capital account 
surplus is expected to in
crease, not least thanks to 
increasing EU transfers which, along with sizeable 

FDI and portfolio inflows, sh
ould help to better 
balance Estonia™s external account. 
Labour market, wages and prices 
Strong growth should translate into a renewed pick-up 
in employment gains from the modest 2004 rate, and a 

sustained decline in the rate of unemployment. With 
regard to employment, some whitening of the still 
widespread grey labour ma
rket, in particular in the 
low-wage sector, can be observed. This can be 
attributed to a combination 
of higher income tax 
thresholds, lower income tax rates, a simple system of 
tax declaration, and increasingly effective tax 
collection. Also, region
al disparities in the labour 
market as well as youth unemployment are starting to 
decline as an active labour market policy starts to bear 
fruit. A gradual increase of 
presently low participation rates will be supported by both a rising retirement age 
and stronger incentives to work. These trends are

Given the fairly flexible lab
our market, real wages are 
expected to increase broadly
 in line with
 productivity 
gains, while 2005 
is expected to mark a low for gross 
wage increases, reflecting the cushioning impact of 
the income tax cuts on net wages. Consumer price 

inflation is expected to 
peak in 2005 at 3.3%, 
reflecting a number of expec
ted administrative price 
increases, and to return to below 
3% in 2006. Core 
inflation is fairly low and
 stable, and the Estonian 
authorities have expressed th
eir intention to put a 
brake on further administrative price hikes should 

inflation develop unfavourably. Oil prices so far have 
not had a major impact on 
inflation in Estonia.

In 2004, Estonia posted 
a higher-than-projected 
general government surplus of
 1.8% of GDP, which is 
some 1% above earlier
 projections. Although the 
Estonian government is aiming for a target of 
balanced budgets for both 2005 and 2006, prudent 
budget assumptions and continuing improvements in 

tax collection are likely to lead
 to surpluses Œ albeit 
declining Œ also in these 
years. For 2005, a strong 
carry-over effect of delayed
 VAT tax collection 
related to EU accession can be expected to provide an 
additional boost to 
budgetary revenues. Local 
government deficits have started to come down, and 

can be expected to further decline as a result of a new 
legal framework which will en
ter into force in 2006.

The situation in 2004 
Although slowing from the previous year, economic 
growth remained robust in
 2004 buttressed
 by healthy 
domestic demand. By contrast, the external side 

continued to act as a drag in spite of a marked 
expansion of export markets, thus confirming that the 
Greek industry has a competitiveness problem. In the 

year as a whole, real GDP posted an increase of 4.2%, 
down from 4.7% in 2003. Following a drop in the 
summer, annual inflation went up again on the back of 

higher oil prices and rising unit labour costs. The 
inflation differential with 
the euro-area average narrowed somewhat. The assessment of labour market 

developments is complicated by a major statistical 
revision carried out in 2004. As the data were not 
revised backward by the cut-off date of the forecast, 

the rate of unemployment exhibits a break between 
2003 and 2004. It is reported to have increased 
significantly together with a sharp increase in the 

labour force ensuing from 
the regularisation of illegal 
immigrants.  
Prospects in 2005 and 2006 
The planned fiscal withdrawal in 2005 and the 
petering out of the ‚Olympic bonus™ are expected to 
shape the economic performance over the forecast 
horizon. GDP growth is likely to ease from 4.2% in 

2004 to slightly below 3% in 2005 before rebounding 
somewhat in 2006 
towards its potential rate. As a 
result, the output gap is set to narrow but to stay 

positive over the forecast period. 
In 2005, the planned fiscal 
adjustment outlined in the 
government budget - mainly lower government 
investment and consumption expenditure - affects 
aggregate demand by more than one percentage point. 
Although private investment is expected to step in, 

taking advantage 
inter alia
 of the recently approved 
business tax reform, total investment growth is set to 
slow markedly. Private consumption growth is also 

projected to weaken, reflecting the dr
op in co
nfidence recorded at the end of 2
004 and the onset of 2005. 
However, the planned income
 tax relief planned is 
likely to mitigate the easing. 
The negative contribution fro
m the external side is 
expected to decline over the forecast horizon as 
manufacturing firms are likely 
to gain ground on the 
still expanding export markets. Nevertheless, net 
exports are likely to continue to act as a drag on real 
GDP growth.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The healthy pace of economic expansion projected in 
2005 and 2006, outpacing
 the euro
-area average, will go along with an increase in employment. However, 
in view of the projected deceleration of economic 
growth, the rate of job creation, while staying 
positive, is expected to dro
p significantly from 2004, 
most likely in the serv
ices sector. The rate of 
unemployment is projected to increase in 2005, before 
edging down again in 2006. 
Following a series of gene
rous wage ag
reements for 
the 2004-2005 period, especially in 
the public sector, 
the leader for other employment categories, wages per 
head are set to keep rising at a rate of more than 5% in 

2005, well above projected 
productivity growth. The 
trend is expected 
to continue in 2006. 
Dynamic wage developments 
coupled with strong 
domestic demand are projected to fuel inflation, 

which is projected to in
crease to 3.1% over the 
forecast horizon. Public finances 
Based on the figures reported on 1 March 2005 in the 
framework of the EU 
budgetary surveillance, the 
deficit was 6.1% of GDP in 2004

factors, the deficit is estimated 
to have been at around 
7% of GDP given the large positive output gap.  
In 2005, the deficit ratio is 
projected to decline to 
4.5% of GDP on the back of the fiscal adjustment 

presented in the government budget. These 
projections do not take account of the additional fiscal 
package announced by the Greek government in late 

March, after the cut-off date for the current forecasts. 
The improvement is expected to chiefly result from 
lower investment expenditure, which is set to fall 
sharply from the high levels brought about by the 
organisation of the Olympi
c Games, and from a series 
of other expenditure curbing measures. In cyclically-

adjusted terms the 2005 de
ficit is estimated to be 
above 5% of GDP. 
Following established
 practice, the deficit projection 
for 2006 of 4.4% of GD
P is based on unchanged 
legislation. The marginal improvement compared to 
2005 reflects the moderate acceleration of economic 
growth. 
The general government debt reached 110.5% of GDP 
in 2004, up from 109.3% in
 2003 on the back of a 
primary deficit and sizeable debt increasing below-

the-line operations. Due to the slowdown in economic 
growth and the persistence 
of debt increasing stock-
flow adjustments, the expected improvement of the 

primary balance in 2005 will suffice to broadly 
stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio. 
A slight decline in the 
debt ratio is expected in 2006.  
                                                          
iEurostat did not validate the deficit figures for Greece notably 
because of an inconsistent recording of flows between Greece and 
the EU budget. Eurostat also noted that healthcare- and Olympics-

related expenditure for past years is 
not yet final. Therefore, the 
government deficit figures for 2004 and earlier years may have to 
be revised upwards.527. Spain Widening external imbalances

Economic developments in 2004 
GDP gained momentum in 2004 and grew by 2.7%, 
compared with 2.5% in 2003, following an 
increasingly unbalanced growth
 pattern, underpinned 
by dynamic domestic demand, while the external 
sector continued to weigh
 on GDP growth.  
Economic activity was led by domestic demand, 
which accelerated markedly. Private consumption 

speeded up, supported by strong job creation along 
with easy monetary and financial conditions. These 
factors also explain the 
resilience of investment in 
dwellings, whereas the household saving rate further 
decreased and net lending turned out negative in 
2004. Investment in equipment accelerated during the 

second half of the year. However, this acceleration 
seems to have been temporary and the result of 
equipment renewal after a large increase of profits in 

2003, rather than a consequence of improved business 
expectations justifying new investment projects. 
The external sector, especially imports, also exhibited 
a high level of dynamism.  Fuelled by strong domestic 
demand, import growth accelerated, while exports 
grew well below world tr
ade. As a result, the trade 
deficit widened from 5.2% of
 GDP in 2003 to 6.8% in 
2004. The external sector deducted 1.7 pp from GDP 
growth, compared with 0.8 pp. in the previous year.  
The negative contribution of the external sector to 
growth has its origin in a persistent and widening 
deficit in goods trade, which
 results from high import 
growth, underpinned by dynamic domestic demand, 

while positive inflation differen
tials with the euro area and low productivity growth kept exports growth well 
below imports. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
GDP growth in 2005 is 
projected to remain almost 
unchanged at 2.7%, on the basis of still buoyant 

domestic demand which will decelerate only 
marginally. This will translate into a slight 
deceleration of imports and therefore a somewhat less 

unbalanced growth pattern than in 2004.  Domestic demand will be underpinned by still 
dynamic job creation and eas
y monetary and financial 
conditions. The deceleration of domestic demand 

stems from a slight moderation of private 
consumption. Households™ i
ndebtedness is projected 
to keep on growing, while high inflationary pressures 

and the worsening of the terms of trade may also 
negatively affect consumers™ 
purchasing power. Gross 
fixed capital formation sh
ould remain buoyant, 
backed by investment in dwellings, which is expected 
to exhibit strong growth. However, investment in 
equipment is projected to decelerate since the factors 
underpinning the 2004 recovery of this item seem to 
have faded out in 2005. 
This strong final demand is expected to keep import 
growth well above exports. The latter are projected to 
grow only moderately due to sl
uggish prospects in the 
euro area coupled
 with deteriorating industrial 
competitiveness. The extern
al sector is projected to 
negatively contribute to GDP growth by 1.4 pp. 
The year 2006 is expected to 
record a broadly similar 
growth profile. GDP is projected to grow at 2.7%. 
53Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 Spain 
Domestic demand components are expected to further 
decelerate. The slowdown of private consumption 
should not be strong and, 
consequently household 
indebtedness should conti
nue to widen. The still large 
gap between production and demand in the housing 
market should induce a reduction of growth in the 

construction sector. Investme
nt in equipment will 
remain subdued, reflecting bu
sinesses concerns about 
the medium term. 
The projected deceleration of domestic demand will 
lead to a moderation of imports, but, persistent 
competitiveness losses, coupled 
with expectations of 
sluggish growth in Spain™s 
main EU trade partners, 
will still weigh on export growth. Overall, the 
negative contribution from the external sector, albeit 
smaller in absolute terms, is 
expected to lighten only 
marginally, to 1.1 pp. 
The trade deficit is expected to reach 7.7% of GDP in 
2005 and to further increase to 8.3% of GDP in 2006. 
Additionally, the surplus recorded by services, 
especially tourism, which ha
s traditionally offset the deficit in goods trade, narr
owed in 2004 and is 
projected to stagnate over the forecast period. 
However, the increasing presence of Spanish firms 
overseas will increase primary incomes, helping 

compensate the trade deficit. Overall, the current 
account deficit could attain 6.2% of GDP in 2006. 
This current account figures, only slightly 

compensated by net capital tr
ansactions, sh
ould result 
in a net borrowing position of the economy of 4.7% 
and 5.2% of GDP in 20
05 and 2006 compared to 
3.9% in 2004.  
Labour market  
Job creation will remain robust. In 2005, full time 
equivalent employment is 
expected to grow at 2.1%, 
whereas in 2006 it should decelerate to 2% in line 

with somewhat less dynamic economic activity. 
Job creation is expected to concentrate on sectors 
where productivity is low, 
namely construction and 
services. In the manufacturing sector, employment is 

projected to recover only ma
rginally (0.1% 
in 2005 
and 0.2% in 2006), wh
ich compares with the job 
losses recorded ov
er 2002-2004. St
rong job creation 
will take place along with
 a rising activity rate, which 
would reach 70% at the end of the forecasting period. 

The increase of the activity rate 
is mainly explained 
by high immigration flows and higher female 
participation. As a consequence, the unemployment 
rate would reduce only marginally over the forecast 
period, remaining still above 10% in 2006. 
Productivity is proj
ected to grow over the forecast 
period by a meagre 0.6% per year, mainly reflecting 
the existence of rigidities 
in product markets, 
especially utilities and services. However, in the 
manufacturing sector, productivity growth should 
remain stronger at around 2%
, mirroring the higher 
exposition to competition of
 this sector, but still 
below the euro-area average. In contrast, in the non-
manufacturing sector, productivity is expected to 
almost stagnate, growing only
 by 0.3% in 2005 and 
0.4% in 2006. 
Costs and prices 
Following the oil price hike 
in the second and third 
quarters of 2004 and negative behaviour of food 
components, headline inflation reached 3.1%, while 

core inflation was only slightly lower at 2.8%.
Since the increase in energy prices is expected to 
affect the first months of the current year, inflation is 
projected to ease gradually after the second quarter of 
2005. On an annual ba
sis, HICP inflation is expected 
to ease to 2.9% in 2005, and 
to fall further to 2.7% in 
2006. Structural factors such as insufficient 
competition in certain sectors (utilities and services), 
coupled with remaining 
rigidities in the labour 
market, especially indexation clauses, seem to be 
behind the still high inflationary pressures. The GDP 
deflator is projected to grow well above the HICP, 

mainly due to a high const
ruction deflator and the 
relative moderation of import prices compared to 
domestic production.   
Following resilient inflatio
n, compensation of 
employees per head is projected to decelerate only 
marginally growing at around 3.7% over the forecast 
period. This may partially reflect the effect of 

indexation clauses, while social partners seem to be 
committed to wage moderation. Consequently, unit 
labour costs are expected to 
slightly slow down in 
2005 and 2006 compared wi
th 2004. A
lthough labour costs in Spain will still 
grow above the euro-area 
average, they will continue to grow below GDP 
deflator, which results in neg
ative real unit labour 
costs growth over the forecast period.

Coupled with low 
productivity growth, inflation differentials with the main 
trading partners will 
continue being one of the driving forces behind 

widening external deficits. 
Public finances 
In 2004, the budget deficit 
was 0.3% of GDP. The 
inclusion of RENFE (the Spanish railway company) 
and RTVE (the public broadcasting company) in the 

general government sector was initially projected to 
lead to a deficit close to
 0.8% of GDP, but the 
budgetary effects of this reclassification were partially 

offset by higher-than-expe
cted revenues. Public 
consumption expend
iture contributed to the 
dynamism of domestic demand, by growing in 

nominal terms (9.9%) well above nominal GDP 
(7.2%).  
A balanced budget is projected for 2005, while a non-
policy-change scenario would resu
lt in a small surplus 
(0.1% of GDP) for 2006
. Strong job creation coupled 
with dynamic consumption should keep revenues 
growing above nominal GDP. As a result, total 

revenues are projected to reach 40.4% of GDP in 
2005 and 40.5% in 2006, 0.5 percentage points of 
GDP above the government target. In parallel, led by 

strong public consumption 
growth, expenditures are 
projected at 40.4% of GDP in 2005 and 2006. This is 
around 0.6 percentage points of GDP higher than the 

government projection, wh
ich might be slightly 
optimistic. 
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to continue on a 
declining path during the fo
recast period, falling from 
48.9% of GDP in 2004 to around 44% of GDP in 
2006. 558. France Growth remains robust, fuelled by domestic demand

France - Household savings rate
The economic situation in 2004 
Real GDP in France grew by 
2.5% in 2004, its best 
performance since 2000. Contrary to what was 
observed in the euro area as a whole, the French 

economy was supported by domestic demand, 
especially by private consumption. At the same time, 
the contribution of th
e external sector to GDP growth 
was negative since France could not fully take 
advantage of the expansion of world trade because its 
export markets expanded more slowly and its price 

competitiveness deteriorated.  
The strong average growth figure hides a slowdown in 
the second half of 2004. While 
in the first half of 2004 
real GDP growth reached about 3% in annualised 

terms, it fell below its potent
ial in the second half of 
the year. In particular, in the context of a worsening 
demand outlook linked 
to the oil price increase and 
the cumulated euro appreciation, business investment 
was less buoyant in the 
second half of the year. 
Consumer spending, which grew rapidly in the first 

half of 2004, dipped in the third quarter but rebounded 
strongly in the fourth
 quarter. The end of tax 
exemption (in December 2004) on the withdrawal of 
balances held by employees 
in companies™ savings 
schemes might have encouraged households to free up 

some savings. In the context of the protracted 
weakness of gross disposable household income, the 
buoyant private consumption was driven by a large 

decline in the saving ratio
 (by 0.7 pp in 2004). 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
In 2005, real GDP 
growth is expected
 to slow down 
somewhat and in 2006 it is 
projected to 
return to its 
potential. Economic activ
ity should still be driven by 
domestic demand, while the contribution of net 
exports to GDP growth should tu
rn neutral by the end 
of the forecast period. 
Recent macroeconomic indicators suggest that 
economic activity is likely to
 continue to be buoyant 
in the first quarter of 2005, supported by private 

consumption, while employme
nt growth may be slow 
to pick up (unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2004 
after a slight increase of 0.1% in the third quarter). 

Also, consumers should continue to draw on their 
savings but this may not be sustainable since the 
savings ratio is already 1 
point below its long-term 
average. Overall private consumption growth is 
projected to decelerate from 2.3% in 2004 to 2.0% in 
2005. In 2006, 
private consumpti
on is expected to 
remain the main driving force of growth, based on an 
expected substantial recovery in employment. It 
would increase in line with disposable household 

income, which is foreseen to accelerate gradually 
thanks to a rise in demand for labour. Over the 
forecast horizon, the planned reform of the 35-hour 
working week may boost households™ income through 
an increase in authorised annual
 overtime and the 
possibility for employees to
 convert the allowed extra 
overtime into additional in
come. The decline in 
inflation should also strengthen the purchasing power 

of households. Over the next two years, invest
ment in equipment is 
forecast to remain relatively buoyant. It should still be 
supported by favourab
le financing co
nditions and the 
implementation of tax cuts on new capital 
expenditure. But in 2005, th
e deterioration in demand 
56Chapter 3 Member States, France expectations, uncertainty about the sustainability of 
the consumption growth
 and relatively low capacity 
utilisation are expected to curb spending on 

equipment in the near term
. In 2006, this tendency 
would be reversed. Hence, following a deceleration 
from 5.1% in 2004 to 4.5% in 2005, equipment 

investment growth wo
uld pick up in 2006 (to 5.5%). 
The increase in residential construction investment is 
also forecast to moderate from 2.9% in 2004 to about 

2% in 2005 and 2006. 
After a loss in export market shares in 2004 for the 
second consecutive year, export volumes are 
projected to increase more in line with markets™ 

growth. The improvement of price competitiveness 
and a better cyclical position in those sectors (car 
transport and aeronautic sector
s) in which France is 
specialised should support export growth. In this 
context, and although imports are forecast to remain 
buoyant in response to the robustness of final demand, 

the negative contributio
n of net trade to GDP growth 
will diminish. Labour markets, costs and prices 
The need for companies to further improve their 
financial situation, uncertainties concerning the 
durability of the recovery 
and the lag in the 
employment response to a pick
 up in activity in 2004 
largely explain the current weakness in employment 
growth. In 2005 and 2006, 
employment growth is set 
to strengthen in response 
to improved corporate 
profitability and better economic prospects over the 
forecast horizon. This would allow a decline in the 
unemployment rate, from 9.6% of the labour force in 

2004 to 9.1% in 
2006 (ILO definition). Given the still high 
unemployment rate, wage 
increases are expected to be moderate in 2005. 
Nevertheless, the harmonisation of the different levels 

of the minimum wage, induced by the reduction in 
working time to 35 hours implemented between 1998 
and 2002, will still support wag
es in 2005. In both 
2005 and 2006 the p
lanned increased flexibility of 
working time should also sustain wages. A slight 
cyclical acceleration in real wages is expected to 
occur in 2006, driven by the improvement of the 
situation in the labour market. 
With productivity growth expected to decelerate from 
the high rate observed in 
2004, unit labour costs 
should rise over the forecast period. Underlying 
inflation is therefore projected to pick up gradually, 
especially in the services sector. However, the 
government™s initiative to induce retailers and 

consumer goods producers to 
cut the prices of major 
branded products, reinforced 
by the planned revision 
of the Galland Law on retail pricing, should moderate 

inflation. In add
ition, the diminishing effect of past 
increases in excise duties on tobacco should reduce 
the inflation rate by 0.4 percentag
e point in 2005. In 
2006, the expected decrease in energy prices should 
contribute to a decline in HICP inflation.  
Public finances 
The general government deficit declined from 4.2% of 
GDP in 2003 to 3.7% of 
GDP in 2004. 
This decline 
benefited from an improvement in the macroeconomic 
situation, which triggered 
additional fiscal revenues, 
notably in terms of VAT and income tax, of about 

0.7% of GDP compared to initial budget plans. 
Discretionary tax measures contributed to a deficit 
reduction by about 0.1% 
of GDP. The ratio of general 
government expenditure to GDP declined from 54.7% 
in 2003 to 54.5% of GDP in
 2004. While for the 
second year in a row State expenditure remained 
stable in volume as planned, expenditures in social 
security regimes and local authorities increased by 

more than initially foreseen 
by the French authorities. 
All in all, the cyclically-adjusted
 deficit improved by 
0.4 percentage point of GDP in 2004, as against a 

targeted 0.8 percentage point of GDP. The general 
government debt continued to increase, from 63.9% 
of GDP in 2003 to 65.6% 
of GDP in 2004, as a result 
of the deficit and negative stock-flow adjustments.  
For 2005, the general 
government deficit is projected 
at 3%. The current forecast assumes that expenditure 
will increase by 2% in real terms (compared to the 

1.6% increase foreseen by the national authorities) as 
health expenditures are projected to increase by 4.0% 
in 2005 against 3.2% in 
the budget law fo
r 2005. This 
is due to an assumed lower impact of the measures 
introduced by the health reform. The forecast also 
incorporates one-off payments by the EDF/GDF 
companies to the general government for a total 
amount of 0.5% of GDP related to this transfer. This 

is the same deficit estimate as in the autumn forecast, 
when 2005 real GDP growth was projected at 2.2% as 
against 2% currently expected. The negative growth 

effect on the deficit (0.1 percentage point of GDP) is 
compensated by some measures on the revenue side.

The macroeconomic and bu
dgetary forecast for 2005 
is consistent with an impr
ovement in the cyclically-
adjusted balance by 0.8 percentage point of GDP, the 

largest part of which reflects the impact of the one-off 
measures. The overall budgetary situation in France 
remains vulnerable and the 
2005 government deficit 
forecast is subject to upward risks. In particular, 
beyond the expenditure slippages already 
incorporated in the current forecast, further slippages 

cannot be ruled out, notably 
in the health and local 
authorities sectors. In addition, this forecast does not 
include potential further increases in public sector 

wages (on top of the alre
ady granted two index 
revalorisations of 0.5% each) linked to the 
negotiations starting end of March 2005. It also does 

not include possible 
tax cuts following the 
announcement by the government on 8 February. 
These potential effects may to a certain extent be 
compensated by additi
onal non-fiscal revenues 
stemming from debt buy-back operations from foreign 

States.In 2006, despite real GDP growth being expected to 
be close to its potential rate, the general government 
deficit is projected to in
crease again to 3.4% of GDP 
(based on the usual no-policy-change assumption). 
This reflects the fact that the exceptional payments 
contributing to the deficit 
reduction in 2005 will 
vanish in 2006 and that tax cuts are already planned 
for that year (0.2% of GDP). This projection is based 
on the assumption that real government expenditures 

will increase by about 2% in real terms, compared 
with a projection of 1.2% in the latest update of the 
stability programme. The risk
s to the government 
deficit forecast for 2006 are skewed to the upside.

Forecast
The economy in 2004 
Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5.4% in 
2004, representing a significant pick
 up on the 
previous year (3.7%), w
ith most of the apparent 
acceleration coming from higher net exports. On the 
domestic side, overall expend
iture grew at a similar 
rate to the previous y
ear. While consumer demand 
remained relatively muted by past standards (with 
growth estimated at just below 3% on the year), 
investment was stronger. In
 particular, residential 
building contributed sign
ificantly to overall growth, 
although the activ
ity in this segment moderated 
somewhat in the third 
quarter. On the external side, 
figures for the first three quarters suggest a somewhat 
weaker than previously expected performance of 
merchandise exports, though performance of services 
offset this somewhat. However, imports are estimated 
to have grown well below exp
ectations, resulting in a 
significantly stronger contri
bution from net exports as 
compared to 2003. Indicators for the fourth quarter of 
2004 suggest some easing of sentiment in 
construction and industry. 
On the other hand, the 
latest purchasing manager™s 
indices for services point 
to increased activity in recent months.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
GDP is projected to grow by 4.9% and 5.1% in 2005 
and 2006 respectively, in lin
e with estimated medium-
term potential. On the domestic side, private 
consumption is supported in
to 2005 by healthy 
employment growth and, in line with recent evidence, 
also by somewhat stronger consumer confidence. In 
2006, private spending 
will revive somewhat further, 
benefiting from a modest fa
ll in the savings rate as 
some Special Savings Incentive Accounts 
(SSIAs)reach maturity. By contrast, the contribution from 

public consumption should re
main modest in view of 
further spending restraint. Also the growth of fixed 
investment should moderate over the projection 

period. Some easing 
in construction activity is 
foreseen, mainly as housing 
output is expected to 
taper off somewhat after reaching record levels in 
2004. However, a pick-up in investment in equipment 
and non-residential construction over the forecast 
horizon, supported by acceleration in public capital 

expenditure and continued inward foreign investment 
(FDI), is likely to offset this to
 some extent. On the 
external side, trends in
 oil prices, international 
economic activity and the euro
/dollar exchange rate 
are the key medium-term risks for the Irish economy. 
Building on the momentum 
regained in 2004, service 
exports are expected to sustain more dynamic growth 
rates over the forecast period. As net profit outflows 
are projected to remain on their recent upward trend, 
the projected growth rate of GNI is somewhat lower 
than that of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
In 2004 employment is estimated to have grown by a 
remarkable 3.0%. However, in view of a gradual 
easing back of construction output and the cap on 
public sector employment, em
ployment gains will be 
somewhat weaker in 2005 and 2006. Nevertheless, 
with a similar rate of exp
ansion proj
ected for the 
labour force, unemployment is estimated to remain at 

around 4½% over the forecast period, implying still 
fairly tight labour market conditions. Data for the first 
three quarters of 2004 suggest a slight acceleration in 

per capita compensation, now estimated to have 
grown just above 5½% in 2004, reflecting the 
relatively tight labour market conditions. However, 

some easing of wage growth is projected in view of 
the moderate pay provisions in the second half of the 
national agreement ﬁSustai
ning Progressﬂ and a lower 
contribution from benchmarking pay awards to public 
sector employees (i.e. the alignment of public sector 
wages with the private sector equivalent). HICP 
inflation averaged 2.3% in 2004, down from 4.0% in 
2003. With downward pressures stemming from a 

stronger currency and no changes in the main indirect 
taxes, the annual rate is projected to moderate further 
in 2005. However, as private spending revives into 

2006, HICP inflation is expected to rise gradually, to

just below 2½% by the end of 2006. CPI inflation is 
expected to be slightly above that of the HICP over 
the forecast period.  
Public finances 
For 2004, the general gov
ernment surplus was 1.3% 
of GDP. This favourable outtu
rn is due to higher-
than-expected tax receipts and also lower-than-
budgeted expenditures, especially on public 

investment. For 2005 the main measures on the 
revenue side of the budget include an upward 
adjustment of the standard tax band for personal 

income and some relief th
rough changes in stamp 
duty. The expenditure side includes significant 
increases in both current and capital spending. The 

general government position is
 thus expected to turn 
into a deficit of 0.6
% of GDP. Nevertheless, there are 
some risks to this projection. In particular, no 

allowance is made for the as yet unclear implications 
for public finances of a recent court ruling on nursing 
home payments. On the other hand, there are also 
some risks that the general government deficit might 
turn out lower that project
ed, including stronger-than-
expected receipts from special Revenue 
Commissioners investigations in 2005 and some 
under-spending in cap
ital outlays. The deficit is 
projected at 0.6% of GDP 
in 2006. Given the non-
indexed nature of the tax and social benefit system, 
the no-policy change assumption is made operational 
for 2006 by freezing average tax rates and adjusting 
social transfer payments by the forecast of CPI 
inflation (with a small top-up). Government debt is 

projected to stabilise just below 30% of GDP.

The situation in 2004  
Following two years of near stagnation, reflecting 
both a cyclical slowdown in the euro-area and 
structural problems specific to Italy, economic growth 

accelerated somewhat in 2004 reaching an average 
rate of 1.2%. In spite of the improvement, the 
recovery shows at least three weak spots. First, it only 

gained ground when th
e global cycle is losing some 
momentum. Second, the driving forces of economic 
growth proved unsteady. In particular, the healthy 

performance of domestic demand in the first quarter 
of the year was followed by a marked and unexpected 
frailty later on offset by a temporary revival of 

exports of goods and
 services at around mid-year. 
Third, quarterly GDP growth turned unexpectedly 
negative in the final quarter of the year.  
Head-count employment, wh
ich had held up well 
during the previous 
years of feeble economic growth, slowed in 2004 reflecting several factors including the 
traditional lag to economic 
activity, a cut in 
employment subsidies and the petering out of the 
level effect of past labour market reforms. On the 
back of the stro
ng euro and a tem
porary drop in oil 
prices, consumer price inflation eventually embarked 
on a downward trend towards year-end, closing the 

gap vis-à-vis the euro-area average. In the year as a 
whole HICP inflation was 2.3%. 
Prospects in 2005 and 2006  Against the background of a still buoyant yet 
somewhat cooling in
ternational economic 
environment, the Italian economy is expected to 
rebound from the negative performance recorded at 
the end of 2004 and to move along an upward path 
throughout 2005 and 2006. However, growth is 
expected to remain moderate, reflecting both the 

persistence of structural rigidities and temporary 
factors such as high oil pri
ces. Real GDP growth is 
forecast to stay at 1.2% in 2005 before edging up to 

1.7% the year after. As a result, Italy would continue 
to lag behind the euro average. 
In spite of the volatility exh
ibited in the recent past, a 
number of favourable fundam
entals suggests that economic growth will mainly be driven by domestic 
demand. In particular, private consumption is likely to 
steady and strengthen again in
 view of ongoing job 
creation and rising real di
sposable income. A more 
robust performance of the largest domestic demand 
component is likely to be 
hampered by the uncertainty 
surrounding the future cour
se of fiscal policy in the 
light of the current bu
dgetary imbalances in 
combination with the still very high government debt-

to-GDP ratio. Gross fixed 
capital formation is also 
expected to contribute to 
economic growth helped by 
low real interest rates, rising prof
it margins and, more 
generally, the gradually improving growth outlook. A 
further extension to the end of 2005 of a fiscal 

incentive for renovating
 private dwellings is expected 
to continue supporting investment in 
construction.  
Following the pattern of the past several years, the 
unfavourable product speci
alisation towards low-
growth goods coupled with a loss of cost 
competitiveness hinders Italy to 
fully benefit from the 
still robust expansion of worl
d trade. Hence, despite a 
recovery of foreign sales, th
e external side is 
projected to continu
e weighing on overall GDP 
61Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 Italy 
growth throughout the forecast period. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
The moderate economic recovery is expected to go 
along with ongoing j
ob creation over the entire 
forecast horizon also reflecting the positive 

adjustment effects from 
the successive steps of labour 
market reform implemented since the mid-1990s. 
However, the job content 
of growth is likely to 
decline from the exceptionally high level observed 
over the past several years. The main contribution to 
overall employment growth will continue to come 

from services. As a result of 
the positive performance 
of the labour market, the rate of unemployment is 
expected to continue its downward trend. 
To the extent that over the past several years fiscal 
incentives have con
tributed to resilient employment 
growth in the South 
of the country, the cuts 
implemented in the 2004 budget are likely to affect 

the convergence process. Hopes are now pinned to the 
possibility to increase the still low degree of wage 
differentiation to account for differences in 
productivity. Discussions about ways of reforming the 
current system of wage bargain
ing are still ongoing. 
Recent wage negotiations have led to an acceleration 
of country-wide contractual wages, which for the first 
time in more than 
four years increased more than 
inflation. With around half 
of the wage contracts due 
to be renegotiated in 
2005 these developments 
represent a challenging point 
of departure. On the 
other hand, as the outlook for inflation seems benign 
over the forecast horizon Œ both consumers and firms 
expect a slowdown in the coming months Œ the 

upcoming wage agreements are forecast not to 
permanently fuel wage inflation.  
Concerning the response of inflation to wage 
developments, the projected economic recovery will 

dampen unit labour costs in 
2006. In addition, the 
closing but still negative 
output gap will also be 
conducive to lower inflation. Overall, the annual 

increase in HICP inflation is forecast to gradually 
decline below 2 percent over the forecast horizon. 
Public finances 
The first reporting by 
the Italian authorities of 
government deficit and debt levels for 2005 included 
significant upward revisi
ons of the deficit-to-GDP 
ratio in 2001-2003 in the order of 0.4 of a percentage 
point on average. The 2004 deficit is reported at 3% 
of GDP
i, one decimal point of GDP higher than in 
2003. With interest expenditure 
declining by 0.3% of 
GDP, the drop in the primar
y surplus was even more 
severe: it fell at 2% of GDP, the lowest level since 
1992. In cyclically adjusted terms, the general 

government deficit improved by 0.2 of a percentage 
point of GDP. The primary surplus worsened of one 
decimal point of GDP. Nevertheless, one-offs 

continued to improve the 2004 deficit by around 1½ 
percentage points of GDP, do
wn from around 2% in 
2003. The government debt ratio declined to 105.8% of 
GDP in 2004 from 106.3% in 2003. Debt increasing 
below-the-line operations continued to hamper a 
faster reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The 

negative impact of these operations more than offset 
the positive effect from the 
privatisation of 20% of the formerly state-owned electricity company, ENEL, in 

October, which raised 0.5% of GDP. 
In 2005, in the absence 
of additional measures, the 
general government deficit is forecast to increase to 
3.6% of GDP
ii. Although interest expenditures are 
likely to continue dimin
ishing relative to GDP, the 
primary surplus is expected to further drop to around 

1.3% of GDP. Net of cycli
cal factors, both the deficit 
and the primary balance are projected to worsen by 
around ½ of a percentage point of GDP. However, the 

impact of temporary measures is expected to decline 
to ¾ of a percentage point of GDP. 
The Commission services forecast is significantly 
above the official deficit target of 2.7% of GDP for a 

number of reasons. First, as in its 2004 autumn 
forecast, the Commission services assume that ANAS, 
the joint-stock compan
y in charge of the state road 
network, continues to be part of the general 
government sector, whereas in the government figures 
it is classified as a market company. Second, the 
forecast has a more prudent assessment of some 
measures included in the 2005
 budget. Compared to 
the original draft underpinning the Commission 
services 2004 autumn fo
recast, the 2005 budget 
approved by Parliament in December includes further 

expenditures and tax cuts. The planned financing of 
these additional measures is assessed to fall short of 
the officially estimated effect. This particularly 

concerns (i) part of the savings expected from local 
governments, (ii) the im
plementation of the revised

scheme to increase the tax base of self-employed 
people (studi di settore
) and (iii) expenditure cuts 
introduced on top of the already very ambitious 2% 

cap on the annual nominal increase foreseen in the 
original version of the budget. Then, the Commission 
services scenario assumes an increase in real GDP of 

1.2%, as compared to 2.1% 
in the latest available 
official projection, and takes into account that the 
2004 deficit turned out sl
ightly higher than the targeted 2.9% of GDP. Furthermore, the budgetary 
position in 2005 could
 be affected by pending 
renewals of public wage agre
ements and receipts from 
real estate disposals that could be lower than the 
officially estimated 0.5% of GDP, to which the 
Commission forecast is aligned. 
The forecast for 2006 of a deficit of 4.6% of GDP 
reflects the expiry of one-off measures, and is based 
on legislation currently in force. The debt ratio is

ally in 2005 and to increase 
in 2006, to return to th

indications of the 2004 
updated stability programme, 
privatisation receipts of around 
2 percentage points of 
GDP per year are projected to be entirely offset by 

debt increasing below-the-l

deficit, the debt forecast for 2006 is based on 
legislation currently in force.                                                           
iEurostat did not validate the deficit figures for Italy notably 
because of the recording of payments by 'concessionari d'imposta', 
of a securitisation operation, of transactions with the EU budget, of 

the classification of government-owned entities, inconsistencies 
between cash and accrual data and large statistical discrepancies. 
The clarification of these issues may lead to an upward revision in 

the deficit figures, notably for 2003 and 2004.

The economy in 2004 
Following a pick-up of econo
mic activity in the 2
ndhalf of 2003, GDP growth strengthened further in 
2004, reaching 3.7% for the year. The recovery was 

driven by domestic demand growth, especially in 
private consumption and investment in construction 
and machinery. Governmen
t consumption dropped in 
real terms. Private consumption growth rebounded to 
6.1%, in line with the increase in disposable income 
and was further stimulated, 
inter alia, by restrained 
demand for consumer durable goods in previous years 
and certain elements of the 
tax reform including the 
lowering of excise duties on cars. After a decline in 

2003, investment also picked
 up strongly with an 
estimated increase of more than 9%, reflecting 
improved profitability and more positive investor 

expectations. Therefore, the interest rate hike on April 
30, related to political uncertainties regarding the 
reunification process as well as the final stage of 

liberalisation of capital movement restrictions at the 
date of EU accession, did not seem to have negatively 
affected private domestic demand. Fiscal 
consolidation led to a st
rong decline in government 
consumption which contri
buted to a marked reduction 
in the general government deficit.  
Net external demand contributed negatively to 
growth. After declining in the previous two years, 
exports of goods and services in 2004 staged a modest 

recovery. Tourism arrivals increased by 2%, the first 
positive growth since 2001
 but still below historical 
growth rates. However, im
ports surged, especially of cars, as a result of the expansion in domestic demand 
and lower excise duties on cars. Together with rising 
oil prises, these factors led to a significant widening 
of the current account deficit to an estimated 5.7% of 
GDP. Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
The outlook for this year and 2006 is for some further 
strengthening of GDP growth
 to around 4%. This is 
mainly domestic-demand led, linked to continued 
strong private sector in
vestment and consumption 
growth in an environment of improving investor and 
consumer confidence. Consumption growth is 
supported by rises in disposable income as real wages 

increase in line with productivity development in 
near-full employment 
conditions. An increased 
competitive environment following EU accession and 

positive investment conditions provided by 
liberalisation in financial and utilities markets and the 
positive outlook on further fiscal consolidation are 

expected to continue to s
timulate further investment 
expansion.  At the same time
, the growth contribution 
from external demand is expected
 to turn positive for 
both years. Mainly based on the moderately positive 
EU growth outlook, the 
forecast projects a continuing 
modest recovery in export 
growth in 2005-2006, in 
tourism and even more 
in non-tourist services. As 
one-off demand factors fade out, import growth is 

expected to slow in 2005
 and then pick up with 
domestic demand growth in 
2006. All in all, the 
forecast projects a concomitant modest decline in the 

current account deficit to belo
w 5% of GDP for this 
year and 4.5% of GDP in 2006. However, projected 
trade developments, especially in tourism and oil 

prices, remain fraught with uncertainty. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Unemployment rose somewhat to 5% in 2004 but is 
expected to inch downward as growth picks up 
further. The (limited) border opening with the Turkish 

Cypriot (T/C) community has led to an increase of the 
share of daily commu
ting T/C workers in total 
employed labour to about 1%. The contribution of 

foreign workers on the on
e hand and wage moderation 
in the public secto
r on the other seem to exercise a 
moderating pressure on wages, which are expected to 
increase  between 1.5 and 2% in real terms in 2005 
and 2006, below expected productivity growth. 

Inflation fell back to 1.9% in
 2004 after peaking at 
4% in 2003 when it was pushed up by increases in 
VAT rates and excise duties.

possible oil price rises, 
inflationary pressures are 
expected to remain relativ
ely subdued with inflation 
projected to slightly increase to 2.3% in 2005 and then 

move back toward 2% by
 2006. Monetary conditions 
appear stable with a slight restrictive bias, which 
helps to keep the exchange 
rate steady vis-à-vis the 
euro. In the con
text of moderate inflation pressures 
and ongoing fiscal consolidati
on, interest rates were 
lowered by 25 basis points in February 2005. 
Public finances 
The 2004 deficit is estimated 
to have declined to 4.2% 
of GDP, down from 6.3% of GDP in 2003. This 
distinctly better-than-expected 
positive outcome is 
attributed to the successful impact of fiscal 

consolidation measures both on the expenditure and 
revenue side, despite negative revenue effects linked 
to delays in the introducti
on of some measures 
initially planned for 2004 a
nd which are now to be 
implemented in 2005. Reven
ues were also supported 
by a more domestic-demand based growth 
composition, leading to extra tax revenues. This 

outturn for 2004, together with the recent successful 
negotiations with social partners on a number of key 
planned consolidation 
measures and the ongoing 
implementation of other m
easures planned for 2005, 
provide the basis for a further projected deficit decline 
to just below 3% of GDP 
in 2005. The projected 
deficit of 1.9% of GDP for 2006 is marginally above 
the Cyprus updated convergence programme target, 
which is mainly linked to the slightly lower forecast 

GDP growth projection for 2006.

Forecast
Recent developments in activity 
In 2004, GDP growth is estimated at a remarkably 
high 8.5% (7.5% in 
2003). Gross fixed capital 
formation and private consumption have been the 

driving factors for growth. Strong private 
consumption was supported by increased bank 
lending and, to a much lesser extent, by employment 

and real income growth. Gr
oss fixed capital formation 
was particularly buoyant as a result of favourable 
credit conditions, the inflow of the EU funds and 

reinforced macroeconomic stability. The fastest 
growing sectors were construc
tion and transport and 
communications. Industrial output grew at a more 

modest pace. Export values grew by close to 20 
percent, however, not sufficien
t to outpace imports, 
which grew by around 25 percent. Thus, the already 

large external deficit 
widened even 
further, resulting 
in a sizeable negative growth contribution. Imports 
were buoyed by input growth
 broadly in line with 
final demand as well as the unexpectedly strong 
stockbuilding observed just before EU accession. 
Prospects for 2004-2006 
Growth prospects for 2005-2006 are strong with an 
expected expansion of about 7% in both years. Final 
domestic demand is expected to continue to drive 
growth, primarily led by 
investment, with housing 
construction increasing
 strongly. Private 
consumption 
is also expected to remain strong largely because of 
better credit access and modest increases in real 

disposable income. The recovery of the EU economy 
and positive externalities of Latvia™s accession to the 
EU will keep export growth strong. Nevertheless, 
import growth is expected to 
remain robust due to the 
increase of investment and intermediate goods. 
Although import growth is projected to slow 

somewhat in 2005, narro
wing the trade deficit, the 
negative net contribution to GDP growth from trade 
will remain considerable in 
both 2005 and 2006. Given the net export performance, the current account 
deficit increased to 12.4% of GD
P in 2004. The 
worsening of the trad
e balance was only partly compensated by weaker-than-expected surpluses on 

the services account. In 2005, it is expected that some 
of the accumulated stocks 
will substitute part of the 
imports, so that th
e current account deficit will decrease, but is expected to remain roughly at the 
same level afterwards. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
High growth has contr
ibuted to lowering the 
unemployment rate, though upward pressure on 

unemployment from enterprise and rural restructuring 
is expected to persist. In 
spite of a strong growth 
performance, and sizeable employment gains since 
2001, the unemployment rate thus remains at just 
below 10% of the labour force and is forecast to drop 

only slightly in the medium term. Moderate 
employment gains of around ½% per year over the 
forecast period will contribute to the decline, although 

considerable regional development disparities will 
hold back a faster improvement in labour market 
conditions. Inflation rose sharply in 2
004. The pick-
up in prices 
has been reflected in all inflation indices, with that for 
producer prices outpacing consumer prices since the 
middle of the year. For 2
004 inflation reached 6.2%, 
up from 2.9% in 2003. The inflation increase in 2004 
is largely accounted for by one-off events, such as EU 
entry-related tax and 
price adjustments, and a 
significant deprecia
tion of the lats vis-à-vis the euro at 
the end of 2003. It was also due to higher regulated 
prices for gas, heating and rent as well as to a sharp 

rise in healthcare costs. The 
main risk to the inflation 
outlook is that price increases could become persistent 
if strong demand continues to drive output above 
potential and feeds into in
flation expectations. Taking 
this into account, inflation is expected to average 

5.0% in 2005 and to 
fall back to 3.6% in 2006.

Public finances 
The general government deficit in 2004 decreased to 
0.8% of GDP largely due to betterŒthan-expected tax 
revenues
i. For the forecast period good economic 
prospects, with average annual growth around 7% 
forecast in 2005-2006, should have a positive impact 
on tax receipts. Moreover, a broadening of the indirect 

tax base should outweigh the narrowing of the 
personal income tax base due
 to increase in the 
personal income tax-free threshold and tax rebates for 

dependents in force sin
ce January 2005. The 2005 
budget law indicates a shift towards a more 
expansionary fiscal policy consistent with the 

frontloading of the implementation of EU-funds-
related projects. Given the commitment of 
expenditures budgeted on 
support from EU funding, 
the achievement of the de
ficit targets is conditional on 
the receipt of such funds in government revenues. The 
associated risks of expenditure overruns stem from 
the strain that project management puts on 

administrative capacity. All together, the deficit is 
expected to remain at around 1.5% of GDP in 2005-
2006.

payments to the EU budget, which may lead to a downward 
revision in the government deficit for 2004.

Forecast
Recent developments 
Real output growth remained 
robust in 2004, although 
the pace of expansion slackened. After growing at 
9.7% in 2003, GDP is estima
ted to have increased by 
6.7% in 2004. As in previous years, domestic demand 
expanded more rapidly than GDP and continued to be 
the major driver for growth, fuelled by particularly 

strong investment and 
private consumption.  
The contribution of net trad
e to growth deteriorated 
further in 2004. The main factor was a significant 
widening of the visible trade balance, induced by a 

surging demand for consum
er and investment goods. 
Preliminary estimations set the current account deficit 
at about 8.3% of GDP in
 2004. Foreign direct 
investment is estimated to
 have increased significantly 
in 2004 and contributed to finance a significant share 
of the deficit (above 4% of GDP). 
Following a deflationary 
period of nearly two years, 
prices started edging up in 
May 2004. This mostly 
reflected rising oil, food, transport and health-care 
prices, some of which were driven by tax alignments 
due to EU accession. Annual average inflation 
measured by the HICP index s
tood at 1.1% in 2004. 
Inflation accelerated further in the first two months of 
2005, reaching 3.3% in 
February year-on-year, largely driven by increases in en
ergy and tr
ansport prices. Evidence on recent labour market developments has 
been mixed. On the one hand, the unemployment rate 
is estimated to have declined further in 2004. On the 
other hand, employment 
growth, which had been 
notably strong in the prev
ious two years, is estimated 
to have been negative in 2004. Emigration seems to 
be contributing to the 
fall in unemployment, while 
labour shortages in some sectors and the structural 
nature of unemployment 
remain as a matter of 
concern. 
Growth prospects  
The forecast for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 is 
broadly unchanged, respectively at 6.4% and 5.9%. 
Gross fixed capital 
formation is exp
ected to continue 
as the major driving force, remaining well above GDP 
growth. Investment is foreseen 
to be sustained by low 
interest rates, high credit growth 
and a higher capacity 
to absorb EU investment 
grants. Private consumption 
is also foreseen to 
remain robust, although 
progressively slowing down from
 the high level of the 
previous two years, partly due to an anticipated 
moderation of the present credit growth dynamics. 
Public consumption growth is 
estimated to peak in 
2005 and slow down signif
icantly in 2006, in line 
with the government™s fiscal 
consolidation plans.    
Following a marked de
terioration in 2004, the 
contribution of net exports 
to growth is expected to 
remain negative during 2005-2006, although export 
growth is expected to accelerate to above 7%. Import 

growth is foreseen to offset 
that of exports in 2005, 
led by robust demand of consumer and investment 
goods. The current account deficit is expected to 
widen in 2005 and start 
a gradual improvement in 
2006, when it is foreseen to reach 8.5% of GDP. 
Labour market, costs and prices  
Unemployment is expected to continue declining over 
the forecast horizon, although the private sector™s 

capacity to meet increasing do
mestic demand through 
additional hiring is foreseen
 to weaken somewhat, as 
skill mismatches are becoming more evident. 

Employment growth is expected to become positive in 
2005-2006. Emigration and labour shortages in some 
segments of the labour ma
rket are likely to put some 
pressure on wages, while la
bour productivity growth 
is expected to remain relatively hi
gh, contributing to 
partly temper the impact of higher wages on unit 

labour costs.  
HICP average inflation is expected to increase further 
to 2.9% in 2005 and decelerate somewhat in 2006. 

Inflation is likely to be driv
en by price increases in the 
administered and transport sectors and by higher wage 
inflation. Risks to th
e inflation projections are on the

expectations. The behaviour of import prices, 
particularly oil prices, appears to be a major risk. 
Public finances 
The general government defic
it is estimated to have 
increased from 1.9% of GDP in 2003 to 2.5% in 

2004
i. The main factors contributing to the deficit 
deterioration compared to 2003 relate to increases in 
public investment, salary increases in the public 

sector, welfare benefits, and real estate restitutions.  
The deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease 
marginally in 2005, 
declining further to 
1.9% in 2006. 
Revenue growth is expected to
 remain strong over the 
forecast period. Tax revenues, particularly income and 
wealth taxes and social contributions, are foreseen to 
increase significantly on the back of
 strong growth 
and higher employment, and 
also induced by rising 
wages and corporate profits. A sizeable increase in 
EU transfers will lead to a rise 
in non-tax revenues. 
Government expenditure is expected to rise 
significantly in 2005, led 
by increases in capital 
expenditure, subsidies, sal
ary increases in the 
education and healthcare sectors and the cost of the 
pension reform. Strong revenue growth and lower 
growth of current expenditure are expected to lead to 

an improvement of the deficit in 2006. 
                                                          
iEurostat™s forthcoming decision on the restitution of confiscated 
property and compensation for lost savings could lead to a 
downward revision in the government deficit for 2004 and earlier 
years.

Forecast
The situation in 2004 
In 2004, GDP continued to grow faster in 
Luxembourg than in neighbo
uring countries, which 
also had been observed during the latest slowdown. 

According to a preliminary 
estimate, growth reached 
4.2% in 2004. 
Activity was especially buoyant in industry with 
production rising by near
ly 6% and the steel sector 
recording exceptional growth rates, though a 
slowdown was observed in the seco
nd half of the 
year. Activity in construction slightly declined but 

only because civil engineering suffered from the 
slowdown in government investment, while in the rest 
of the sector it increased by about 3½%. Trade 

performed well, even if 
retail trade was somewhat 
subdued, reflecting rather weak growth in private 
consumption. Transport, especially air transport, 

clearly recovered from its slo
wdown. Finally, in the 
financial sector, activity gr
ew strongly although   
profits stagnated because the decline in the interest 

margin compensated for the 
good results of financial 
markets transactions. 
Private consumption was rather subdued in recent 
years since the positive 
effects of the 2001-2002 tax 
cuts had faded away. It remained relatively weak in 
2004, growing only by 1.8%
. Investment
, which had 
fallen, mostly for incidental reasons, by more than 6% 
in 2003, rose by a similar pe
rcentage in 2004. Both 
exports and imports, which had risen by only a 

modest 1½Œ2% in real terms in 2003, recovered in 
2004, growing by abou
t 6% in both cases.    
Employment growth follo
wed the slowdown in output 
with a two-year lag, slowing from a peak of 5.7% in 
2001 to 1.8% in 2003, and accelerating again to 2.4% 

in 2004. However, as in 
previous years, the lion™s share of new jobs went to cross-border workers, 
whose number rose by 4.7%, while national 

employment only increased by 1.3%. This rise in 
residents™ employment was not 
sufficient to prevent 
unemployment from increasing to 4.2% of the active 

population from 3.8% in 2003. 
Consumer price inflation, as measured by the Eurostat 
harmonised index, significantly accelerated from 
2.5% in 2003 to 3.2% 
in 2004. However, this 
relatively high inflation rate is in large part due to the 
rise in oil prices and the increase in taxes on tobacco: 
the rise in the national CPI, which excludes 

consumption by non-resident
s and especially their 
large purchases of car fuel and tobacco products, was 
significantly slower, 2.2% in 2004 as against 2.0% in 

2003. Moreover, underlying inflation significantly 
decelerated during the year.      
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Real GDP growth is expected to
 slow down slightly in 2005 before re-accelerating in 2006, though it should 
remain in the region of 4% throughout the forecast 
period. Private consumption should accelerate 

together with employment 
(even if the largest share of 
jobs created is once again expected
 to go to non-
residents). This should more than compensate for the 

expected slowdown in wages. Investment should 
remain dynamic.  The rise in exports markets is 
expected to slightly decelerate over the period. 

Simultaneously, wage increases will probably slow 
down somewhat in line with
 domestic inflation. As a 
result, export growth should decelerate only modestly 

and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth 
should remain widely positive.  
Employment growth is forecast to accelerate, 
reflecting output growth in recent years, and to reach 

about 3% at the end of the period (which is not 
exceptionally high by Luxembourg™s standards). As in 
previous years, the bulk of 
job creation should go to 
non-residents but the rise in 
national employment will 
progressively accelerate too, so that unemployment 

should peak in 2005 and begi
n to decrease slightly in 
2006. 70Chapter 3 Member States, Luxembourg

Inflation is projected to
 progressively diminish over 
the period, in line with th
e expected decrease in oil 
prices and the absence of significant internal 

inflationary pressures. The share of oil products being 
significantly higher in th
e harmonised index than in 
the national index, the slowdown in the former should 

also be more marked.
Public finances 
After a sharp decline in the general government 
surplus from a record 6.2% of
 GDP in 2000 and 2001 
to 0.5% in 2003, a 1.1% of GDP deficit was recorded 

in 2004 (compared to a 1.4% deficit projected by the 
authorities in their upd
ated stability programme). As 
expected, tax revenues significantly exceeded 

projections but, at the same time, investment 
expenditure was revised upwards in order to take into 
account some big projects based on a public-private 

partnership that had not been previously recorded in 
the government sector. The latter pushed up public 
spending figures by about half a percentage point of 
GDP. Reflecting the relatively strong gro
wth in output and 
employment, government revenues should remain 

buoyant, rising by
 about 6% in both years, compared 
to 4% in 2003 and 5% in 2004. However, government 
spending, though decelerating, is still projected to rise 

by about 7% a year in 2005 and 2006 As a result, the 
deficit would progressively widen to about 1½% of 
GDP in 2005 and 2% in
 2006. The pub
lic debt, which was also revised upwards, for the same reason as 
government investment, fro
m 5.7% to 7.5% of GDP 
in 2004, should slightly rise to ab
out 8% in 2006.

Hungary - HICP 
The situation in 2004  
GDP continued to grow vi
gorously in the second half 
of 2004, resulting in an annual growth rate of 4%. 
Growth became more balanced: private consumption 

growth more than halved due to a significant decrease 
in net disposable income, while investment and 
exports rose strongly and 
the contribution of the 
external sector to GDP growth became positive.  
Following three years of strong real wage increases, 
averaging more than 10% per year, wage growth 
decelerated in 2004, mainly due to a significant real 

wage decrease in the public sector. After consumer 
price inflation rose to around 7% in the first half of 
2004, largely owing to tax and price adjustments, it 

started to fall again in the second half of the year. This 
was supported by the strong value of the forint, as 
well as lower food and o
il prices. Against the 
background of an improving inflation outlook, the 
central bank cut its policy rat
es by 200 basis points in 
the course of 2004. 
The increase in unemployment accelerated from mid-
2004 and reached a yearly average of around 6%. 
Despite the slowdown of consumption growth, the 

current account deficit is estimated to have remained 
close to 9% of GDP in 2004, increasingly financed by 
non-debt-creating inflows. Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
GDP growth is projected to 
remain solid in the 
forecast period, with export and investment growth 
decelerating only slowly. Given the moderate increase 
of real disposable income in 2004 and the expected 
continuation of this 
trend until 2006, private 
consumption is projected to slow down further in 

2005 to about 3% and to remain 
at this level in 2006.  
Investment growth is forecast to remain robust but to 
ease somewhat in 2005 when the tightening of 
subsidies for housing loans 
dating back to the end of 
2003 is expected to have 
its full impact on 
construction. The envisaged sharp decline in public 
investment in 2005 (by 1.5 percentage point of GDP) 

is intended to be largely replaced by public-private 
partnership projects (mainly 
highway construction).  A further improvement in the trade balance Œ based 
on the expectation that import growth will react more 

strongly to the softening of domestic demand than in 
2004
1 Œ and some fiscal tightening should contribute 
to a moderate narrowing of the current account deficit 

to 7% of GDP by 2006. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment which dropp
ed by 0.5% in 2004, is 
expected to grow by 0.5% in 
2005 and 0.9% in 2006, 
leading to a small deceleration in productivity. 
Nevertheless, the unemploy
ment rate is projected to 
slightly increase to 6.2% in 20
06 (Eurostat definition) 
because of a stronger rise in the total labour force.   
Year-on-year inflation is expected to decelerate 
sharply in the first half of 2005, also supported by a 
decline in inflation expectations. Consumer price 

inflation should fall below an annual average of 4% in 
2005 and declin
e slightly more in 
2006. Accordingly, a further reduction in short-term interest rates can be 

expected in the forecasting period. 
Public finances 
The Hungarian authorities decided to avail themselves 
of the possibility of the temporary reclassification of 
second pillar pension fund
s inside the general 
government as permitted 
by Eurostat until the March 
2007 fiscal notification (decision of 23 September 
2004). This forecast therefore uses the official 

reclassified figures which reduce the general 
                                                          
1Due to an accounting modification, re-invested earnings are 
included both in the income account of the current account and in 
the FDI account of the capital account since April 2004. The 

revision increases the deficit by about 3 percentage points.

government deficit by 0.9, 1.1 and 1.2 percentage 
points of GDP in 2004, 
2005 and 200
6, respectively.  
According to data notified
 by the Hungarian 
authorities, the deficit was reduced to 4.5% of GDP in 
2004, by 1.7 percentage po
int of GDP below the 2003 
outturn. This largely reflects the methodological 
change of accounting VAT refunds, increasing the 

2003 deficit by 0.7 percentage point of GDP and 
reducing the 2004 deficit accordingly, which might 
however be subject to
 further revision. 
Regarding the 2005 de
ficit, while there are some 
positive trends in view of 
lower-than-expected interest 
rates, the impact of the freezing of carried-over 
appropriations from 2004 to 2005, and an improved 

outlook for corporate taxes, there are also increased 
risks in some areas. Notably VAT revenues and the 
budgetary impact of the intended public-private-

partnership projects are subject to uncertainty. 
Following the renewed recommendation of the Ecofin 
Council to Hungary un
der the Excessive Deficit 
Procedure on 8 March, the Government has increased 
from 0.5 to 0.8 percentage point of GDP its 

ﬁemergencyﬂ reserve package against a possible 
missing of the 2005 target, and identified some 
limited further revenues. Although this has been 

largely taken into consid
eration, risks of possible 
slippages remain. For 20
06 an increase in public 
investment is expected, 
which is however not 
compensated by expenditure-improving effects of the 
measures contained in the 2005 budget, especially 
since they were not backed by comprehensive 

reforms. Hence, the deficit is expected to rise again to 
4.1% of GDP in 2006, from 3.9% of GDP in 2005, 
based on the usual no-policy change assumption.

Economic developments in 2004 
After falling in real terms by 1.8% in 2003, GDP 
growth turned positive to 
1.5% in 2004. Private 
consumption decelerated to 1% in 2004 (from 2% in 

2003), reflecting lower disposa
ble income. This was 
mainly the result of an 
increase in taxes when wage 
growth remained barely changed. On the other hand 

ongoing fiscal consolidation led public consumption 
to further slow down to a meagre 0.6%. Gross fixed 
capital formation growth fell sh
arply to 5.3% from 
34% in 2003, although th
is is attributable to a base 
effect caused by a one-off operation registered as a 
negative investment in 2002.  
Exports of goods and servi
ces briskly recovered to 
+2.5% in 2004 from Œ3.8% in 2003, mirroring 
stronger world demand fo
r semiconductors and the 
improvement in the to
urist sector. Import growth 
halved to 3.5% due to an unforeseen deceleration in 
imports of goods. However, the terms of trade 
deteriorated notably, worseni
ng the external balance of goods and services to a 
nominal deficit of 7.7% of 
GDP (from 5.5% of GDP in 
2003). Accordingly, the 
contribution to GDP growth 
from domestic demand 
fell markedly to 1.9 pp (7 
pp in the previous year). In 
contrast, the foreign sector 
contribution improved, as 
compared with the previou
s year, detracting only 1.2 
pp to output (-1
0.2 pp in 2003). 
Employment increased by 1.4%, after a fall in the 
previous year, due to the completion of industrial 

restructuring.  
The HICP inflation stood at 2.7%, significantly below 
the figure projected in the previous forecast. This is 
explained by increased
 competition stemming from 
import liberalization in a context of flimsy internal 
demand. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006
Real GDP is expected to accelerate to 1.7% in 2005. 
For 2006, GDP growth rate is forecast to attain 1.9%. 
Supported by a recovery 
of employment, private 
consumption is projected to grow by 1% in 2005, 

barely changed from the previous year, while it 
should accelerate to 1.5% in 2006. The ongoing fiscal 
consolidation programme is lik
ely to keep growth of 
public consumption is rat
her flat over the forecast 
period. The gradual comple
tion of some important 
public investment projects, which should boost gross 

fixed capital formation to 6.6% in 2005, would lower 
investment growth to 1.9% in 2006.  
Exports are foreseen to gain momentum, pulled up by 
stronger demand for semi
conductors, growing by 
3.3% in 2005 and 200
6. Conversely, imports are 
expected to loose some pace, as the completion of the 
above-mentioned investment project is progressively 
achieved.  
All in all, domestic demand is likely to contribute to 
2.1 pp to growth in 2005 (1.5 pp in 2006), while the 

contribution from the external sector is projected to 
remain slightly negative, de
ducting 0.2 pp to growth 
in 2005. This sh
ould reverse in 
2006, when the 
external sector would add 
0.5 pp to GDP growth. 
The external current account deficit is projected to 
remain close to 10% of GDP over the forecast period. 
An across-the-board deter
ioration in the main sub-
accounts of the Balance of Payments already started 
in 2004, which 
brought about a decline in reserve 
assets of 3.7% of GDP. Thi
s deterioration stems 
mainly from a worsening 
of the trade balance, whose 
deficit would widen above 16% of GDP. The 
financial account depends on the offshore-banking 

operations, which make it highly volatile, and by 
transfers related to EU funds, which are estimated to 
increase as projects materialized. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Job creation is projected to accelerate as economic 
recovery gains momentum and the restructuring 
process in the manufacturing sector is concluded. 

Unemployment would smoothly decline throughout

the forecast period from 7.3% in 2004 to 7.0% in 
2006. Despite the rise in energy and water prices, HICP 
inflation is expected to further decline to 2.4% in 

2005 and 2.1% in 2006. 
This decline is mainly due to 
the phasing out of th
e impact of th
e 2004 VAT rise in 
2005 and 2006, 
along with an incr
ease in product 
competition. Neverthe
less, these projections are 
subject to some degree of uncertainty since 
developments in the HICP are strongly influenced by 

price volatility in the tourist 
sector and by changes in 
the external trade prices.  
Public finances 
The consolidation measures implemented in the 2004 
budget brought the deficit down to 5.2% of GDP, 
from a recently revised deficit of over 10% of GDP in 
2003. The revenue increasing measures and the expenditure 
cuts planned in the 2005 budget are expected to 

reduce the general government deficit to 3.9% of 
GDP, while the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 76.4% 
of GDP in 2005 up from 75% 
in 2004. For
 2006, the 
deficit is expected to further decrease to 2.8% of 
GDP, and the debt ratio rise to 77% of GDP. These 
projections are based on
 the usual no
n-policy change scenario for revenues and current expenditure. 
However, the projection 
for capital expenditures incorporates the fall associated to the finalization of 

the Italian Protocol. The debt figures do not take on 
board the eventual effect of stock-flows adjustments 
produced by some privati
zation operations foreseen 
by the government.

The situation in 2004 
Following the recession in 20
03, when real GDP fell 
by 0.9%, the Dutch economy 
recovered in 2004 with 
real GDP growth reaching 1.3% on average. First 

estimates of the quarterly national accounts indicate 
that economic activity contracted
 slightly in the fourth 
quarter of 2004, after positive growth in the third 

quarter. The recovery was driv
en both by international 
trade and domestic demand. Investment growth 
picked up but private consumption remained 

lacklustre (growing only 
by 0.5%). Employment fell 
for the second consecutive year while the 
unemployment rate, having fallen slightly over the 

summer, increased 
again in the last part of 2004, and 
averaged slightly below 5%
. However, the moderate 
increase in vacancies last year suggests an 

improvement in employment prospects. HICP 
inflation fell to 1.4%, from 2.2% in 2003, in response 
to weak activity and moderate wage costs. Significant 

price cuts by major retail chains in an attempt to 
(re)capture a larger share of the market further 
contributed to lower inflation. 
Private consumption to remain the weak link 
Economic activity is forecast to
 improve gradually 
over the projection horizon.
 However, partly due to 
negative carry-over effects, 
real GDP growth in 2005 
will still be slightly lower th
an in 2004, at 1.0%. 
Exports are expected to grow by 4%. Despite 
moderate wage growth, Dutch exporters will not 

experience a marked improvement in external 
competitiveness, due to
 the euro™s app
reciation, the 
rise in oil prices, and competitive pricing conditions 
in world markets. The importance of buoyant re-
exports masks the further losses in market share for 
domestically produced export goods and limits the 

positive impact on overall growth. Domestic demand 
will not accelerate markedly in 2005. This is mainly 
because private consumption continues to be weak 

(despite a stabilisation in employment), due to low 
confidence and the impact of wage moderation and 
fiscal tightening on disposable income. Private 

consumption is projected 
to remain broadly flat 
(decreasing by 0.2%), with a foreseen further decline 
in the consumption of durable goods broadly offset by 

increases in private health care expenditure. By 
contrast, investment growth will pick up moderately, 
to 2.1%. Whil
e financing co
nditions are favourable and corporate balance sheets improved, weak demand 
and relatively low capacity utilisation implies the 
absence of a strong investment need. Although earlier 

rises in oil prices push up consumer price inflation in 
the beginning of the year, mainly through higher gas 
and electricity prices, inflation is set to slightly 
moderate in the course of 2005 as underlying inflation 
decreases in response to falling wage costs.  
Domestic demand is expected 
to improve further in 
2006, causing real GDP growth to increase to 2.0%. 
However, the pattern of 
public and private 
consumption demand is h
eavily distorted by the 
effects of the health care reform effective as of 1 
January. The reform entails the abolishment of the 
distinction between private and public insurance for 

basic health insurance. The new system introduces a 
mandatory public insurance for basic health care 
which will imply a reclassification of part of private 

health care expenditure as public consumption. The 
impact of the reform is estimated to reduce the 
recorded level of private consumption by somewhat 

less than 2% of GDP, raising measured government 
consumption by the sam
e amount. Underlying 
consumption demand will improve somewhat 

compared to 2005, but remains rather weak, in view 
of the rather modest improvement in employment and 
the expected further deceleration in compensation per 
employee. Export growth will p
ick up to 5.5%, and 
investment is expected to
 accelerate in 2006, but the 
strength of the recovery in in
vestment is dampened by 
the slack in domestic demand. Employment growth is 
projected to increase to slightly above 1% in 2006 in 

the usual lagged response to an economic upturn, 
leading to a moderate decrease in the unemployment 
rate. In view of the expected decline in oil prices,

weak import prices, the delayed pass-through of the 
earlier euro appreciation, and 
a fall in unit labour 
costs, consumer price inflation will moderate further, 

to 0.7% in 2006. HICP 
inflation will fall to around -
3% in 2006, but 
this large drop is mainly due to the 
statistical impact of the health care reform on 

harmonised inflation. 
Deficit fell below 3% of GDP already in 2004 
The economic downturn took
 a heavy toll on public 
finances in the down
swing, despite substantial 
consolidation measures, but budgetary prospects are 

currently improving. According to the most recent 
data, the deficit fell markedly in 2004, to 2.5% of 
GDP, compared to 3.2% of GDP in 2003. This 

improvement reflected fiscal tightening, lower-than-
expected expenditures in some areas, and an 
acceleration in tax receipts towards the end of 2004 

due to better macroeconomic 
conditions. The 2005 
budget contains considerable further consolidation 
measures, including increases in income tax rates, 
reduced access to unemployment benefits, and the 
phasing out of subsidies on low-paid labour. The 

agreement reached in November 2004 between the 
government and social part
ners modifying planned 
reforms in the areas of social security and pensions in 

return for wage moderation should secure the savings 
planned for 2005. Fiscal con
solidation will help bring 
down the deficit to 2.0% 
of GDP in 2005 despite 
lacklustre economic growth. In
 line with the cyclical 
recovery, the general government deficit will fall 
further in 2006 to 1.6% of GDP. The government 

debt-to-GDP ratio is still forecast to rise, from 55.7% 
of GDP in 2004 to 57.9% in 2006. However, the exact 
impact of the reforms in the areas of pension and 

health care to be implemen
ted in 2006 is difficult to

Forecast
Developments in 2004 
Austria™s economy grew by 2% in 2004, accelerating 
from 0.8% in the prev
ious year. Activity was boosted 
by world trade, with net 
exports contributing more 
than one percentag
e point to GDP 
growth. Support 
came also from a notable increase in investment 
volumes, both in response to export demand and a 

fiscal investment premium, which expired by the end 
of the year and which led to a sizeable amount of 
investment being carried forw
ard. As the upswing was 
accompanied by a marked increase in employment, 
private consumption also picked up. 
However, following very solid quarterly growth rates 
between 0.6% and 0.8% in the first three quarters, the 

recovery has slowed to a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the 
fourth quarter, in line with the (temporary) weakness 
in the neighbouring economi
es, notably Germany and 
Italy. Especially tourism revenues remained below 
expectations, but also investment and consumption 
could not maintain the relatively high growth pace 

they had earlier in the year.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
The economy is expected to continue growing at a 
solid rate. Domestic c
onsumption should respond 
positively to a sizeable tax reduction and rising 
employment. However, consump
tion growth is likely 
to lag behind the increase in disposable incomes, 

leading to an increase in the savings rate.  
A dampening factor is an expected dip in investment 
volumes following immediately after the subsidy 
phase-out in January. Investment should, however, 
quickly resume its healthy growth
 in the light of rising 
demand and growing profits. The reduction in the 

corporate tax rate will also make Austria more 
attractive for foreign investors. 
Housing construction, 
having suffered from slack demand for new homes 

and persistent excess office space, should pick up 
moderately and will no longer constitute a drag on the 
economy. 
As regards the external side, unit labour costs are 
expected to grow at a rate below the EU average and 
export prices relative to 
its trading partners should 
continue to fall in 2005. 
Even so, the importance of 
the external contribution to growth will weaken 
substantially due to slackening world demand. 
Labour market, costs, and prices 
Employment is expected to grow throughout the 
forecast period. The increased employment does not, 

however, translate into an equal reduction in 
unemployment, owing to 
the high elasticity of labour 
supply and sizeable immigration.   
Consumer price inflation should stay at a rate close to 
2% in 2004 and 2005, driven by rising energy prices 
and taxes and higher tobacco excise duties. As this 

effect wears off, consumer pri
ce inflation should slow 
in 2006. Public finances 
In 2004, the first step of a major tax reform was 
implemented, with parts of th
e 2005 instalment being 
brought forward to 2004. The reform consisted of a 
lowering of tax rates (personal 
and corporate income 
taxes) equivalent to 0.3 % of GDP, the effect on 

overall revenues being offset by increases in mineral 
oil and energy taxes. The measures of the 2005 reform 
brought forward to 2004 
comprised higher tax 
allowances for children, worth about 0.1 % of GDP, 
which were not financed by expenditure cuts. Being 
largely export-driven, the 
composition of growth in 
2004 was tax-un
friendly. On the other hand, tax 
revenues benefited fro
m substantial cross-border 
petrol shopping from Germany, amounting to more 
than 0.3% of GDP. All in all, the deficit rose by 0.2 
pp compared with 2003 to 1.3% of GDP in 2004. 
At 2.0% of GDP, the deficit in 2005 is projected to be 
¾% of GDP higher than in 2004. The fact that GDP 
growth was lower than the official forecast, explains

why the deficit is projected to widen slightly more 
than expected by the 
national authorities. The 
dominating factor is the implementation of the second 

stage of the tax reform 2004/2005. The personal 
income tax is reduced to four tax brackets, including a 
zero tax bracket up to an income of •10 000. The 

corporate tax rate is reduced from 34% to 25%, while 
tax rules for holdings (do
mestic and foreign) are also 
simplified. The agricultural 
sector is exempted from 
mineral oil tax. The burden on the 
budget is estimated 
to amount to 1% of GDP, although the effects from 
the new holding taxation 
are difficult to measure and 
may pose a budgetary risk. The health care reform is 
projected to lead to additional revenues of 0.1 % of 
GDP, mainly due to an 
increase in th
e contribution rate of 0.1 pp and an increase in the tobacco tax. 
Streamlining the health care administration is 
expected to lead to expenditure savings of 
approximately the same size.  
On the basis of the no-
policy-change assumption, the 
2006 deficit is expected to fall by ¼ pp to 1.7% of 
GDP, as the economy is expected to grow above 
potential and some spending programmes (in 

particular the subsidy on 
additional investment) will 
no longer burden the budget.  
The debt ratio
i is expected to 
ease down slightly 
during the forecasting peri
od, while remaining above 
the 60% of GDP reference value.

Economic situation in 2004 
While still robust, economic activity decelerated 
markedly in the second half of 2004, with real GDP 
growth slowing to 4.3% year-on-year from 6.5% in 

the first half of the year. 
The slowdown in activity 
mostly reflected the phase-out of the pre-EU-entry 
one-off effects that contributed to the impressive 

performance of the Polish econ
omy in the first half of 
the year. For 2004 as a whole, real GDP growth 
reached 5.3% against 3.8% in 2003. As in 2003, 

growth was mainly driven by exports, which 
continued to grow strongly de
spite the appreciation of 
the zloty since May. However, the growth 

contribution of the external sector gradually 
diminished and turned negative in the fourth quarter 
for the first time since early 2003. Household 

consumption expanded moderately on the back of 
weak real income growth and 
persistently high 
unemployment, while fixe
d investment rebounded 
finally after falling for three consecutive years. 
Investment growth started to
 recover timidly towards 
the end of 2003 and gained momentum in the course 
of 2004, with an abrupt acceleration to over 7% year-
on-year in the fourth quarter. In addition, growth was 

sustained during most of 
the year by a strong positive 
contribution from stockbuilding. While the rapid 
growth in inventories in the first quarter can be 

attributed to expectations of price increases after EU 
accession, the sharp increase in the following two 
quarters appears unusual in this phase of the economic 

cycle.Prospects in 2005 and 2006 
With the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus, 
growth is set to decelerate this year. Monetary 
conditions have become less 
supportive, as a result of 
both the real effective appreciation of the zloty and 
the interest rate hikes of 
mid-2004, while the long-
delayed fiscal adjustment starts this year. Overall, real 

GDP growth is projected to slow to 4.4% in 2005. As 
international prospects improve and monetary 
conditions ease somewhat, eco
nomic growth should 
rise, but only modestly, to 4.5% 
in 2006. A shift in the 
growth pattern, with domestic demand taking over 
from net exports as the ma
in contributor to growth, 
was already at work in the 
fourth quarter of 2004. 
This will continue in th
e coming quarters, with a drag 
from net exports expected for both 2005 and 2006. 
Investment growth should accelerate further in 2005 
and 2006, against the 
backdrop of emerging capacity 
constraints, strong corporate profitability and 
accession-related business opportunities. In particular, 

estimates by the National Bank of Poland point to 
capacity utilisation rates of above 80% in the first 
quarter of 2005, against a low of 73% in early 2002. 
EU funds will provide a further boost to investment 
activity, which is projected to accelerate to around 

10% in volume terms this year and next. Consumer 
demand is also likely to strength
en over the projection 
period, helped by the turn
around in the 
labour market, 
faster real wage growth and growing consumer 
confidence.  
Export growth, while affected
 by the appreciation of 
the zloty, should remain r
obust this year, supported by 
80Chapter 3 Member States, Poland productivity gains by Po
lish firms. Exports would 
grow somewhat faster next year against the backdrop 
of a growth revival in Poland™s main trading partners. 

Poland would continue to gain market shares 
throughout the forecast period, albeit at a slower pace 
than in previous years. Given the high import content 

of Polish exports and 
the expected recovery in 
investment activity, import gr
owth is also projected to 
pick up strongly and would outpace export growth 

from 2005 onwards.  
The risks to the growth outlook are skewed to the 
downside. Persistent fiscal 
and political uncertainties 
remain a major source of co
ncern for the strength of 
the expected investment recovery.Also,a slower-
than-expected improvement in the labour market and 
more moderate wage growth would hold back private 

consumption. Finally, the strong zloty and weak 
growth in the EU could ca
use exports to grow less 
rapidly than projected. 
Labour market, costs and prices 
Labour market conditions a
ppear to be improving 
since the second quarter of 2004. Overall, 
employment ceased to drop last year, and 

unemployment decreased by 0.4 
percentage points to 
18.8% of the labour force, compared to a peak of 
19.8% in 2002. As economic activity remains 

vigorous, employment growt
h is expected to become 
increasingly strong over the forecast horizon. This 
should translate into a drop in the unemployment rate 

by a little over a full percen
tage point over 2005-06. 
However, unemployment will still be relatively high, 
at 17.6% of the labour for
ce, by the end of the 
forecast horizon, reflecting the deep-seated structural 
problems in the lab
our market. Poland™s 
unemployment has a large structural component, and 

labour market difficulties are 
further exacerbated by 
unfavourable demographi
c developments and the 
ongoing restructuring process in heavy industries and 

agriculture.  
HICP inflation increased sharply last year, reaching 
3.6% on average, up from 0.7% in 2003. Consumer 
price inflation overshot the upper limit of the central 
bank™s target band (2.5 ± 1 percent) in June and 
continued to rise to
 4.6% year-on-year in July-August, before declining to 4% year-on-year in December. 
The surge in head
line inflation was mostly due to 
rising food and oil prices and accession-related 

increases in indirect taxes. In order to contain second-
round effects of higher inflation, the National Bank of 
Poland raised its key reference rate by a cumulative 
125 basis points to 6.5% between June and August. 

Core inflation picked up sign
ificantly in mid-2004 but 
has stabilised at 2.4% year-on-year since September, 
pointing to limited price pressures stemming from the 

demand side to date. 
With the fading of the one-off effects of EU accession 
on prices, together with more favourable 
developments in food and oil prices, consumer price 

inflation is set to fall this 
year despite the emergence 
of a positive output gap. Also, the strong zloty will 
contribute to dampening inflationary pressures. As the 

positive output gap widens 
and unit labour costs pick 
up, headline inflation should edge up in the course of 
2006 and is projected to average 2.3% against 2.1% in 

2005. Unit labour cost growth is estima
ted to have fallen by 
0.7% last year, owing to a cyclical pick-up in 
productivity to over 5% 
combined with modest 
compensation growth. However, in 2005 and 2006, 
this is likely to be 
reversed as productivity and 
compensation are projected to move in the opposite 
direction. Although nominal wages are expected to 
increase in order to at least sustain growth in real 

earnings, high unemploy
ment should exert a 
moderating influence.  
External accounts Poland™s export performan
ce remained strong last 
year and, although import 
growth outstripped export 
growth towards the end of 2004, the current account 
deficit narrowed further from
 the already low levels 
recorded in 2003. The deficit reached 1.5% of GDP, 

down from 2.2% in 2003. Growing imports in line 
with strengthening domestic
 demand will lead to a 
steady increase in the trade and current account 

deficits this year and next.However, as in 2004, 
higher transfers from the EU will have a positive 
impact on both the current and capital accounts. In 

total, the current account deficit is projected to widen 
to 2.4% of GDP this year and 3% in 2006, and will 
thus remain within sustainable bounds.
Public finances  
At 4.8% of GDP, the general government deficit in 
2004 is estimated to be
 considerably lower than 
targeted in the 2004 b
udget. The downward revision

of the deficit results mainly from a better-than-
expected performance by the social security sub-
sector by 0.7% of GDP. A better-than-expected 

position of the central gove
rnment also contributed to 
the revision of 
the 2004 deficit. The general government deficit is expected to 
decrease to 4.4% of GDP in 2005 and 3.8% in 2006 

compared to 3.9% and 3.2% of GDP respectively in 
the December convergence programme. The upward 
revision of the deficit pr
ojections by 0.3 percentage 
points in 2005 and 0.7 in 
2006 compared to the 
autumn 2004 forecasts takes into account the state of 
implementation of the public finance reform package 

provided in the updated programme. However, based 
on the no-policy change assumption, the forecast 
includes only the measures that have been approved 

by Parliament. Savings on the expenditure side 
represent approximately 
0.6% of GDP in 2005 and 
0.5% in 2006. The estimated budgetary impact of the 

measures affecting the revenue side of the budget 
(restructuring of the railways and coal mining sector) 
corresponds to 0.1% of GDP in 2005 and 2006. The 
downward revision of the growth rates has also 

contributed to a higher deficit-to-GDP ratio. The 
forecast still includes the surplus of the second-pillar 
funded pension funds, which is expected to reach 

approximately 2% of GDP in 2004 and 1.9% in 2005 
and 2006, within the general government sector. 
The lower-than-expected gross 
debt figure in 2004 is 
due to stronger-than-expected nominal GDP growth, 

favourable valuation
 effects following the 
appreciation of the zloty and higher-than-expected 
privatisation proceeds. From 43.6% of GDP in 2004, 

the debt-to-GDP ratio would still increase to 46.8% in 
2005 and reach 47.6% in 2006.

Developments in 2004 
After shrinking by 1.1% in 2003, real GDP gained 1% 
in 2004, with a clear
 rebound up to the middle of the 
year and retrenchments thereafter. The recovery was 

led by strong internal demand: after receding in the 
previous year, private consumption was lively and 
private investment recovered from the losses recorded 

in 2002 and 2003. Exports were buoyant in particular 
in the first half of 2004, 
while imports grew strongly 
over the whole year. The result was a negative net 

contribution of the external 
sector to GDP growth and 
a sharp deterioration of the trade balance.  
Outlook for 2005 and 2006 
Domestic demand, while rem
aining the principal 
driver of growth in the coming two years, is projected 

to slow down somewhat in 
2005. The labour market 
prospects are not expected 
to improve, and thus the 
momentum of private consumption observed in 2004 

may abate in 2005. Moreover, the uncertainty 
surrounding fiscal consolidation seems to have been 
weighing on the economy, in particular on 
investment. The foreign se
ctor should not exert a 
major drag on economic gro
wth: firstly, the slowdown 
in the rise of labour costs and in inflation is expected 
to help exports competitiv
eness, although 
in a context 
of a somewhat more moderate growth of exports 

markets; secondly, in 2006, ex
ports will be boosted 
by specific developments in
 the car industry; thirdly, 
the projected cooling of in
ternal demand will result in 
lower demand for imports. Nevertheless, a negative 
carry-over from the second half 
of 2004 will damper 
average growth in 2005
. All in all, real GDP is 
estimated to grow by 1.1% in 2005 and to accelerate 
to 1.7% in 2006. After the sharp increase in 2004, demand for imported 
goods in 2005 an
d 2006 is expected to be more in line 
with domestic demand, preventing a further 
significant deterioration in
 the trade balance. At the 
same time, the services balance su
rplus is expected to 
continue rising.  
Labour market, wages and prices 
On the back of subdued growth, unemployment rose 
further in 2004 and may edge up to a rate close to 7% 
in 2005. However, moderate wage rises and a slower 

upward drift in unit labour 
costs should provide some 
relief.Inflation slackened markedly
 at the beginning of 
2004, but rebounded towards the end of the year due 

to higher energy 
prices. In 2005 and 
2006, the lagged 
effects of low wage growth and the significantly 
negative output gap should
 rein back inflationary 
pressure. The easing on prices of imported basic 
goods should also help to
 curb inflation in 2006. Public finances 
In 2004, the general government deficit stood at 2.9% 
of GDP
1. In spite of the stro
ng fiscal revenue growth, 
hikes on government expenditure held back progress 
in budgetary conso
lidation. To keep the deficit below 
the reference value, th
e authorities decid
ed to transfer 
to the government sector pen
sion liabilities for four 
state-owned enterprises, 
in exchange of payments 
worth more than 2.2% of GD
P. Without such one-off 
operations, the general government deficit would have 
largely exceeded 3% of GDP.  
Large public finances imbalances are projected over 
the forecast horizon. In 2005, the corporate tax rate 
cut from 30 to 25% will, 
for the first time, exert its 
full effects, lowering proceeds by around 0.4% of 

GDP.  On the expenditure side, public consumption is 
expected to continue growing in 2005 in real terms, 
albeit less than GDP. The strong growth in 

expenditure on social tr
ansfers, in excess of nominal 
                                                          
1 There are ongoing discussions with Eurostat on the 
consistency between accrual- and cash-based data, which may lead to a revision in the government deficit.

GDP, that has been observed for several years is, on a 
no-policy change basis, fo
recast to continue, mainly 
driven by old-age pension entitlements with the 

maturing of pension schemes and the lack of 
improvement on the labour market. 
All in all, the government deficit in both 2005 and 
2006 is forecast to be well above the 3% of GDP 

reference value. Last October, the Portuguese 
authorities stated their commitmen
t to keep the deficit 
at or below 3% of GDP an
d, in order to achieve this 
goal, to introduce one-off revenue-raising measures. 
One of those measures, namely a transfer of a pension 
fund to the government sector, worth 0.3% of GDP, 

was taken on board in the current forecast, which 
brings the estimated government deficit for 2005 to 
4.9% of GDP. It remains to be seen whether the new 

government which took office on 12 March, will 
confirm such in
tention. The 2005 deficit has been 
revised upwards compared with the Commission 

services autumn forecast mainly due to a significantly 
lower economic growth and the withdrawal of a one-
off operation with expected proceeds of 0.5% of GDP, 
as Eurostat considered it as 
a financial operation with 
no impact on the deficit.  
In 2006, the deficit is projected at 4.7% of GDP on a 
no-policy change assumption and abstracting from 
any one-off revenue-raising measure. 
Since 2003, public debt has been exceeding 60% of 
GDP. As a consequence of the high government 
deficits, low nominal GDP 
growth, and of one-off 
debt-increasing stock-flow adj
ustments, public debt 
will continue to increase, exceeding 68% of GDP at 
the end of 2006.

The economy in 2004 
Following subdued activity in
 2003, which resulted in 
real GDP to grow at the slowest pace since 1993, the 
economy recovered its stren
gth in 2004. As growth 
accelerated vigorously and in the third quarter of 2004 
reached the highest rate over the past four years, 
output is estimated to have risen by 4.6%. The 

stimulus came from a favourable international 
environment. Ignited by a recovery of the EU markets 
at the end of 2003, exports expanded considerably 

throughout 2004. After a long period of external trade 
being a drag on economic performance, the 
contribution of net exports 
to GDP growth turned 
positive in the second half of 2004. Furthermore, 
household spending and investment expenditure 
remained buoyant while 
de-stocking occurred. A 
marked upward trend in the quarterly dynamics of 
both domestic and foreign demand confirms the 
anticipation of a solid econom
ic revival in
 2004-2006. 
The force of the upturn, 
however, appears strong 
given the rather slim prospect
s of further expansion in 
the rest of the EU.  
Outlook for 2005-2006 
This year, the economy is likely to become 
temporarily affected by relatively slow growth in 
Slovenia™s main trading part
ners. It is especially 
domestic consumption that is likely to fuel growth. 
While wages are expected to remain constrained, the 
historically low nominal in
terest rates and the new 
personal income tax regi
me relieving the lowest 
income classes should keep private spending strong. 
The forecast projects GDP to increase by 3.7%.  
In 2006, when the negative effects of high oil prices 
are expected to gradually fade, growth should 
strengthen, to reach 4.0%. Domestic demand is set to 

provide the main impetus as household spending and 
investment stay robust 
against the background of 
vigorous construction activity
 and production capacity 
adjustments geared to bu
ilding up the competitiveness 
of Slovene industry. As a consequence of buoyant 
private and investment expenditure a sustained rise in 

imports is expected, which is likely to be offset by 
solid export growth. The negative external 
contribution to GDP growth should thus gradually 

narrow. 
Although a recovery in the 
main trading partners has 
been fuelling Slovenia™s ex
ports, the current account 
moved further from balance in 2004. Over the next 

two years, the current 
account deficit should stay low 
and contained, at 1% of GDP. 
Labour market, wages and prices 
In 2004, the situation on the labour market improved 
as employment increased and unemployment 
decreased. This year, when a further gentle pick-up in 
employment is projected, the unemployment rate is 

expected to resume its gradual trend decline and be 
around 6% by 2006.  
In 2004, real wage growth has been subdued thanks to 
the implementation of the restrictive wage agreement 

across the economy. The forward-looking indexation, 
taking into account an
ticipated rather than actual 
domestic consumer price movements, inflation in the 

EU and the euro/tolar central pa
rity, has been applied 
consistently in all sector
s, public and private. Furthermore, the wage increases lagged behind 

productivity growth by mo
re than on
e percentage point.  
Inflation continued to decline rapidly in 2004, only 
briefly interrupted by the oil price hike and higher 

excise duties on tobacco in May and November 
respectively. Consumer price growth dropped from 
5.7% in 2003 to 3.6% in 
2004. Inflationary pressures 
have been well contained as the government has 
remained committed to 
prudence in regulating 
administered price increases and indirect tax changes, 
as well as has applied frequent adjustments of excise 
duties on oil to temper th
e impact of world market 
price fluctuations. Moreover, inflation has been 
falling against a stable exchange rate, set at the central

The revision of the government accounts, linked to 
the reclassification of the two extra-budgetary funds 

into the general government sector, has led to the 
general government defici
t figures being revised 
upwards (by 0.2-0.5% of GDP) for the period 2000-
2003. Within the new methodological framework, the 
deficit in 2004 is estimated 
to have decreased slightly, 
to 1.9% of GDP, mostly as a result of good economic 

performance and a firm commitment to fiscal 
discipline in the wake of a revenue shortfall linked to 
the loss in VAT resour
ces following the change of the 
tax collection system after EU accession which was, 
moreover, smaller than expected. This year, the deficit 
is projected to increase to 2.2% of GDP as the 

revenue ratio declines furt
her due to the direct tax 
reform effective from January 2005. The current 
forward-looking indexatio
n mechanism, containing 
the rise of public sector wages and certain social 
transfers, will limit the rise in expenditures. 
Anticipating the increase in th
e inflows of EU funds, 
the deficit is forecast to stabilise at slightly above 2% 
of GDP.

Economic situation in 2004  
In 2004, real GDP growth accelerated significantly to 
5½% and its composition turned around completely. 
Domestic demand became the sole growth engine, 

while the external contribu
tion entered negative territory. Although export growth remained in the 
double-digit range, it dropped to approximately half 
the level of its stellar performance a year earlier and 
was outpaced by import growth. Higher imports were 
induced by an expansion 
of both investment and 
private consumption, which had both contracted a 
year before. In particular, private consumption 
expenditure picked up faster than had been commonly 

expected and was bolstered by real wage growth and 
lower income taxes (comp
ensating for restraints on 
social transfers). Changes in income taxation also 

caused economic agents to shift some components of 
employees™ compensation from 2003 into 2004.  
Prospects in 2005 and 2006  In 2005 and 2006, the economic expansion is 
anticipated to remain robu
st at around 5%. Domestic 
demand is likely to stay th
e exclusive driving force 
behind growth, while the negative external 

contribution is forecast to peak in 2005. Private 
consumption growth is expected to accelerate further 
as disposable income expands (reflecting higher real 

wages) and as the household savi
ngs rate falls (net of 
the effect of the introduction of a funded pension 
pillar). Strengthening house
hold credit growth is 
likely to have a consumption-inducing effect as well. 
Gross fixed capital formation is predicted to expand 
sharply as business environment and business 
confidence are being fostered further and as the 
already pledged gree
nfield investments, 
predominantly in the 
automobile sector, materialise.  
However, the latter will also 
entail an increase in 
imports of investment goods and this is a major factor 
behind the expected negative 
external contribution. In 
2006, the first tranches of the newly created export 

capacity will come on stream but will prospectively 
not yet suffice for the ex
ternal contribution to turn positive again.  
In 2004, the current account 
deficit widened to some 
3½% of GDP. This resulted
 mainly from a 
weakening, but still robu
st, export performance and 
strong import growth. Furthermore, the amount of 

repatriated profits increased 
significantly. This trend, 
coupled with a continued high import expansion, are 
the main factors behind a forecast additional increase 

in the current account deficit to some 5% of GDP in 
2005 and 2006.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
After a strong performa
nce in 2003, employment 
growth was significantly lower in 2004, not least as a 
result of further labour shed
ding in the public sector. 
Employment growth is predicted to revive in 2005 

and 2006. Partly as a refl
ection of unemployment 
benefit reforms, the unemployment rate fell strongly 
in 2003. It rose again in 2004
 but a further, albeit only 
gradual, reduction is likely over the rest of the 
forecast horizon.  
In 2004, the average consumer price inflation rate 
amounted to 7½%, with adjustments in administered 

prices and indirect taxes contributing about 5¾ 
percentage points. As these 
adjustments will play a 
much lesser role in futu
re, inflation is forecast to drop 
rapidly to below 4% and 3% in 2005 and 2006 
respectively Œ assuming th
at potential second-round effects, including due to backward-looking wage- 

setting, are kept in check. 
Public finances 
The implementation of the 20
04 budget reflected most 
of the government™s structural reform agenda for the 
current legislative period, on both the revenue and 
expenditure side. This included notably the 
introduction of a flat corporate and individual income 

tax rate and a uniform VAT rat
e (both at 19%) at the 
beginning of 2004. It also encompassed

comprehensive reforms in the social sphere. 
Altogether, the budget de
ficit turned out significantly 
better than originally planned, 
but this is mostly due 
to spending postponements, including related to co-
payments for EU-funds. The overall general 
government deficit for 2004 is estimated at 3.3% of 

GDP.  For the years 2005 and 2006, the general government 
deficit is expected to be slightly below or at 4% of 
GDP. A rise in both the revenue- and expenditure-to-

GDP-ratios in 2005 is due 
to the assumed increased 
inflow of transfers from the EU on the revenue side 
and to the associated spending (including co-

financing) and the contributions to the EU budget on 
the expenditure side.  
On the revenue side, after the major shift from direct 
to indirect taxation associated with the tax reforms in 

2004, changes in the tax legislation in 2005 are 
marginal and it is assumed that policies will not 
change in 2006. Social contributions in 2005 and 
2006 are particularly affected by the redirection of 
contributions in the amount 
of 9 percentage points of 
gross wages to a funded
 pension pillar. The effect is 
forecast to be around ½% of GDP in 2005 and around 
1% of GDP in 2006
 and is excluded from the 
predicted social contribution revenues.  
On the expenditure side, the main reform measure 
included in the budget 2005 is a second tranche of 
health care reforms, which is 
predicted to lead to an 
upfront increase of the GDP-shar
e of expenditures by 
health insurance companies in 20
05 but a stable share 
thereafter.

Finland - Contributions to GDP growth 
The economy in 2004  
Economic growth turned ou
t higher than expected, 
with real GDP accelerating to 3.7% from 2.4% in 
2003. Domestic demand provided the main bulk of 

support, as the contribution from external demand was 
negative on the year. Also higher inventories 
contributed to growth. Household consumption, 

fuelled by solid earnings, dir
ect and indirect tax cuts, 
and low interest rates, grew by 3.2%. Public 
consumption expanded by 
2.1% from 2003. Total 
investment reversed its declining trend and advanced 
for the first time since 2
001, up by 4.6%. Residential 
construction and equipm
ent investment increased 
strongly, while investment
 on commercial buildings 
continued to decline. Even though being boosted by 
strong demand for metal products, exports in the first 

half of 2004 were weak reflecting difficulties in the 
electronics industry. As the year progressed, the 
telecommunications sector was able to win back 

market shares and increase exports, while demand for 
metal products also remained strong. The growth 
contribution from net exports was negative at 0.1 for 
the whole year, as exports and imports increased by 
3.5% and 4.8%, respectively. The weakening in the 

terms of trade continued, even though export prices 
reversed their d
eclining trend and increased modestly, 
as import prices rose strongly due to higher oil and 

raw material prices. 
In line with strong activ
ity, employment started to 
improve in the second half
 of 2004, offsetting earlier 
declines. However, employment was unchanged from 

2003. Nevertheless, the un
employment rate fell as 
part of unemployed left the labour force. HICP 
inflation declined from an aver
age of 1.3% in 2003 to 
0.1% in 2004, reflecting 
increased competition and 
alcohol tax cuts, which took effect in March.  
Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
Despite some moderation, the economy is projected to 
remain firmly on the growth
 path throughout the 
forecast period. According to survey indicators, 
growth of industrial production and exports is 

expected to moderate slightly in early 2005, while 
domestic demand should remain solid. Net exports 
will increasingly contribute to growth, while support 

from private consumption will recede, but investment 
is expected to pick up th
e slack. Hence, activity is set 
to expand at a steady pace, reaching 3.3% in 2005 and 

then easing to slightly below 3% in 2006.  
In the labour market, the 
improvement which started 
in the summer of 2004 
is expected to continue. Higher 
job creation during the forecast period will make 

inroads into unemplo
yment, which nevertheless 
remains largely structural in nature. Private 
consumption is expected to continue to provide the 
main stimulus to activity, altho
ugh gains in disposable 
income will be lower as the temporary factors that 

supported purchasing power in 2004 fade away. In 
addition, higher inflation, in
creases in tax-like charges 
and moderate pay rises will dampen growth of real 

disposable income. Public co
nsumption is expected to 
grow by around 2% annually, despite the efforts of the 
central government at expenditure control. After 

peaking in 2004, investment 
is expected to continue to 
grow in 2005-2006, despite 
some slowdown due to 
less lively housing construction and Finnish 

companies increasingly invest abroad.  
Exports are anticipated to further strengthen on the 
back of stable international
 environment, retaining 
their momentum also in 2006. After winning back 

market shares in the electronics industry in 2004, the 
prospects for exports of telecommunication 
equipment appear promising. Also, the outlook for 

metal industry exports remains positive, given 
continued strong demand from Asian countries and 
Russia. Despite suffering from 
low sales prices, the paper industry is expected to remain competitive.

expected to normalise as the effect of the tax cut fades 
away and reach about 1.1% and 1.4% in 2005 and 
2006, respectively. In late 20
04, the social partners 
settled a new centralised 
two-and-half-year wage 
agreement that provides fo
r wage rises of 2.5% from 
March 2005 for 15 months, and another 2.1% from 

June 2006 for 16 months
. Assuming the usual positive 
wage drift of about 1 perc
entage point, per-capita 
wages are expected to incr
ease by about 3.5% in 2005 
and 3% in 2006, from 3.5% in 2004. However, higher 
growth in overall productivity 
appears likely to curb 
the rise in unit labour costs. 
Public finances  
The general government surpl
us is foreseen to be 
reduced from 2.1% of GDP in 2004 to 1.6% by 2006. 
Central government finances 
are expected to slip into 
deficit, after posting a sur
plus of 0.4% of GDP in 
2004, while the financial po
sition of local government 
is foreseen to weak
en and remain in
 deficit. On the 
basis of the government™s medium-term spending 
guidelines of spring 2005 and the budget for 2005, the 
general government surplus is estimated to stay below 
2% of GDP during the forecast period. Central 
government finances are projected to be in deficit in 
2005-2006, since the gove
rnment has supplemented 
the collective wage agreement by sizeable income tax 
cuts of 0.8% of GDP and due to higher overall 
expenditure. Local government finances will stay in 

deficit due to higher spending and investment 
expenditure even though tax receipts should improve. 
Overall, the general government surplus will rest 

solely on the surplus in the social security funds. 
The government debt ratio
 is anticipated to fall from 
45.1% of GDP in 2004 to
 43.7% of GDP by the end 
of the forecast period.

Sweden
Forecast
The situation in 2004 
Swedish economic growth was strong in 2004, with 
GDP up by 3.5% on the 
year, compared to 1.5% in 
2003. The calendar effect 
contributed positively but, 
even adjusting for this, growth was above potential. 
Exports expanded substan
tially, outpacing imports, 
resulting in a considerable 
growth contribution from 
net exports. On the domestic side, private 
consumption advanced steadily and the expansion of 
investment was encouraging 
after a sustained period 
of sluggishness. The rela
tively poor developments 
observed in the labour market
 helped to contain wage 
demands and inflationary pressures, which have been 

very low, allowing the Riksban
k to cut repo rates by 
75 basis points over the year.  
The situation in 2005 and 2006 
Recent indicators are positive, with both consumer 
and business expectations at
 high levels. The 
consumer confidence indica
tor, and in particular 
consumers™ expectations regarding their own 
economic situation, give a 
positive pictur
e. Both the 
industrial confidence and the purchasing managers 
indicators show positive expectations. These are 
expected to support a continuation of healthy growth 
in 2005. Domestic demand growth should become 
stronger and external demand 
growth continue at high 
levels, albeit at a decelerating pace, while imports 
should pick up further 
during 2005, resulting in a 
continued small but positiv
e contribution from net 
exports. In 2006, economic growth is expected to 
decelerate toward potential levels, as the recovery 
becomes more balanced throug
hout the economy. 
Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 3.0% in 2005 
and 2.8% in 2006.  A resumption of employment growth will contribute 
positively to household disposable income in 2005 

and 2006 while the sav
ings rate stabilises at around 
11%. Financial wealth has 
benefited from rising 
equity prices. Moreover, while households have taken 

on more debt, house prices have continued to rise 
steadily against a backgr
ound of low interest rates, 
contributing to the ma
intenance of a relatively strong 
net wealth position of households. All in all, this 
should result in an increasi
ng growth in consumption 
in the years to 2006. Public consumption is expected 

to continue to be relatively steady over the forecast 
period.  
Turning to investment, th
e conditions for a continued 
recovery are in place: a benign demand outlook, 

favourable financing conditions, a long period of 
falling total investments in 
previous years and a high 
capacity utilisation rate in manufacturing. A strong 

investment expansion should therefore take place over 
the forecast period.  
Exports are expected to 
continue to grow relatively 
strongly up to 2006, in lin
e with world markets, but at 
a decelerating pace as the appreciation of the krona 
feeds through. Imports should expand as final demand 

strengthens further during the forecast period.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
Employment fell in 2004 and the unemployment rate 
rose. The strong rise in economic activity foreseen 
from 2004 onwards is expected to result in an 

improvement in the labour market in 2005 and in 
particular in 2006. Agai
nst this background and 
supported by an increase in the volume of active 

labour market measures, the unemployment rate will 
decrease over the period. Inflation has fallen 
considerably since electricity and energy price 

increases in late 2003, notwithstanding the 
considerable recent rises in oil prices. Wages are 
expected to rise relatively moderately, reflecting past 

weakness in the labour market. The wage agreement 
reached in the spring of 2004, covering a period 
including 2006, resulted 
in lower negotiated wage 
rises in industry compared with the 2001 wage 
negotiation round. Against this background, 

inflationary pressures shoul
d continue to be subdued.

2006, inflation is expected to rise gradually towards 
2% in the course of 
2006. With relatively strong 
growth over this period, and an improvement in the 

labour market from next year, 
interest rates may start 
to rise. Public finances 
In 2004, the su
rplus in public 
finances was slightly above 1% of GDP. Over the forecast period, Sweden 

will continue to show b
udget surpluses while the 
fiscal stance is broadly ne
utral. Income tax cuts in 
2005 proposed in the Budget Bill, one part of the last 
step of a phased income tax reform, will reduce the 
surplus ratio in the govern
ment finances somewhat in 
2005 as compared to 2004. On current policies, the 

budget balance is projected to remain at a similar 
level in 2006, benefiting 
also from an improvement in 
the labour market. General government debt, which 

mainly lies with cen
tral government, is projected to 
rise as central government is expected to remain in 
deficit over the forecast period. The increase is 
nevertheless slower than nominal GDP over the 
forecast period, resulting in a fall in the debt ratio to 
just below 50% of GDP in 2006.

Forecast
The economy in 2004 
Overall, UK GDP growth in 2004 has been firm and 
above trend, at 3.1% for the year as a whole. Strong 
growth in the first half of the year slowed slightly in 

the second half, broadly in line with the Commission 
services™ autumn forecast. Fourth quarter output 
growth is estimated to have been 0.7%, representing a 

slight pickup up on third quarter growth of 0.5%. 
Nonetheless, the data appear to suggest that the 
economy has moderated towards trend. 
Domestic demand growth, up 4% over the year, 
continues to be the key driver for this performance. 
Private consumption expenditure slowed over the 
course of the year, most likely as a consequence of a 

sustained tightening in monetary policy and 
moderation in house price inf
lation. Helping to offset 
this, supportive governmen
t consumption picked up in 
the second half of 2004, as part of the government™s 
continued programme of spending aimed at improving 
public services. Growth in
 fixed investment, at 6.0% 
for 2004 as a whole, also contributed.  
Net trade, in contrast, continued to act as a significant 
drag on growth. The appreciation in the sterling 

effective exchange rate that had taken place during the 
second half of 2003 and 
into March 2004 initially 
dampened the potential ex
ternal stimulus, but the 
subsequent depreciation in the late-summer and 
autumn helped support export growth, which had 
begun to pick up in the second quarter. Countered by 

increasingly firm growth in 
import volumes, the 
overall negative contributio
n to growth was 0.9% over 
the year. In 2004, as in 2003, growth was led by the service 
sectors, particularly business services and finance, 
with firm support from the construction sector. 

Manufacturing output growth was less steady Œ a fall in output was evid
ent in both th
e first and third 
quarters, but the sector still recorded growth (of 1.3%) 
for the year as a whole. Output in this sector, 
however, remains below its 2001 level.   
Unemployment has remained close to record-low 
levels, at 4.7% in the three months to January 2005. In 

spite of this labour mark
et strength, average earnings grew only slightly faster than the previous year, and 
do not yet appear to have give
n rise to any significant 
inflationary pressure. Indeed, the harmonised index of 
consumer prices (known in the UK as CPI) remained 
well below the Bank of England
™s 2% inflation target 
throughout the year. Having raised policy interest 
rates by a cumulative 125 basis points between 
November 2003 and August 
2004 in anticipation of 
emerging price pressures, the Bank has since left 
interest rates unchanged.   Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
Firm growth is expected to
 continue throughout the 
forecast period, moderating slightly to around 2¾% in 
both 2005 and 2006. Final domestic demand should 
weaken in 2005 and 2006, particularly as household 

consumption slows as a consequence of the tightening 
in monetary policy already und
ertaken, but this should 
be partially offset by an improved export performance 

as global demand remains firm.  
The cumulative rise in
 interest rates to date is 
expected to lead to moderate household consumption 
93Economic Forecasts, Spring 2005 United Kingdom 
growth of around 2¼% in bo
th 2005 and 2006, partly 
through its impact in c
ooling the housing market. 
Since the autumn forecast, annual house price growth 

has eased; although monthly falls have occasionally 
been evident, the broad picture appears one of 
moderation, with little sign of significant price falls 

immediately apparent.  The overall impact on 
consumption from slower house price growth is not 
expected to be large, as the labour market remains 

strong, and household net wealth holdings are healthy; 
household debt has risen in recent years but does not 
seem to be a major risk. In
 addition, most equity 
released from the housing market appears to have 
been re-invested in housing
 improvements or used to 
purchase financial assets, and not to finance 

consumption. 
However, while the central projection is for private 
consumption to ease gently, there remains a high 
degree of uncertainty associated with this forecast. 

Risks of a significant rapid correction to house prices 
cannot be ruled out, but are judged to have receded 
slightly since the autumn forecast. Neither can it be 
excluded that a resumption of
 firm house-price 
growth would help boost consumption going forward.  
Growth throughout the forecast period will be 
supported by planned rises in government current and 
capital spending. Overall, fixed investment growth is 
expected to moderate slightly compared to the robust 

growth of 2004, particularly in construction 
investment, but the outlook remains positive; equity 
price rises should, all else equa
l, help lower the cost 
of capital, while there is evidence of high rates of 
capacity utilisation. Global economic growth should help support UK 
export performance, with ne
t trade providing an 
increasingly small drag on growth over the forecast 
horizon. An improved 
export performance, already 
evident in latest quarterly 
data, suggests that the unexpectedly large loss of export market share in 
2004 (shared with many of the UK™s international 
competitors) is unlikely to 
be repeated, though the 
increasing importance of China and other emerging 
markets in world trade means that some further 

erosion should be expected. Import growth, while 
slowing gently as consumption 
slows, should continue 
to be supported by firm growth in equipment 

investment.  
Labour market, costs and prices 
The moderate evolution of wage growth combined 
with good productiv
ity growth suggests that 
unemployment should remai
n low and stable at 
around its current level, near estimates of the NAIRU 
level, throughout the forecast period. Employment 
growth seems likely to slow, as employment levels 

are already relatively high by international standards. 
The apparent tightness of 
the labour market should 
lead to a gentle acceleration of wage growth, 

particularly if bonus 
payments reflect improved 
corporate profitability; how
ever, the need for 
companies to repair company pension balance sheets, 

together with strong competitive pressures (including 
through the po
tential for outsou
rcing) may help dampen wage growth relative to previous cycles. 
HICP inflation seems likely to continue to rise gently, 
to its 2% target by the end of the forecast period, as 
the small negative output gap closes. Producer prices 
continue to suggest emerging inflationary pressure, 

while rising import prices sh
ould exert upward 
pressure, particularly in 2005.  
Public finances 
General government finances 
recorded a deficit of 
3.2% of GDP in 2004, significantly higher than was 
implied by the autho
rities projections in the March 
2004 Budget. Stronger-than
-expected growth in 
current spending contribu
ted, as did disappointing 
growth in corporate tax revenues. 
For financial year 2004/05, the reference period for 
assessing the UK™s public finances, the latest official 

estimates suggest that the 
deficit will have fallen to 
2.9% of GDP (around 3.0% on an EDP basis).
i This 
modest improvement over the first quarter of 2005 

appears to result from a 
marked pickup in corporate 
tax receipts, offset by continued strength in current 
spending Œ the authorities 
note that this partly reflects 
the drawdown, by government departments, of 
previously unspent spending allocations. Some 
improvement is therefore evident, and the deficit is 

expected to narrow over the forecast period as 
revenues pickup relative to nominal income Œ but the 
rate of improvement is likely
 to be tempered slightly 
in 2005 by a slightly faster pace of growth in planned 
general government consumption relative to 2004.

Revenues should rise as 
a result of the strength in 
GDP growth, particularly if the recent pickup in 
corporation tax revenues is 
sustained. There is also 
potential for some further improvement from the 
impact of high oil pr
ices, although this is partially 
offset by higher indexed spending, based on a 

measure of inflation pushed upwards by higher fuel 
prices. On the expenditure side, growth in general 
government current consumpti
on is expected to slow 
in 2006, and if the public finances are to improve in 
line with plans, central government departments will 
need to ensure a successful adjustment to the tighter 

budgets. In this respect, the accumulated unspent 
balances from previous years, still available to 
departments (subject to par
liamentary approval), may 
present a risk to current spending plans. The 
authorities™ ongoing efforts to enhance public sector 
efficiency are not expected to have any net impact on 
the public finances, since the government has ear-

marked savings to be redirected to priority areas of 
the public services. In summary, the projected deficit declines to around 
3% of GDP in 2005 and further to around 2¾% in 

2006. The ratio of gros
s debt to GDP, though 
increasing slightly, is expected to remain close to 
40%.                                                           
iThe UK authorities include, in their estimate for the general 
government balance, annual receipts of around £1.0 billion from the 
sale of UMTS licences in 2000. Eurostat, following its own 

decision (News Release 81/2000 of 14 July 2000), adjusts these to 
bring the estimate onto an EDP basis, which has the effect of 
increasing the deficit by 0.1%.

current account balance
Developments in 2004 
The Bulgarian economy continued its expansion at a 
rate of 5.7% in the first 
three quarters 
of 2004 and 
most indicators point to a 
continuation of this trend in 
the fourth quarter. Grow
th was based on strong 
domestic demand fuelled by increases in net income, 
employment and bank credit. The stock of bank 

credits kept on rising at a rate of close to 50%, 
although from a low base and not yet accompanied by 
a decline of quality of ba
nks™ portfolios. While this 
resulted in high import grow
th, stronger expo
rts since the summer could not prevent the further deterioration 
of the trade deficit. On the supply side, a good 

harvest, a strong increase in industrial production and 
a good tourism season contributed to high output 
growth in 2004. 
Consumer price inflation was high in the first half of 
2004, but came down in the second half to a year-on-
year rate of 4% until December which resulted in an 
average rate of 6.2%. Unemployment decreased 

further from an annual avera
ge of 13.6% in 2003 to 
12.0% in 2004 since jobs are being created in the 
private sector and in government schemes for long-
term unemployed. The current account deficit, which 
had widened in 2003 to 9.3% of GDP, narrowed to 

7.4% of GDP in 2004, with 
all its balances turning out 
better except for the trade deficit. Net inflows of 
foreign direct investment
 were at record highs and 
matched the current account deficit in both years. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
GDP growth is expected to 
have reached 5.7% for the 
full year 2004, to accelerate to 6% in 2005 and to moderate to 4½% in 2006. The acceleration in 2005 
will be based on strong domestic demand resulting in 
a highly imbalanced growth com
position. In view of 
national elections in June 200
5, growth is stimulated 
by expansionary fiscal and wage policies and could 
show some signs of overheat
ing. This is likely to be 
followed by a smooth down
ward adjustment in 2006 
when public expenditure, wages and bank credits 
would increase at lower rat
es. This would rebalance 
the economy and bring it closer to its medium-term 
potential growth rate. 
The projected growth path 
will continue to trigger 
substantial imports given the still weak industrial base 

of the economy. Private consumption will remain very 
strong because of high credit growth, higher 
employment and increases in net income, the latter 

also arising from cuts in in
come tax rates and a 25% 
increase in the minimum wage at the beginning of 
2005 which could spill ove
r into other wage brackets. 
These effects on consumption are likely to moderate 
in 2006, but strong investment in view of the 
opportunities expected from EU accession in 2007 
should prevent the economy from a more significant 
slowdown. Net exports have a strongly negative 
contribution to GDP growth in 2005 until becoming 
less negative in 2006 as a result of a slower expansion 
of private consumption. 
In spite of only small increases in administered or 
regulated prices and excise 
taxes in 2005, consumer 
price inflation is unlik
ely to fall below 4% on average 
because of the upward pressure on prices arising from 

wage increases beyond wh
at is warranted by 
productivity growth. These effects should ease in 
2006, but increases in excise taxes and administered 

prices as well as catching-up effects will make it 
difficult to achieve an average inflation rate of less 
than 4%. 
Continued net employment gains should allow 
reaching an unemployment rate around 10% in 2006. 
This assumes that the induced increase in the 
participation rate is likely to 
be higher than the 
decline in the work
ing-age population. 
Public finances 
Following a higher than expected revenue 
performance in 2004, the 
general government budget 
achieved a surplus of 1.4% of GDP. The expected 
deficit in 2005 of -0.5% 
of GDP is in line with the

the substantial flexibility built into the budget. The 
continuation of a primary sur
plus, debt buy-backs and 
high GDP growth will further reduce the debt-to-GDP 
ratio over the forecasting horizon to a more 
sustainable level. 
External balances The deficit of the trade balance is expected to widen 
further in 2005 as a result of strong domestic demand. 
It is projected to decrease somewhat in 2006 due to 
more favourable terms of trade and a gradual 

improvement in competit
iveness arising from the high 
fixed investment in the 
past years. As a consequence, 
the current account deficit is forecast to remain high 
at 8½% of GDP in 2005 and to drop to 7% of GDP 

only in 2006. Favour

ts in tourism,

inflows related to both

investment.

Croatia - Contributions to GDP growth
real GDP growth
Developments in 2004 
GDP growth decelerated in the second and third 
quarter. This reduced the year-on-year growth rate in 
the first nine months to 3.9%, compared to 4.3% for 

the full year of 2003. Growth of fixed capital 
formation reached only 5.5% in the first nine months 
of 2004 after 16.8% in 2003, reflecting a gradual 

completion of public infrastructure projects. Private 
consumption continued to grow at a moderate 4%, 
slightly down from 4.1% in 2003. Real exports grew 

5.2% on the back of a particularly strong growth of 
merchandise exports (17%). Net exports contributed 
positively to GDP growth in
 the third quarter for the 
first time since 2002. On 
the supply side, a good 
performance of the manufacturing sector as well as a 
strong tourism season boos
ted gross value added. 
High-frequency indicators on industr
y, construction 
and retail trade performance 
suggest a continuation of a slightly decelerating growth trend in the fourth 

quarter of 2004.  
Average consumer price inflation increased slightly to 
2.1% in 2004 from 1.8% a 
year before, but end-year 
inflation went up to 2.7%, due to a significant rise of 
energy and transport prices in the second half of the 
year. The unemployment rate, according to labour 

force survey data, fell from 14.5% in the second half 
of 2003 to 13.8% in the first half of 2004, due to a 
strong increase in empl
oyment by 3%. The four-
quarter current account deficit, which reached 7% of 
GDP in 2003, narrowed to 6.1% by the end of the 
third quarter, due to strong
 export growth and a 
significant reduction of the income balance deficit. 
Net inflows of foreign direct
 investment in the first 
three quarters of 2004 accounted for 3.1% of GDP 
compared to 6% in 2003, also reflecting a slower pace 
of privatisation. Prospects for 2005 and 2006  
As a result of moderate private consumption and a 
significant reduction of pub
lic investment growth, real 
GDP growth is expected to have slowed to 3.7% in 
2004. Growth is expected to slightly accelerate to 
4.0% in 2005 and 4.3% in 2006, based on the 
assumption of continued privatisation, restructuring of 
industry and tourism and 
a generally positive external 
environment. Private consumption growth will stay at 
around 4%, while gross fixed capital formation 
growth will further decline 
in 2005, before slightly 
picking up in 2006, 
reflecting stronger private 
investment. Real exports are expected to increase 
markedly on the back of market share gains in 

manufacturing and a further expansion of the tourism 
industry. Real imports are forecast to grow more 
slowly than exports, but still at accelerating rates, 

driven by a high import content of exports, a strong 
domestic currency and falling trade barriers. Over the 
forecast period, domestic demand will continue to 
contribute around 3.8-3.9 percentage points to growth 
while net exports will add 0.
3 percentage points in 
2005 and 0.5 percentage points in 2006. 
Annual average consumer price inflation is forecast to 
increase to 2.7% in 2005 and 
2.8% in 2006, due to 
further adjustments of admi
nistrative prices and wage 
increases towards the end of the forecast period. This 
increase is limited due to c
ontinued relatively tight 
monetary conditions, a stable exchange rate and 

moderate domestic demand. Following an estimated 
rise of 1.5% in 2004, employment (according to the 
LFS) is forecast to grow by around 1-1.2%, 

supporting a gradual reduction of the unemployment 
rate from an expected 13.9% in 2004 to 13.3% in 
2005 and by 12.5% in 2006. Net employment growth 

will be facilitated by stronger private investment and 
increased labour mobility.  
Public finances 
Following lower than expected
 revenues in 2004, in 
particular a lower
 than budgeted co
llection of indirect 
taxes, the general government budget is expected to 
have reached a consolidated deficit of 5%, instead of 

the targeted 4.5%. The forecast assumes a reduction 
of the deficit to 4.4% in 
2005 and 3.9% in 2006, in

line with the governme
nt™s strategy to reduce the 
country™s investment-savings gap through a policy of 
fiscal consolidation. Over the forecast period, fiscal 

adjustment is expected to take primarily place on the 
expenditure side. Cost savings are expected to arise 
from continued downsizing of public administration 

personnel, the effects of health sector reform, and 
improved financial discip
line of public enterprises. 
Overall, compared to officially announced policy 

targets, the forecast assumes a slightly less ambitious 
fiscal adjustment, on both 
the revenue and spending 
side of the budget. Following an increase to 53.8% in 
2004, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to come 
down over the forecast horizon to around 52.5%. 
External balancesFavourable external demand 
conditions and improved 
competitiveness as a result 
of ongoing enterprise 
restructuring and private investment growth are 
expected to drive merchandi
se exports. Furthermore, 
terms of trade are expected to rise over the forecast 
horizon. As a result, the deficit of the trade balance is 
expected to fall further 
despite a continued relatively 
strong growth of imports. It is forecast to be reduced 
by 1.5% of GDP over 2005 and 2006 to around 24% 
of GDP. A substantial part of the trade deficits will 
continue to be counterbalanced by significant 
surpluses in the balances of 
services and, to a minor 
extent, net transfers from ab
road, while the deficit in 
the income balance is 
projected to slightly increase. 
The current account deficit, which is expected to have 
markedly improved to 5.3% of GDP, also on the back 

of a significant increase in net inco
me from abroad, is

Recent economic developments 
In 2003, real GDP grew by 5.2%. However, growth 
was increasingly unbalanced and mainly driven by 
domestic demand. Household consumption rose 

strongly by 7.2% driven 
by surging consumer credit 
and high wage growth.  With a real growth of 4.6% 
government consumption also expanded considerably. 

Gross fixed capital formation increased rapidly at 
9.1%, pointing to the on
going replace
ment of 
Romania™s capital stock. This strong domestic 

demand led to a significant
 import growth of 16.4%, 
while export growth decelerated, reaching 11.4%. 
Consequently, net exports 
turned strongly negative 
during 2003, and the trade balance widened 
significantly to 7.8% of GDP.  
For 2004, preliminary figures show that GDP grew by 
8.3%. Growth was driven by a further strengthening 

of household consumptio
n, growing by 10.8% 
annually, on the back of high real wage gains, and by 
strong gross fixed capita
l formation, growing by 
10.1%.  Although exports accelerated to a double-
digit growth rate, they continue to be outpaced by 
rapid import growth of both consumer and investment 
goods. As a result, the trad
e deficit widened further.  
Prospects for 2005 to 2006  
The outlook for Ro
mania™s economy 
points to strong 
growth, a further decline in inflation and a 

considerable current account deficit, which is mainly 
caused by high imports of goods and services but 
mitigated by increasing remittances and EU transfers. 
Relative to the Autumn 2004 forecast, the acceleration 
of domestic demand cause an upward revision of GDP 
growth for 2004. Growth
 would gradually moderate 
over 2005 and 2006 on the back of more subdued 
domestic demand, although 
projections for household 
consumption and gross fixed capital formation have 

been revised upwards due to considerable cuts in 
income and corporate profit taxation. 
GDP growth and components 
In 2005, private consumption is expected to remain 
strong due to the effect of
 tax cuts on disposable 
income, but is projected to decelerate slightly against 
2004 on the back of agreed energy price hikes and the 
normalisation of own consu
mption. In 2006, the fiscal 
reform will be fully phased in and private 
consumption should return 
to a more sustainable 
growth path. Investment gro
wth is expected to remain 
strong at above 10% annually over the forecast period 
due to the ongoing modernisation of production 
facilities, a structural ch
ange towards less labour-intensive production and am
bitious public investment 
projects. The cut in profit taxes would further 
underpin investment. Export growth, increasing 
inflows of FDI and improved access to financing will 
also support investment. The negative contribution to 

GDP growth from net exports will persist, but is 
expected to diminish in 2006. 
InflationInflation is expected to remain on
 a downward path. 
After consumer price inflation reached 11.9% on 

average in 2004, it is forecast 
to soften to 8.2% in 
2005 and further to 6.5% in 2006.  This continued fall 
is underpinned by a moderation of inflationary 

expectations in the economy and strong appreciation 
of the currency.  Productivity gains due to industrial 
restructuring and investments are also expected to 

contribute to mitigating inflationary pressures.  
Higher energy prices are expected to increasingly feed 
through from producer to consumer prices. In 

combination with the ongoing adjustment of 
administered energy end-user prices and robust 
economic activity, this may cause inflation to decline 
at a slowing pace in 2005-06. 
Labour market 
The unemployment rate is expected to remain stable 
at around 7% against the background of slowly falling

will continue to mitigate the effect from lay-offs 

caused by the restructuring 
of state-owned enterprises,

Against the background of 
strong revenue growth, the 
fiscal policy stance was adjusted during 2004 in order 
to bring the general government deficit down to 1.4% 

of GDP, compared to the originally budgeted 3.0% of 
GDP. In 2005, the fiscal stance is affected by the 
considerable cuts in 
income and profit taxes, which 
implies a revenue loss of around 1.5% of GDP. As the 
reform remains partly underfi
nanced, the significant 
revenue shortfall is expected to lead to an increasing 
general government deficit and debt. 
External balances Buoyant private consumpti
on and investment activity 
will continue to drive im
ports up and result in a 
persistent trade deficit.  The strong appreciation of the 
currency may also with a lag have a negative impact 
on the overall trade balance. Increasing remittances 

and EU transfers will mitigate the impact on the 
current account deficit over the forecasting period. 
High FDI inflows, improved access to international 

financial markets and large 
international reserves will 
facilitate the financing of the deficit.

Turkey - GDP growth 
 %04Q2
Developments in 2004 
In the first nine months of 2004, economic activity 
was very strong in Turkey. Private consumption and 
investment showed an impressive boom, leading to an 

output increase by nearly 9%, compared to some 6% 
in the same period a year ago.  The main underlying 
factors for this strong expansion have been improved 

political stability - fostering, consumer and business 
confidence - and a favourable economic environment 
with declining inflation 
and interest rates, rapidly 
expanding consumer credits
, tax incen
tives to scrap 
old cars and a strong currenc
y, supporting imports of 
consumer durables and investment goods. Overall, the 

surge in investment has recently brought capital 
formation back to its 
pre-crises level of 1998. GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter will likely continue to fall 

slightly, as indicated by 
several leading production 
indicators. Annual real GDP growth will thus amount 
to 7.7% in 2004.  Disinflation has remained stronger than expected, 
with a decline in 12-mont
hs consumer price inflation 
from some 25% on average in 2003 to around 9% in 
late 2004. Tight fiscal policies and the strength of the 
Turkish lira have helped to
 reduce inflation.  
The acceleration in domestic demand has led to 
widening of external defi
cits. In 2004, the current 
account deficit increased to EUR 12.5 billion, nearly 
the double of the value in
 the same period in 2003. 
Strong tourism receipts, traditionally peaking in the 

third quarter, mitigated th
e effect of rapidly rising 
imports less than anticipated.  
Government finances continued to improve in 2004. 
The general government deficit (in ESA 95 terms) 
reached 4% of GDP in 2004. Revenues benefited 

from strong growth, while expenditures were largely 
kept in line with budgetary 
targets. Interest payments 
on government debt fell dr
amatically by over 30% 
compared to 2003. 
Since mid-2004, labour markets have started to react 
to the increasing momentum in GDP growth. The 
number of employed persons increased by 2% in 

2004, while the number of unemployed persons 
declined only marginally. 
As a result, the average 
unemployment rate reached 10.3% in 2004. 
Prospects for 2005 to 2006  
After the strong growth in the first half of the year 
(almost 12% year-on-year) and a marked deceleration 
in the third quarter to 4.
7% year-on-year, th
e whole of 
2004 will see a very strong 
average growth of 7.7%. 
In 2005 and 2006, the Turkish economy is expected to 
continue its catching-up process, by realising 
relatively high growth. Thus, output growth at some 
5% in 2005 and 2006 ap
pears possible, reaping the 
benefits of improved political and economic stability. 

These rates would bring Turkey close to its long-term 
potential growth rates.  
Like in 2004, private consumption and fixed capital 
formation will be the main sources of growth over the 

forecast horizon. Indeed, despite potential dampening 
policies, consumer confiden
ce remains high in the 
country, indicating that domestic demand may be 

stronger and more resilient than the government 
projects. After years of
 postponed investment, 
substantial efforts are required to
 modernise and to 
deepen the capital stock. Increasing FDI inflows are 
expected to support the modernisation process. 
However, in view of the investment need, the bulk of 

investment will have to co
me from domestic sources. 
Overall, investment growth
 is expected to remain 
above 10% per year over the forecast horizon.  
In 2005, increasing administrated prices and high 
energy prices are likely to slightly raise inflationary 
pressures. However, the au
thorities™ end-year target of 
8% seems to be within reach. Disinflation is likely to 
continue over the next two years, based on declining 
inflationary expectations
, moderate wage growth and 
fiscal discipline. In such a scenario, consumer price 
inflation could decline to 
well below 7% by 2006.

After years of labour sheddi
ng, the Turkish economy 
will continue to increase its employment by rates 
similar to in 2004, by
 around 2% annually in 2005 
and 2006. However, the unemployment rate is likely 
to remain relatively high, as the projected job creation 
might just be enough to
 compensate Turkey™s strong 
growth in labour supply.  
Public finances and current account  
With the presently strong revenue growth, reaching 
the primary surplus target of 6.5% of GDP (according 
to GFS accounting) for 2005 appears to be feasible. 

This would translate in a general government deficit 
(in ESA 95 terms) of 4%. This deficit is forecast to 
fall further during the 2005-2006 forecast horizon to 

about 3% in 2006. 
Continued fiscal discipline and 
declining financing
 costs will be key in this respect. 
Significant primary surpluses and strong nominal 

GDP growth will help to reduce the general 
government gross debt ratio to around 70% of GDP in 
2006. However, as 
a result of the d
eclining impact of 
nominal GDP growth on the debt ratio, achieving 
primary surpluses will be in
creasingly important for 
maintaining the downward trend 
in the debt ratio.   
The external accounts are likely to register significant 
deficits. Import growth is expected to slow down in 
comparison to the boom in 
2004 but to still outpace 
the growth in exports. As 
a result the trade deficit will remain close to 8% of GDP in 2005-2006. Export 
growth is expected to
 remain relatively strong, 
although the lib
eralisation of textile trad
e in 2005 will 
bring additional comp
etition from low-wage countries 
for one of Turkey™s most important export categories. 

However, strong growth in
 service exports, mainly 
tourism, will help to maintain the current account 
deficit at sustainable levels, 
falling from 5.3% of GDP 
in 2004 to about 4% in 2005-2006.  105Chapter 5 Other non-EU Countries 1. United States of America

forecast
Solid expansion in 2004 
The US economy completed its third year of 
expansion on a strong note 
in 2004. Real GDP growth 
of 4.4%, the highest growt
h rate in five years, was 
driven by strong household and business spending. 
The increase in consumer spending was based on a 
substantial gain in real 
disposable income and a 
further drop in the household saving rate which, in 
turn, were fuelled by th
e long-awaited improvement 
in the labour market and a 
continuation of the house 
price boom. Business invest
ment, supported by 
record-high profits and lo
w interest rates, expanded 
by close to 10%, as did residential investment, which 

also benefited from favourable 
financing conditions. 
Government spending increased much less than in the 
first three years of the Bush administration and added 

only relatively little to ove
rall growth. Once again 
there was a negative contribution to growth from the 
foreign trade side, in spite of
 the fact that the dollar™s 
real effective value declined to its long-term average 
level in 2004. 
Employment growth resumed after two ﬁjobless- 
recoveryﬂ years, although it re
mained well below the 
usual increase for the third year of an economic 
upturn. The unemployment rate drifted lower which, 

in addition to job gains, 
was helped by the slowdown 
in labour force growth 
and the downward trend in 
labour force participation. 
Productivity growth slowed 
from extraordinarily high rates 
in the previous years 
and unit labour costs started 
to rise again. Inflation 
edged up against the background of higher energy 

prices and a continuing downward trend in the 
dollar™s exchange value (5% effective depreciation in 
2004). In the fourth quarter of 2004 overall CPI 
inflation reached 3.4% 
year-over-year. However, 
‚core™ inflation, measured by the price index for 

personal consumption expenditure less food and 
energy, remained contained at 1.6% in Q4 and 
inflation expectations stayed well anchored. 
The trends in the so-called 
‚twin deficits™ diverged in 
2004. While the current 
account deficit surged to 
5.4% of GDP on a national account basis (5.7% on a 
balance-of-payments basis),
 the fiscal deficit of 
general government fell to 4.4% of GDP. The small 
fiscal improvement was solely due to the sub-federal 
level; the federal deficit remained at 3.7% of GDP.  
Higher interest rates will curb domestic demand 
The Federal Reserve has removed monetary stimulus 
since June 2004 by raising sho
rt-term interest rates at 
a measured but steady pace. However, long-term rates 
have remained surprisingly 
low into early 2005, 
which has bolstered the expansion in the winter of 
2004/05. Looking 
forward, it is expected that 
household spending will sta
y relatively strong
 in the 
first half of 2005, benefiting from still accommodative 
financial conditions and 
the related rise in home 
prices and in spite of the dampening effect of higher 
energy prices. A slowdo
wn in household spending 
growth is expected to set in
 around the middle of the 
year as the Federal Reserve is 
poised to continue its 
campaign of raising the fed
eral funds rate to a 
‚neutral™ level. In this cont
ext, long-term rates should 
rise, also because the risks are perceived to be shifting 
in the direction of higher inflation as a consequence of 
lower productivity growth and
 the weaker dollar. At 
the same time, the fiscal thrust is disappearing due to 
the restraint in discretiona
ry federal spending. 
Business investment is also 
likely to slow
 down from 
the robust growth seen over the past two years, partly 

because profit margins will be reduced by the cyclical 
downturn in productivity growth. Residential 
investment, in particular, will receive a setback from 

rising long-term interest rates.  
The withdrawal of monetary and, to a lesser extent, 
fiscal stimulus will partly be offset by the trade effect 
of the dollar™s depreciation in 
the 2002-04 period. The 
gain in international co
mpetitiveness of US goods and 
services should now make ex
port volumes grow faster 
than import volumes (for 2005 only visible in 
quarterly forecast figures). Th
is would imply that net

exports would start to make a positive contribution to 
output growth in 2006. However, this effect will kick 
in later than the contraction
ary effects. Consequently, the quarterly profile of GDP growth is expected to be 
U-shaped over the forecast period with the low point 
being reached in the final quarter of 2005. 
Prospects for 2005 and 2006 
The forecast sees output growth at close to 4% at the 
beginning of 2005, but a deceleration would 
subsequently lower the 
annualised growth rate to 
below 3% in the second half of the year. Helped by an 

improving trade performance, output growth would 
then gradually return to 
an annualised growth rate of 
3½ % at the end of 2006. This profile results in annual 

growth rates of 3.6% in 2005 and 3.0% in 2006. The 
growth in consumer spending is projected to fall to 
2.5% in 2006, resulting 
in a stabilisation of the 
household saving rate. The
 unemployment rate is 
expected to fall marginally to 5.0% by the end of next 
year, i.e. not below most estimates of the NAIRU. 
Inflationary pressures s
hould remain contained over 
the forecast period as real wage growth per worker is 

expected to stay roughly in
 line with productivity 
growth. Overall CPI inflation is forecast to decline to 
2.3% in 2006. The fiscal deficit of general 

government is projected to fall to 3.8% of GDP in 
2006, while the current account deficit would rise to 
close to 6% of GDP. 
The risks to this forecast appear to be symmetrical. 
On the upside, there is the possibility of faster 
employment growth, further substantial gains in home 
prices, and a better-than-expected trade improvement. 

On the downside, a sharp rise in long-term rates, 
possibly in connection wit
h a loss of international 
investors™ confidence in the dollar, could result in a 

large negative wealth effect.

The economy experienced a technical recession in 
the middle of 2004 
Following annualised growth of 
around 6% in the first 
quarter of 2004, output expansion turned negative and 

declined in the second and the third quarters of the 
year. Whereas private domestic demand growth 
continued to be strong in
 the second quarter, a sharp 
reduction in public inves
tment together with a 
correction in inventories brought about the decline in 
the overall growth rate. In 
the third quarter, export 
growth slowed significantly and private consumption 
fell, with the result that 
GDP growth remained 
negative. In the fourth quarter, output expansion 

recovered to a modest 0.5%, helped by a build-up in 
inventories.  
In spite of these weak quarterly developments, the 
substantial overhang 
into 2004 and the strong growth 
rate in the first quarter resu
lted in annual growth rate 
of 2.7%, the largest increase since 1996.  
Growth is expected to recover in the first half of 
2005 
There are several reasons for expecting a rebound in 
growth in the first half of 2005. First, the global 
outlook appears to be relativ
ely benign and should as 
such be supportive to
 Japanese gr
owth. Second, production has been depresse
d by a major inventory 
adjustment in the electronics sector, which should 

come to an end. Third, a number of weather-related 
factors (in particular the unusually severe and 
numerous typhoons) had a dampening effect on 

growth in the second half of 2004.  
Private consumption should rebound as the overall 
compensation of employees in real terms has started 
to increase slightly, suggesting
 that the tendency to 
replace regular workers by lower paid temporary 
workers may be coming to an end. Machinery orders 
have also bounced back and point to a recovery in 

private investment. The high level of capacity 
utilisation and the surge 
in corporate profits 
throughout last year shoul
d also be supportive to 
capital expenditure growth. As 
the economy continues 
to be very dependent on external demand, the 
evolution of trade will be 
a key factor for the Japanese 
outlook.  Although the forecast for Japan is clouded by 
uncertainty, in particular from 
the external side, the 
annualised quarterly growth path is likely to hover 

around 1 ½%, resulting in an 
annual average of some 
1.1% in 2005 and 1.7% in 
2005. The fairly sharp 
downward revisions compared to the autumn forecast 

should be seen against the back
drop of the switch to 
chain-weighted price deflators that shaved off around 
1.3 percentage points from the annual growth rate in 
2004 and which also had implications looking 
forward. They also reflect the carry-over effect from 

the weak economic growth seen in the second half of 
2004. Core deflation remains persistent 
The year-on-year change in headline CPI turned 
positive last autumn, but th
is was largely due to a 
strong rise in the prices of fr
esh food. Core CPI, on 
the other hand, continued to fall, and in January this 
year the year-on-year fall stood at 0.3%. Price cuts in 

the telecommunication sector 
have contributed to the 
observed persistence of defla
tion. Given the very slow 
deceleration in underlying deflation and the lower 

growth projections, the year-on-year change in core 
CPI may turn positive only around the turn of the year 
or even later.  The labour market is improving Total employment has been rising somewhat, but 
whereas job creation has been strong in the services 
sector, the manufacturing 
sector has continued to 
reduce its workforce. There 
are initial signs that the tendency to replace regular workers with lower paid 
workers on temporary contracts, resulting in an 

overall fall in real wages per person, is gradually 
coming to an end. Unemployment declined last year

by around ½ a percentage point, and stood at 4.4% of 
the labour force in December. 
Monetary and fiscal policy roughly unchanged 
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has pledged to maintain the 
current quantitative easing policy, implying short-

term interest rates that are close 
to zero, until inflation 
has returned on a solid basis. Given the outlook for 
deflation, the BOJ is less likely to start raising the 

short-term interest rates during the forecast period. 
However, recently, the BOJ has not been able to inject 
the intended amounts of money into the financial 

system, suggesting that 
concerns about financial 
system stability are receding (which would induce a 
decline in the demand for 
precautionary liquidity). 
This raises the question as to
 whether the BOJ will 
lower the current quantitative target within the near 
future. 
As for fiscal policy, the government is maintaining its 
intention to reduce the prim
ary balance by around 0.5 
of a percentage point annual
ly. The aim is to achieve 
primary balance in the 
early 2010s, although neither a 
detailed consolidation pa
th nor more specific 
measures have been put forward.

1. The directorate general for
 economic and financial affairs (DG 
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short- term 
economic forecasts twice a year: in the spring and in the autumn. 

These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic aggregates for 
the Member States, the Candidate Countries, the European Union as 
a whole, the euro area and the international environment. 
2. Data for 2004 are estimates and 
those for 2005 and 2006 are 
projections. The sources for all tables are the Commission services, 
except where it is stated otherwise. In general, the historical data for 

the Member States are based on the ESA 95 system. For DE, IE and 
PT, data start in the late 1980s or ear
ly 1990s. For all other Member 
States, most data are reported for lo
nger periods in the past, except 
for the 10 recently-acceded member states for which ESA95 data 
start in the early or mid-
1990s. For the USA and Japan the 
definitions are as in the SNA.  
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand, respectively, 
present data including inventories. 4. In Table 16, the data are based on the national index for USA and 
Japan, and for EU Member 
States and the aggregates prior to 1996. 
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential 
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in 
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment 

and the NAIRU play a key role. The cyclical adjustment of 
budgetary balances is based on this concept, except for ES.  
6. Employment data are based on numb
ers of persons employed. The 
concept of full-time equivalent is used for Spain, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Austria and Estonia. Tables 21-27 and 31-32 use data 
on FTE for these countries.  7. The nominal short term interest rates are defined as the 3-month 
inter-bank rates. The nominal long term interest rates are defined as 
the yield on the central government 
benchmark 10-year bond from 
1995. 
8. EU-25 and euro area data are aggregated using exchange rates. 
World GDP is aggregated using Purc
hasing Power Standards (PPS). 
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the 
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates. 
Tables 48 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU25 and euro area "adjusted" 

balances. Theoretically, balances of EU25 and euro area vis-à-vis 
third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the 
individual countries in the EU25 or
 the euro area. However, intra-
EU25 or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of reporting 

errors.  The creation of the internal market in 1993 reduced border controls 
and formalities, and accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU 

trade coverage. Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated 
compared to intra-EU exports, leading to an overestimation of the 
surplus. For the past, the "adjusted" balances are Eurostat (for 

EU25) estimates and ECB (for euro area) estimates. For the future, 
they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the extrapolation of the 
discrepancies observed in 2003. 9. Tables 37, 38, 39 and 42 are based on government debt and deficit 
data for the period 2001-2004, as 
transmitted by Member States to 
the European Commission in March 2005. In publishing these data, 

Eurostat has indicated that, for certain Member States (Greece and 
Italy), it ﬁhas to undertake further examination of deficit and debt 
data before the figures can be validatedﬂ, while there are ﬁongoing 

discussionsﬂ with the national statistical authorities of Latvia, 
Lithuania and Portugal, ﬁwhich may 
lead to a subsequent revision of 
the dataﬂ (see Eurostat news release N° 39 of 18 March 2005). The 

data are according to the ESA95 system of national accounts. 
Interest expenditure includes settlements under swap arrangements 
and forward rate agreements (Tables 35, 37, 38 and 40). 
10. The allocation of mobile phone licences (UMTS) impacts strongly 
on the general government accounts for some countries in 2000-
2005. Tables 35, 37 and 39 include th
e amounts from the sale of the 
licences, while the cyclically adjusted balances in tables 40 and 41 
exclude these amounts. The amounts in bn of national currency are 
for 2000: DE 50.8, ES 0.5, IT 
13.8, NL 2.7, 
AT 0.8, PT 0.4, 
UK 22.5, EU25 105.9 and 
euro area 69.1. For 
2001: BE 0.5, CZ 7.4, 
DK 3.2, EL 0.6, FR 
1.2, PL 3.0, SI 21.
8, EU25 3.8 and euro 
area 2.3. For 2002: FR 0.
6, IE 0.2, EU25 0.8 
and euro area 0.8. For 
2003: EE 0.2. For 2005: SI 9.0. 
11. Second pillar pension funds are included in the general government 
sector in the following Member States (with the estimated effect as 
% of GDP indicated in brackets): DK (1.1 in 2001, 1.0 in 2002-

2003, 1.1 in 2004, 1.0 in 2005-2006)
, HU (0.7 in 2001-2002, 0.9 in 
2003-2004, 1.1 in 2005, 1.2 in 2006)
, PL (1.5 in 2001, 1.9 in 2002, 
1.7 in 2003, 2.0 in 2004, 1.9 
in 2005-2006) and SE (0.9 in 2001-
2003, 1.0 in 2004, 2005 and 2006). They  are excluded from the 
general government sector in the following MS : LV (0.4 in 2004-
2006), LT (0.3 in 2004, 0.5 in 2005-2006) and SK (0.5 in 2005 and 

1.0 in 2006). 
12. German, EU-25 an
d euro-area figures are 
for unified Germany from 
1991 onwards; from 1992 onwar
ds for percentage changes.  
13. With respect to the RAMS (recently-acceded Member States), which 
are presently in a transition phase, data may not always be directly 
comparable to the EU-15 Member States. 
14. Geographical zones are defined as follows :  
Euro area:  EUR-12 (EU-15 excluding 
DK, SE and the UK) Candidate countries: 
 Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Turkey. 
Industrialised Countries :  EU-25, Candidate Countries,
 USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
