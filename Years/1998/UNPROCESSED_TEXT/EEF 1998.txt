Overview
For 1998, favourable developments in the first half of the
year suggest that the Spring 98 Forecast is on track. GDP in
the EU is expected to rise by 2.9 % in real terms compared
to 2.8 % in the previous forecast. However, the composition of growth has changed: domestic demand is stronger,
particularly stockbuilding, while the external contribution
has shrunk under the influence of a deteriorating international environment.
With Japan facing an output contraction of 2.5 % of GDP in
1998, the crisis in Asia has deepened and spread to Russia.
As a result, world GDP and trade growth are cut by half in
1998 compared to 1997, to 2% and 4.7% respectively.
However they should pick up from 1999 onwards. The US
dollar that had been relatively stable vis–à–vis EU currencies since the beginning of 1998 has weakened considerably since August. Its depreciation of approximately
10% until mid–October 1998 has led to an appreciation of
EU currencies that weighs on export growth.
GDP growth in the EU is now expected to slow from 2.9%
in 1998 to 2.4% in 1999 whereas an acceleration to 3% was
forecast in the spring. The deceleration in EUR–11 is somewhat less pronounced. In addition to faltering exports, the
downward revision is explained by reduced confidence as
reflected in sharp stock market corrections which have undermined the spill–over from external demand to investment and private consumption. In 2000 the EU economy is
expected to reaccelerate under the influence of a better investment performance, but with an increase of 2.8 %, real
GDP growth remains under that of 1998 as the uncertainties surrounding the world economy are still large.
Thanks to stronger growth, employment in the EU should
increase by 1.2 % in 1998 and for the remainder of the forecast horizon job creation is expected to be 0.9 % per year.
This corresponds to a net increase of 4 million jobs in the
years 1998–2000. The unemployment rate falls from
10.0 % in 1998 to 9.0 % in 2000.
Mainly under the influence of falling import prices, inflation (measured by the private consumption deflator) has
been revised downward to 1.6 % in 1998 and 1.7% in 1999.
The inflation rate remains under 2 % in 2000.
The general government deficit should decline further to
1.8 % of GDP in the EU as a whole in 1998, mainly as a result of stronger growth and falling interest rates. The cyclically adjusted deficit hardly improves in 1998 in some
Member States suggesting a pause in the consolidation effort after the sprint in 1997 to meet the Maastricht criteria.
Several Member States will see a growing surplus on their
general government balance. For the EU as a whole the
general government deficit is expected to fall to 1.4 % of
GDP in 1999 and 1.2 % in 2000.

The international environment has deteriorated
considerably
Since the spring the international environment has deteriorated considerably. The Asian crisis has widened and deepened, the Japanese economy has worsened and the Russian
economy has plunged into crisis. There has also been contagion to Latin America and, to a lesser extent, central and
Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, given signs that the worst hit
Asian economies are already bottoming out, an expected
soft landing in the US and a continuation of accelerating
growth in the Europe Agreement countries, the expectation
is of a gentle pick–up in growth over the forecasting horizon in the world outside the EU.
The forecast for GDP growth in Japan has been again revised down significantly. In the spring growth was forecast
to slow sharply in 1998 to 0.4%; given the latest data the
economy is now expected to shrink by 2.5% in 1998 and
grow by a very modest 0.6% in 1999 and 1.7% in 2000.
Economic activity in ASEAN4 + South Korea also looks
likely to turn out considerably weaker than expected. However, the commitment of the authorities to policy reforms
and strong underlying growth potential in these countries
have already led to some improvements in sentiment.
Nevertheless, given the size of the contraction of GDP expected in 1998, positive growth is not expected here until
2000. The bottoming out of the crises in Japan and
ASEAN4 plus South Korea, coupled with continued robust
growth in other Asian economies should allow a reacceleration of growth in Asia as a whole over the forecasting horizon.
After finally achieving positive GDP growth in 1997
(0.4%), the Russian economy is back on a downhill track
following the events of August 1998. Indeed the slowdown
is set to accelerate in the absence of any change of policy.
The current forecast for the FSU (Former Soviet Union excluding the Baltics) is for GDP growth of –0.8% in 1998,
–0.7% in 1999 and –1.7% in 2000. The EAC (Europe
Agreement Countries) have been adversely affected by events in Russia and growth forecasts have been revised
down somewhat. GDP growth in the ten candidate
countries overall is nevertheless still expected to accelerate
in 1998, from 2.9% in 1997 to 3.3%, with a further acceleration to 3.7% in 1999 and 4.4% in 2000. Positive growth is
expected in all EAC countries this year with the exception
of Romania, where growth should turn positive by 2000.
Spill–over effects in Latin America are expected to bring
about some slowdown next year before growth picks up
again in 2000.
By contrast, news from the United States has been brighter
than expected. The GDP growth forecast for 1998 has been
revised up from 2.5% to 3.3%. Despite the gloomier international outlook a soft–landing is still expected for the
US economy with growth slowing to just above 2% in 1999
and 2000.

Overall world GDP growth is forecast to slow from 4.1% in
1997 to 2% in 1998, rising to 2.7% in 1999 and 3.5% in
2000. Given the expected slowdown in the EU economy in
1999, GDP growth in the world excluding the EU is set to
accelerate more rapidly, from 1.8% in 1998 to 2.7% in 1999
and 3.7% in 2000. In line with weaker than expected world
demand, the forecasts for imports have also been revised
downwards. Imports in the world excluding the EU are
now expected to slow by nearly three–quarters this year,
from 10.9% in 1997 to 3% in 1998. A gentle pick–up is
forecast to 4.4% in 1999 and 5.5% in 2000, to rates which
nevertheless remain much lower than those recorded in recent years. Extra–EU export market growth is set to slow to
4.6% in 1998 from 6.7% in 1997, in line with slowing
world demand, but should then pick up again.
The loss in external demand for EU economies described
above is partly offset by lower interest rates and falling
commodity prices, especially oil prices. The average price
of Brent crude in 1997 was 19.1 USD/barrel. In mid–August this year the price dipped briefly below 12 USD/barrel
before recovering again somewhat. Nevertheless, prices in
1998 Q3 were around 1/3 lower than in the same period a

Box 1: Technical Points
Unchanged policy assumption
The forecasts are made under the assumption of unchanged
policies. Only measures adopted or known in sufficient detail
are included. This is of particular importance in the field of
budgetary and monetary policy.
With regard to public finances most countries have recently
presented their budgets for 1999. The forecasts assume the
budgets are fully implemented. In the case of Italy, due to the
resignation of the government on 9 October 1998, the budget
forecasts for 1999 do not include any discretionary measures.
For 2000, the no–policy change assumption applies for all
Member States which implies that presently known measures
(if not one–offs) and trends are extrapolated. Figures are
compatible with ESA79 accounting rules, and the ratios are
calculated using the GDP 4th resource in the denominator.
The evolution of monetary variables is governed by technical
assumptions. Depending on the case, exchange rates are held
constant in nominal or real terms starting from a level observed in the recent past. Interest rates are set in order to have
a neutral impact on the economy.
ESA95
According to Council Regulation (EC) N° 2223/96 of 25 June
1996, the new European system of accounts called ESA95
shall be applied for data to be transmitted to Eurostat from
April 1999 onwards. Until then Member Countries may use
the old system of accounts, called ESA79 (or ESA Second
Edition). Denmark was the first country to use ESA95 accounts and the Commission’s Autumn 1998 forecasts are established on the new statistical basis for the first time. A
transitional provision of the above regulation stipulates that

year earlier. Although developments in the former Soviet
Union and Iraq especially inject a significant element of
uncertainty into the outlook, with the approaching winter in
the northern hemisphere and the risk that OPEC will resort
to revenue boosting measures it is assumed that prices will
rise gently over the forecasting horizon. On average, oil
prices in 1999 are assumed to be about 4  % higher than in
1998, accelerating to an increase of around 7% in 2000.
The strong downward revision in non–oil commodity
prices since the spring is due largely to the effects of the
Asian crisis. It is estimated that Asia accounted for around
2/3 of the growth in energy and other commodity consumption between 1992 and 1997 so the dramatic fall in economic activity in the region has caused a substantial fall in
demand and thus prices.

The economy of the European Union
1. Recent developments
On the one hand, world growth prospects have been sharply revised down due to the worsening and the broadening of
the financial crisis that started in Asia last year. On the
other hand, EU internal demand has displayed throughout

Member Counties should report to the Commission public
deficit and debt figures under the excessive deficit procedure
(Regulation EC N° 3605/93) according to ESA79 until 1 September 1999. For this purpose in the current forecasts for
Denmark, an adjustment line was introduced in order to allow
for the difference in the public deficit under ESA95 and
ESA79.
The UK moved to ESA95 on 24 September 1998. The tables
in the Autumn 1998 forecasts have, hence, been prepared for
the first time in line with the ESA95 definitions. The changes
to historical data are significant and embody other methodological changes including re–basing.
Italy: 1998 Tax reform
A tax reform became effective in Italy from 1 January 1998.
Due to this reform there are breaks in several series of data between 1997 and 1998. The establishment of IRAP (Imposta
regionale sulle Attività Produttive), which is a tax on value
added replacing health contributions and other direct taxes,
has the effect of considerably increasing, on the one hand indirect taxes, and on the other decreasing direct taxes and social contributions in 1998 compared to 1997. The estimated
amount of the reallocation of tax revenues according to the
tax reform is close to 4% of GDP. In addition to the field of
public finance the interpretation of series involving nominal
compensation per head (which includes social security contributions) is blurred. The sharp drop in this variable does not
suggest that disposable income declines. On the other hand
the fall in unit labour costs is genuine, but does not mean that
inflationary pressures are reduced by the same token as the
tax base is shifted to other production factors. Given the
weight of Italy, the European average is also visibly influenced.

1998 genuine signs of a strength that had not been observed
since the beginning of the 1990’s. The EU economy cannot
stay immune from the mounting uncertainties in the world
economy, a slowdown is forecast in EU GDP growth in
1999, due to a combination of falling export performance
and deteriorating business confidence.
Quarterly GDP figures for the first half of 1998 have developed roughly as anticipated in the Spring 1998 Forecast.
Based on a preliminary estimate by Eurostat, GDP in
EU–15 grew 0.6% qoq and 3.3% yoy in 98Q1, before slowing to 0.2% qoq and 2.0% yoy in 98Q2. However, one
should not pay too much attention to this apparent deceleration, largely due to working day variations. Recent data
and indicators suggest a relatively buoyant 98Q3 that
would allow a GDP growth of 2.9% for the year 1998 as a
whole.
Industrial production growth in the EU as a whole peaked
during 97Q4 and 98Q1 at around 5% yoy (harmonised seasonally adjusted Eurostat data). Since, it has slowed moderately to around 4% yoy in 98Q2. Germany, France and
Spain have recorded rather strong increases according to
data available until July 1998, while more subdued or stagnant growth rates were observed in Italy and the UK.

Survey indicators to September 1998 provide a clear confirmation of the dichotomy between domestic activity and
external threats. The EU economic sentiment indicator,
which summarises the information contained in several
surveys, peaked in July 1998, and has since experienced
sharp drops. Although a large part of it is explained by the
collapse in stock markets, declining industrial confidence
has also played a role. It appears that business confidence
peaked in March–April 1998. This fall owes much to
growing concerns in the export sector. Export order–books
have seen a turn–around at the beginning of the year, although it is impossible to split extra from intra–EU trade.
The robustness of intra–EU trade probably hides a much
larger fall of extra–EU export order–books. A totally different picture is painted by more domestic–oriented surveys. Despite a slight drop in August consumer confidence
remains remarkably stable and high, at a level close to its
peak of the previous cycle, while sentiment in the retail
trade remains steady. Following several difficult years,

construction confidence is now recovering markedly. As
regards capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry, the
latest survey made in July shows that it increased marginally by 0.1 point compared with April 1998 to the high level
of 83.6%.
2. Monetary conditions
Short–term interest rates in Germany have remained close
to 3% since October 1997 when the Bundesbank last
raised its repo rate to 3.3%. In the first three quarters of
1998 convergence among money market rates in EUR–11
economies has continued but spreads remain larger than
100 basis points in the cases of Ireland and Italy. For the remainder of 1998 monetary policy in EUR–11 will be determined by the need to bring money market rates into line by
the beginning of 1999 when the ECB takes responsibility
for monetary policy. As monetary policy is already widely
co–ordinated among designated members of the union a
smooth changeover can be expected. The interest rate cuts

–6–

in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal in October 1998 brought
short–term rates further down in these countries.

GRAPH 7: Yield spread (long minus short–term interest rates)
3

Outside EUR–11 short–term rates in the UK had risen several times to 7.5% before they were cut in October by ¼
percentage point. Confronted with exchange rate pressures
Denmark had to briefly hike its interest rate. In the USA
short term rates had been more or less stable close to 5½%
until the Fed cut rates in late September and mid–October.
Although already low, short–term interest rates in Japan
were cut in October (from ½ to ¼%) in order to avoid the
unintended monetary tightening resulting from the combination of slower growth, weaker demand and unchanged
interest rates.
Long–term interest rates reflect the absence of inflationary
pressures as well as the temporary appearance of extraordinary factors (a second flight–to–quality wave immediately
following the emergence of problems in Russia) sending
yields to historical lows in the euro area. Convergence of
inflation rates among most countries that will join monetary union in 1999 has further supported convergence of
long–term interest rates in 1998. However, unlike short–
term rates, temporarily differentials between rates in Germany and other parts of the euro area have become larger
than in early 1998 during certain periods.

The situation is somewhat different outside EUR–11.
While yields in Denmark and Sweden are close to the level
of the EMU core countries, UK bond yields are currently
approximately 70 basis points above euro area yields since
the UK is further on in the business cycle than EUR–11
economies. This is also visible in the inverted UK yield
curve. Since the drachma entered the ERM the spread between Greek government bonds and German Bunds has
narrowed to approximately 280 basis points at the beginning of August, before widening to around 460 b.p. in the
first weeks of October.

There has also been a flattening of yield curves in many
Member States. However, this is due to a fall in long rates
and cannot be viewed as having the same leading indicator
properties (suggesting a downturn) as in periods without
extraordinary factors. Although interest rates are relatively
low in nominal terms the absence of inflationary pressure
results in real interest rates in the euro area, which are still
higher than in the USA.

Foreign exchange markets outside the ERM have displayed a lot of volatility over the course of 1998. In early
October the US dollar has continued to depreciate vis–
à–vis the JPY and the DEM. In the second week of October
the US dollar was trading around 1.65 DEM which is clearly below the rates observed in the first eight months of the
year (between 1.70 and 1.85 DEM/USD).

The technical assumptions for exchange rates imply fixed
nominal exchange rates between ERM currencies, and
fixed real exchange rates between ERM currencies and the
other European as well as non–European currencies. Exchange rates for the fourth quarter of 1998 are set at the average of historical daily data between 24 September and 9
October 1998, the starting period for the calculations. It
implies a DEM/USD rate of 1.65 and a ECU/USD rate of
0.84. For Denmark and Greece constant bilateral exchange
rates are assumed against the other ERM participants. For
the euro–area, the bilateral exchange rates (DEM/FRF,
DEM/NLG, FRF/NLG, …) are set at the ERM central rates
as announced on 2 May 1998 by the Finance Ministers at
the European Council. The conversion rates into euro
(DEM/EURO, NLG/EURO, FRF/EURO, …) are as yet
unknown because three currencies (DKK, GRD, GBP) are
in the ecu basket but are not participating in EMU. These
rates are set so that the external value of the ecu does not
change (article 109 l (4) of the Treaty) taking into account
that 1 ECU = 1 EURO (article 2 of Council regulation No
1103/97, OJ L 162 of 19.6.1997). These technical assumptions imply an appreciation of the euro in nominal effective
terms by 5% in 1999.

Stock markets have faced increased volatility in the first
three quarters of 1998. From spring stock markets in
Europe and the US rallied to new all–time peaks in July.
However, increasing concern about developments in Asia
and Russia have since contributed to a downward reaction
of stock prices. In some cases stock prices have even fallen
below levels seen at the beginning of the year. The impact
of these movements on the real economy can be expected to
differ significantly between the regions affected. In most
Member States the share of private households’ wealth
held in equities is still small compared to the USA. This
suggests a limited impact of changes in stock prices on private wealth and on private consumption. Confidence effects are difficult to assess, but should be monitored carefully.

3. Sound growth factors underpin robust domestic
demand

ability is higher than in the 1960’s and is approaching that
of the USA. Long–term interest rates are historically low
and prices for oil and commodities have fallen to record
low levels.

In the troubled waters of the world economy, the EU appears to be an island of relative stability. Indeed, the EU
economy is reaping the fruits of its past efforts with the
soundness of current macro–economic fundamentals justifying its status of safe–haven. The macro–economic environment of the EU is characterised by low nominal interest
rates, stable European currencies in expectation of the
euro, and already well–advanced budgetary consolidation.
This will not make the EU economy completely immune
from the world financial storm, but will protect it to a large
extent. Strongly positive growth forces remain at play in
the EU economy, and help sustain domestic demand. Private consumption benefits from purchasing power gains
due to falling inflation, the pick–up in employment and the
overall confidence climate shown by households in the surveys. Following several years of subdued consumption,
this demand factor for investment is now in place. In addition, supply–side conditions were already very supportive
for investment. They have further improved. Real wages
are growing less rapidly than productivity. Capital profit-

The clouded international environment is assumed to
weigh down on the forecast mainly in 1999. A significant
downward revision from 3.0% to 2.4 has been applied to
GDP growth in EU–15. A reacceleration is expected for
2000 (2.8%), assuming a « normalisation » of the world
environment.
As regards demand components, exports had represented
the main driver of activity in 1997. This dynamic has enabled a spill–over into the domestic economy with investment and consumption clearly picking up in 1998, following years of subdued growth. Investment and private
consumption in the EU are estimated to grow by 4.7% and
2.6% respectively in 1998. However, a slowdown is forecast in the growth rate of exports from last year’s almost
10% to between 6.5% in 1998, 4.7% in 1999, and 6.1% in
2000. This loss of external demand, directly affecting the
contribution of net exports to growth, is also expected to

weigh down on output performance in the EU via a negative effect on business confidence. Some slowdown isforecast in equipment investment growth from almost 8% this
year to 5.2% next year, together with a negligible contribution of inventories. On the other hand, construction investment is set to accelerate gradually while private consumption is forecast to grow steadily at around 2½% per year
until 2000.
Given the weight of the EUR–11 aggregate in the total it is
not surprising that differences with the EU as a whole are
slight. However, EUR–11 displays both a slightly better
growth performance and a greater cyclical homogeneity.
Although, some countries (e.g., IRL, FIN, P) grow much
faster than the aggregate, they still display the same cycle.
Compared to EU–15, in EUR–11 GDP growth (from this
year onward) is slightly stronger, inflation lower, trade and
current account surpluses larger and short term interest
rates lower, but public sector deficits and unemployment
are higher. Turning to growth components, domestic demand in EUR–11 is clearly accelerating from 2.0% in 1997
to 3.2% this year, before settling around 3.0% in 1999 and
2000. Domestic demand is taking over from exports which
were the main engine for growth in the years 1996 and
1997.
4. All Member States affected by the deteriorated global outlook
The ongoing synchronisation of business cycles among
most Member States of the European Union is reflected in
similar outlooks. The four big countries that will join EMU
(Germany, France, Italy, Spain) belong to this category especially. For economies not participating in EMU some
more pronounced differences are evident.
Germany
Economic activity gathered substantial momentum in the
first half of 1998 as GDP grew at an annualised rate of 3.4%
(seasonally adjusted). In contrast to 1997, when stocks and

net exports were the main determinants, growth was supported by contributions from all domestic components except construction investment. Against the backdrop of the
strong performance in the first half of the year, annual output growth in 1998 is expected to accelerate compared to
last year’s 2.2% and to remain close to the 2¼% level in
1999 and close to 2½ in 2000. In contrast to many previous
years of expansion in Germany, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth will be virtually negligible because
net exports are affected by the deterioration of the external
environment. Therefore the driving force of future output
growth will be domestic demand. Private consumption will
continue to accelerate moderately, supported by low price
rises and a sustained improvement in labour incomes. The
contribution of government consumption will be small but
distinctly positive in 1998 with some acceleration starting
next year as a further slight loosening of the budgetary
stance takes hold. Although the strong growth of equipment investment will be partly compensated for by a
further fall in construction investment in 1998, overall
capital formation is expected to grow much more strongly
than last year. While equipment investment is expected to
slow down from the current year, not least due to uncertainty regarding the effects of the international crises, for
construction investment a slow recovery is forecast on the
basis of some encouraging recent developments in orders
and the expected acceleration in public work projects. Total
investment is expected to continue to support economicgrowth in 1999 and 2000 as continued high profitability
and the transition to the euro act as a stimulus for enterprises to renew their capital stock. Due to continued economic expansion the labour market should continue to improve gradually. However, job creation will be limited at
first, accelerating only towards the year 2000. Inflationary
pressures remain low, thanks to continued wage moderation and the decline in import prices. Further contributions
to price stability stem from the depreciation of the US dollar
since mid–1998 and a technical effect whereby the impact of
the April 1998 VAT increase on prices falls out of the figures.

France
Following a recovery very much driven by exports in 1997,
1998 has seen a clear rebound of domestic demand, yielding a GDP growth rate of 3.1%. The acceleration is remarkable : after 2 years of subdued growth (0.9% per year),
internal demand is estimated to accelerate by 3.8% in 1998,
benefiting in particular from good employment performance and record low inflation. All demand components experience this improvement. Private consumption grows by
a very strong 3.6%, while equipment investment also picks
up markedly by 8.9%. The 0.8% growth rate of construction investment may look rather subdued, but it represents a
true turn–around compared to previous years. Logically
given both worse external demand and healthy domestic
demand, the contribution of net exports to growth in 1998 is
estimated to be clearly negative. A negative contribution
from the external side is forecast for 1999 as well, but to a
lesser extent. Uncertainties in the world economy are assumed to weigh down on the forecast for 1999, not so much
through trade but through domestic demand. Falling business confidence, already visible in surveys, is expected to
fuel more prudent behaviour in terms of equipment investment and stockbuilding. Private consumption is also expected to return to a more normal pattern. As a result GDP
growth is forecast to slow somewhat in 1999 to 2.6%, before reaccelerating slightly to 2.8% in 2000. Moderate improvement is expected in the public sector deficit, which

should fall from 2.9% of GDP this year to 2.3% in 1999 and
1.9% in 2000. The debt to GDP ratio is forecast to start falling
from 2000.
Italy
After accelerating in the middle of 1997, real GDP growth
weakened in the following quarters. The annual rate of
growth slowed from 2.5% in the first quarter of 1998 to
1.1% in the second quarter leaving an expected average
growth rate for the year as a whole of only 1.7%. Real GDP
growth is expected to accelerate gradually in 1999–2000,
to approach its trend rate of about 2.5%. Domestic demand
continued to be sustained in the first half of 1998, as a result
of a large accumulation of stocks and favourable developments in equipment investment. The deceleration of private consumption reflects the gradual phasing out of tax incentives on car sales, the squeeze on personal disposable
income and some deterioration in households’ confidence.
Private consumption is expected to improve in the period
1999–2000 thanks to better employment prospects, improving real disposable income and lower interest rates.
Total investment is expected to strengthen (from 3.3% in
1998 to 6.7% in 2000), as result of better demand prospects
and a lower cost of capital. Lower world demand will reduce export growth in 1999, while in 2000 some improvements are expected. Import growth is likely to decelerate in
1999 with the fading out of the car incentive scheme, which
boosted imports in 1997–98. Employment is expected to

– 11 –

improve gradually during the forecast period (+0.3% in
1999 and +0.6% in 2000). Positive effects are expected
from the newly introduced measures for higher flexibility
in the labour market and from the initiatives aiming to reduce labour costs in the depressed areas. Inflation has remained subdued (2.2% in 1998) and is expected to remain
so, thanks to wage moderation, low commodity prices and
the slow pace of economic recovery. The introduction of a
wide–ranging fiscal reform has influenced the timing of tax
receipts, but the 2.6% deficit target for the year should be
met. As the government fell over the adoption of the 1999
budget the no policy change assumption points to a deficit
of around 2.3% of GDP. The Draft Budget Law for 1999 introduced measures of additional revenues and savings for
0.7% of GDP (according to government estimates), of
which around 0.3% are aimed at financing employment
measures and tax relief for the poorest households. The reduction in the deficit to 2.0% of GDP in year 2000 is mainly
due to lower government interest payments.
United Kingdom
Growth remained stronger than expected in the first half of
1998 so the forecast for the year as a whole has been revised
up to 2.5% from 1.9% in the spring. However there are now
clear signs that the economy is slowing in response to monetary and fiscal tightening. The impact on trade has been
particularly marked with the negative effects of the
strength of sterling exacerbated by the crisis in south east
Asia. GDP growth is forecast to fall back to 1.3% in 1999
before rising again to around trend at 2.1% in 2000. Inflationary pressures in the UK economy are subdued, helped
by weak world wide commodity prices, and look set to remain so. The private consumption deflator is forecast to increase by about 2% in all three forecasting years. Buoyant
recent revenues and ongoing consolidation resulting from
announced plans should ensure that the public finances remain close to balance over the forecasting horizon, in line
with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Spain

ported by buoyant demand, high profits, low interest rates
and a high rate of capacity utilisation. It is forecast to slow
down in 1999 (growth rate of about 8%) as a result of the
slight internal demand deceleration and the less dynamic
external markets. Investment in construction is foreseen to
recover strength progressively in the forecast period,
owing to lower interest rates and to higher public construction. This year’s acceleration from 1.3% to 6.2% will be
continued in the years 1999 and 2000 for which growth
rates close to 8% are expected.
Other economies
The smaller Member States displayed very robust growth
over the course of 1998. Eight of these ten economies (all
except Belgium and Denmark) are expected to exhibit
GDP growth above the EU average in the years 1998 to
2000. The Netherlands are expected to complete a five–
year–roll of economic growth close to 3% p.a. in
1996–2000, even displaying an acceleration towards 3%
this year mainly due to strong domestic demand. Strong domestic demand exceeding GDP growth in 1998 and 1999 is
also expected in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Portugal, and Sweden. In Greece domestic demand is expected to
become the engine of economic growth next year driven by
strong investment and a progressive rise in private consumption. While the foreign contribution to growth is expected to remain positive though considerably declining in
Austria, significant support from net exports is still expected in Ireland adding the years 1998 to 2000 to the success story which becomes evident in an average annual
growth of 7.7% in the 1990s, well ahead of the second
fastest growing economy, Luxembourg (4.7%), and considerably ahead of the rate of 2.0% for the EU as a whole.

GDP rose at an annualised rate of 3.8% in the first half of
1998, a rate which is expected to be sustained during the
rest of the year. As a result, for 1998 as a whole, GDP
growth is forecast to grow by around 3.8%. Economic activity in 1999 is expected to decelerate slightly, especially
during the first quarters of the year. In 2000, GDP growth is
foreseen to stabilise at around 3.5%. With regard to the
components of growth, in the first half of 1998 domestic
demand remained strong, led by private consumption and
investment in equipment, whereas the external sector had a
negative contribution to GDP growth. Private consumption
is expected to increase by 3.4% in 1998, mainly sustained
by continued strong job creation. In 1999 it is expected to
accelerate, partially due to the income tax reform which
will raise households’ disposable income. Investment in
equipment registered a growth rate of 11% in 1997, and for
1998 it is expected to accelerate further to 12.5%, sup-

5. Employment creation improving
Employment in the EU is forecast to increase by 1.2% in
1998 following two years of only very moderate increases
(0.1% and 0.4% respectively). In the years 1998–2000
economic expansion in the European Union will add 4
million new jobs (in net terms) to the economy. Given a

steady increase in the labour force of approximately %
p.a. this is transformed into a decline in the number of registered unemployed by roughly 2 million. This forecast
performance contrasts sharply with fears of ’jobless
growth’ expressed until very recently. It becomes more and
more evident that both favourable supply–side conditions
and the expectation of a sufficiently long lasting period of
economic expansion are a conditio sine qua non for improvements in the labour market.

(stronger competition, higher price transparency). The average annual rise in EU–15 of the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) was 1.3% in August 1998, down from
1.5% in July 1998 and from 1.8% a year earlier. The highest
rates were reported in Greece (4.7%), Ireland (3.0%), Italy
and Portugal (both 2.2%). The lowest rates were in France
and Sweden (both 0.6%), Germany and Austria (both
0.7%). The harmonised index for EUR–11, the monetary
union index of consumer prices (MUICP) stood at 1.2% in
August 1998 down from 1.4% in July and a year ago.

In 1998 the improvement in employment creation is shared
by all Member States except Denmark, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Finland and the UK where figures were well
above the Union average both in 1997 and 1998. The
biggest increases in employment between 1997 and 2000
are forecast for Ireland (+11.2%), Spain (+8.8%), Luxembourg (+8.4%), the Netherlands (+6.3%) while employment is expected to grow only moderately in Italy (+1.2%)
and in Germany (0.9%).

Between 1998 and 2000 unemployment rates are expected
to decline in all Member States bringing the EU average
rate down to 9.0% in 2000. Only in Luxembourg which displays the lowest levels in all years is the unemployment rate
increasing, despite strong employment creation. This is
explained by the large share of new jobs which are captured
by border workers but not counted in the Luxembourg labour force. The strongest improvements between 1996
and 2000 are expected for Spain (–6.5 percentage point),
Finland (–5.8 percentage point), Ireland (–5.4 percentage
point) and the Netherlands (–3.7 percentage point).

Inflation as measured by the private consumption deflator
is expected to decline further (from 2.1% in 1997) and to
remain at levels slightly below 2% in the years 1998 to
2000. A considerable degree of convergence is also expected for 1999 and 2000. The factors that slow inflation
are falling imported input prices, the decline of commodity
prices, the pass–through from the depreciation of the US
dollar starting in summer, and falling unit labour costs due

6. Inflation remains moderate
The downward trend observed since 1991 in inflation rates
continued due to supporting factors from the wage front
leading to subdued rises in unit labour costs. Downward
pressures on inflation also come from the supply side

to wage moderation. Even increases in indirect taxes in
some Member States have not shown up significantly in the
average inflation rate. In 1998 a decline in inflation rates is
observed in most Member States. Only Ireland, Portugal,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg display higher rates than
in 1997.

expenditure rather than by increasing the revenues of general government as a percentage of GDP. From a peak of
52.5% of GDP in 1993, general government total expenditure for the Union as a whole kept decreasing year after to
year to reach about 48.1% of GDP in 1998. For 1999 and
2000, general government expenditure may well decrease
further to 47.7% of GDP and 47.2% of GDP respectively.
Current receipts of general government as a percentage of
GDP have been increasing at a rather slow pace. During the
last five years current receipts represented around 46% of
GDP, with only small variations.
The decline in the public debt, which started in 1997 when
the debt/GDP ratio fell by a full percentage point to about
72%, is expected to continue through the forecast period. In
1998 and 1999 the debt/GDP ratio will fall to 70% and
69% respectively, while in 2000 it will be just over 67%. In
1998 the debt/GDP ratio is expected to fall in all Member
States except France and Luxembourg, where it nevertheless remains relatively low compared to the EU average. In
Ireland the debt/GDP ratio is expected to fall by about 10
percentage points annually during the 1998–2000 period.
In this way, by 2000 Ireland will have the second lowest
debt/GDP ratio (34.4 %) in the EU, while it had the second
highest ratio in the EU (peak level of 114.9 %) in 1987.
8. EU current account surplus set to decline

GRAPH 16: General government expenditures and receipts–
EU–15

A slowdown in EU exports stemming from a shift from external to domestically driven growth results in a gentle decline in the current account surplus over the forecasting
horizon. In EU–15 the surplus declines from a peak of 1.5%
of GDP in the years 1997 and 1998 to 1.4% in the years
1999 and 2000. In EUR–11, excluding the UK which is in
significant deficit, the surplus is forecast to fall from this
year’s and next year’s 1.9% to 1.8% in 2000. By contrast,
the current account surplus in Japan has grown rapidly over
the past few years and is forecast to continue rising to 4.0%
of GDP by 2000. The US deficit is also expected to continue
widening, from –1.7% of GDP in 1997 to –3.3% in 2000.

1997 saw an important progress in budget consolidation
across Europe, with the EU average budget deficit falling to
2.3% of GDP from 4.2% of GDP in 1996. In 1998 some improvement in the average EU deficit/GDP ratio is expected
in the order of half of a percentage point (1.8% of GDP)
thanks to stronger growth and lower interest rates. The
cyclically adjusted deficit hardly improves. Including the
available national budgets for 1999 and based on the assumption of unchanged policies for 2000, the deficit/GDP
ratio will continue to decline to 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. Six countries are expected to show a surplus in their
budgetary balances in 1999 (DK, IRL, L, FIN, S and the UK).
Budget consolidation has mainly progressed in the European Union over the past few years through a decrease in
