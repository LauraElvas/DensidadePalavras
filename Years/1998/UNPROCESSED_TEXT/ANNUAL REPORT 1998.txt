Mersch, C. Noyer, W. F. Duisenberg, B. Nyboe Andersen, J.-C. TrichetForewordECB Annual Report Ł 19982At the beginning of May 1998 the EUCouncil€Œ meeting in the composition of the
Heads of State or Government€Œ unanimouslydecided that 11 Member States, namelyBelgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria,Portugal and Finland, fulfilled the necessaryconditions for the adoption of the single
currency on 1€January 1999. One month laterthe European Central Bank (ECB) wasestablished, which took over the tasks of
the European Monetary Institute (EMI).Thereafter, preparations for the start of StageThree of Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) intensified and were finalised. Duringthis process, the Governing Council ofthe ECB endorsed the stability-oriented
monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem,i.e.€the ECB and the national central banks(NCBs) of the 11 Member States which
adopted the euro at the start of Stage Three.This strategy provides a definition for pricestability as the primary objective of the
single monetary policy of the Eurosystemand is based on two pillars, namely aprominent role for money and a broadly
based assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments and the risks to price stability,using financial and other economic indicators.This Annual Report, which is the first one tobe published by the ECB, provides a recordof the developments in the economic
environment for monetary policy in 1998,both for the euro area and for the non-euroarea Member States, and the steps taken to
finalise the operational framework forMonetary Union. The Report also covers thefirst few weeks of 1999 after the start of
Stage Three of EMU. I should like toemphasise the fact that the smoothchangeover to the euro crowned the
preparatory work conducted by the EMI andthe NCBs. At the start of Stage Three a fullyfledged Eurosystem was operational in
technical and organisational terms. I shouldlike to express my great appreciation for thework performed by the management and the
staff of the EMI and the ECB as well as theNCBs for their outstanding contribution tothis work.The Eurosystem has assumed responsibilityfor the single monetary policy at a time when
inflation rates are compatible with pricestability and when prospects for themaintenance of price stability in the euro
area are favourable. Interest rates arehistorically low and this situation has beenbrought about by convergence to price
stability, exchange rate stability and improvingfiscal positions. In this respect, the necessaryconditions for sustained economic growth are
in place. However, it would appear thateconomic expansion in the euro area isbeing adversely affected by the unfolding
weaknesses and uncertainties in the externalenvironment. In order to translate thefavourable domestic environment into more
investment, higher output growth and lowerunemployment, it is important not toundermine the confidence achieved by
previous convergence efforts and thesuccessful monetary policy. Priority needs tobe given to removing the structural
impediments to a higher level of economicactivity and of employment in the EuropeanUnion. These structural rigidities relate in
particular to European labour markets, theperformance of which is unsatisfactory Œ as isevidenced by the slow process of job creation3ECB Annual Report Ł 1998and very gradual decrease in unemployment.In addition, confidence needs to be supportedby the realisation€Œ as quickly as possible€Œ of
budgetary positions close to balance or insurplus. This will allow the Member Statesboth to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations
without undue risk of incurring excessivedeficits and to put the government debt ratioon a declining path at a satisfactory pace.This will also be necessary to address thelonger-term challenges associated with theageing of the population. The start of
Monetary Union was a success; the aim nowshould be to consolidate the foundations fora stable euro and with that to create the
necessary, although not sufficient, conditionsfor a resumption of output and employmentgrowth.Frankfurt am Main, April 1999Willem F. DuisenbergExecutive summaryECB Annual Report Ł 19986The Annual Report 1998 is the first Annual Report to be published by the European CentralBank (ECB). It nevertheless also covers the activities of the European Monetary Institute(EMI), which in practice ceased to exist on 1 June 1998, when the ECB was established, but
which was not liquidated until the end of 1998. The cut-off date for the data included in thisReport was 10 March 1999.IEconomic developments in the European Union
Macroeconomic environment influenced byadverse external developmentsIn 1998 the increase in the HICP in the euroarea remained in line with the definition ofprice stability adopted by the GoverningCouncil of the ECB in October 1998; it
decreased to 1.1% for the year as a whole,from 1.6% in 1997. The deceleration in theoverall index was mainly caused by the fall in
energy prices. The year-on-year increase ingoods prices was 0.6% and that in servicesprices 2.0%. The pace of economic activity
in the euro area in 1998 as a wholewas characterised by a continuation ofthe economic expansion. However, the
expansion appeared to be increasingly fragilein the face of the unfolding weaknesses anduncertainties of the external environment.
As the year progressed, doubts about theprospects for sustained area-wide growthincreased, leading not only to some
downward revisions to expectations ofgrowth for 1998 as a whole, but also tolower projections for growth in 1999.Overall, real GDP growth in the euro area isestimated to have increased by 3.0% in 1998,
slightly above the rate of growth of 2.5%achieved in the previous year. This reflects asomewhat higher rate of output growth in
the first half of 1998 (approximately 3.4%compared with the same period a yearearlier), whereas in the second half of the
year the annual rate of growth fell to around2.6%. Underlying the performance of realGDP growth in 1998 was a significant shift in
favour of domestic demand and a negativecontribution to growth from net exports.One main factor was private consumption,
which is estimated to have risen by around3.0%, the highest rate of growth since theearly 1990s and a significant improvementcompared with the previous few years. It is
likely that this development was supportedby an increase in real household incomes. Inparticular, income growth was underpinned
by net employment growth, and a furtherdecline in consumer price increases led to astronger rise in real incomes. Gross capital
formation is estimated to have increased by4.2% in 1998. The contribution to growthfrom gross fixed capital formation was
significantly higher than in 1997. Evenstronger investment growth might have beenexpected given the positive fundamentals,
particularly lower short-term and long-terminterest rates, with the evidence suggestinghigher profit margins, stable intra-euro
area exchange rates, lower inflation anda comparatively high level of capacityutilisation. Government consumption for the
euro area as a whole remained subduedduring 1998, while its contribution to realGDP growth was close to zero.The recovery in employment, which began inspring 1997, strengthened throughout 1998.
By contrast with the sluggish developmentsobserved in the years following thedownswing of 1993, employment grew by
more than 1% in 1998. In the course of thefirst three quarters of 1998 more jobswere created in the euro area than had
been created between early 1994, whenemployment had levelled out, and the end of1997. As a result of the strengthening of net
job creation the unemployment rate in theeuro area has been declining continuously,albeit at a very gradual pace, since
October 1997. The standardised rate ofunemployment, as estimated by Eurostat,decreased from 11.7%, the peak level in 1997,
to 10.7% in December 1998. In January 1999there was a further slight decline in area-wide unemployment, to 10.6%. While this7ECB Annual Report Ł 1998represents the lowest level of area-wideunemployment over the past five years, itremains high by historical standards as well
as in comparison with the levels recorded inother major economies outside the euroarea, such as the United States, Japan and the
United Kingdom. A predominant view hasemerged  that unemployment in Europe is,to a large extent, structural in nature.Government budgetary positions improvedfurther in 1998, albeit at a rather slow pace,
leaving budgets highly imbalanced on averagein the euro area. According to the latestavailable data provided by Eurostat, the
average deficit-to-GDP ratio in the euro areastood at 2.1%, compared with 2.5% in 1997.Government debt ratios in the euro area on
average remain at a very high level, therebysubstantially limiting the budgetary room formanoeuvre in many Member States. The
average ratio declined by 0.8 percentagepoint in 1998 to 73.8%.In the euro area the average level of 10-yearbond yields dropped by almost 150 basispoints during 1998 to reach a level of 3.95%
by the end of the year. At the beginning of1998 the deviation between the highest andlowest 10-year government bond yields stood
at an already very low level of just under40 basis points. Following the announcementat the beginning of May 1998 of the selection
of those countries that would adopt thesingle currency as from 1 January 1999, theremaining long-term interest rate differentials
among the participating Member Statesnarrowed further.Monetary policy focused on the future euroareaDuring 1998 the focus of monetary policiesin the euro area Member States gradually
shifted from a national to a euro areaperspective. At the beginning of May 1998diverse levels of short-term interest rates
existed within the euro area. One group ofcountries (Belgium/Luxembourg, Germany,France, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland)had closely aligned monetary policies and arelatively low level of short-term interestrates. In four other countries (Spain, Ireland,
Italy and Portugal) short-term interest rateswere significantly above those of the firstgroup. In the remainder of 1998 monetary
policy stances thus had to be adjusted and acommon level of short-term interest ratessuitable for the maintenance of price stability
in the euro area had to be found. The path ofmonetary policies and the exchange ratedevelopments within the ERM during 1998
were very much shaped by the decisiontaken during the weekend of 2-3 May 1998,when the countries that were to adopt the
euro were selected. On that occasion, thebilateral exchange rates to be used indetermining the euro conversion rates were
pre-announced to be the ERM bilateralcentral rates for the participating currencies.The pre-announcement helped to stabilise
the ERM for the remainder of the yearby reducing uncertainties regarding thechangeover to the single currency. Periods
of significant turbulence in internationalfinancial markets, in particular over thesummer, did not disturb ERM exchange
rates, which remained closely aligned withtheir expected paths. These developmentssuggested that a high degree of confidence in
the successful creation of the euro existedamong market participants.Against a favourable outlook for pricestability in the euro area, with moderatemonetary growth, exchange rate stability and
indications of a weakening of economicgrowth in the second half of the year, theconvergence process took place through
gradual reductions in official interest rates inthe second group of countries towards thelowest levels prevailing in the euro area. This
convergence process accelerated in the lastfew months of 1998 and was finally completedin December 1998, when all the national
central banks (NCBs) adopting the singlemonetary policy lowered their key centralbank interest rates in a co-ordinated move.
This joint reduction was to be seen as a defacto decision on the level of interest rateswith which the Eurosystem would start StageECB Annual Report Ł 19988Three of EMU. This decision reflected aconsensus within the Governing Council onthe basis of a common assessment of the
economic, monetary and financial situation inthe euro area, in accordance with thestability-oriented monetary policy strategy
of the Eurosystem, which was adopted inOctober 1998. Overall, and reflecting theprocess of convergence of official interest
rates, the average euro area money marketinterest rate at the three-month maturity fellby around 70€basis points from the beginning
of 1998 to the end of November 1998 and bya further 30€basis points in December 1998,reaching 3.25% at the end of the year.The main elements of the stability-orientedmonetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem
are the following. The primary objective ofmonetary policy, namely price stability, isdefined as ﬁa year-on-year increase in the
HICP for the euro area of below 2%ﬂ. Thisobjective is maintained using a strategybased on two ﬁpillarsﬂ. The first pillar is a
prominent role for money, reflected in theannouncement of a reference value for thegrowth of a broad monetary aggregate. The
first reference value has been set at an annualgrowth rate of 4½% for M3. The secondpillar is a broadly based assessment of the
outlook for price developments and the risksto price stability in the euro area. Thisassessment is made using a wide range of
economic indicators.Against this background, the GoverningCouncil announced the first interest ratesfor the monetary policy instruments of the
Eurosystem on 22 December 1998. Theinterest rate applicable to the first mainrefinancing operation, offered in the form of
a fixed rate tender, was set at a level of 3.0%.At its subsequent meetings until the cut-offdate for this Report, on each occasion having
taken into consideration the latest availablemonetary, financial and other economic data,the Governing Council confirmed that
forthcoming main refinancing operationswould be conducted at a fixed rate of 3.0%.Price stability also the goal in the non-euroarea EU countriesIt should, in general, be noted that whileDenmark, Greece, Sweden and the UnitedKingdom conduct their monetary policies
under different institutional and operationalframeworks, the ultimate goal of monetarypolicy in all four countries is price stability;
in all four countries price increases measuredby the HICP decreased during 1998 and, withthe exception of Greece, were below 2%.
Furthermore, official interest rates werereduced in all four countries. Nevertheless,in Greece the official interest rate remained
significantly higher (12.0% at the end ofFebruary 1999) compared with the threeother countries, whose interest rates lay in a
range of 3.15-5.5%.2Preparatory work for Stage Three and the changeover
to the euroMonetary policy frameworkIn the first half of 1998 work continued atthe EMI to complete the Eurosystem™soperational framework for theimplementation of monetary policy. In
September 1998 the ECB published a reportentitled ﬁThe single monetary policy in StageThree: General documentation on ESCB
monetary policy instruments and proceduresﬂwhich defined the elements of theEurosystem™s monetary policy framework. Itcomprises a minimum reserve system, openmarket operations and standing facilities.The bulk of the implementation work in thefield of monetary policy, including the testingof the systems and the preparation of
the relevant legal documentation, wasconducted by the NCBs. The work wasinitially co-ordinated by the EMI and its
relevant Sub-Committees and subsequentlyco-ordinated and supervised by the ECB.Preparatory work on liquidity management9ECB Annual Report Ł 1998procedures was finalised in the course of1998, including all procedures needed forinternal Eurosystem communication and for
the consolidation of the NCBs™ balancesheets. Accurate information regarding theliquidity conditions in the euro area is
published on every Eurosystem business day.Introduction of the euro and foreignexchange rate policy frameworkOn 31 December 1998 the irrevocable euroexchange rates were established in aprocedure involving the ECB, the NCBs, the
European Commission and the EU Council.The euro came into existence at 0.00 hourson 1 January 1999.In accordance with the Resolution adoptedby the European Council at its meeting held
in Amsterdam on 16€and 17€June 1997, fromthe start of Stage Three of EMU the EuropeanMonetary System/Exchange Rate Mechanism
(EMS/ERM) was replaced by a new exchangerate mechanism (ERM II) which, on avoluntary basis, links the currencies of EU
Member States outside the euro area to theeuro.As from 1 January 1999 two Member Statesoutside the euro area Œ Denmark andGreece Œ have been taking part in ERM II.
The Danish krone has been participating inERM II with a ±2.25% fluctuation band and acentral rate against the euro of DKK€7.46038,
and the Greek drachma with the standardfluctuation band of ±15% and a central rateagainst the euro of GRD€353.109.The preparation and testing of theinfrastructure required for the conduct of
foreign exchange intervention by theEurosystem was finalised in the course of1998. The infrastructure was developed in
such a way as to enable the Eurosystem toexecute foreign exchange intervention in botha decentralised and a centralised fashion. The
NCBs transferred foreign reserve assets ofan amount equivalent to about E39.5 billionto the ECB at the start of Stage Three. Thatamount corresponds to the limit of E50 billionestablished by the Statute of the ESCB forthe initial transfer of foreign reserve assets
to the ECB, reduced in accordance with theshare in the ESCB™s capital of the NCBs ofnon-participating Member States.StatisticsThe statistical work conducted at theEMI/ECB in 1998 centred on implementation
of the requirements established in July 1996,the focus of which was the compilation ofcomparable statistics covering the euro area
as a whole.The first monetary aggregates were publishedin December 1998. Backdata from 1980,together with other monetary and relateddata, have subsequently been published in
the ECB Monthly Bulletin. The first balanceof payments data to be published for theeuro area, relating to January 1999, with
backdata from 1995, follow furtherconceptual and practical work carried out inco-operation with the European Commission
(Eurostat). The design of a system of financialaccounts reached an advanced stage in 1998,although, as intended, the first results will
not appear until later in 1999.Following adoption in November 1998 ofCouncil Regulation (EC) No. 2533/98concerning the collection of statisticalinformation by the European Central Bank,
the Governing Council of the ECB adoptedthe necessary legal instruments to supportreporting requirements. Essential features of
the information systems infrastructureneeded for statistical purposes werecompleted in 1998.Payment systemsIn the field of payment systems the ﬁThirdprogress report on the TARGET projectﬂ
released by the ECB in November 1998provided further information concerningprogress made since September 1997.ECB Annual Report Ł 199810On schedule, on the morning of 4 January1999 the ESCB successfully began operatingthe TARGET system, with more than 5,000
credit institutions participating directly in thesystem. From the very first week of itsoperation TARGET processed transactions
of a value in excess of E1 trillion daily, morethan one-third of which consisted of cross-
border traffic.In the field of securities settlement systems(SSSs) preparatory work focused on three
main aspects: (1) the assessment of EU SSSsagainst standards to determine whether ornot they qualified for use in the Eurosystem™s
credit operations; (2) the assessment of linksbetween EU SSSs; and (3)€the implementationof the correspondent central banking model
(CCBM) for the cross-border use ofcollateral. The results of the assessment ofthe EU SSSs against certain standards are
included in the ECB report entitledﬁAssessment of EU securities settlementsystems against the standards for their use in
ESCB credit operationsﬂ, which was publishedin September 1998. The most importantfeatures of the CCBM were summarised in a
brochure released in December 1998.The development of the euro banknotesand the preparations for the cashchangeoverThe final designs and the technicalspecifications for the euro banknotes were
approved by the EMI Council in February1998. Production of the pilot series was readyto start in September 1998. The aim was to
check the compliance of the originationmaterials with the specifications and toestablish a preliminary basis for a quality
management system. The Governing Councilagreed that the participating NCBs couldrelease their printing orders on the
assumption of a production volume of13€billion euro banknotes.To ensure substitutability of the nationalcurrency units between 1999 and 2002 eachparticipating NCB or its authorised agent hasbeen offering to exchange the banknotes ofother participating countries for nationalbanknotes and coins at the official conversion
rate since 1 January 1999 in at least onelocation.Information and communications systemsIn the information and communicationssystems field the key achievements of 1998included the end of the implementation phase
of the ESCB™s systems for operationalpurposes as well as, in the second half of theyear, the overall testing exercise of all ESCB-
wide systems and procedures. Likewisenumerous systems for the ECB itself havebeen set up or expanded to accommodate
both the increasing size and the change inthe nature and purpose of the organisation.From mid-1998 the ECB€Œ in co-operation
with the NCBs for ESCB-related matters Œhas gradually been increasing its focus onYear 2000 compliance issues with a view to
ensuring that all critical ECB and ESCBsystems are compliant.Banking supervision and financial stabilityThe preparatory work in the field of bankingsupervision and financial stability confirmedand elaborated the common understanding
reached by the EMI Council. The finalcommon understanding, as endorsed by theGoverning Council, identifies the effective
interaction between the Eurosystem and thenational supervisory authorities as the mainobjective of Article€105€(5) of the Treaty,
which obliges the Eurosystem to contributeto the smooth conduct of policies pursuedby the national authorities responsible for
the prudential supervision of creditinstitutions and for maintaining the stabilityof the financial system. Two main
contributions of the Eurosystem can beidentified in this context, the first of which isthe promotion of co-operation among
supervisory authorities, and the second isthe possible provision to them of confidentialinformation on individual credit institutions11ECB Annual Report Ł 1998and markets obtained in the course of theEurosystem™s basic activities. Moreover,Article€25.1 of the Statute of the ESCB€Œ
which is applicable to all EU Member States€Œprovides for a specific advisory function ofthe ECB in the field of Community legislation
on banking supervision and financial stability.In addition, the ECB provides advice on draftCommunity and national legislation on
banking supervision and financial stabilityunder the conditions laid down inArticle€105€(4) of the Treaty and in the
related Council Decision of 29€June 1998(98/415/EC) (neither of which, incidentally,applies to the United Kingdom).Co-operation with other institutionsRepresentation of the Eurosystem in theperformance of its basic tasks is decided by
the Governing Council of the ECB and varies,depending on the institutions or foraconcerned. Informal arrangements with
certain institutions (e.g.€the OECD and theIMF) had already been reached in the contextof the EMI. Since the ECB™s establishment on
1 June 1998 its European and internationalrepresentation has been developed further.The most relevant arrangements were in
place at the start of Stage Three on 1 January1999. In the European context, the closeco-operation already existing with other
institutions of the European Union has beenfurther consolidated, in particular with theEuropean Parliament, the EU Council, the
Euro-11 group, the European Commissionand the Monetary Committee. At theinternational level the ECB is represented at
the IMF and at the OECD, in the meetings ofthe G7 and G10 Ministers and Governorsand in the meetings of the G10 Governors
and their Committees organised under theauspices of the BIS. In a bilateral context,relations are being developed with non-EU
central banks.Legal issuesMember States were obliged, in accordancewith Article 108 of the Treaty, to eliminateincompatibilities between their nationallegislation€Œ including the statutes of their
NCBs€Œ on the one hand and the Treaty andthe Statute of the ESCB on the other, by thedate of the establishment of the ESCB at the
latest. In its Convergence Report, publishedin March 1998, the EMI concluded that, withthe exception of Denmark (the legislation of
which did not require adaptation) and theUnited Kingdom (which is exempt from theobligations laid down in Article€108 of the
Treaty), a legislative process was taking placethroughout the European Union that wasintended to prepare the NCBs for Stage€Threeof EMU. This process was effectivelycompleted before the Council of theEuropean Union (EU Council), meeting in the
composition of the Heads of State orGovernment, convened on 1 May 1998 toadopt the decisions foreseen in Article€109j€(4)of the Treaty.The preparatory work for Stage Threeincluded a considerable legal componentwhich extended to virtually all areas in whichsuch work was being undertaken. The ECB
participated actively in the preparation ofCommunity legal acts relevant to theintroduction of the euro. In particular, it
contributed, through ECB Recommendations,to the adoption of secondary legislation ofEU institutions in the preparation of Stage
Three. In parallel with this, the ECB fulfilledits obligation to prepare the legal framework,both operational and institutional, of the
ESCB. In this context, the ECB employed theentire set of legal acts which it is empoweredto use under Articles€14.3 and 34 of the
Statute of the ESCB. In addition, theinstitutional establishment of the ECBand of the ESCB has involved the preparation
and adoption of a variety of legal actsand instruments, such as the HeadquartersAgreement with the ECB™s host state and
Rules of Procedure.ECB Annual Report Ł 199812Internal audit activitiesInternal audit activities are twofold: purelyinternal and ESCB-related. The ECB™sDirectorate Internal Audit is involved notonly in reviewing the reliability and integrity
of financial information, in particular withregard to that which is provided in thefinancial statements, but also in reviewing and
examining the security of information systemsunder development or already in operation.ESCB common infrastructures are reviewed
within the framework of EU-wide co-operation among the ESCB™s Internal Auditfunctions, which are co-ordinated within the
Internal Auditors Committee (IAC). Thescope of the activities of the IAC wasprogressively extended during 1998.Changeover to the euroThe transition to the euro by the bankingand financial sectors of the participating
Member States in only three and a half daysafter the irrevocable fixing of the euroconversion rates was deemed to be a
remarkable success. The smooth migrationof all electronic systems and proceduresattested to the quality of the preparatory
work carried out in earlier months and years,both by the banking and financial industryand by the central banking community. It also
reflected the intensive preparatory workcarried out during 1998 under the guidanceof the EMI and, later, the ECB.Information activitiesThe aims of the ESCB™s external communicationpolicy are to foster the transparency and clarityof its policy objectives, to inform the public
about its tasks and actions, thereby enhancingits effectiveness, credibility and efficiency, andto contribute to the accountability of
the Eurosystem. The ECB communicatesinformation to the public by a variety of means,including press releases, press conferences Œ
which are held in accordance with a fixedschedule following the first Governing Councilmeeting of each month Œ and speeches by
members of the Governing Council and variouspublications. Since January 1999 the ECB hasproduced a Monthly Bulletin, which is intended
to be one of the ECB™s main tools for analysingeconomic developments in the euro area andexplaining the single monetary policy of the
Eurosystem. Furthermore, the statistical part ofthis Monthly Bulletin is one of the key sourcesof euro area statistics. The ECB™s Annual Report
and the Monthly Bulletin (as well as many otherpublications) are produced in all 11 official EUlanguages and made widely available throughout
the euro area and beyond on the ECB™s Website (http://www.ecb.int) and on the Web sitesof the NCBs.3Other ESCB activities
Oversight of the ECU Clearing and
Settlement SystemDuring 1998 the activity of the Euro BankingAssociation (EBA) focused mainly on thepreparatory work for the Euro ClearingSystem (Euro 1) run by the newly created
EBA Clearing Company. Euro€1 startedclearing and settlement operations on4 January 1999, with the ECB acting as the
settlement agent and holder of a liquiditypool for Euro I.Electronic moneyIn August 1998 the ECB published the ﬁReporton electronic moneyﬂ. The Report addresses
the reasons why the issuance of electronicmoney should be regulated and states theminimum requirements for electronic money
issuers and desirable objectives. In particular,the Report confirms the views expressed bythe EMI in 1994, according to which issuers of
electronic money should be credit institutions.It also indicates why electronic money shouldbe redeemable.13ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Administration of EMS mechanisms andCommunity loansUnder Article 109l€(2) of the Treaty, the ECBtook over the tasks of the EMI related to theadministration of the mechanisms of the
European Monetary System (EMS)€Œ the VeryShort-Term Financing (VSTF) mechanism, theShort-Term Monetary Support mechanism,
the creation of ECUs for the purpose ofimplementing the EMS Agreement and theadministration of borrowing and lending
operations concluded by the Communityunder the Medium-Term Financial Assistancemechanism. In accordance with Article€23.2
of the EMI Statute and Article 20 of the EMSAgreement, the mechanism for the creationof ECUs against gold and US dollars was
unwound by the first day of the third stageof EMU. As provided for in Article 23.3of the EMI Statute, any existing claims and
liabilities arising from the VSTF mechanismand from the Short-Term Monetary Supportmechanism were settled by the first day of
the third stage of EMU.Co-operation in the field of bankingsupervision and financial stabilityIn the context of the task of the Eurosystemto contribute to the smooth conduct of thepolicies pursued by the competent authorities
relating to the prudential supervision ofcredit institutions and financial stability, anumber of issues have been analysed with
the assistance of the Banking SupervisionCommittee. In most cases the outcome ofthese analyses has been made available to
other international supervisory fora. Theanalyses covered the possible effects ofMonetary Union on the EU banking systems,
the EU banking systems™ exposures towardsemerging countries in financial crisis, methodsfor carrying out macro-prudential analysis
aimed at the early identification of potentialsystemic weaknesses in the banking sector,and a stock-taking of formalised supervisoryrisk assessment systems used by certain EUnational supervisory authorities, with the aimof identifying, at an early stage, potentially
fragile credit institutions.Advisory functionsArticle 105€(4) of the Treaty and Article 4 ofthe Statute of the ESCB require that theECB be consulted by the EU Council orthe responsible national authorities, as
appropriate, on any proposed Community ornational legislation within the ECB™s field ofcompetence. The limits and conditions of
consultations on draft legislation by nationalauthorities for the EMI were set outin Council Decision 93/717/EEC of
22 November 1993, which also applied tothe ECB under Article 109l€(2) in conjunctionwith Article 109f€(6) of the Treaty. As from
1 January 1999 the ECB is consultedunder Council Decision 98/415/EC of29 June 1998, which contains provisions
similar to those of Council Decision93/717/EEC of 22 November 1993. A total of64 requests for the opinion of the EMI/ECB
were received in 1998.Monitoring of compliance with theprohibition on monetary financing and onprivileged accessThe ECB has the task of monitoring thecompliance of NCBs with the prohibitions
referred to in Articles 104 and 104a of theTreaty and the related Council Regulations(EC) Nos. 3603/93 and 3604/93. These
provisions relate to the prohibition onproviding monetary financing to governmentsand on taking measures, not based on
prudential considerations, which establishprivileged access by governments to financialinstitutions. In 1998 the NCBs of all Member
States continued to respect the Treatyrequirements and the above-mentionedCouncil Regulations (EC).ECB Annual Report Ł 1998144The European System of Central Banks and the Eurosystem
Organisation of the ESCB and theEurosystemThe ESCB is composed of the ECB and the15 NCBs. The NCBs of the Member Stateswhich are not participating in the euro area
are, however, members of the ESCB with aspecial status: while they are allowed toconduct their respective national monetary
policies, they do not take part in the decision-making regarding the single monetary policyfor the euro area and the implementation of
such decisions. It is for this reason that theGoverning Council of the ECB decided, forthe sake of transparency and easy reference,
to make a distinction between the ESCB andthe ﬁEurosystemﬂ, the latter being composedof the ECB and the 11 fully participating
NCBs, as long as there are Member Stateswhich have not yet adopted the euro.The ESCB is governed by the decision-makingbodies of the ECB: the Governing Counciland the Executive Board. Without prejudice
to this, the General Council is constituted asa third decision-making body of the ECB, ifand for as long as there are Member Stateswith a derogation. The Governing Council,which is the supreme decision-making bodyof the ECB, comprises all the members of
the Executive Board and the governors ofthe NCBs forming the Eurosystem. TheExecutive Board comprises the President, the
Vice-President and four other members, allchosen from among persons of recognisedstanding and professional experience in
monetary or banking matters. The GeneralCouncil comprises the President and theVice-President and the governors of all
15 NCBs. In addition, a number ofCommittees composed of experts from theNCBs and the ECB have been established.Liquidation of the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI)In accordance with Article 109l of theTreaty, the EMI went into liquidation on theestablishment of the ECB. The financialaspects of the liquidation of the EMI are
described in detail in the notes to the annualaccounts of the ECB.Chapter IEconomic developmentsin the European UnionECB Annual Report Ł 1998181External macroeconomic conditions
Growing uncertainties in theinternational environmentOver the course of 1998 the globalmacroeconomic environment wascharacterised by high volatility in financialmarkets and considerable swings in investor
confidence. In the earlier part of the year thedominating factor continued to be thefinancial and economic consequences of the
1997 financial crisis in Asia, which caused aprotracted recession in the economiesconcerned. Nevertheless, financial and
exchange market tensions in Asia appearedto subside and spillover effects on the rest ofthe world were for some time regarded as
limited. In August 1998, however, the crisisin Russia sparked a new round of financialturmoil. This led to a significant worsening of
global economic and financial conditions,compounded by the further deepening of therecession in many Asian economies and the
crisis in Japan. As a result, world-wide growthin production and trade declined significantly.Capital market volatility, in particular,
increased substantially, triggered by a greaterpreference for less risky and more liquidassets (the so-called ﬁflight to qualityﬂ effect),
which led to sudden and significant asset pricechanges.Towards the end of 1998 the spiral of badnews from the global economy seemed tohave moderated. Policy responses in several
countries helped to restore more orderlyconditions in financial markets. Central banksin the main industrial countries reduced
interest rates; in Japan measures wereannounced to address the banking sectorproblem and to stimulate further aggregate
demand, and in emerging economies thepolicy environment generally improved.Meanwhile, in the United States robust output
growth continued and inflationary pressureremained subdued, while in some Asian crisiscountries evidence emerged that the crisis
may have bottomed out. Supported by thesepositive developments, international financialmarkets recovered towards the end of 1998.However, indicators of world-wide financial
and economic conditions remained mixed,and the risks associated with global activityand world trade continued to be
predominantly on the downside. At thebeginning of 1999 the currency crisis in Brazilcontributed to renewed uncertainty about the
outlook for the world economy.Against the background of a slowdown inworld demand, 1998 saw considerableweakness in commodity markets. Oil pricesfell by 30.7% on average in 1998, to reach a
50-year inflation-adjusted low of aroundUSD€9.8 per barrel in December. The trendin oil prices reflected, in addition to weak
demand, mild winter weather and lessstringent control of oil production by OPECcountries. In early 1999 oil prices recovered
slightly, to USD€10.5 per barrel at the end ofFebruary. Non-energy raw materials pricesfell by 13.7% in 1998 compared with their
average level in 1997 according to theHWWA index. This trend reflected falls in abroad range of primary commodities and
occurred mostly during the summer period.In January and February this index fell further.Considering the major economic regions ofthe world, in the United States robust realoutput growth, low unemployment and
low inflation characterised economicdevelopments during 1998, notwithstandingfinancial and economic strains at the global
level. Output growth reached a peak of 6.1%in the fourth quarter of 1998 at annualisedrates, resulting in 3.9% for the overall rate of
GDP growth for the year. In parallel, theunemployment rate fell during the course ofthe year to 4.3%, the lowest level recorded
for almost four decades. Although thedeepening of the recession in many emergingcountries during the second half of 1998 had
an adverse impact on US exports and profitsof US firms abroad, exceptionally strongdomestic demand compensated for the
slowdown in world trade. The combinationof weak foreign and strong domestic demandled to a gradual widening of the trade deficit,19ECB Annual Report Ł 1998which, together with the deterioration in theUS investment income balance, led to a sharprise in the current account deficit to
USD€61 billion in the third quarter of theyear. With regard to price developments,consumer price inflation declined further in
the course of 1998 to 1.6% year-on-year inDecember 1998, in particular reflectingdeclining energy prices. Following the Russian
crisis and the subsequent turmoil in financialmarkets, the Federal Reserve cut the Federalfunds rate from 5.5% in September to 4.75%
in November. These measures were seen aseasing the strains apparent in the financialsystem and as sustaining output growth.
Owing mainly to buoyant tax revenuecollection, the federal fiscal budget recordeda surplus of 0.8% of GDP in the fiscal year
1998.In Japan economic conditions continued todeteriorate in 1998. Around the turn of theyear 1997/98 the economy had moved intorecession. During the course of 1998 output
fell further, mainly as a result of sluggishprivate demand. Fixed business investmentcontinued to decline, partly because of
financial constraints, and diminishingconsumer confidence hampered a recoveryof private consumption. Recorded
unemployment was 4.3% in December 1998,and the total amount of liabilities of bankruptcompanies reached its highest post-war level.
Against this background the JapaneseGovernment implemented two fiscal stimuluspackages: one in April, of JPY€16.7 trillion
(3.3% of GDP), followed by a second packageof JPY€24.2 trillion (4.8% of GDP) inNovember. Mainly as a result of the increase
in public investment, the economicdeterioration has gradually moderatedrecently. During the year the problems of
the financial sector worsened further as badloans estimates turned out to be higher thanexpected and the solvency of many financial
institutions deteriorated. In the latter part ofthe year two long-term credit banks werenationalised. In response to these
developments, in October the Governmentintroduced major banking recapitalisationplans, which provided for the injection ofpublic funds of JPY€60 trillion in total (12% ofGDP). In addition, the Bank of Japan loweredfurther the target for the overnight call rate
to around 0.25% in September 1998 and to0.15% in February 1999, while injectingsubstantial liquidity into the system.
Consumer prices declined in some months of1998, but the change in the CPI remainedslightly positive for the year as a whole.Of the other Asian economies, manyexperienced a severe recession in 1998 as a
result of the financial and economic crisis.Output is estimated to have declined in HongKong, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand between
5% and 8% for 1998 as a whole. The sharp fallin demand is one of the reasons why, despitesignificant currency depreciations, inflation
remained in single digits for all theseeconomies. In Indonesia the adjustment wasmuch more severe, with a decline in real
output estimated at 15%; on the other hand,China managed to weather the effects of thecrisis in the rest of Asia to a large extent and
its economy grew by around 7% in 1998, onlyslightly below the 8% growth recorded theyear before.The performance of transition countries wasmixed in 1998. Although during the first half
of the year the initial impact of the crisis inconfidence in emerging markets was severeacross the region, the economies of a number
of countries have shown resilience. Keyindicators of investor confidence, such asbond spreads, show that investors have
become more selective. In Russia the general
lack of investor confidence in emergingmarkets was compounded by the difficulties
the Government had in controlling the fiscaldeficit and in implementing the fiscal measuresagreed upon with the IMF during the summer.
This in turn eroded investor confidence inthe prospects of achieving a stablemacroeconomic environment. Triggered by
the ﬁflight to qualityﬂ effect after the Asiancrisis, an increasing number of foreign andresident investors decided to liquidate their
investments in Russia, also as a result of risingconcern about the level of Russia™s externaldebt. Russia had to give up its exchange rateECB Annual Report Ł 199820peg, introduced a 90-day moratorium on allprincipal repayments for external debt ofcorporations and banks and announced the
conversion of short-term government debt.As a result, domestic financial marketscollapsed and the banking system came under
severe strain. By contrast with Russia andUkraine, which was forced to renegotiate itsdomestic debt, in Hungary and Poland
financial markets were stable, reflecting acredible market-oriented policy environmentand good macroeconomic performance. In
the second half of 1998, following the crisisin Russia, financial market volatility increasedin many countries of the region.In Latin America the unstable global financialsituation had an adverse effect on the
investment climate and caused interest ratesto rise. The effect was particularly severe inBrazil, where the exchange rate regime (a
crawling peg) was subject to intense pressure,also fuelled by growing fiscal imbalances andexpectations of low growth. An IMF aid
package conditional on some fiscaladjustments was initially well received bymarkets, but subsequent doubts about the
ability of the Brazilian authorities to pass thenecessary legislation to comply with thepackage generated additional pressure and
led to the decision to let the real float inJanuary 1999. While the contagion effectof the Brazilian crisis in the area has been
limited thus far, the overall macroeconomicsituation in the region has suffered from theincreased aversion of foreign investors to
investing in emerging market economies.Developments in foreign exchangemarketsWhile the prospective EMU currenciesconverged smoothly to their pre-announcedconversion rates, global foreign exchange
markets experienced relatively high volatilityduring 1998, reflecting the financial crises inmany emerging markets. Most importantly,with regard to the US dollar, the ECU€Œ the
performance of which may be seen as broadlysummarising the developments of currencieswhich subsequently formed the euro€Œ
strengthened during the second and thirdquarters of 1998. This strengthening wasconnected with expected spillovers from the
emerging markets crisis into the US economyand with an easing of monetary policy in theUnited States. The ECU reached almost
USD€1.20 on average in October. However,these developments were partly reversedtowards the end of the year, when the US
economy continued to display robust growthand the crisis in global financial markets beganto ease. The last ECU/USD exchange rate
recorded in 1998 was USD€1.17 per ECU,and on 10€March 1999 the euro was quotedat USD€1.10.Against the Japanese yen, the ECUstrengthened gradually by about 10% during
the first three quarters of 1998 amid thedeepening recession in Japan. In the fourthquarter, however, the ECU weakened rapidly,
triggered by technical factors such as theunwinding of short trading positions of yenagainst dollars and the end of specific trading
by hedge funds, agreements on bankrestructuring and the largest fiscal stimuluspackage in Japan™s history in November. As a
result, the ECU had depreciated to a level ofJPY€132.80 per ECU by the end of December1998, about 16% below its peak of August
1998. In early 1999 the euro mostly traded ina range of JPY€126 to JPY€134.
Overall, in nominal effective terms, the ECUappreciated by 3.3% between December 1997and December 1998, and by 2.7% in real
terms. As this upward movement reflected apartial recovery of the decline observed in1997, the ECU remained somewhat below
the levels observed on average in the 1990s.21ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Chart 1Main developments in major industrialised economiesSources: National data, Eurostat and ECB calculations.1)Eurostat data are used for the euro area; for the United States and Japan national data are used.

2Economic developments in the euro area
2.1Price developments
In 1998 the increase in the HICP remained inline with the definition of price stability
adopted by the Governing Council of theECB (for further information see Section€2.7);it decreased to 1.1% for the year as a whole,
from 1.6% in 1997 (see Table 1). Thus, thetrend towards lower price increases recordedin recent years continued in 1998. In January
1999 the rate of increase in the HICP wasunchanged from December at 0.8%. Thedeceleration in the overall index in 1998 was
mainly caused by the fall in energy prices (adecline of 2.6%, compared with an increaseof 2.8% in 1997). A measure of consumer
price inflation excluding the more volatileitems (seasonal food and energy products)has remained broadly stable.The reduction in the annual increase of the
headline HICP was apparent in bothcomponents of the index: goods and servicesprices. The year-on-year increase in goods
prices declined from just above 1% in 1997to 0.6% in 1998, whereas the rate of increasein services prices slowed from 2.4% in 1997
to 2.0% in 1998. However, inflation in termsof annual averages may partly obscuredivergent developments over the course of
the year. In the case of services prices, therate of increase remained virtually unchangedat around 2% throughout 1998 (see Chart 2),
whereas goods price increases continuedto slow during 1998, interrupted onlytemporarily in early 1998, partly owing to an
increase in German VAT.23ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Chart 2Breakdown of HICP inflation in the euro area by components(annual percentage changes; monthly data)Source: Eurostat.Note: For further information on the data used, see Table 1.Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4

56total HICPservicesunprocessed foodprocessed foodnon-energy industrial goodsenergyThis downward trend was caused mainly bythe ongoing steep decline in energy pricesthroughout 1998 but also, in the second half
of the year, by a decline in the rate of increaseof unprocessed food prices. The consumerprice of energy, which in 1998 as a whole
decreased by around 2½% compared with ayear earlier, stood 4.8% lower in Decemberthan a year earlier. This reflects the fact that
oil prices have tended to fall since early 1997,and in particular from the fourth quarter of1997, mainly as a result of expectations of
lower world demand due to the crises inAsia and, subsequently, also in other parts ofthe world. As a consequence, a measure of
consumer prices excluding these morevolatile items (HICP excluding seasonal foodand energy) has remained stable at 1.2-1.5%
since the second quarter of 1997. Assumingonly limited scope for a sustained further fallin energy prices below the levels reached at
the end of 1998, the decline of the annualrate of increase of the headline HICP to alevel of below 1% towards the end of 1998may be viewed as being of a ﬁone-offﬂ nature,
and one which would be reversed if the worldmarket prices of these products were to
stabilise or recover.In addition to oil prices, other externalfactors have contributed to the furtherdecline in consumer price increases in theeuro area in 1998. The weakening in world
market non-oil commodity prices, theappreciation of the effective exchange rate ofthe euro area and developments in the
emerging countries have all contributed tolower import prices, with a downwardinfluence on consumer goods prices.The pattern of broad stability in consumerprices also reflects wage developments in
1998. Wage increases remained low in thefirst three quarters of 1998, at around 1%year-on-year, down from 2.6% in 1997,
reflecting the absence of wage pressures inmost countries of the euro area, althoughthere have been recent signs of anECB Annual Report Ł 199824acceleration in a few countries. The modestgrowth in wages combined with a relativelyhigh productivity growth rate resulted in an
average decline in unit labour costs in thefirst three quarters of 1998 of about 1¼%.Profit margins are expected to have improved
in 1998 given that the prices of inputs toproduction, such as energy and commoditiesprices, unit labour costs and the cost of
capital (long and short-term interest rates)fell, while consumer prices continued toincrease, albeit at a very slow pace.Overall, the modest rate of increase in theheadline HICP in 1998 appears to reflect an
environment which is characterised bydecreasing import prices and low domesticinflationary pressures, while allowing for
some widening of profit margins in the euroarea economy as a whole. Given theuncertainties resulting from developments in
the world economy, this pattern of pricestability and, for the time being, low costpressures can be seen as a counterbalancing
factor which tends to support output andemployment growth in the euro area (seebelow).2.2Output, demand and labour
marketsContinued economic expansionThe pace of economic activity in the euroarea in 1998 as a whole was characterised bya continuation of the economic expansionwhich followed the temporary slowdown in
1995-96. However, the expansion appearedto be increasingly fragile in the face of theunfolding weaknesses and uncertainties in
the external environment. As the yearprogressed, doubts about the prospects forsustained area-wide growth increased, leading
not only to some downward revision toexpectations of growth for the year as awhole, but also to lower projections for
growth in 1999. Overall, real GDP in theeuro area is estimated to have increased by3.0% in 1998, slightly above the rate of growth
achieved in the previous year of 2.5% (seeTable 2). This reflects a somewhat higherrate of output growth in the first half of
1998, when area-wide real GDP growthreached approximately 3.4% compared withthe same period a year earlier. In the secondAnnual rates 1)Quarterly rates 2)1996199719981997199819981998199819971998199819981998

the second quarter Œ 0.6%, compared with0.9% in the first quarter of 1998 Œ while realgrowth is estimated to have been stronger
again in the third quarter at 0.7%, which isclose to the average of the first two quarters.Differences in the number of working days
associated with the timing of Easter partlydetermined this quarterly pattern, as didfactors such as the VAT increase in Germany
at the beginning of April and unusually mildweather in the first quarter. The area-wideimpact of calendar effects on activity is
difficult to estimate precisely at the currentjuncture, and further improvements on themethodological side are desirable. Provisional
estimates of fourth-quarter growth, whichshowed a substantial slowdown, were alsoinfluenced by calendar effects. Real GDP is
estimated to have risen by only 0.2% in thefinal quarter of 1998.Domestic demand replaces net exportsUnderlying the performance of real GDPgrowth in 1998 was a significant shift in favourof domestic demand in the euro area and a
negative contribution to growth from netexports (see€Charts 3a and 3b). While netexports measured on a year-on-year basis
declined sharply during the course of theyear, domestic demand maintained a robustpace.For 1998 as a whole, the contribution toannual growth from net exports is estimated
to be slightly negative, at -0.2%, comparedwith a contribution of 0.7% in 1997. It fellsharply from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of
1997 to 0% in the first quarter of 1998, andwas increasingly negative in the followingquarters. In the fourth quarter of 1998 the
contribution was -0.6%. This sharp decline innet exports was primarily accounted for bythe deterioration in the global situationChart 3aContributions to annual realGDP growth(annual percentage point contributions; seasonally adjusted)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.Chart 3bContributions to quarterly realGDP growth(quarterly percentage point contributions; seasonally adjusted)Sources: Eurostat and ECB calculations.19971998

However, measured on a quarter-on-quarterbasis, net exports are estimated to have madea small positive contribution to growth in the
second and third quarters, following anegative contribution in the previous twoquarters, while in the fourth quarter of 1998
the contribution from net exports was againnegative, at -0.4%.As regards the increase in domestic demand,it remained broadly robust throughout theyear, and stronger than in 1997, thus helping
to sustain overall growth. One main factorwas private consumption, which maintained astable growth rate throughout the year, while
the household saving ratio may also havedeclined somewhat in 1998. For 1998 as awhole, private consumption is estimated to
have risen by around 3.0%, the highest rateof growth since the early 1990s and asignificant improvement compared with the
previous few years. It is likely that thisdevelopment was supported by an increasein real household incomes. In particular,
income growth was underpinned by netemployment growth. In addition, a furtherdecline in consumer price increases led to a
stronger rise in real incomes. While it isgenerally considered that wealth effects areof limited significance for the euro area, and
1998 witnessed substantial volatility in equitymarkets, it cannot be entirely ruled out thatshare price increases may also have played a
role. Consumer confidence in the euro areacontinued to improve throughout the year,extending the rise in confidence for a second
successive year and helping to underpinprivate consumption. By the end of 1998 theconsumer confidence indicator had risen to
match the highest level achieved in 1990.Other indicators of consumer demand, suchas retail sales and retail confidence, also
pointed to robust growth during 1998,suggesting that higher consumer confidencewas feeding through to household
expenditure.Gross capital formation is estimated to haveincreased by 4.2% in 1998. The contributionto growth from gross fixed capital formation
was significantly higher than in 1997. Evenstronger investment growth might have beenexpected given the positive fundamentals,
particularly lower short-term and long-terminterest rates, with the evidence suggestinghigher profit margins, stable intra-euro area
exchange rates, lower inflation and acomparatively high level of capacity utilisation.However, the gradual deterioration of
prospects (especially for exports) may haveinduced an additional degree of caution infirms™ investment plans. A further factor may
have been the build-up of stocks during thecourse of the year. Changes in inventoriesappear to have made a significant contribution
to total GDP growth for the secondconsecutive year, although this may be seenpartly as a result of statistical discrepancies,
pointing to upward revisions to final domesticdemand components of growth in the future.To the extent that inventories did rise, this
was likely to have been partly involuntary, asthe decline in orders, particularly for exports,was rather rapid and started in the first half
of the year. However, the decrease in rawmaterials prices and low interest rates mayhave combined to reduce the cost of building
up inventories.Finally, government consumption for the euroarea as a whole also remained subdued during1998, while its contribution to real GDPgrowth was close to zero.Industrial production loses momentumEvidence of a slowdown in economic activityduring 1998 was seen from spring onwards in
the behaviour of industrial production andindustrial confidence. According to data fromEurostat, actual industrial production,
excluding construction, is estimated to haverisen by around 4¼% for the year as a whole,but slowed from a year-on-year rate of over
6% in the first quarter of 1998 to around 2%by the fourth quarter of the year (seeTable 3). The slowdown in manufacturing27ECB Annual Report Ł 1998production in the course of 1998 was evenmore pronounced. The strongest growth for
1998 as a whole was observed in the capitalgoods industry, at around 7¼%, followed bythe intermediate goods sector, at just below
4%. Production of capital goods was higher in1998 than in the preceding year, but showedsigns of weakening towards the end of the
year. The increase in intermediate goodsproduction was lower than in 1997, andproduction appeared to peak in the first few
months of the year.Production of consumer goods also rose, byaround 3% for the year as a whole, but withinthis category there was a significant differencebetween the durable and non-durable goods
sectors. Production in the former increasedby over 6½% in 1998, following several yearsof more subdued activity. Durables tend to
be more cyclically sensitive and demand forthese products may have benefited more fromthe growth in real incomes over this period.
In addition, low interest rates probably alsosupported the stronger rise in output in thedurables sector. Certainly, survey results
from the European Commission ConsumerSurveys confirmed the positive climate ofopinion as regards the purchase of durables.
The rise in output in the non-durable goodssector, however, was much more limited in1998, rising by only 1½% overall, and annual1996199719981998199819981998199819981998199819981998

1215consumer confidenceindustrial confidenceconstruction confidencegrowth is estimated to have turned slightlynegative in the fourth quarter.The slowdown in industrial production wasmatched by a sharp turnaround in industrial
confidence (see Chart 4). After reaching apeak in the spring which was close to thatECB Annual Report Ł 199828achieved in the late 1980s and in 1994, therewas a progressive decline during theremainder of the year which left the indicator
slightly below its long-term average. A furthersignal of weaker manufacturing activity wasrecorded by estimates of capacity utilisation,
which fell back towards the end of the year,to below 82½% in the fourth quarter, whileremaining above its average over the period
since 1985.There were some positive indicationsregarding the construction sector in early1998. This followed several years ofprolonged weakness associated with a
widespread problem of excess supplygenerated in the late 1980s and early 1990sin some countries and a normalisation of
construction activity in Germany after highinvestment in the eastern part of the countryfollowing unification. Construction activity
was particularly strong in the first quarter ofthe year, also supported by milder weatherthan is normally experienced at the start ofthe year (and which contrasted markedly withthe exceptionally cold weather in the sameperiod in 1997), but it lost pace in the second
half of 1998 and is estimated to have declinedby around 1% for the year as a whole.Construction confidence improved during
most of the year, and remained at a relativelyhigh level in the final quarter.Overall, 1998 was characterised by a negativeimpact of global developments on net exportsand manufacturing activity, while domestic
demand by and large remained unaffected.This pattern is also reflected in thecontrasting development of industrial and
consumer confidence during the year, basedon the survey evidence from the EuropeanCommission. The correlation between the
two confidence indicators in the past has beenrelatively high and major deviations betweenthe two series have typically been rare. To
some extent, the divergence in 1998 couldperhaps be explained by the effect onindustrial confidence of the deterioration inChart 5Total employment in the euro area(quarterly data; seasonally adjusted)Sources: National data and ECB calculations.Note: Data on total employment are based on national indicators which are not fully comparable.

By contrast, domestic
economic conditions remained positive andnet employment creation and real incomegrowth were among the factors supporting
consumer confidence. In this regard it maybe noted that, on the one hand, industrialactivity accounts for less than one-third of
overall GDP in the euro area, and a slowdownin this sector therefore only partly feedsthrough to the performance of overall
activity. The services sector appears to havebeen influenced predominantly by domesticfactors which have been more supportive of
growth. On the other hand, however,persistent weakness in industrial activity couldeventually have a negative effect on consumer
confidence, if the prospect of continuedincreases in employment and income were tobe called into question.Strengthening of employment growthThe recovery in employment which began inspring 1997 strengthened throughout 1998
(see Chart€5). As signs of a weakening ineconomic activity appeared later in the year,growth of total employment, measured
quarter-on-quarter, probably declinedsomewhat in the fourth quarter, according tonational data available. By contrast with the
sluggish developments observed in the yearsfollowing the downturn in 1993, employmentgrew by more than 1% in 1998. In the courseof the first three quarters of 1998 more jobswere created in the euro area than had beencreated between early 1994 Œ when
employment had levelled out Œ and the endof 1997.The recent slowdown in activity appears tohave had some influence on employmentgrowth in the exposed sectors of the euro
area economy. In manufacturing, quarter-on-quarter net job creation was particularlystrong in the first half of 1998, but
decelerated significantly in the third quarter.As total employment growth did not show aslowdown over the same period, employment
growth in the rest of the economy appearsto have accelerated slightly. This mainlyreflects performance in the sectors less
exposed to external developments, notablythe services sector and the public sector.Furthermore, in some Member States the
continuing expansion of job creationmeasures within the framework of labourmarket policy played an important role.Gradual decline in unemploymentAs a result of the strengthening of net jobcreation, the unemployment rate in the euro
area has been declining continuously Œ albeitat a very gradual pace Œ since October 1997(see Table 4). As a result, the standardised
rate of unemployment, as estimated byEurostat, decreased from 11.7%, the peaklevel in 1997, to 10.7% in December 1998. InSource: Eurostat.Note: Figures calculated in accordance with ILO recommendations.Level and ratesAnnual changes

unemployment over the past five years, itremains high by historical standards as wellas in comparison with the rates recorded in
other major economies outside the euro area,such as the United States, Japan and theUnited Kingdom. The decline in the euro area
unemployment rate appears to have beenparticularly moderate in view of the fact thatin 1998 the increase in employment has
exceeded the trend growth of the labourforce. This suggests that, apart from the trendin population growth, the perception of
better employment prospects may haveencouraged inactive people to enter or toreturn to the labour market.The improvement in the labour marketsituation was also noticeable in the absolute
level of unemployment, as the number ofjobless fell (according to Eurostat) by morethan 950,000 in the year to December 1998,
which constitutes a decrease of 6½%. Thisimprovement was observed in almost all theeuro area countries, including those in which

However, the rate of youthunemployment was still double the rate forthe over-25s at the end of 1998.Box 1Unemployment and economic policyUnemployment, although falling, remains the most serious problem in the euro areaThe reduction of unemployment is the major challenge currently facing euro area Member States. This is acrucial issue, requiring both a serious examination of the underlying causes and careful consideration of the
most effective methods for achieving a significant and sustained decline in unemployment from the presentunacceptably high level. This is also reflected in the formulation of the European Employment Strategy. Whilean elaborate and detailed review of the unemployment problem in the euro area is beyond the scope of this
Report, some key aspects of this issue are highlighted below.In the course of 1998 euro area unemployment fell by almost one million, from a rate of 11.5% at the end of1997 to 10.7% in December 1998. However, despite this decline, unemployment remains unacceptably high at
almost 14€million. The recent decline needs to be viewed against the background of a significant long-termupward trend. Net employment growth, although relatively strong in recent quarters, has, over a longer periodof time, been insufficient to bring about a significant and lasting reduction in unemployment. In this regard, it
is important to address the causes of unemployment and the role that economic policies can play in helping toreduce it. Extensive analysis has been carried out in recent years, at both the national and the internationallevel. Comparisons have also been drawn with the experience of other countries, such as the United States,
whose record in terms of unemployment has been significantly better than that of the euro area.31ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Euro area unemployment is largely of a structural natureA predominant view has emerged, on the basis both of analyses carried out by international bodies and ofacademic research, that unemployment in Europe is, to a large extent, of a structural nature and is caused byfactors of an institutional and regulatory character. A number of structural causes underlying the relatively
high level of unemployment have been identified with regard to both labour supply and labour demand; thesemay be summarised as follows. On the part of potential job seekers, generous unemployment and otherbenefits, as well as the length of time for which these can be claimed, are perceived as acting as a disincentive
to search actively for employment or to accept a job offer. The effectively high marginal tax rates and socialsecurity contributions that are the norm in many European countries are considered to be further disincentivesto take up work, particularly for those in lower income brackets. Moreover, longer spells of unemployment are
associated with a loss of skills and, as a consequence, with a severe reduction in re-employment prospects. Onthe part of employers, high statutory social security contributions have been identified as a significant non-wage cost factor. Moreover, disincentives are also related to the levels of minimum wages, which compare
unfavourably with the labour productivity of, in particular, young people and the less skilled. Strict employmentprotection regulations, which effectively impose large lay-off costs on employers, are pinpointed as additionalfactors which give rise to employment disincentives.A further factor to which reference is often made in the interplay of labour demand and supply is thatindustrial relations are not generally organised in a way that allows wage formation to reflect productivitydevelopment. More generally, a smoother and more timely adaptation of qualifications and/or wages to
changing skill requirements is needed in view of technological developments and increased global competition.In conjunction with higher levels of education, training and retraining, this would also increase labourmobility, thereby contributing to filling vacancies that coexist with high unemployment in some sectors and
regions. It is often asserted that existing wage rigidities are reinforced by strict regulations on working hours.More flexible employment contracts would help to accommodate firm-specific needs while, at the same time,enabling the labour force to move towards the most productive areas. At the same time, the attainment of
higher rates of labour force participation in a number of countries is still hampered by regulations anddisincentives concerning, inter alia, part-time employment. It is important to emphasise that the coexistence ofa variety of structural rigidities tends to lead to a mutual reinforcing of these rigidities.The role of economic policyAgainst this background, the problem of unemployment in the euro area should be addressed by tackling theunderlying impediments to employment growth. These reforms should, preferably, be of a comprehensive
nature. A number of countries have already started addressing these issues. Their experience has demonstratedthat implementing these reforms is a lengthy process and it takes considerable time for the impact onunemployment to become evident. Hence any delay in bringing forward structural reforms is counterproductive.
Indeed, those European countries which are at an advanced stage of implementing wide-ranging reformpolicies have been successful in reducing their structural unemployment. This points to the appropriateness ofsuch an approach and suggests that there are examples that could be followed by other countries. Fiscal policy
geared to budgetary consolidation might also help to improve the efficiency of these reforms and therebystimulate employment creation. This would appear to be the case, in particular, if fiscal consolidation were tofocus primarily on curbing expenditure rather than increasing the tax burden.The best contribution monetary policy can make to fostering economic growth and reducing unemployment inthe medium and long term is to maintain price stability in the euro area in a credible and lasting manner.Maintaining price stability will yield a number of important benefits for employment creation. The various
market mechanisms, supported by structural reform, can be expected to be most effective when the signalssent by the relative price mechanism are not distorted or obscured by changes in the general price level.Moreover, inflation risk premia in long-term interest rates are minimised in an environment of price stability,
thereby helping to reduce the cost of financing productive investment and supporting the long-term growthpotential of the euro area economy, which is necessary to foster employment over the medium term.Maintaining price stability also avoids the significant costs incurred when inflation or deflation exacerbates
the distortions created by tax and benefits systems.ECB Annual Report Ł 199832As embodied in the monetary policy strategy adopted by the Eurosystem, monetary policy reacts in a forward-looking way to changes in the outlook for price stability. It thereby takes full account of the overall situation indemand, supply and the labour markets in the euro area. Indeed, in the current context of low inflationarypressure, accompanied by downward revisions of expected real GDP growth and slow progress in reducing
rates of unemployment, interest rates have reached record lows. Monetary and financial conditions aretherefore no impediment to a recovery of economic activity. However, directing monetary policy towardsactively stimulating demand over the short term, while potentially leading to some immediate positive effects
on employment, cannot be expected to have any lasting effect. Such a policy would put price stability injeopardy and generate inflationary expectations. In this way it would undermine the credibility of monetarypolicy and tend to lead to higher long-term interest rates. This would, in the long term, reduce the level of
employment to below that which would have prevailed without any monetary policy activism. Thus, theultimate impact on employment would be counterproductive.ConclusionsCurrently high and, seen over a time span of several decades, steadily increasing levels of unemployment arethe major challenge to economic policy in the euro area. Economic policy can influence whether the increasesin unemployment which occur during economic downturns are subsequently reversed, and whether a general
turnaround in the long-term trend of unemployment in the euro area can be achieved. However, given thelargely structural nature of unemployment in the euro area, the introduction of structural reforms to labour andproduct markets is the key to achieving low unemployment. Fiscal policies can help this process by focusing
on curbing expenditure growth rather than increasing the tax burden. Monetary policy can make an importantcontribution through the achievement and maintenance of price stability and a stable macroeconomicenvironment.2.3Fiscal developments
Slowdown in fiscal consolidationGovernment budgetary positions improvedfurther in 1998, albeit at a rather slow pace,leaving budgets highly imbalanced on averagein the euro area. According to the latest
available data provided by Eurostat, theaverage deficit-to-GDP ratio in the euro areastood at 2.1%, compared with 2.5% in 1997
(see Table€5). This decline in the deficit ratiocompares with a cumulative decline of2.3 percentage points in 1996 and 1997.
Government deficits are distributed unequallyamong euro area countries, with largercountries Œ which, on account of their relative
weight, largely determine the fiscal stance inthe euro area Œ tending to show higherdeficits in relation to GDP, thereby continuing
to restrict fiscal policy flexibility. Fivecountries had deficit ratios of above 2% in1998; the ratio in France and Italy being above
2.5% and in Germany, Austria and Portugalbetween 2% and 2.5%. Of the remainingcountries, Belgium and Spain recorded deficitsof between 1% and 2% of GDP, while the
deficit ratio of the Netherlands was just
below 1%. Ireland, Luxembourg and Finlandhad budgetary surpluses. The greatestimprovement in budgetary positions in 1998
was observed in Ireland and Finland, wheregovernment balances were improved by morethan 1€percentage point of GDP. In Belgium,
Germany and Spain deficits declined bybetween 0.5 and 1 percentage point, whileonly marginally declining deficit ratios (by 0.1
or 0.2€percentage point) were recorded inFrance and Portugal. In Austria the deficit-to-GDP ratio increased in 1998, and in
Luxembourg the budgetary surplus declined.Government debt ratios in the euro area onaverage remain at a very high level, therebysubstantially limiting the budgetary room formanoeuvre in many Member States. The
average debt ratio declined by 0.8 percentagepoint in 1998 to 73.8%, after having fallenmarginally in 1997 for the first time since
1991, i.e.€since comparable data for the euroarea have been available. Hence the debt ratioin the euro area still by far exceeds the 60%33ECB Annual Report Ł 1998reference value laid down in the Treaty. In1998 the debt ratio was above 60% in six
countries, of which Belgium and Italy had thehighest debt ratios, amounting to 117.3% and118.7% respectively. In the remaining five
countries debt ratios stood between 50%and 60% of GDP, with the exception ofLuxembourg, which recorded a debt ratio of
6.7%. In 1998 debt ratios declined in almostall euro area countries, with the exception ofFrance and Luxembourg. The largest absolute
reductions in debt ratios were observed inIreland and Belgium.Fiscal positions largely driven by strongeconomic activity and declining interest
ratesTo a large extent budgetary developments in1998 were driven by factors beyond thedirect control of the fiscal authorities, whilepolicy-makers did not appear to have taken
an active role in improving the underlyingfinancial positions of general governments. Inparticular, budgetary positions benefited from
stronger economic growth and lower interestrates than in previous years. However, savingsin interest spending were used byGeneral government surplus (+) or deficit (-)1995199619971998

ECB Annual Report Ł 199834governments to cut tax revenues, whileprogress in reducing primary expenditure wasvery limited, with the consequence that the
primary surplus ratio in the euro area as awhole deteriorated by 0.2 percentage pointin 1998 after this indicator had improved over
a number of years. Of the euro areacountries, Ireland, Italy and Portugal benefitedmost from lowered interest payments in
terms of reducing overall deficits.Budgetary developments in 1998 were alsopartly determined by the unwinding oftemporary measures on government deficits.Such measures have favourable effects in one
year only, improve the budgetary situation atthe expense of future budgets or have merepresentational effects. Hence, by their very
nature, they do not contribute to fiscalsustainability. To degrees which variedbetween 0.1 and 1€percentage point of GDP
from one country to another, such measureshad reduced Member States™ generalgovernment deficit ratios in 1997. Hence, in
order simply to maintain the budgetarypositions achieved in 1997, let alone to reachmore ambitious targets, a number of
countries had to take further correctiveaction in 1998. In other words, fiscalconsolidation efforts taken in 1998 did not
fully translate into deficit reduction as a resultof the necessary compensation for thetemporary measures taken in 1997. From the
evidence available, it would appear thatfurther temporary measures played only aminor role in budgetary developments in
1998.With regard to the evolution of individualitems in governments™ budgets, the smalldecrease in the overall deficit in 1998 wasachieved by a reduction in the government
expenditure ratio (mainly due to the fall inthe interest payments ratio) which was strongenough to outpace a decline in government
revenue as a share of GDP. In 1996 and 1997deficit reduction had partly relied onincreasing government revenue. In this sense,
the general fiscal consolidation strategypursued in 1998 can be considered asappropriate, although too modest inmagnitude. The reduction in the expenditureratio in 1998 was not strong enough topermit a rapid decline in government deficits
within the euro area. Moreover, althoughdeclining, government revenue remained veryhigh. Consideration of the structure of
government revenue shows that taxes haverepresented an increasing share of totalrevenue in recent years, whereas the share
of social security contributions in governmentrevenue has fallen. The share of publicinvestment in GDP has remained relatively
stable at a comparatively low level. At thesame time, public investment expenditure wasmarginally higher than overall general
government deficits.With regard to the evolution of governmentdebt, deficit-debt adjustments have played anon-negligible role in reducing debt ratios inthe euro area, as was already the case in
1997. Such adjustments reflect variousfinancial transactions that leave the deficitratio unaffected but have an impact on
government debt levels. They occur, inparticular, in the case of privatisation, acourse of action which has been pursued by
most euro area governments in recent years.Debt developments in 1998 also benefited toa considerable extent from lower interest
spending, while€Œ as mentioned above€Œ thefavourable effect of primary surpluses lostsome of the momentum gained in 1997. In
addition, in the recent past the compositionof government debt has been shifting moretowards medium and long-term financing
instruments.Medium-term fiscal plans without sufficientsafety marginsFiscal plans for 1999 and for the mediumterm signal a slowdown in previous efforts tofurther consolidate public finances and create
better conditions for prolonged economicgrowth and permanent job creation. Thisbecomes apparent when considering 1999
government budgets and medium-term fiscalstrategies as laid down in the Member States™stability programmes, which have been35ECB Annual Report Ł 1998submitted to the European Commission inaccordance with the Stability and GrowthPact. Most countries are still far from
attaining the target set out in the Stabilityand Growth Pact of achieving budgetarypositions ﬁclose to balance or in surplusﬂ
over the medium term. The means ofachieving this target and the time frame inwhich to do so differ from one country toanother owing to significant differences instarting positions and in expectedmacroeconomic scenarios. The projected
fiscal effort in some countries could beregarded as being unambitious in the light ofthe favourable forecasts for real growth and
interest rates. More generally, furtherconsolidation efforts have been postponed(see Box 2).Box 2Medium-term budgetary objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact and the policystrategies of Member StatesAccording to the Stability and Growth Pact adopted by the Council of the European Union in 1997, MemberStates are committed ﬁto adhere to the medium-term objective of budgetary positions close to balance or insurplusﬂ. This objective is considered appropriate ﬁto allow Member States to deal with normal cyclical
fluctuations while keeping the government deficit within the 3% of GDP reference valueﬂ. For the purpose ofmultilateral surveillance, Member States are obliged to submit to the Council of the European Union and theEuropean Commission stability programmes (in the case of euro area countries) or convergence programmes
(for non-participating Member States) which present the information needed to assess the envisaged budgetaryadjustments aimed at reaching the close to balance or surplus position.Euro area Member States™ stability programmes, submitted in late 1998 or early 1999, are aimed at furtherconsolidating general government budgetary positions. However, the envisaged progress in bringing down
government deficits and debt levels varies significantly from one country to another and reveals ratherunambitious fiscal targets for some countries (see the table above). A number of governments have alreadyachieved balanced budgets or even surpluses and intend to maintain or further improve such positions
(i.e.€Ireland, Luxembourg and Finland), thereby also allowing debt ratios to fall rapidly or remain at a lowlevel. All other euro area Member States, with the exception of Belgium and Spain, are currently aiming toachieve medium-term deficits of about 1% or higher. Moreover, stability programmes are often based on the
assumption of buoyant economic activity over the medium term. The ECOFIN Council concluded that themedium-term objectives of the stability programmes provide a safety margin which allows Member States, in1)According to Luxembourg™s stability programme, general government debt, which in total represented 6.7% of GDP in 1998,
will not increase in the forecasting period.Macroeconomic assumptions and fiscal targets enshrined in Member States™ stability programmesyrtnuo

ECB Annual Report Ł 199836the event of a normal cyclical downturn, to let automatic stabilisers work without large risk of exceeding the3% reference value. In this sense, the Council considers the medium-term budgetary situation in the stability
programmes to be in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Nevertheless, in the event ofa severe or prolonged growth slowdown, government deficits in some countries could easily approach or evenbreach the 3% deficit limit. Hence, as cyclically adjusted deficits in the euro area as a whole are still high, no
sufficient safety margin has as yet been provided for in order to let automatic stabilisers operate fully in a moresevere growth slowdown without running the risk of quickly breaching the 3% reference value.In addition, from a forward-looking perspective, the medium-term target in most stability programmesappears to be rather a minimum requirement for budgetary solvency. It does not envisage procedures to copefully with the unfunded liabilities implicit in current public pension and health care schemes, nor does it
provide for additional budgetary flexibility to address the longer-term structural problems of public finances,in particular the need to reduce high debt ratios at a satisfactory pace.In the event of a severe or prolonged growthslowdown, government deficits in a numberof countries could easily approach or even
breach the 3% deficit limit, because currentfiscal plans do not incorporate a sufficientsafety margin to let automatic stabilisers work
fully without the risk of budgetary positionsbecoming excessively imbalanced. This is allthe more important because government debt
remains far too high and debt ratios haveonly started to decline recently, with no signof the downward movement being rapid.
Hence they continue to impose strongpressure on public finances as interestpayments absorb a significant share of
government revenue. In addition, governmentbudgets and, in particular, unfunded publicpension and health care schemes will be
confronted with the serious financialconsequences of ageing populations over themedium term in almost all euro area
countries. For these reasons, budget plansshould not only be tailored so as to safeguardpublic finances against the financial
consequences of potential future recessions,but should also build up schemes to copefully with the implicit future liabilities
accumulated within the government sector.2.4Foreign trade
Conflicting events marked the international
environment that influenced euro areacountries™ foreign trade during 1998.As mentioned in Section€1, the globalmacroeconomic environment worsened as aresult of declining demand and output in mostAsian countries. In the first half of the year
these effects were offset by the sustainedeconomic growth in the euro area™s maintrading partners and the substantial
weakening of oil and commodity prices, whichhelped to dampen import prices. However,in the second half of 1998 the rate of growth
of exports in the euro area slowedsignificantly.The only data available on overall balance ofpayments developments for the euro area bythe cut-off date (10 March 1999) were trade
data produced by Eurostat, based on grossdata for exports and imports of goodsbetween the euro area and the rest of the
world, excluding intra-euro area transactions(see Table€6 and Chapter€II, Section€3.1, onbalance of payments statistics).Over recent years the euro area tradebalance with the rest of the world has shown
a slightly rising surplus, from 0.9% of GDP in1995 to 1.7% of GDP in 1997. However,from mid-1998 onwards the worsening in the
global economy had a delayed impact on thetrade balance of the euro area. In particular,after the first quarter of 1998, euro area
export growth was increasingly affected bythe global economic environment. Some ofthe impact may also have been related to
the appreciation of euro area currencies.Meanwhile, import volumes increased owingto strong domestic demand and weak foreign37ECB Annual Report Ł 1998prices, but the growth in the total value ofimports declined sharply owing to reducedcommodity prices.Over the first 11 months of the year thecumulative surplus in the trade balancereached ECU€77.6 billion, ECU€3.5 billion
lower than in the corresponding period in1997. The value of imports increased by 5.8%,reaching ECU€649.3 billion for the first11 months of 1998. For the same period thevalue of exports, at ECU€726.8 billion, was4.6% higher in comparison with the first 11
months of 1997. This contrasts sharply withthe stronger growth rates seen for importsand exports in early 1998. According to the
above figures, the trade balance as apercentage of GDP is expected to haveTable 7Exports and imports by product of the euro area(annual percentage changes; exports (f.o.b.); imports (c.i.f.))199619971997199819981998199819981998199819981998

ECB Annual Report Ł 199838declined by 0.1-0.2 percentage point of GDPin 1998.These broad trends in trade flows are alsodiscernible when exports and imports arebroken down by product (for which data up
to October 1998 are available, see Table€7).In particular, the rate of growth of exportsdeclined across all major categories. With
regard to the value of imports in the thirdquarter, negative growth rates were recordedmainly in raw materials and energy owing to
decreasing world market prices for suchproducts.2.5Bond and stock markets
Long-term bond yields decline furtherLong-term government bond yields inindustrialised countries declined tohistorically low levels in the course of 1998.These global developments reflected the
continuation of a trend which has beenevident in bond markets since 1990 (seeBox 3). In the euro area the average level of
10-year government bond yields dropped byalmost 150 basis points during 1998 to reacha level of 3.95% by the end of the year. In the
United States 10-year government bond yieldsdeclined by almost 120 basis points to 4.70%over the same period. As a consequence, the
differential between US 10-year governmentbond yields and comparable yields in the euroarea widened to 75€basis points by the end of
the year. Developments in Japan differedslightly, with 10-year bond yields decliningfor most of 1998, eventually by more than
100 basis points, to reach unprecedentedlevels of below 1% before rising markedlytowards the very end of the year. This sharp
increase left 10-year bond yields in Japan atslightly above end-1997 levels by the end of1998.Further declines in global rates of inflationappeared to play a key role in the declines in
long-term interest rates, while successivebouts of exceptional volatility in globalfinancial markets tended to accelerate thisprocess. The turbulence intensified in thesummer months, with concerns about economicconditions in emerging market economies such
as countries in Asia, Russia and countries inLatin America. With the debt moratorium andeffective default in Russia, as well as a
devaluation of the rouble in August, theturbulence intensified and spilled over to thefinancial markets of industrialised countries.Against this background, over the summermonths the assessment by international
financial market participants regarding riskappeared to shift quite dramatically. This wasreflected in a generalised ﬁflight to qualityﬂ
from emerging markets to the bond marketsof industrialised countries, favouring highlyliquid benchmarks. In addition, in
industrialised countries a ﬁflight to safetyﬂwas observed from assets with relativelyhigher risk, such as equities, to bonds. A
particular feature of this phenomenon was asignificant widening of corporate bondinterest rate spreads vis-à-vis government
bonds with comparable maturities in theUnited States. This, in turn, led to concernsregarding the possibility of the emergence of
a ﬁcredit crunchﬂ in the United States. Incontrast, in the euro area, given thedifferences in financial market structure, there
was little discernible evidence of suchconcerns.The aforementioned developments inemerging markets appear to have had animpact on global financial markets via two
distinct channels that tended to reinforce oneanother. First, although developments mayhave partly reflected the influence of ﬁsafe-
havenﬂ flows, they also seemed to lead to adownward reassessment of the prospects forglobal economic growth. The expectation of
slower global growth coupled with theassociated decline in commodity pricesalso appeared to lead to a downward
reassessment of the global inflation outlookby financial markets. A second factor wasincreased concern about the vulnerability of
the global financial system to developmentsin individual financial markets or thedifficulties of some large financial institutions.39ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Box 3Accounting for the decline in long-term bond yields to historically low levelsBy the end of 1998 long-term bond yields in industrialised countries had reached levels that in many cases werehistorically unprecedented. The average level of 10-year bond yields in the euro area was the lowest recordedsince the late 1940s, with yields in some individual countries reaching exceptionally low levels. In the United
States 10-year government bond yields reached levels that had not been seen since before the mid-1960s. Themost extreme case was Japan, where 10-year yields temporarily reached levels of below 1% during 1998.These developments in global bond markets reflect the continuation of a trend that has been common toindustrialised countries since 1990, with the exception of a brief interruption during 1994 when international
bond markets endured a period of turbulence. Long-term nominal interest rates represent expectations of thereal interest rate (including risk premia) and inflation expectations. Among these factors, the key influence onthis longer-term global decline in bond yields has been the simultaneous decline in global rates of inflation, as
well as an associated decline in longer-term inflation expectations reflecting, in particular, increased world-wide confidence in the ability of monetary policy to deliver low and stable rates of inflation in the longer term.In line with the decline in long-term nominal interest rates, real interest rates Œ although they are difficult tomeasure Œ have also fallen. First, the enhanced price stability orientation of monetary policy may have
contributed to a reduction in the risk premia associated with the inflation variability that tends to be embeddedin long-term real rates of interest. Since inflation variability tends to be high when the level of inflation is high,the global decline in inflation may have been coupled with a general decline in inflation uncertainty. Second,
declines in general government deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios, that have reduced the demand of the publicsector on global capital markets, also played an important role. Furthermore, these improvements in fiscalpositions may also have contributed to declines in risk premia related to concerns about longer-term
sustainability. An additional factor in the euro area has been the gradual disappearance of exchange riskpremia, which has facilitated a convergence of real long-term interest rates towards the levels of thosecountries with the lowest yields.After mid-1997, when concerns about the economic situation in some Asian countries initially emerged,declines in nominal long-term interest rates tended to accelerate and it seemed that the bond markets ofindustrialised countries had benefited from safe-haven flows. A similar pattern was also observed during theturbulence in the international financial markets in autumn 1998. These developments would tend to suggest
that while the low levels of long-term bond yields in industrialised countries primarily reflect structuralfactors, the possibility of a temporary shift of international capital cannot be excluded.Sources: ECB and BIS.Note: Long-term government bond yields refer to 10-year bonds or the closest available bond maturity.Long-term government bond yields in the euro area, the United States and Japan(percentages per annum; daily data)199019911992199319941995199619971998

United States and the euro area countriesheightened. The subsequent cuts in interestrates in these economies also facilitated
further declines in long-term bond yields.After mid-October 1998 the turbulence inthe financial markets gradually began tosubside. The catalyst for this turnaroundseemed to be the agreement on reform
packages in Brazil and Japan and the reactionof the monetary authorities in the UnitedStates to perceived risks for financial stability.
Despite some reversal in the trend of bondyields in many industrialised countriestowards the end of the year, yields continued
to decline in the euro area. Thesedevelopments would tend to reinforce theview that longer-term expectations for
inflation dropped throughout 1998,particularly in the euro area.In January 1999 long-term bond yields in theeuro area dropped further to levels of wellbelow 4%. This development was supported
by an international portfolio reallocation infavour of euro-denominated securities oncethe changeover was seen to have progressed
smoothly. During February 1999, however,long-term bond yields in the euro area edgedupwards, primarily reflecting a spillover from
the United States. Nonetheless, during themonth the differential between euro area andUS long-term interest rates widened further.Long-term interest rate differentials remainstable in the euro areaAt the beginning of 1998 the deviationbetween the highest and lowest 10-yeargovernment bond yields in the euro areastood at an already very low level of
just under 40 basis points. Following theannouncement in May 1998 of the selectionof those countries that would adopt the single
currency from 1 January 1999, remaining long-term interest rate differentials among theparticipating countries narrowed further. Thisdevelopment reflected in part the progresstowards the closing of short-term interestrate differentials as well as the elimination of
intra-euro area exchange risk premia. Thevolatility in global financial markets did not,however, significantly affect long-term interest
rate differentials within the euro area.Although a temporary ﬁflight to liquidbenchmarksﬂ in the autumn months led to a
widening of long-term interest rate differentials,this development was later quickly reversed.The relative stability of low long-term interestrate differentials during this period was anotable development, since long-term interest
rate differentials within the euro area haveoften widened in the past, sometimes bysignificant amounts, in times of turbulence in
the international financial markets. Therelative resilience of long-term interest ratedifferentials during this period highlights the
beneficial influence of the EMU process onfinancial stability within the euro area. Theremaining deviation between the highest and
lowest long-term interest rates within arelatively tight range of below 20 basis pointsin early 1999 appears to be, to a large extent,
a reflection of differences in the size, depth,liquidity and structure of national governmentbond markets.Despite turbulence, global stock marketsshow overall increasesStock markets in most industrialisedcountries experienced a high degree ofvolatility during 1998. During the first half ofthe year significant increases were observed.
The largest increases were seen in the euroarea, where, by mid-July 1998, the broad DowJones EURO STOXX index was almost 45%
above end-1997 levels. By mid-July in theUnited States the Standard and Poor™s 500index was more than 20% above end-1997
levels, while in Japan an increase of almost10% in the Nikkei 225 index was observedover the same period. As a consequence, by
mid-1998 key stock market valuationindicators such as price-earnings ratiosreached historically high levels across most41ECB Annual Report Ł 1998of the industrialised countries. Similarly,corporate dividend yields reached historicallylow levels. Although the increases in price-earnings ratios may, in part, have reflected
the simultaneous declines observed in globallong-term interest rates, the departure ofvaluation measures from levels that were

sustainability of international stock pricelevels.Following the outbreak of turbulence in thefinancial markets of emerging economies,there was a ﬁflight to safetyﬂ from stock
markets to government bond marketsacross the industrialised countries. Thisphenomenon was reflected in a particularly
large decline in the broad Dow Jones EUROSTOXX index of almost 35% between mid-July and early October 1998. In the United
States stock prices dropped by almost 20% froma peak in mid-July to a trough in early October,while a decline of almost 25% was observed in
Japan.

of industrialised countries have been relativelyuncommon. A key factor in this developmentmay have been perceptions that the highstock price levels observed in mid-1998 were
not sustainable and hence vulnerable to sharpchanges in earnings expectations and equityrisk premia. Concerns about emerging
economies seemed to lead to a deteriorationin both of these factors. A notable feature ofthe declines in stock markets was a sharp
downgrading of bank and financial stock pricesacross all major markets.However, sentiment in global financialmarkets changed once again during the lastquarter of 1998, with stock prices showing a
significant recovery after the first week ofOctober 1998. Taking 8 October 1998 as theturning-point in global stock markets, the
increase in the euro area broad Dow JonesEURO STOXX index was around 35%from that day until end-December 1998.
Meanwhile, in the United States the Standardand Poor™s 500 index showed an increase ofabout 28% over the same period, while the
recovery in Japan was less robust, with theNikkei 225 index increasing by just over 6%over the period from 8 October 1998 toECB Annual Report Ł 199842Chart 8Difference between market and theoretical ECU exchange rates(in percentages; daily data)Sources: Reuters and ECB.-0.4-0.20.0

1998Dec.end-December 1998. These developments lefteuro area stock prices below the peaks ofmid-July, although they stood significantly
higher than their end-1997 levels. By theend of the year stock prices in the UnitedStates had risen above their previous peak
levels. By contrast, Japanese stock pricesdemonstrated a year-on-year decline.At the very beginning of 1999 sharp increasesin euro area stock prices were observedwhich mainly reflected international portfolio
reallocation in favour of euro-denominatedsecurities. These increases were laterreversed owing to a further bout of volatility
in global financial markets that reflectedmarket uncertainties about the economicand financial situation in Brazil. These
uncertainties also provoked similar declinesin the United States and Japan. DuringFebruary 1999, mainly reflecting global stock
market spillovers and the upturn in domesticlong-term bond yields, stock prices in the euroarea were subject to some volatility, although
they remained above end-1998 levels.Issuance of ECU bonds increases and ECUspreads closeThe outstanding amount of bondsdenominated in ECU increased in the courseof 1998, as it had in 1997, after having
decreased over the period from 1993 to1996. The turnover in the ECU bond markets,when measured on the basis of trades settled
in one of the two international securitiesdepositories of the euro area (Cedel Bankand Euroclear), also increased markedly in
the course of 1998. These developments,which occurred largely in the second half of1998, were related to the fact that the ECU
was increasingly seen by some marketparticipants as a useful conduit into euro-denominated bonds at the beginning of the
third stage of EMU, reflecting the expectedone-for-one conversion to the euro of thetheoretical ECU.The spread between market and theoretical(or ﬁbasketﬂ) ECU exchange rates, which had
been narrowing gradually since early 199643ECB Annual Report Ł 1998and had reached positive values at the end of1997, remained at values of between zeroand +20 basis points during most of 1998.
The spread became negative, however, for ashort period between mid-January and mid-February 1998, reaching a level of -25 basis
points. At the beginning of October, duringan episode of financial market instability, theECU spread widened sharply, reaching +120
basis points at its peak on 12€October. Theincrease in the ECU spread appeared to berelated to technical factors such as the
unwinding, in particular by some hedge funds,of short positions in the market ECU. Theseshort positions were sometimes associated
with long positions in the basket ECU,resulting in a strategy aimed at profiting fromthe expected narrowing of the spread in
the run-up to the start of the third stage ofEMU on 1 January 1999. As tensions eased,however, the spread decreased gradually,
falling below 50€basis points at the end ofOctober. Thereafter it continued to follow adeclining trend until the exchange rates of
the market and basket ECU, as expected,became equal at the end of 1998.2.6National monetary policies
during 1998Monetary policy focused on the future euro
areaDuring 1998 the focus of monetary policiesin euro area Member States gradually shiftedfrom a national to a euro area perspective.
This was necessary since the existence ofsignificant lags in the transmission ofmonetary policy implied that decisions taken
at the individual country level increasinglyinfluenced the conditions for price stability inStage Three of EMU. In addition, the need for
the convergence of short-term interest ratesat the end of Stage Two required closeco-operation between euro area NCBs in the
context of the Governing Council of the ECBin order to reach a common positionconcerning the appropriate starting level of
interest rates for the euro area as a whole inStage Three.At the beginning of May 1998, when thedecision on the participating countries wastaken, diverse levels of short-term interestChart 9Three-month interest rate in the euro area(percentages per annum; daily data)Source: ECB.Note: Euro area average of national three-month interbank rates until 29 December 1998; three-month EURIBOR from

had closely aligned monetary policies and arelatively low level of short-term interestrates. In four other countries (Spain, Ireland,
Italy and Portugal) short-term interest rateswere significantly above those of the firstgroup. In the remainder of 1998 monetary
policy stances thus had to be adjusted and acommon level of short-term interest rateshad to be found which was suitable for the
maintenance of price stability in the euroarea.Against a favourable outlook for price stabilityin the euro area, with moderate monetarygrowth, exchange rate stability and indications
of a weakening of economic growth in thesecond half of the year, the convergenceprocess took place through gradual

co-ordinated move. This decision reflected aconsensus within the Governing Council ofthe ECB on the basis of a common assessment
of the economic, monetary and financialsituation in the euro area. The joint reductionin interest rates was to be seen as a de facto
decision on the level of interest rates withwhich the Eurosystem would start StageThree.The path of monetary policies and theexchange rate developments within the ERM
during 1998 were very much shaped bythe decision taken during the weekend of2-3 May 1998, when the countries that were
to adopt the euro as the single currency asfrom 1 January 1999 were selected. On thatoccasion, the bilateral exchange rates to be
used in determining the euro conversion rateswere pre-announced to be the ERM bilateralcentral rates for the participating currencies.
The pre-announcement implied that forwardexchange rates rapidly converged towards thepre-announced bilateral exchange rates. This,45ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Chart 11Exchange rate deviations from ERM bilateral central rates againstthe Deutsche Mark(in percentages; daily data)Source: National data.in turn, resulted in a mechanical relationbetween the path of convergence of spot
exchange rates to central rates and the pathalong which money market interest ratedifferentials narrowed.The pre-announcement helped to stabilisethe ERM for the remainder of the year
by reducing uncertainties regarding thechangeover to the single currency. Periods ofsignificant turbulence in international financial
markets, in particular over the summer, didnot disturb ERM exchange rates, whichremained closely aligned with their expected
paths. These developments suggested that ahigh degree of confidence in the successfulcreation of the euro existed among market
participants. Overall, and reflecting theprocess of convergence of official interestrates described above, the euro area average
of money market interest rates at the three-month maturity fell by around 70€basis pointsfrom the beginning of 1998 to the end of
November 1998 and by a further 30€basispoints in December 1998, reaching 3.25% atthe end of the year (see Chart 9).The following two sections describe in moredetail the monetary policies pursued by theJan.

unchanged since April 1996 (see Chart 12).In December 1997 the Bundesbank confirmedits two-year monetary target of around 5%
per annum, reducing the target corridor forthe annual rate of M3 growth in the fourthquarter of 1998 to 3-6% from 3.5-6.5% in
the previous year. At the same time theBundesbank explained that following theselection of the countries adopting the single
currency as from 1 January 1999, monetarypolicy would have to widen its focus to takegreater account of the monetary policy
situation in the whole of the euro area.During most of 1998 M3 growth movedcontinuously within the target corridor. InECB Annual Report Ł 199846Chart 12Official and key interest rates(end-of-month data; in percentages)Source: National data.19971998

5.1% compared with the final quarter of 1996.Therefore, both the monetary target for 1998and that for the two-year period 1997-98
were met. On 3 December 1998 theBundesbank cut its securities repurchase rateto 3% as part of the co-ordinated move of
the euro area NCBs which was deemedappropriate in view of the outlook for pricestability in the euro area as a whole.The Monetary Policy Council of the Banquede France decided to carry over its monetary
policy guidelines for 1997 unchanged into1998, with the aim of maintaining pricestability Œ defined as CPI growth not
exceeding 2% Œ in 1998 and in the mediumterm. Monetary policy continued to bedefined in terms of two intermediate
objectives: first, a stable external value of theFrench franc against the group of the mostcredible ERM currencies; and, second, a 5%
target for the growth of the money supply (interms of narrow and broad monetaryaggregates). The French franc remained very
stable throughout 1998, trading close to itscentral rates within the ERM. For most of theperiod up to October the growth of M3 was
slightly below 5%, decreasing to 2.7% inDecember 1998, compared with 2.0% at theend of 1997. In December 1998 the monetary
aggregates M1 and M2 grew by 3.1% and4.3% respectively, compared with 6.5% and7.8% in December 1997.The NCBs of Belgium, the Netherlands andAustria continued to focus on the stability of
the exchange rates of their nationalcurrencies vis-à-vis the Deutsche Mark in theERM. The currencies of all three countries
showed a high degree of stability within theERM, with forward and spot exchange ratesremaining close to German levels throughout
the year (see Chart 11).Suomen Pankki continued to target an annualincrease in the indicator of underlyinginflation of around 2% in the context of theFinnish markka™s participation in the ERM.Against a background of strong economicgrowth and signs of upward pressures onprices, Suomen Pankki increased its tender
rate by 15 basis points to 3.4% on 19 March1998. Later, in the context of exchange ratestability within the ERM and despite economic
activity continuing at a strong pace,inflationary pressures gradually receded inFinland, with the 12-month increase in the
indicator of underlying inflation reaching0.4% in December 1998. On 3€December1998 the tender rate was reduced by 40
basis points to 3% in the context of theco-ordinated move by all euro area NCBs.Smooth convergence towards low interestrate levels in Spain, Ireland, Italy and
PortugalThe Banco de España defined a target for CPIinflation of close to 2% in 1998. During theyear the 12-month growth rate of the CPImoved in line with this target. Developments
in prices were particularly subduedfrom September 1998 onwards, with CPIinflation reaching 1.4% in December 1998.
Furthermore, the exchange rate of theSpanish peseta remained relatively stablethroughout the year, steadily converging to
the pre-announced rates. This contextallowed the Banco de España gradually tolower its 10-day repurchase rate from 4.75%
at the beginning of the year to 3% on3 December 1998, with the main adjustmentoccurring towards the end of the year.In Ireland monetary policy was gearedtowards ensuring a smooth transition
towards Monetary Union. Rapid economicgrowth implied the maintenance of significantshort-term interest rate differentials against
the euro area countries with the lowestinterest rates in 1998. Reflecting the strengthof the Irish pound in the ERM, the Irish
pound™s central rate was revalued by 3%in March 1998 to a level consistent witheconomic fundamentals and with sustained
convergence. This notwithstanding, until late1998 the persistence of sizable short-terminterest rate differentials vis-à-vis other euroECB Annual Report Ł 199848area countries supported a strong Irish poundwithin the ERM, thus contributing tocontaining inflationary pressures in Ireland
(see Charts 10 and 11). The convergence ofIrish money market interest rates took placemainly in the autumn of 1998. The Central
Bank of Ireland first reduced its repurchaserate by 125 basis points to 4.94% with effectfrom 12 October 1998. On 9 November 1998
it reduced this rate by another 125 basispoints and on 3 December 1998 a furtherreduction of 69 basis points to 3% with effect
from 4 December 1998 was announced.In 1998 the Banca d™Italia followed a policyaimed at price stability, based on a broadrange of indicators and a reference value forbroad money growth of 5%, in order to foster
the completion of the convergence processand continued exchange rate stability vis-à-vis participating currencies. In the context of
rapid monetary expansion and increases inprices and labour costs of above the euroarea average, the Banca d™Italia gradually
lowered official interest rates over the year,first reducing its discount rate by 50 basispoints on 22 April 1998. Further cuts in
interest rates occurred in the fourth quarterof the year, with reductions in the discountrate of 100 basis points at the end of October
1998, 50 basis points on 3 December 1998and, finally, a further 50 basis points on23€December 1998 to 3% (see Chart 12).The Banco de Portugal was able to achieveits policy objective of keeping the exchange
rate of the Portuguese escudo broadly stablein the ERM during 1998. Against thebackground of Portuguese inflation rates of
above the euro area average, the narrowingof short-term interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro area countries with the lowest
short-term interest rates occurred mainly inthe second half of the year. The repurchaserate was reduced, in several steps, from 5.3%
at the beginning of the year to 3% on3€December€1998.2.7The monetary policy of the
EurosystemAt the start of Stage Three of EMU the
Eurosystem€Œ comprising the ECB and theNCBs of the 11 Member States which
adopted the euro on 1 January 1999€Œassumed the task of conducting the singlemonetary policy for the euro area as a whole.
With a unified monetary policy, policydecisions must be made in a manner thatreflects conditions across the euro area in its
entirety, rather than specific regional ornational developments. As described inSection 2.6, the changeover of monetary
policies to Stage Three has been smooth,reflecting the close co-operation during StageTwo and the euro area perspective already
adopted by participating NCBs in 1998.In order to guide market expectations in theresulting new institutional environment, theGoverning Council of the ECB has announceda stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.
This section first describes this strategy andthen turns to the monetary policy decisionswhich were taken in the first few weeks of
1999 on the basis of this strategy.The stability-oriented monetary policystrategy of the EurosystemOn 13€October€1998 the Governing Councilannounced the main elements of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the
Eurosystem, which will guide monetary policydecisions in Stage Three of EMU. Insubsequent speeches and statements, the
President of the ECB and other members ofthe Governing Council have elaborated onthe details of the strategy. In its first Monthly
Bulletin (January 1999) the ECB published adetailed article describing the strategy.The Eurosystem™s monetary policy strategyconsists of three main elements: thepublication of a quantitative definition of the
primary objective of monetary policy, namelyprice stability, and the two ﬁpillarsﬂ of thestrategy used to maintain this objective.49ECB Annual Report Ł 1998These pillars are a prominent role for money,as signalled by the announcement of aquantitative reference value for the growth
of a broad monetary aggregate, and a broadlybased assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments and risks to price stability in
the euro area as a whole.The quantitative definition of price stabilityPublishing a quantitative definition of pricestability serves two purposes. First, it givesclear guidance to market expectations offuture price developments. Second, it gives
the public a measure for assessing the successof the single monetary policy, therebystrengthening the accountability of the
Eurosystem.The Governing Council has defined pricestability as ﬁa year-on-year increase in theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP) for the euro area of below 2%ﬂ. Pricestability according to this definition ﬁis to bemaintained over the medium termﬂ. Thephrase ﬁbelow 2%ﬂ clearly delineates the
upper boundary for the rate of measuredinflation in the HICP that is consistent withprice stability. At the same time, the use of
the word ﬁincreaseﬂ in the definition clearlysignals that deflation, i.e. prolonged declinesin the level of the HICP index, would also
not be deemed consistent with price stability.Among economists in academic, financial andcentral banking circles, there is broadconsensus that various forms of so-calledﬁmeasurement biasﬂ can exist in consumer
price indices (CPIs). These biases arise mainlyfrom changing spending patterns and qualityimprovements in those goods and services
included in the basket used to define a specificprice index. Such biases cannot always befully corrected in the construction of price
indices. The measurement bias typicallycauses CPIs to overstate slightly the ﬁtrueﬂrate of inflation. By only referring to
ﬁincreasesﬂ, without specifying an explicitlower boundary for inflation rates consistentwith price stability, the announced definitionof price stability allows both for the possibleexistence of measurement bias in the HICPfor the euro area and for uncertainty
regarding its magnitude.The chosen definition identifies the HICP asthe price index that should be used in theassessment of whether price stability has beenachieved. The use of the HICP is consistent
with the public™s focus on consumer prices inits assessment of developments in the pricelevel. In addition, the HICP is harmonised
across the countries participating in MonetaryUnion. Focusing on the HICP for the euroarea guarantees the adoption of an area-wide
perspective in monetary policy-making.The statement that ﬁprice stability is to bemaintained over the medium termﬂ reflectsthe need for monetary policy to have aforward-looking, medium-term orientation. It
also acknowledges the existence of short-term volatility in prices, resulting from non-monetary shocks to the price level, such as
indirect tax changes or variations incommodity prices, that cannot be controlledby monetary policy. As the Eurosystem
cannot be held responsible for these short-term shocks to the price level, assessing theperformance of the single monetary policy
over the medium term ensures genuine andmeaningful accountability for the Eurosystem.The Eurosystem™s definition of price stabilityis in line with the definitions used by mostNCBs in the euro area prior to the transition
to Monetary Union, ensuring an importantelement of continuity with their successfulmonetary policy strategies.The two pillars of the strategyThe reference value Œ a prominent role for moneyTo maintain price stability according to itsdefinition, the Governing Council has adopteda strategy that assigns a prominent role to
money, in recognition of the monetary originsof inflation over the longer term. Moneyconstitutes a natural, firm and reliableECB Annual Report Ł 199850ﬁnominal anchorﬂ for monetary policy aimingat the preservation of price stability. To signalthe prominent role assigned to money, the
Governing Council has announced aquantitative reference value for monetarygrowth as one pillar of the overall stability-
oriented strategy. The reference value isintended to help the Governing Council toanalyse and present the information contained
in the monetary aggregates in a manner thatoffers a coherent and credible guide formonetary policy.The quantitative reference value for monetarygrowth was derived in a manner that is
consistent with Œ and serves the maintenanceof Œ price stability. Consequently, substantialor prolonged deviations of monetary growth
from the reference value would, undernormal circumstances, signal risks to pricestability over the medium term.The reference value is designed to helpmaintain price stability over the medium term.
Therefore, in the first instance, a deviation ofmonetary growth from the reference valuewill prompt further analysis to identify and
interpret the economic disturbance thatcaused the deviation. If this analysis suggeststhat the disturbance identified indeed points
to a threat to price stability, monetary policywould respond in a manner appropriate tocounter this risk. Thus, interest rates will not
be changed ﬁmechanisticallyﬂ in response tosuch deviations or attempt to returnmonetary growth to the reference value over
the short term. For this reason, the referencevalue is different from a target that the centralbank intends to meet at a specific point in
time and against which it wishes to be heldaccountable.The relationship between actual monetarygrowth and the reference value is beinganalysed regularly and thoroughly by the
Governing Council. This assessment is basedon the three-month moving average of the12-month growth rate of money. Using this
approach ensures that erratic monthlyoutturns in the data do not unduly distortthe information contained in the monetaryaggregate, thereby reinforcing the medium-term orientation of the reference value. Theresults of this analysis and its impact on
monetary policy decisions are explained tothe public. Through this process, monetarypolicy decision-making is being made clearer
and more transparent.The Governing Council has chosen toannounce a reference value for a broadmonetary aggregate (M3). This aggregateincludes not only currency in circulation and
shorter-term bank deposits, but also boththe shares/units issued by money marketfunds (MMFs) and the money market paper
and short-term debt securities issued byMonetary Financial Institutions (MFIs).On 1€December€1998 the Governing Councilannounced its reference value for M3 growth.The reference value for monetary growth
has been derived using the well-knownrelationship between money, on the onehand, and prices, real gross domestic product
(GDP) and the velocity of circulation, onthe other. In view of the medium-termorientation of monetary policy, it was deemed
appropriate to base the derivation of thereference value on the following medium-term assumptions:Łprice stability must be maintained, in
accordance with the Eurosystem™s definition,
so that year-on-year increases in the HICPfor the euro area are below 2%;Łthe medium-term trend of real GDP
growth lies in the range of 2-2½% perannum; andŁover the medium term the decline in the
velocity of circulation of M3 is in the
approximate range of ½-1% per annum.In setting the reference value for monetary
growth, the Governing Council emphasisedthat the Eurosystem™s published definition ofprice stability limits increases in the HICP for
the euro area to below 2%. Furthermore, theGoverning Council took the view that the
actual trend decline in velocity is likely to lie51ECB Annual Report Ł 1998somewhat below the upper boundary of its½-1% range. Taking account of these twofactors, the Governing Council decided to
set the first reference value for M3 growth at4½% per annum. The Governing Councilintends to review this reference value in
December 1999.The presentation of monetary analysis to thepublic will naturally focus on developments inthe ﬁkeyﬂ broad monetary aggregate M3in relation to the published reference value
for monetary growth. Nevertheless,developments in other monetary aggregates,which are in fact components of M3, and in
the counterparts of the key aggregate in theconsolidated MFI balance sheet are also beingthoroughly assessed on an ongoing basis by
the Eurosystem. Such analysis provides usefulbackground information that helps in theassessment of developments in M3. In its
February 1999 Monthly Bulletin the ECBpublished a detailed article on the definitionof the euro area monetary aggregates and
their role in the monetary policy strategy ofthe Eurosystem.A broadly based assessment of the outlook forprice developmentsAlthough the monetary data containinformation vital to guide monetary policy-making, on their own they do not constitute
a complete summary of all the informationabout the economy required to set anappropriate monetary policy for the
maintenance of price stability. Therefore, inparallel with the analysis of M3 growth inrelation to the reference value, a broadly
based assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments and the risks to price stabilityin the euro area plays a major role in the
strategy of the Eurosystem. This assessmentis being made using a wide range of economicindicators.This wide range of indicators includes manyvariables that have leading indicator
properties for future price developments.These variables include, inter alia, wages,exchange rates, bond prices and the yieldcurve, various measures of real activity, fiscalpolicy indicators, price and cost indices andbusiness and consumer confidence surveys.
Obviously, it will also be useful to look atinflation forecasts derived using all thesevariables when assessing whether the
monetary policy stance is appropriate. In thisregard, the Eurosystem will evaluate the fullrange of inflation forecasts produced by
international organisations, other authorities,market participants, etc., and will alsoproduce its own internal assessment of the
future inflation outlook.The Eurosystem™s stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy guides the GoverningCouncil™s monetary policy decisions in StageThree of EMU. This strategy will ensure that
price stability over the medium term ismaintained in a credible and lasting mannerthroughout the euro area. This is the best
contribution that the single monetary policycan make to raising the living standards ofEurope™s citizens.The conduct of monetary policy in the firstfew weeks of Stage ThreeAs from the start of Stage Three, theEurosystem conducts open marketoperations, offers standing facilities andrequires credit institutions to hold minimum
reserves on accounts with the NCBs in orderto achieve its monetary policy objective (seeChapter II, Section 1, for a discussion of the
completion of the monetary policy frameworkduring 1998). Among the open marketoperations, the ﬁmain refinancing operationﬂ,
i.e. a weekly tender with a two-weekmaturity, is the main vehicle for steeringshort-term market interest rates, providing
liquidity to the banking system and signallingthe monetary policy stance. In addition, theEurosystem conducts monthly ﬁlonger-term
refinancing operationsﬂ with a maturity ofthree months, which are normally notintended to send policy signals to the market.
The Eurosystem offers two standing facilities:the marginal lending facility and the depositfacility, which aim, respectively, at providingECB Annual Report Ł 199852and absorbing overnight liquidity to creditinstitutions. The interest rates on the twostanding facilities provide a general signal
regarding monetary policy intentions over themedium term and constitute a corridor forthe overnight market interest rate. Finally,
the Eurosystem™s minimum reserve systemfulfils the functions of enhancing the demandfor central bank money as well as smoothing
interest rate developments over the shortterm.On 22 December 1998 the GoverningCouncil announced the first interest ratesfor the monetary policy operations of the
Eurosystem. The interest rate applicable tothe first main refinancing operation, offeredin the form of a fixed rate tender for
settlement on 7 January 1999, was set at alevel of 3.0%. In addition, the interest ratefor the marginal lending facility was set at a
level of 4.5% and the interest rate for thedeposit facility at a level of 2.0% at the startof Stage Three (i.e. 1 January 1999). However,
as a transitional measure, between 4 and21€January 1999 the interest rate for themarginal lending facility was set at a level of
3.25% and the interest rate for the depositfacility at a level of 2.75% (see Chart 13). TheChart 13ECB interest rates and the overnight market interest rate(percentages per annum; daily data)Source: ECB.1815222951219265

3.54.04.55.0marginal lending ratedeposit ratemain refinancing rateovernight interest rate (EONIA)latter measure was mainly of a technicalnature, aimed at helping credit institutions toadapt to the functioning of the integrated
euro area money market.The decision on the level of the interest rateon the main refinancing operations took intoconsideration the co-ordinated reduction ofkey central bank interest rates in the euro
area of 3€December 1998. As explained bythe ECB on 3 December, the joint reductionhad to be seen as a de facto decision on the
level of interest rates with which theEurosystem would start Stage Three and wasintended to be maintained for the foreseeable
future. Indeed, at its subsequent meetings, oneach occasion having taken into considerationthe latest available monetary, financial and
other economic data against the backgroundof its stability-oriented monetary policystrategy, the Governing Council confirmed
that forthcoming main refinancing operationswould be conducted at a fixed rate of 3.0%.These decisions were backed by the fact thatdevelopments in the broad monetaryaggregate M3 were not signalling significant
risks for price stability. At an annual growthrate of around 4.5%, the evolution of M353ECB Annual Report Ł 1998towards the end of 1998 was relativelysmooth. The three-month moving average ofthe 12-month growth rate of M3, covering
the months from October to December 1998,stood at 4.6%, which was very close to theEurosystem™s reference rate. From a longer-
term perspective, data available showed thatM3 grew at an annual rate of between 3.5%and 5% during 1997 and 1998 (see Chart 14).
This development was broadly compatiblewith price stability and sustainable economicgrowth in the euro area. A relatively high
growth rate of M1 was, however, observedduring 1998 mainly as a result of thepronounced fall in interest rates and inflation
expectations in several euro area countries.In addition, this development was probablyinfluenced by the role of overnight deposits
as a buffer stock in situations of portfolioreallocation, as investors in the euro areamay have preferred to adopt a cautious
approach in view of the remaininguncertainties related to the changeover tothe euro. The relatively fast pace of lending
to the private sector, equal to 8.2% inDecember 1998, indicated that episodes ofcredit crunch were not detectable in the euro
area during 1998. The monetary data forJanuary 1999 which were released in early
March 1999 showed a substantial furtherincrease in overnight deposits. While thisput some upward pressure on monetary
aggregates, the three-month moving averageof the 12-month growth rate of M3 in theperiod from November 1998 to January 1999
remained close to the reference value of4½%. Against this background, and in view ofthe uncertainty relating to the special factors
associated with the move to Stage Three andthe introduction of the euro, the accelerationof M3 was not considered to be a signal of
future inflationary pressures.With regard to the outlook for pricedevelopments and risks to price stability,various other indicators confirmed theassessment made on the basis of
developments in monetary data. The fall inlong-term nominal interest rates following theco-ordinated reduction of central bank rates
on 3 December 1998 and the downward shiftof the yield curve were seen as a sign thatChart 14Monetary aggregates in the euro area(annual percentage changes)Source: ECB.Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4

area was very much influenced by theuncertainties surrounding the evolution of theworld economy in 1999. The overall picture
was, however, somewhat mixed. Severalindicators, in particular the fall in industrialconfidence, pointed in the direction of a
slowdown in economic activity. By contrast,other indicators, such as consumerconfidence and retail sales, indicated that
domestic demand was still strong.The level of 3.0% for the main refinancingrate at the start of Stage Three resulted in athree-month money market rate at a level ofaround 3.1% in early 1999. This level is very
low by historical standards. Even in thosecountries with the best track records in termsof price stability over the past few decades,
rates have hardly ever been lower than this.In Germany, for example, the average nominalshort-term interest rate, measured by the
three-month interbank rate, over the pastfour decades was 6%, with rates of below 3%not having been observed since February
1962. In real terms, i.e. considering the levelof the short-term interest rates deflated byHICP inflation, the levels reached were also
very low, standing at approximately 2.3% inearly March 1999. By comparison, the euroarea level of real three-month interest rates
was equal to an average of 4.5% during the1990s and the German average over thisperiod was 3.2%.The transitional measure to narrow thecorridor between the rates of the deposit
facility and the marginal lending facilitybetween 4 and 21 January 1999 contributedto the smooth start of the euro area
integrated money market at a time whenmarket participants were faced with thechallenge of having to adapt to the new
environment. The developments during thefirst few weeks of operation of the euromoney market indicated that the integration
of the national money markets of the euroarea countries was proceeding rapidly. Anessential element in the integration processwas the TARGET system, which allows cross-
border payments to be processed safely andin real time. As a consequence, cross-countrydispersion of overnight rates was relatively
small as of the first days of Stage Three,indicating that market participants madeefficient use of arbitrage opportunities across
markets. In view of the satisfactoryexperience of the first few weeks and takinginto account that continuing to maintain the
narrow corridor for too long would havebeen likely to hamper the development ofthe euro area money market in the longer
term, the Governing Council discontinued theapplication of the narrow corridor with effectfrom 22€January 1999. After the widening of
the band defined by the two standing facilities,the spread between overnight rates onnational markets remained stable and the
recourse to the standing facilities contractedsharply.The Eurosystem™s refinancing operations duringthe first weeks of 1999 contributed tosmoothing the developments in the money
market. The allotments effectuated through themain refinancing operations in the first weeksof Stage Three provided an endowment of
liquidity exceeding the expected reserverequirements. This was seen as a means ofcoping with the relatively high degree of initial
uncertainty about the true reserve requirementsof credit institutions in the first maintenanceperiod. Indeed, the reserve requirement for the
first maintenance period had to be based onbanks™ balance sheet data for 1 January 1999.These data, however, became known to the
Eurosystem only in late January 1999. While theattitude of market participants in the first fewdays of 1999 was very cautious, resulting in an
overnight rate which was only slightly belowthe temporary marginal lending rate of 3.25%,increasing certainty about liquidity needs at
the start of Stage Three and an easing ofmarket conditions allowed the overnight rateto come closer to the Eurosystem™s main
refinancing rate.55ECB Annual Report Ł 19983Economic developments in non-euro area EU countries
In this section, economic developments inthe four non-euro area EU countries arereviewed on a country-by-country basis. Itmay, in general, be noted that while these
countries conduct their monetary policiesunder different institutional and operationalframeworks, the ultimate goal of monetary
policy in all of them is to maintain pricestability. The Eurosystem and the nationalcentral banks (NCBs) of the non-participating
EU countries co-operate closely in thecontext of the General Council with a viewto contributing to the maintenance of price
stability in the EU as a whole. In this context,the review of macroeconomic conditions aswell as monetary and exchange rate policies
is an integral part of the co-ordinationexercise between the Eurosystem and thefour NCBs not participating in the single
monetary policy.3.1Denmark
In Denmark real GDP increased by 2.8% in
1998, somewhat below the growth rates ofabove 3% achieved from the middle of 1993until 1997. As in recent years, output growth
was supported by strong private consumptionand investment, while the contribution togrowth from net exports was negative.
Compared with most euro area countries,Denmark occupies a relatively advancedposition in the business cycle. During 1998
the Danish economy operated close to fullcapacity utilisation and under tight labourmarket conditions; the unemployment rate
was 4.6% in December, the lowest rate inalmost 20 years. Despite government actionto stimulate labour supply, real wage
increases in 1998 were above productivitygrowth. Combined with a strengthening ofthe nominal effective exchange rate, this led
to a loss of competitiveness. The currentaccount deteriorated and moved into deficitin 1998 for the first time in the 1990s.Tight capacity and high rates of wageincreases have so far had only little impact onconsumer prices. HICP inflation was quite
close to the euro area average in 1998,following a downward trend in the course ofthe year, and stabilised at 1.1% in the last
quarter. The modest rate of inflation isassociated with the compression of profitmargins, lower energy prices and a weak
development in prices of transport and somemeat products.The current wage acceleration and thepressures coming from the strong expansionof domestic demand pose a challenge to the
maintenance of price stability. To counteractthese pressures fiscal policy has beenfollowing a restrictive stance. After the
substantial fiscal consolidation in the 1993-97period (when the budget balance moved froma deficit of 2.8% of GDP to a surplus of 0.4%
of GDP) a new fiscal austerity package, whichlowered tax deductions for interest paymentsand increased indirect taxes, was introduced
in June 1998. In 1998 the budget surplus roseto 0.8% of GDP as a result of a strong declinein the total expenditure-to-GDP ratio which
was only partially offset by a decline in thecurrent revenue-to-GDP ratio. The ratio ofgovernment debt to GDP declined by
5.5€percentage points to 58.1%.The monetary policy strategy of DanmarksNationalbank has remained unchangedfollowing the introduction of the euro. Danishmonetary policy is geared to stabilising the
Danish krone vis-à-vis the euro as Denmarkhas been participating in the ERM IIarrangement from 1 January 1999 with a
narrow band of ±2¼% around the eurocentral rate.Throughout 1998 the Danish krone remainedclose to the central parity in the ERM.Nevertheless, there were occasions in 1998
when the currency came under pressure andDanmarks Nationalbank changed its interestrates and intervened to keep the currency
stable. As a consequence, the three-monthinterest rate spread vis-à-vis the comparableGerman rate was relatively volatile duringECB Annual Report Ł 1998561998, with high spreads during periods ofinternational currency unrest (225 basispoints at the height of the global tensions atend-September). The spread was around
90 basis points at the end of the year, butdeclined in the first two months of 1999 to alevel of around 40 basis points. Considering
the year as a whole, short-term interest ratesas measured by the three-month moneymarket rates rose by 20 basis points. The
official (repo) rate was lowered in varioussteps in the last quarter of 1998 and in early1999 and stood at 3.4% at the beginning of
March 1999.Long-term interest rates as measured by10-year government bond yields followed theinternational decline in levels during 1998,but less markedly than the German 10-year
rate. As a consequence, the spread widenedslightly to 30 basis points at the end ofFebruary 1999.19921993199419951996199719981998199819981998

3.2Greece
In the recent past Greece has experienced aperiod of buoyant economic growth. The rate
of growth of GDP was 3.2% in 1997 andincreased to 3.7% in 1998. There was amarked strengthening in industrial production
and construction in 1998. A strong expansionof investment (both public investment, linkedto structural funds from the EU, and private
investment) and rising exports were thetwo main factors underlying this growthperformance. Consumption demand has
decelerated owing to wage moderationcombined with a slightly increasing tax burdenand the negative terms-of-trade effect of the
drachma™s devaluation in early 1998. Theregistered unemployment rate remains high,at 9.9% on average in 1998. The trade deficit
(partly distorted by unrecorded exports) isestimated to have remained broadly at thesame high level as that recorded in 199757ECB Annual Report Ł 1998(at around 15% of GDP), as the positive effectof lower energy import prices has beencompensated by the negative terms-of-tradeeffect of the devaluation of the drachma.
However, the current account deficit isestimated to have declined from 4% of GDPin 1997 to 3.4% of GDP in 1998.Despite robust growth, the HICP inflationrate continued its downward trend in 1998.
While initially inflation increased€Œ to peak at5.1% in April 1998, mainly as a consequenceof the devaluation of the drachma upon entry
to the ERM in March€Œ thereafter it resumedits downward course, declining almostcontinuously to reach 3.5% in January 1999.
The main factor contributing to disinflationhas been the deceleration of unit labour costs,underpinned by wage moderation (helped by
declining inflationary expectations and bydisinflationary pay settlements in both theprivate and the public sectors) and sustainedproductivity growth. The inflationary impact
of the devaluation was compensated to someextent by the decline in the price of seasonalfood and the international price of oil.
Underlying inflation, as measured by the HICPstripped of seasonal food and energy prices,while on a declining trend, was still running
at 4.4% in January 1999.A sizable fiscal consolidation took place inGreece between 1993 and 1997 as the budgetdeficit fell from 13.8% of GDP to 3.9% ofGDP. In 1998 the budget deficit fell further
to 2.4% as a result of both a decreasing totalexpenditure-to-GDP ratio and an increasingcurrent revenue-to-GDP ratio. The stock of
government debt declined by almost3€percentage points to 106.5% of GDP in1998.Monetary policy is conducted with a view toattaining nominal convergence with the euro19921993199419951996199719981998199819981998

ECB Annual Report Ł 199858area. According to the new legislationestablishing the independence of the Bank ofGreece (which came into effect in December
1997), the maintenance of price stability hasbeen confirmed as the ultimate goal ofmonetary policy. The Bank of Greece aims to
reduce inflation to below 2% by the end of1999. The Greek drachma joined the ERM on16 March 1998 and has been participating in
ERM II since 1 January 1999, observing a ±15%fluctuation band around the euro central rate.Since entering the ERM the exchange ratehas played the role of an intermediate target.In the first few months of 1998 the drachma
came under pressure owing to contagionfrom the Asian crisis. The drachma enteredthe ERM with a central parity against the
ECU that represented a devaluation of 12.3%from prevailing market rates. Thereafter, thedrachma has consistently been in the upper
part of the ERM parity grid. It ended the year8.2% above its central parity and traded atclose to 9% above its central parity on
average in February 1999. Upon ERM entry,short-term interest rates immediatelydeclined and have been on a downward trend
since then, with the exception of the secondhalf of August when they peaked again due tothe impact of the Russian crisis on financial
markets. By the end of the year the spreadvis-à-vis the comparable German rates was8.7 percentage points, but had narrowed by
some 150 basis points by the end of February1999. The fixed tender rate for 14-daydeposits stood at 12% at the end of February
1999.Long-term interest rates followed adownward trend with fluctuations in thecourse of 1998, and the differential vis-à-visGerman yields came down to around 320
basis points by the end of 1998 and was 210basis points on average in February 1999.3.3Sweden
Swedish real GDP grew by 2.9% in 1998,
accelerating from 1.8% in 1997. The drivingforce was a rapid acceleration in domesticdemand, while, after a number of years ofexport-led growth, the contribution togrowth from external trade turned negative.
Private consumption grew by 2.6%, whilegross capital formation increased by 9.6%.Real import growth has been strong,
reflecting strong domestic demand andsubdued import prices, while export demanddecelerated significantly in 1998 compared
with 1997, mainly because of the Asian crisis.As a result, the current account surplusdiminished somewhat in 1998, to 2.4% of
GDP. As in most euro area countries, therewas some weakening of business sentiment inthe second half of the year, especially in the
manufacturing sector, but the level ofconsumer confidence remained historicallyhigh. Since the autumn of 1997 a marked fall
in unemployment has been recorded (to 7.5%at the end of the year), mainly due togovernment educational measures but also
reflecting strong economic growth.Consumer prices were not affected by theacceleration in output in 1998. The HICPrate of inflation decreased more or lesscontinuously in 1998 to 0% in December (and
was maintained at the same level in January1999). The downward movement is mainlyexplained by falling prices for imported goods,
moderate unit labour cost developments andsizable cuts in indirect taxes.A substantial fiscal consolidation took placein Sweden between 1993 and 1997 as thebudget deficit declined from 12.3% of GDP
to 0.7% of GDP. In 1998 the budget balancerecorded a surplus of 2% of GDP as a resultof both a significant increase in the current
revenue-to-GDP ratio and a decrease in theexpenditure-to-GDP ratio. The governmentdebt-to-GDP ratio declined by 1.6 percentage
points to 75.1%.On 25 November 1998 the SwedishParliament approved new legislationreinforcing the independence of the centralbank. The primary objective of monetary
policy in Sweden is to achieve price stability.Sveriges Riksbank operates with a flexibleexchange rate regime and conducts monetary59ECB Annual Report Ł 199819921993199419951996199719981998199819981998

policy for an explicit inflation target. Theinflation target is to achieve a CPI inflationrate of 2%, with a tolerance margin of±1 percentage point. Historically, inflation
measured by the CPI index did not differ inSweden, on average, from inflation measuredby the HICP index. The actual rate of
inflation, measured as the 12-month changein the CPI, fell during 1998 to reach -0.6% inDecember, standing at 0.4% on average for
the year as a whole, and was thus well belowthe target.Short-term interest rates have been on adeclining trend, reflecting a five-stage cut inthe official (repo) rate of 120 basis points to
3.15% in February 1999. The Swedish kronastarted to depreciate over the summer in thewake of international market unrest, and at
the end of 1998 had depreciated byapproximately 8% vis-à-vis the ECU,compared with a year earlier. In the first twomonths of 1999 it appreciated by around 5.5%
vis-à-vis the euro.Long-term interest rates fell by1.8 percentage points in the course of 1998to 4.2% on average in December. Theinterest rate differential vis-à-vis Germany
amounted to around 40€basis points at theend of 1998, and to 30 basis points on averagein February 1999.3.4United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth
slowed to 2.3% in 1998 from 3.5% in 1997.
The slowdown in output in the course of theyear was due to a marked deterioration innet exports and a slight weakening of
domestic demand. Business confidenceindicators deteriorated throughout the year,with a particularly marked decline in theECB Annual Report Ł 199860autumn. The slowdown was initially mostevident in the manufacturing sector, reflectingthe strength of sterling and the decelerationin world trade due to the Asian crisis.
However, the services sector, which hadremained comparatively robust (reflecting thestrength of domestic demand), also began to
show clear signs of a slowdown in the latterhalf of 1998. Unemployment, at 6.2% inNovember 1998, was at its lowest level since
1980. The current account deterioratedsignificantly in the first half of 1998, reflectingthe appreciation of sterling, but this was
partly offset by a large surplus recorded inthe third quarter.HICP inflation fell slightly during 1998,stabilising at 1.4% in the last two quarters ofthe year. However, reflecting the pressure

stronger. The inflation rate for the servicessector was significantly higher (by about3.5 percentage points on average) than thegoods inflation rate. Goods price increases
were held down by the steep declines inimport prices following the rise in sterling in1997 and early 1998.A sizable fiscal consolidation took placebetween 1993 and 1997 as the budget deficit
declined from 7.9% of GDP to 1.9% of GDP.In 1998 there was a further improvement inthe public finances and the budget balance
recorded a surplus of 0.6% of GDP. This wasmainly due to an increase in the currentrevenue-to-GDP ratio and, to a lesser extent,
to reductions in the public expenditure-to-GDP ratio for all main categories of spending.The government gross debt-to-GDP ratio
declined by 2.7€percentage points to 49.4% in1998.61ECB Annual Report Ł 1998The monetary policy objective of the Bank ofEngland is to achieve an inflation target whichis defined in terms of the Retail Price Index
excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX),of 2.5% per annum. Historically, inflation asmeasured by the RPIX index has been, on
average, around half a percentage point higherthan when measured by the HICP index. RPIXinflation remained close to the target in 1998.
Official interest rates began the year at 7.25%,were increased to 7.5% in June, remainedconstant during the third quarter, and
have been cut five times since then, tostand at 5.5% in February 1999, againstthe background of deteriorating growthprospects and an easing of inflationarypressures. Following a very substantial rise of15% in 1997, sterling appreciated further
against the ECU during the first half of 1998,but depreciated in the second half of theyear. In early 1999 it appreciated somewhat
against the euro.Long-term interest rates fell steadilythroughout 1998 in absolute terms andrelative to comparable rates in major euroarea economies. The 10-year spread vis-à-vis
German yields was around 50 basis points onaverage in February 1999, compared witharound 100 basis points at the start of 1998.Box 4Procedures for the decision on the fulfilment of the necessary conditions for theadoption of the euro by non-euro area Member States in Stage ThreeIn March 1998 the EMI submitted a report to the EU Council ﬁon the progress made in the fulfilment by theMember States of their obligations regarding the achievement of Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ. This reportwas produced in accordance with the requirement of Article€109j€(1) of the Treaty establishing the European
Community. The same mandate was given to the European Commission, and the two reports were submittedto the EU Council in parallel, forming a starting-point for the procedure in accordance with Article€109j€(2)and (4) which led to the selection of 11 Member States to participate in Economic and Monetary Union from
the start of Stage Three.Denmark, in accordance with the terms of Protocol No. 12 of the Treaty, gave notification that it would notparticipate in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. The United Kingdom, in accordance with theterms of Protocol No. 11, also notified the EU Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage in 1999.As a result, neither Member State has adopted the euro. Greece and Sweden are both Member States with a
derogation, having been judged by the Council not to have fulfilled the necessary conditions for the adoptionof the single currency on 1€January 1999. The Greek Government has announced its aim to join the euro areaby 2001.Article 109j€(1) of the Treaty establishes the criteria to be used for an examination of the fulfilment by the non-euro area Member States of their obligations regarding their participation in Economic and Monetary Union.
In particular, with regard to economic convergence, the reports of the ECB and the European Commissionshall examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the following fourcriteria:
-the achievement of a high degree of price stability;
-the sustainability of the government financial position;
-the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism;

-the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State and of its participation in the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System being reflected in the long-term interest rate levels.In addition, with regard to legal convergence, these reports shall include an examination of the compatibilitybetween each Member State™s national legislation, including the statutes of its national central bank, andArticles€107 and 108 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.ECB Annual Report Ł 199862In terms of the procedure to be followed for the decision on the fulfilment of the necessary conditions for theadoption of the euro, according to Article€109k€(2): ﬁAt least once every two years, or at the request of a
Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance withthe procedure laid down in Article€109j€(1). After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion inthe Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, the Council shall, acting by a
qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide which Member States with a derogation fulfilthe necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria set out in Article€109j€(1), and abrogate the derogations ofthe Member States concerned.ﬂWith regard to Denmark and the United Kingdom, Protocols No. 12 and No. 11 of the Treaty respectivelyprescribe that the procedure mentioned above can only be initiated at their own request.If, following the above examination and procedures, the status of ﬁMember States with a derogationﬂ isabrogated, Article€109l (5) of the Treaty provides for the fixing of the conversion rate at which the euro shall
be substituted for the currency of the Member State concerned, and for the adoption of all other measuresnecessary for the rapid introduction of the euro in those Member States.Chapter IIPreparatory workfor Stage Three andthe changeover to the euroECB Annual Report Ł 1998661Monetary policy framework
In the first half of 1998 work continued atthe EMI to complete the Eurosystem™soperational framework for theimplementation of monetary policy. Following
the publication by the EMI, in September1997, of the report entitled ﬁThe singlemonetary policy in Stage Three: General
documentation on ESCB monetary policyinstruments and proceduresﬂ, the ECBendorsed the content of that report in the
summer of 1998 and developed it further, inclose co-operation with the NCBs, byspecifying additional provisions in a number
of areas. As a result, in September 1998 theECB published a new version of the reportwith the same title (the ﬁGeneral
documentationﬂ).The monetary policy framework of theEurosystem comprises a minimum reservesystem, open market operations and standingfacilities as described below. In accordance with
Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, theGoverning Council of the ECB is responsiblefor the formulation of monetary policy, while
the Executive Board is empowered toimplement monetary policy according to thedecisions and guidelines laid down by the
Governing Council. To the extent deemedpossible and appropriate, and with a view toensuring operational efficiency, the ECB has
recourse to the NCBs to carry out theoperations which form part of the tasks of theESCB. The Eurosystem™s monetary policy
operations are executed on equal terms andconditions in all participating Member States.The most relevant new features of the versionof the ﬁGeneral documentationﬂ published bythe ECB in September 1998, as compared with
the earlier version published by the EMI, are thedetails of the eligibility criteria and risk controlmeasures to be applied to assets eligible for the
monetary policy operations of the Eurosystem,the specification of procedures to be appliedfor cross-border transactions in the context of
the correspondent central banking model(CCBM), the establishment of the conditionsfor access to the deposit facility, the definitionof the features of the minimum reserve system
and the definition of the calendar of tenderoperations for 1999. Finally, the ﬁGeneraldocumentationﬂ presented specific provisions
to be applied to the monetary policyinstruments and procedures during thetransition to Stage Three.1.1The minimum reserve system
On 7 July 1998 the Governing Council of the
ECB decided that the ECB would require
credit institutions established in euro areaMember States to hold minimum reserves asfrom the start of Stage Three.The minimum reserve system applied by theECB is primarily intended to fulfil the
following two monetary policy functions: thestabilisation of money market interest rates(ﬁstabilisation functionﬂ) and the enlargement
of a structural liquidity shortage within thebanking system (ﬁenlargement functionﬂ). Asregards the stabilisation function, the
introduction of an averaging provision(implying that reserve requirements have tobe fulfilled on average over a monthly
maintenance period and not on a daily basis)enhances the flexibility of the creditinstitutions™ day-to-day liquidity management,
allowing them to exploit short-term arbitrageopportunities in the money market. In thisway, the averaging provision can be expected
to contribute to a stabilisation of theovernight interest rate over the course ofthe maintenance period. This, in turn, reduces
the need for central bank fine-tuningintervention in the market and thus allowsthe Eurosystem to extract valuable
information from market developments. Withregard to the enlargement function, asufficiently large structural liquidity shortage
within the banking system enhances the abilityof the Eurosystem to operate efficiently as asupplier of liquidity.The minimum reserve system applied by theECB can be characterised by the following67ECB Annual Report Ł 1998main elements. First, the reserve requirementapplies to all credit institutions (as defined inArticle€1 of the First Banking Co-ordination
Directive) which are established in the euroarea. Second, the reserve requirement of eachindividual credit institution is calculated by
applying a reserve ratio, which has been setat 2%, to its liabilities in the form of overnightdeposits, deposits with an agreed maturity or
period of notice of up to two years, debtsecurities issued with an agreed maturity ofup to two years and money market paper.
However, liabilities vis-à-vis institutionsestablished in the euro area and liabilities vis-à-vis the Eurosystem are not subject to
reserve requirements. If a credit institutioncannot provide evidence of its liabilities inthe form of debt securities with an agreed
maturity of up to two years and moneymarket paper vis-à-vis other institutionssubject to minimum reserve requirements,
this institution is allowed to apply astandardised deduction, which was set at10% at the start of Stage Three, to the
aforementioned liabilities. In order todetermine the final reserve requirement, eachcredit institution is allowed to deduct a lump-
sum allowance of E100,000 from the resultingamount. Third, a credit institution complies
with its obligations under the minimum
reserve system if its average daily reserveholdings, as computed over a reservemaintenance period running from the 24th
day of each month to the 23rd day of thefollowing month,1 is at least equal to itsreserve requirement. Fourth, the requiredreserve holdings are remunerated at a levelcorresponding to the average interest rateover the maintenance period of the main
refinancing operations of the Eurosystem(i.e.€broadly in line with market conditions).Finally, a credit institution may apply to the
NCB of the Member State in which it isresident for permission to hold all itsminimum reserves indirectly, through an
intermediary.On 1 December 1998 the GoverningCouncil adopted the ECB Regulation onthe application of minimum reserves(ECB/1998/15). This Regulation lays down ina legally binding form the features of theminimum reserve system applied by the ECB.The legal basis for this ECB Regulation is set
out in Article€19 of the Statute of theESCB and in the Council Regulation (EC)No. 2531/98 concerning the application of
minimum reserves by the European CentralBank, which was adopted by the ECOFINCouncil on 23 November 1998.1.2Open market operations and
standing facilitiesOpen market operations are the main
instrument used by the Eurosystem for thepurposes of steering interest rates, managingthe liquidity situation in the market and
signalling the monetary policy stance. Themajority of the Eurosystem™s open marketoperations consist of reverse transactions
against eligible collateral. The two main kindsof open market operation are the mainrefinancing operations (MROs), which have a
maturity of two weeks and are conducted ona weekly basis, and the longer-termrefinancing operations (LTROs), which have
a maturity of three months and take place ona monthly basis. In addition, the Eurosystemmay conduct fine-tuning open market
operations through reverse transactions,outright purchases and sales of assets, thecollection of deposits, or foreign exchange
swaps. While the MRO and LTRO areconducted through standard tenders, fine-tuning operations can be performed either
through quick tenders or through bilateralprocedures involving a limited set ofcounterparties, except for outright
operations which can be carried out onlythrough bilateral transactions. Other availableopen market operations include structural
operations which have a longer time horizonand a maturity which may or may not bestandardised. They may include reverse
transactions, outright purchases or sales ofassets, or the issuance of ECB debt1As a transitional provision, the first maintenance period of Stage
Three started on 1 January 1999 and ended on 23 February1999.ECB Annual Report Ł 199868certificates. However, the ECB decided that,given the structural liquidity deficit prevailingin the euro area at the start of Stage Three,
it would not issue debt certificates from thestart of Stage Three.With regard to the two standing facilities,counterparties can use the marginal lendingfacility to obtain overnight liquidity against
eligible assets and the deposit facility to makeovernight deposits with the Eurosystem. Thetwo standing facilities are available to eligible
counterparties at their own initiative andwithout any restrictions. Under normalcircumstances the interest rates on the
standing facilities form a corridor for theovernight market interest rate, with themarginal lending rate providing the ceiling and
the deposit rate the floor.1.3Eligible counterparties and
assetsThe Eurosystem accepts a wide range ofunderlying assets for its credit operations. Adistinction is made between two categories of
eligible assets: tier one and tier two. Tier oneconsists of marketable debt instruments whichfulfil the uniform, area-wide eligibility criteria
established by the ECB, while tier two comprisesother marketable and non-marketable debtinstruments, equities and non-marketable
financial assets, which take into account thedifferences between the national financial andbanking systems, and for which eligibility criteria
have been established by the NCBs, subject tothe minimum eligibility criteria defined by theECB. However, no distinction is made between
the two tiers with regard to their eligibility forthe various types of monetary policy operationof the Eurosystem (except for the fact that tier
two assets are not normally used by theEurosystem in outright transactions).The list of eligible assets for the Eurosystem™scredit operations was made available on theInternet in October 1998. The amount of
marketable eligible assets outstanding at thestart of Stage Three was slightly above E5,000billion. Most of these outstanding assets(98%) consisted of tier one collateral.
Approximately 75% were governmentsecurities, 18% securities issued by credit
institutions, 4% securities issued by thecorporate sector, and the remaindersecurities issued by NCBs. Appropriate risk
control measures are applied to protect theEurosystem against the risk of financial loss.Risk control measures for tier one assets are
harmonised across the euro area and includethe following elements: initial margins, whichtake into account the length of time during
which the Eurosystem is exposed to creditrisk; specific valuation haircuts, which aredifferentiated according to the residual
maturity and coupon structure of the debtinstrument; and symmetric margin calls, whichaim to ensure that the value of the underlying
assets matches the requirements. The riskcontrol measures for tier two assets aredefined by the NCB that has included the
asset in its tier two list, subject to theapproval of the ECB. They are at least asstringent as the risk control measures applied
to tier one assets.A list of counterparties eligible for themonetary policy operations of theEurosystem has been established on the basisof common eligibility criteria. It includes all
those institutions that are subject to minimumreserve requirements. These institutions are,in principle, eligible to access open market
operations based on the standard tenderprocedures and the two standing facilities. Inaddition, eligible counterparties to the
Eurosystem™s monetary policy operationshave to satisfy certain prudential andoperational requirements, i.e.€they must be
financially sound, subject to prudentialsupervision, and satisfy the operationalcriteria for participation in monetary policy
operations. The list of institutions subject tominimum reserve requirements, which coversall credit institutions established in the euro
area, comprises more than 8,000 institutions.This list was made available on the Internetin October 1998. More than 4,000 of these
credit institutions have access to the twostanding facilities of the Eurosystem, whilealmost 3,000 have access to the refinancing69ECB Annual Report Ł 1998operations. At the start of Stage Three nocredit institution was exempt from theminimum reserve requirements.1.4Preparatory work for the
implementation of monetarypolicy instrumentsGiven the decentralised approach adoptedfor the implementation of the monetarypolicy of the Eurosystem, the bulk of the
implementation work in this field, includingthe testing of the systems and the preparationof the relevant legal documentation, was
conducted by the NCBs. The work wasinitially co-ordinated by the EMI and itsrelevant Sub-Committees and subsequently
co-ordinated and supervised by the ECB.The testing process for all proceduresincluded preliminary testing of individualsystems and, thereafter, a period of overalltesting of the systems and procedures of the
Eurosystem. The latter started at thebeginning of July 1998. Its aim was, inparticular, to test the interconnections
between the multiplicity of systems andprocedures that were considered critical tothe performance of the Eurosystem™s
operations. The overall testing consisted ofthree phases, the first of which involvedtesting the normal systems and procedures
for specific Eurosystem activities withinindividual business areas, including monetarypolicy, foreign exchange policy, payment
systems, the back office and accounting. Thesecond phase, which started in September1998, focused on the testing of contingency
procedures, while the third phase, whichstarted in October, represented a generalﬁdress rehearsalﬂ for all Eurosystem
processes critical to the conduct of monetarypolicy. The three phases were carried outunder the management of the Steering
Committee for the Overall Testing (SCOT).The whole process made considerabledemands on staff resources, both at the NCBs
and at the EMI/ECB, and was completedsuccessfully.The preparation of the relevant national legal
documentation was finalised by the NCBsunder the ECB™s supervision, which was, in
essence, aimed at ensuring that a level playing-field in this regard would be in placethroughout the euro area.As regards liquidity management procedures,preparatory work was finalised in the course
of 1998, including all procedures needed forinternal Eurosystem communication and forthe consolidation of the NCBs™ balance sheets
in order to produce the Eurosystem™s balancesheet and update the relevant forecasts on adaily basis. To guide credit institutions in their
reserve management, the Governing Councilalso decided that accurate informationregarding the liquidity conditions in the euro
area Œ including the aggregate current accountholdings of euro area credit institutions, theaggregate use of the standing facilities on the
preceding Eurosystem business day and theaggregate minimum reserve requirement forthe current maintenance period of euro area
credit institutions Œ would be published by9.30€a.m. on every Eurosystem business day.1.5Domestic asset and liability
managementWhile monetary policy decisions are takencentrally, the management of domestic assets
and liabilities is effected by the NCBs ontheir own responsibility, irrespective ofwhether they act on their own account, as
fiscal agents, on behalf of their customers orfor their staff. Such management may includetransactions with securities, deposit taking,
the transfer of profits to the respectivegovernment or administrative expenditures.To ensure that operations in domestic assets
and liabilities do not undermine the singlemonetary policy by creating unwarrantedliquidity and signalling effects, any financial
operations in domestic assets and liabilitiesby the NCBs which are not carried out formonetary policy purposes are subject to
internal ECB rules.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998702Foreign exchange rate policy framework
2.1The euro conversion rates
In accordance with the decision taken by theEuropean Council at its meeting in
Luxembourg in December 1997, on 3 May1998, following the decision adopted by theCouncil of the European Union (EU Council),
meeting in the composition of the Heads ofState or Government, on the Member Stateswhich would participate in the euro area from
the start of Stage Three, a Joint Communiquéon the procedure to be used to determinethe irrevocable conversion rates for the euro
at the end of Stage Two was issued by theministers and central bank governors of thoseEU Member States which would participate
in the euro area, the European Commissionand the EMI, as the forerunner of the ECB.The form of the pre-announcement€Œ a jointpolitical declaration endorsed by all theauthorities involved€Œ was chosen owing to the
Treaty requirement that the formal adoption ofBox 5The procedure followed for the computation and adoption of the irrevocable euroconversion ratesJoint Information Notice by the European Commission and the European Central Bank on the detailedcomputation of the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro issued on 11 March 1999The irrevocable conversion rates for the euro were adopted by the EU Council on a proposal from theCommission and after consultation of the European Central Bank (ECB) on 31 December 1998 and enteredinto force together with the substitution of the euro for the national currencies on 1 January 1999. The
ministers of the Member States adopting the euro as their single currency, the governors of the central banks ofthese Member States, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute/European Central Bankissued two joint communiqués on the determination and the adoption of the irrevocable conversion rates for
the euro, dated 3 May and 26 September 1998 respectively. The European Commission and the EuropeanCentral Bank hereby provide the details of the computation of these conversion rates.Calculation of the exchange rates of the official ECU on 31 December 1998
On 31 December 1998 the final official ECU exchange rates were calculated and adopted by the EU Councilas the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro on the first day of Stage Three, i.e. on 1 January 1999. This wasdone by using the regular daily concertation procedure, which continues to be used in Stage Three for quoting
the euro reference exchange rates.Three steps can be identifiedStep 1: Determination of the EU currencies™ concertation exchange rates against the US€dollarA teleconference was initiated at 11.00 a.m. (C.E.T.), in which the EU central banks, including those whosecurrencies were not components of the ECU basket, provided each other with the US dollar exchange rate forthe irrevocable conversion rates for the euroshould take place on 1€January 1999. In addition,since the ECU should be converted into theeuro at a 1:1 rate, and since some of the ECU
component currencies (the Danish krone, theGreek drachma and the pound sterling) wouldnot participate in the euro area from the outset,
it was not possible to announce the irrevocableeuro conversion rates for the participatingcurrencies. Hence the decision was taken to
pre-announce the bilateral rates (equal to theERM central rates) of the currenciesparticipating in the euro area that would be
used on 31€December 1998 to determine theirrevocable euro exchange rates.On 31 December 1998 the irrevocable euroexchange rates were established in thecontext of the regular daily concertation
procedure, as had been clarified in the pre-announcement (see Box 5 for a descriptionof the process followed for the adoption of
the euro conversion rates).71ECB Annual Report Ł 1998their respective currencies. These exchange rates were recorded as discrete values lying within the market bid-ask spreads prevailing at the time of the teleconference. The central banks of the Member States adopting theeuro as their single currency were prepared to use, if needed, appropriate market techniques to ensure that, at
the time of the teleconference on 31 December 1998, the market exchange rates would be consistent with theERM bilateral central rates.The Joint Communiqué of last May had already mentioned the possibility that, owing to rounding, the implicitbilateral rates which could be derived from the euro conversion rates would not necessarily correspond, up tothe last (sixth) significant figure, to the pre-announced ERM bilateral central rates. In order to minimise suchinconsistencies, the exchange rates of the participating currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar were quoted with a
high degree of precision. First, and in line with the regular concertation procedure, one euro area currency,namely the Deutsche Mark, was quoted against the US dollar according to prevailing market conventions (to5 significant digits). Then, the US dollar exchange rates for the other euro area currencies were determined by
multiplying their pre-announced ERM bilateral central rates against the Deutsche Mark by the DEM/USDexchange rate.1 The exchange rates of the 11 euro area currencies so calculated had 11 significant digits, all ofwhich were retained for maximum accuracy. Since the ERM bilateral central rates were lying within themarket bid-ask spreads for the participating currencies prevailing at the time of the teleconference on31 December 1998, equality between the market and the pre-announced exchange rates was ensured and thelikelihood of rounding errors was minimised.The next two steps had formed part of the usual procedure for the daily calculation of ECU rates since thecreation of the basket in 1979.Step 2: Calculation of the exchange rate of the official ECU against the US dollarThe US dollar rates recorded by the EU central banks were thereafter communicated by the Banque Nationalede Belgique/Nationale Bank van België to the European Commission, where they were used to calculate theexchange rates of the official ECU. The USD/ECU exchange rate (expressed as ECU 1 = USD x) was obtained
by summing the US dollar equivalents of national currency amounts that composed the ECU.Step 3: Calculation of the exchange rates of the official ECU against the EU currencies participating in theeuro areaThe official ECU exchange rates of the EU currencies were calculated by the Commission by multiplying thenon-rounded value of the USD/ECU exchange rate by their respective exchange rates vis-à-vis the US dollar.The resulting ECU exchange rates (i.e. units of currency per ECU) were rounded to the sixth significant digit.This calculation was performed for all EU currencies, not only those which were components of the ECU
basket. The Commission also calculated, as usual, the ECU rates for a number of non-EU currencies. TheECU rates of 31 December 1998 were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (Part C).For the participating currencies, these rates were then proposed as the irrevocable euro conversion rates.The table below illustrates the calculation of the official ECU exchange rates vis-à-vis all EU currencies on31 December 1998.1For example: BEF/USD = (BEF/DEM)
CR * DEM/USD, with (BEF/DEM)CR  being the pre-announced ERM central rate betweenthe DEM and the BEF.  This applies for all participating currencies except the Irish pound, for which, in order to adhere to the
market convention, the inverse exchange rate was used. The same convention applies to the GBP.ECB Annual Report Ł 199872Calculation of the ECU exchange rates on 31 December 1998@The exchange rate in column (b) for the pound sterling and the Irish pound is the number of US dollars per currency unit
rather than the number of currency units per dollar. Column (c) is therefore calculated for each of these two currencies bymultiplying the value in column (a) by that in column (b); and column (d) by dividing the US dollar equivalent of the ECU (i.e.
USD/ECU) by the rate in column (b).#The USD/ECU rate is shown after rounding to the 7th decimal place, whereas a higher degree of accuracy is used for
computational purposes.2.2Agreement on the new exchange
rate mechanism (ERM II)In accordance with the Resolution adoptedby the European Council at its meeting heldin Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June 1997, theEuropean Monetary System/exchange rate
mechanism  (EMS/ERM), which played a keyrole in the progress towards EMU, wasreplaced by a new exchange rate mechanism
(ERM II) from the start of Stage Three. Thisnew mechanism links the currencies ofMember States outside the euro area to the
euro. The operating procedures of this newexchange rate mechanism are laid down in anAgreement between the ECB and the NCBs
of the Member States outside the euro area(Central Bank Agreement) which was signedby the President of the ECB and the
four non-euro area NCB governors on1 September 1998. This Agreement replaces,with effect from 1€ January 1999, theAgreement of 13 March 1979€Œ as amended
by the Instrument of 10 June 1985 and theInstrument of 10 November 1987€Œ layingdown the operating procedures of the
EMS/ERM.Participation in ERM II is voluntary for all theMember States outside the euro area.Nevertheless, Member States with aderogation can be expected to join the
mechanism. It is regarded as a continuationof EMS/ERM membership and a prelude tothe possible future participation of a Member
State in Stage Three of EMU. Sustainableconvergence of economic performance andpolicies in participating non-euro area
Member States by reference to the euro area,in particular in the field of price stability,is one of the main objectives of ERM II.
Such convergence is considered to be aprerequisite for sustainable exchange ratestability, while such stability is, in turn,ycnerru

73ECB Annual Report Ł 1998conducive to greater convergence. Theconvergence-oriented nature of ERM II isreflected not only in the central role assigned
to the euro, but also in the possibility ofcloser exchange rate co-operation with theECB, subject to progress in economic
convergence towards the euro area.The new mechanism is based on central ratesagainst the euro with a standard fluctuationband of ±15% or narrower fluctuation bands,depending on progress towards convergence,
around the central rates. Foreign exchangeintervention and financing at the margins of thestandard or narrower fluctuation bands are, in
principle, automatic and unlimited, with veryshort-term financing available. The ECB and the
participating non-euro area NCBs could,
however, suspend automatic intervention if thiswere to conflict with their primary objective ofmaintaining price stability. The new exchange
rate mechanism does not include the Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism and theswap operations (creation of official ECUs
against US dollar and gold reserve assets) asprovided for by the EMS/ERM. These twomechanisms were unwound by the last day
of Stage Two, as described in Chapter III,Section 4.1.In September 1998 two Member Statesoutside the euro area Œ Denmark andGreece Œ expressed their intention to join
the new mechanism as from 1 January 1999.In order to stabilise market expectations andachieve a smooth transition to the new
mechanism, the intention of the Danish andGreek Governments to carry on from theEMS/ERM to ERM II was pre-announced atthe informal ECOFIN Council meeting on26 September 1998. This pre-announcementalso included notification of the fluctuation
bands to be used for the Danish krone (anarrower band of ±2.25%) and the Greek
drachma (the standard band of ±15%).
In accordance with the European CouncilResolution on the new exchange rate
mechanism, the decisions on the terms of theparticipation of the Danish krone and theGreek drachma in ERM II, i.e.€the central
rates of these currencies against the euroand the width of their fluctuation bands, weretaken on 31 December 1998 by the ministers
of the euro area Member States, the ECB andthe ministers and central bank governors ofDenmark and Greece, following a common
procedure involving the EuropeanCommission and after consultation of theMonetary Committee. The Danish krone has
been participating in ERM II with a ±2.25%fluctuation band and a central rate againstthe euro of DKK€7.46038, and the Greek
drachma with the standard fluctuation bandof ±15% and a central rate against the euroof GRD€353.109 since 1 January 1999.Further to this decision, the ECB, DanmarksNationalbank and the Bank of Greece, in
accordance with Article 1.2 of the CentralBank Agreement of 1 September 1998,established, by common accord, the following
bilateral upper and lower rates between theeuro and their respective currencies forcompulsory intervention in ERM II. The
existing arrangements are summarised in thetable below.Table 12Euro central rates and compulsory intervention rates for currencies of the countriesparticipating in ERM IIin force as from 1 January 1999Country and currencyEUR 1 =DENMARK:Upper rate7.62824

ECB Annual Report Ł 1998742.3Foreign exchange intervention
and the management of theECB™s foreign reserve assetsThe preparation and testing of theinfrastructure required for the conduct of
foreign exchange intervention by theEurosystem was finalised in the course of1998. The infrastructure was developed in
such a way as to enable the Eurosystem toexecute foreign exchange intervention in botha decentralised and a centralised manner,
both in the context of ERM II and againstother EU and non-EU currencies.With regard to the ECB™s foreign reservemanagement, a detailed methodologicalframework was finalised for the management
of the reserves. The finalisation and testingof the IT systems support needed by the ECBfor its decision-making process also took
place in the course of the year. This technicalinfrastructure is used to convey the ECB™sdecisions to the NCBs, which are in charge
of carrying out portfolio managementoperations in accordance with theseinstructions. Decisions transmitted by the
ECB include the setting of the operationalobjectives in terms of currency distribution,interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity
requirements. A list of counterparties eligiblefor foreign exchange operations by theEurosystem was selected and the relevant
legal documentation required for foreignreserve management was prepared.2.4Initial transfer of foreign reserve
assets from the NCBs to theECBIn accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statuteof the ESCB, the euro area NCBs transferredforeign reserve assets of an amountequivalent to E39.5 billion to the ECB atthe start of Stage Three. That amountcorresponds to the limit of E50 billionestablished by the Statute of the ESCB forthe initial transfer of foreign reserve assetsto the ECB, reduced in accordance withthe share in the ESCB™s capital of thenon-participating Member States. 85% ofthe amount transferred consists of foreigncurrency reserves, while 15% is gold.
Article 30.4 of the Statute of the ESCBprovides for the possibility for the ECBto make further calls on the NCBs™
foreign reserve assets beyond the limit setin Article 30.1.2.5The NCBs™ and Member States™
operations with their foreignreserve assetsThe foreign reserve assets not transferred tothe ECB at the start of Stage Three are heldand managed by the NCBs. In order to ensureconsistency with the euro area™s single
monetary and foreign exchange policies, andin accordance with Article 31.3 of the Statuteof the ESCB, the ECB will monitor and co-
ordinate market transactions conducted withthose assets. A similar monitoring frameworkhas been prepared for transactions executed
by euro area Member States with their foreignexchange working balances held outside theEurosystem. Along the same lines, an
agreement has been established between theECB and the European Commission.2.6The euro reference exchange
ratesThe ECB adopted the relevant conventionswith regard to the procedures for the
computation and publication of the referenceexchange rates for the euro. According tothese conventions, no euro area official fixing
procedure involving the ESCB, i.e.€the ECBand the NCBs, has been set up. However,given the need for the daily publication of
reference exchange rates, the ECB decidedto compute and publish reference exchangerates for the euro on a daily basis for a
number of currencies. The reference ratesare based on the regular daily concertationprocedure between central banks, which
normally takes place at 2.15€p.m. (C.E.T.),and are published via electronic marketinformation providers shortly after the75ECB Annual Report Ł 1998procedure is completed. Only one referencerate per currency is published (i.e.€the midrate), using the method E1€=€x€foreigncurrency units. As a general rule, amountsare given to five significant figures. Euroarea NCBs are free to publish morecomprehensive lists of euro reference rates
under a co-ordinated procedure.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998763.Statistics
3.1Implementation of the statistical
requirements for Stage ThreeThe statistical requirements for the conductof the single monetary policy and foreignexchange operations were set out in thedocument entitled ﬁStatistical requirements
for Stage Three of Monetary Union(Implementation package)ﬂ, which was madeavailable to banking associations and others
involved in statistical preparations forStage Three by the EMI in July 1996. Therequirements covered a wide range of
statistics in the areas of money and banking,balance of payments, financial accounts, pricesand costs, government finance, and a range
of other macroeconomic data. The focus wasplaced on statistics covering the future euroarea as a whole. It was necessary for the
data to be sufficiently harmonised to permitmeaningful aggregation and, where relevant,in a form which would allow consolidation at
the euro area level. The Governing Councilof the ECB formally approved theﬁImplementation packageﬂ on 1 September
1998. The statistical work conducted at theEMI/ECB in 1998 was mainly concerned withthe implementation of these requirements.Money and banking statisticsIn the field of money and banking statistics,the first balance sheets for the Monetary
Financial Institutions (MFI) sector in the euroarea to have been drawn up on the agreednew basis€Œ relating to end-June€1998 and
subsequent month-ends€Œ were submitted bythe NCBs of the participating Member Statesduring the summer of 1998. Data going back
to September 1997, compiled in such a wayas to conform as closely as possible to theagreed new basis, became available soon
afterwards. In order to assist the policypreparations for Stage Three, the NCBsprepared estimations for periods prior to
September 1997 and, in most cases, suppliedbest estimates for a range of monetaryaggregates for earlier years. These dataincluded approximations for missing items and
their quality improved during the second halfof the year. The first consolidated MFI balancesheets and monetary aggregates were
published in December 1998, shortly afterthe Governing Council had chosen theprecise definition of broad money (M3) to
provide the reference value for monetarypolicy purposes. The regular monthlypublication of MFI balance sheets and
monetary aggregates began with thepublication of end-November€1998 data on30 December 1998. Since January€1999
detailed information, together with data oninterest rates (including retail interest rates),has been published in the ECB Monthly
Bulletin. More detailed quarterly monetaryand related data for end-December 1998were released in April 1999.The monthly MFI balance sheet returns alsoprovide the information necessary to calculate
the minimum reserves which credit institutionsin the euro area must hold. Since the form ofminimum reserves was not decided until
July€1998, by which time the first MFI balancesheets were already in preparation, somemodifications, which were necessary to ensure
full compliance with the minimum reservesystem, were introduced on a voluntary basisuntil end-1999. The ﬁList of MFIsﬂ itself, which
now indicates which institutions are subject tominimum reserves, was first published inSeptember 1997, with an addendum in
December 1997, and was further improvedduring 1998 in terms of its consistency andpresentation. It has been available on the ECB™s
Web site since October€1998 and is updatedon a monthly basis.The task of developing statistics in the moneyand banking area is not yet complete. Interestrate and securities market statistics need to
be developed further; the ECB has yet tocarry out work on statistics relating to thosefinancial intermediaries (other than insurance
companies and pension funds) which are notMFIs. Further work on derivatives statisticsis also necessary.77ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Balance of payments statisticsIn accordance with the provisions of theimplementation package, the first balance ofpayments data in which transactions withresidents outside the euro area are recorded
as such relate to January 1999 and werereleased in April 1999, together withestimates going back to 1995. In 1998 much
attention was paid to analysing bilateral cross-border flows within the future euro area.The analysis has provided a further insight
into ways of improving the geographicalallocation of transactions, which will lead tomore reliable data for the area as a whole.
Moreover, while the implementation innational statistics of the IMF Balance ofPayments Manual (5th edition) had almost
been completed by the end of 1998, severalconceptual and practical issues still had to beresolved during the course of the year. These
included derivatives transactions, certainaspects of direct and portfolio investment,the recording of investment income on an
accruals basis, rather than on a cash basis,and the concept and measurement of officialreserves in the context of Monetary Union.In the area of balance of payments statisticsthe ECB shares responsibility at the EU level
with the European Commission (Eurostat).Conceptual work and practical planning havetherefore been carried out in close co-operation
with Eurostat. While the monthly balance ofpayments statistics will be the responsibility ofthe ECB alone, the intention is to publish fuller
quarterly and annual statistics jointly.Further conceptual and practical work wasalso carried out in 1998 on the internationalinvestment position. The first statement ofthe external assets and liabilities of the euro
area as a whole will be compiled as at end-1998 on a net basis for the first year, again asforeseen in the implementation package.Financial accountsThe implementation package stated a needfor quarterly financial accounts statistics,showing both transactions and balance sheetsfor the euro area as a whole, to complementmonetary analysis and policy research. The
design of such a system, which was intendedto provide relatively full, though incomplete,quarterly accounts, reached an advanced
stage in 1998, although it will not be possibleto compile tables until the detailed quarterlymoney and banking and balance of payments
statistics, as well as other relevantinformation, become available in the courseof 1999. This work is being carried out in
close co-operation with the EuropeanCommission (Eurostat) within the frameworkof the ESA€95, the implementation of which
begins in 1999.Other economic and financial statisticsThe implementation package also presenteda requirement for a wide range of othereconomic statistics, for which the EuropeanCommission (Eurostat) is responsible at the
EU level. Price statistics relate directly to theprimary objective of the ESCB™s policy, themaintenance of price stability. Considerable
effort has gone into producing theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices(HICP), originally for the purpose of assessing
economic convergence. Although somefurther improvements to coverage andcomparability have yet to be made, the HICP
is the most appropriate means of measuringprices for the purposes of the ESCB™sdefinition of price stability. The availability of
better government finance statistics (in termsof comparability, a level of detail€greater thanthat required by Protocol No. 5 on the
excessive deficit procedure attached to theTreaty,€and frequency) is highly desirable forthe purpose of assessing fiscal policy. With
regard to their usefulness as informationcontributing to the conduct of monetarypolicy, the quality of other economic statistics
relating to the euro area, including price andcost statistics other than the HICP, remainsuneven, despite many improvements during
1998. The implementation of the ESA€95 fromApril 1999 and of Council Regulation (EC)No.€1165/98 of 19 May 1998 concerningECB Annual Report Ł 199878short-term statistics, enacted with the strongsupport of the ECB, will improve the qualityof the information available in this key area.3.2Statistics relating to
non-participating Member StatesStatistics relating to the four Member States
outside the euro area are carefully monitoredby the ECB owing to their close economicand financial links with the euro area, not
least through the operation of the exchangerate mechanism (ERM€II). It is also importantfor these Member States to remain in close
contact with the development of statisticalneeds in the euro area in view of theirprospective participation in Monetary Union.
Thus, although the statistical requirementsdiffer somewhat in their case and althoughlegal instruments adopted by the Governing
Council (see below) do not apply to them,the non-participating Member States have, forthe most part, implemented the ECB™s
statistical requirements and are supplyingdata, whenever possible, on the same basis asthe participating NCBs.3.3Legal aspects
Council Regulation (EC) No. 2533/98
concerning the collection of statisticalinformation by the European Central Bankwas adopted in November 1998. This
Regulation completes the framework for theECB™s statistical activities as required for thepurpose of enabling the ESCB to carry out its
functions, in terms of defining the reportingpopulation, specifying a confidentiality regimeand making provision for enforcement.
Shortly after the enactment of the above-mentioned EU Council Regulation, theGoverning Council adopted several legal
instruments which lend substance toreporting requirements in the areas of moneyand banking, balance of payments and
international investment position statistics.3.4Information systems
infrastructureA project to provide the means for electronicdata to be exchanged within the ESCB wassuccessfully completed in spring 1998. The
message format used, GESMES/CB, seemslikely to become the international standardfor the transmission of economic and financial
data in the form of time series.More comprehensive statistical informationcan be obtained from the ECB™s Web site.79ECB Annual Report Ł 19984Payment systems
4.1The TARGET system
In 1998 intensive work continued on theimplementation of the TARGET (Trans-
European Automated Real-time Grosssettlement Express Transfer) system.In July 1998 the ECB published twodocuments on the TARGET system. The first,the TARGET brochure, provides general
information about TARGET in all 11 officialEU languages. The second, entitled ﬁTheTARGET service levelﬂ, is a document which
provides the European banking communitywith a description of the service level offeredto TARGET customers. The ECB has also
devoted a special section of its Web site(http://www.ecb.int) to TARGET, with theintention of making the latest information
available on a regular basis.The ﬁThird progress report on the TARGETprojectﬂ was released by the ECB inNovember 1998 with the objective ofproviding information concerning the
progress made on the TARGET project sincethe publication of the previous TARGETprogress report in September 1997. The
Report covers the following issues inparticular: (1) access to euro RTGS systemslinked to TARGET; (2) operating times;
(3)€the provision of intraday credit; (4)€pricingpolicies; (5) bank-to-bank charges forcustomer payments; (6) intraday liquidity
management in euro; (7) transparency duringthe changeover period; (8) return payments;(9) central bank correspondent banking
relations; (10) progress made in the technicalimplementation of TARGET; and (11) thelegal framework for TARGET.The price structure for cross-borderTARGET payments was established by the
Governing Council of the ECB in June 1998.The fee to be charged by the sendingNCB/ECB for cross-border payments effected
via TARGET between direct participants isbased on the number of transactions,according to the following degressive scale:E1.75 for each of the first 100 transactionsper month; E1.00 for each of the next 900transactions per month; and E0.80 for eachsubsequent transaction in excess of 1,000 per
month.The Governing Council of the ECB decidedin July 1998 to grant access to TARGET toNCBs and participants in RTGS systemsoperating in euro but located in non-euro
area Member States. This decision was aninnovation in the banking world since nocentral bank had previously granted access to
settlement facilities to institutions locatedoutside its currency jurisdiction.To ensure the availability of intraday liquidityin their euro RTGS system, non-euro areaNCBs have had to make arrangements to
ensure that, under normal circumstances,they have a deposit with the Eurosystembefore 8€a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) each day.
This deposit is of an amount of E3€billion forthe Bank of England and E1€billion each forthe Bank of Greece, Danmarks Nationalbank
and Sveriges Riksbank. Overnight depositsheld by the non-euro area NCBs with theEurosystem will be remunerated at the
ESCB™s deposit facility rate up to theaforementioned amounts.Participation in TARGET has been designedin such a way as to give the ECB assurancethat non-euro area participants will always
be in a position to reimburse intraday creditby the due time, thus avoiding any need forovernight central bank credit in euro. The
maximum amount of intraday credit grantedto a non-euro area participant is E1 billion.With regard to the TARGET operating times,
in September 1998 the ECB published, in theform of a press release, a calendar of
TARGET operating days for 1999. In additionto Saturdays and Sundays, in 1999 TARGETwas originally scheduled to be closed only on
the two public holidays that are common toall EU countries: Christmas Day and NewYear™s Day. However, in order to enableECB Annual Report Ł 199880banks to deal with the Year 2000 changeover,the Governing Council decided that TARGETshould also be closed on 31 December 1999.
TARGET will be open in all EU countries onall the other days of the year. The ECB willinform the financial community should any
changes be made to the calendar of TARGEToperating days after 1999.As regards the technical implementation ofthe TARGET system, 1998 was mainlydevoted to testing. All the NCBs and the
ECB moved on 1€July 1998, as scheduled, tothe penultimate test phase known assimulation testing. The aim of the simulation
phase was to test operations in a technicalenvironment which resembled theﬁproductionﬂ environment as closely as
possible, integrating operational staffand operational infrastructures. Creditinstitutions were invited to participate in end-
to-end simulation testing on specifieddates. In the volume testing in November1998 almost 100,000 test payments were
processed during the normal business hoursof TARGET. The final test period Œ ﬁmigrationto productionﬂ Œ took place in November
and December 1998. TARGET testing wasdesigned and conducted to ensure that thetechnical specifications were implemented
correctly and to enable the TARGET servicelevel Œ as published in July 1998 Œ to be met.At 7 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) on Monday,4 January 1999, after a smooth conversion tothe euro, the ESCB successfully began
operating the TARGET system, with morethan 5,000 credit institutions participatingdirectly in the system. TARGET immediately
started contributing to the integration of theeuro money market and made possible theconsolidation of the treasury management of
institutions with different activity centresthroughout Europe. There were someteething troubles, mainly because several
RTGS participants experienced difficulties inadapting to the TARGET rules. However,most of these problems had limited business
implications in TARGET. TARGET handledmore cross-border payments thananticipated. From the very first week of itsoperation TARGET processed transactionsof a value in excess of E1 trillion daily, ofwhich E340€billion was cross-border traffic.4.2Securities settlement systems
In 1998 preparatory work for Stage Three ofEMU in the field of securities settlement
systems (SSSs) focused on: (1) the assessmentof EU SSSs against certain standards for theiruse in the Eurosystem™s credit operations;
(2) the assessment of links between EU SSSs;and (3) the ongoing implementation of thecorrespondent central banking model
(CCBM) for the cross-border use ofcollateral.Assessment of EU SSSs against thestandards for their use in the Eurosystem™s
credit operationsAfter publication of a report on ﬁStandardsfor the use of EU securities settlementsystems in ESCB credit operationsﬂ in January1998, work concentrated on assessing the
EU SSSs against these standards in order todetermine whether or not they qualified foruse by the Eurosystem in monetary policy
and intraday credit operations. A keyobjective of the assessment was to allowcareful analysis to be carried out, with the
aim of ascertaining whether there were anyrisks to which the Eurosystem would beexposed in using these systems in the context
of its credit operations.The subsequent report (ﬁAssessment of EUsecurities settlement systems against thestandards for their use in ESCB creditoperationsﬂ), which was published in
September 1998, gave the results of theassessment and clarified the manner in whichthe systems had been analysed and assessed
against the standards.The assessment covered 29 EU SSSs, all ofwhich were found to be eligible for use fromthe start of Stage Three of EMU, although atthe time of the assessment, in July 1998, not81ECB Annual Report Ł 1998all SSSs complied fully with all the standards.Most were in the process of implementingchanges in order to ensure full compliance
from the start of Stage Three. At present,additional steps to comply with the standardsare still being taken. Therefore, the use of
most SSSs as from the start of Stage Three issubject to certain conditions. In future theeligibility of SSSs will be subject to periodic
reviews to take into considerationdevelopments and changes in the systems andmarket needs.Assessment of links between EU SSSsA link between SSSs can be defined as thetechnical, legal and organisational arrangements
established between different SSSs in order totransfer securities from one system to another.The use of links can facilitate the cross-border
use of eligible collateral for the Eurosystem™smonetary policy and intraday credit operations.The aim of the assessment is to analyse the
risks that are specific to links, such as potentialconflicts of law resulting from the applicabilityof different legal systems, in order to ensure
the safe and efficient transfer of securities on across-border basis.Thus far the ECB has focused only on thosedirect links which (1) would facilitate the cross-border use of eligible collateral in its monetary
policy and intraday credit operations; (2) havebeen established between those SSSs whichwere assessed by the Eurosystem as being
eligible for use in the Eurosystem™s monetarypolicy and intraday credit operations; and(3)€were operational as from 4 January 1999 at
the latest. Other links will be assessed in 1999.All links will be monitored and periodicallyreviewed.Implementation of the correspondentcentral banking modelThe correspondent central banking model(CCBM) was originally established as aninterim means of facilitating the cross-borderuse of collateral in the Eurosystem™s monetary
policy and intraday credit operations.The most important characteristics of theCCBM have been summarised in a brochurethat was made available to the public in
December 1998. In the CCBM each NCBmay act as a correspondent bank (for thedelivery of securities) at the request of any
other NCB. Thus, when a Eurosystemcounterparty (in country A) wishes to obtaincredit from its home NCB (NCB A) using
collateral held in another country (countryB), the counterparty will arrange for thecollateral to be transferred to a specified
securities account of the NCB of country Awith the NCB of country B. Onceconfirmation of the final, irrevocable delivery
of the collateral has been received byNCB A, the latter will release the credit tothe counterparty.The CCBM is open for instructions fromcounterparties from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. ECB
time (C.E.T.) in order to cover the normaltime frame in which regular open marketoperations are carried out by the Eurosystem.
In very exceptional circumstances the closingtime may be delayed, if that is deemednecessary by the ECB for monetary policy
purposes or for the smooth closing ofTARGET.The fee to be charged by the home NCB to acounterparty for each cross-border transferhas been set at E5. This fee only covers thecosts of the correspondent NCB and doesnot include local fees that are chargedseparately by the home NCB.In drawing up the list of assets eligible for usein the monetary policy operations of the
Eurosystem, it was also decided to includeassets in various countries which are ofparticular importance for their national
financial markets and banking systems, thetier two assets. In some countries theseeligible assets also include non-marketable
assets, such as private bank claims, bills ofexchange and non-marketable bonds. OwingECB Annual Report Ł 199882to the specific characteristics of these non-marketable assets, two methods have beendeveloped to enable their mobilisation
through the CCBM. The first method wasdeveloped for the mobilisation of certainFrench non-marketable tier two assets and
implies the transfer of property to thecorrespondent NCB for its own account. Thesecond method was developed for certain
non-marketable German, Austrian, Spanishand Dutch tier two assets and implies thetransfer of property or a pledge in favour of
the home NCB.In addition, the Governing Council decidedon 7 September 1998 that certain assets fromnon-euro area Member States may be usedas collateral to obtain intraday credit in euro
for payment systems purposes, subject to theapproval of the Governing Council. Thiscollateral can be mobilised by euro area
counterparties through the CCBM.Although the CCBM was originally designedas an interim solution, it may continue tooperate, in particular for non-marketableassets which cannot be transferred across
borders by alternative means.4.3Other payment arrangements
Oversight of the preparatory work for StageThree of the EBA Euro Clearing andSettlement SystemDuring 1998 the ECB followed closely thepreparatory work conducted by the Euro
Banking Association (EBA) on its EuroClearing System (Euro 1) for Stage Three ofEMU, in order to ensure that Euro 1 complied
with the safety standards laid down in the1990 G10 Report on Interbank NettingSchemes (the Lamfalussy standards).In particular, the ECB monitored the designand implementation of the liquidity, collateral
and loss-sharing arrangements, the setting-upof operational procedures for the settlementprocess in both normal and emergencycircumstances and, from the technicalviewpoint, the implementation of thehardware and software changes required for
the new system.Euro I began operating on 4 January 1999,with the ECB acting as the settlement agentand holder of a liquidity pool for Euro I.The EMI Council also envisaged that NCBswould be able to offer settlement services tothe EBA Clearing Company, should they wish
to do so. Only the Banque de France hasindicated its intention to open a localsettlement account for the EBA.Other large-value systemsIn compliance with the policy line endorsedby the Committee of Governors of the
Central Banks of the Member States of theEuropean Economic Community in 1993,whereby large-value net settlement systems
should meet the Lamfalussy standards andsettle at the central bank, the NCBs of thecountries in which large-value settlement
systems are in place also assessed thesesystems in the light of the Lamfalussystandards. The four systems assessed were:
Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) in Germany;Servicio Español de Pagos Interbancarios(SEPI) in Spain; Système Net Protégé (SNP)
in France and Pankkien On-line Pikasiirrot jaSekit-järjestelmä (POPS) in Finland. Theassessment was co-ordinated and reviewed
by the ECB. On the basis of the overallsatisfactory outcome of this assessment, theGoverning Council agreed that all four
systems mentioned above (as well as Euro I)complied with the Lamfalussy standards andcould operate in euro as from 4 January 1999.Policy statement of the ECB on paymentand settlement systems located outside theeuro areaIn November 1998 the ECB published a policystatement on euro payment and settlementsystems located outside the euro area. In line83ECB Annual Report Ł 1998with the G10 Report on Interbank NettingSchemes, the statement underlined the factthat, as in any other monetary system, central
bank money in euro can only be provided bythe central banks that belong to the euroarea. Moreover, the Governing Council
invited all central banks outside the euro areato contact the ECB whenever they becomeaware of a planned settlement arrangementin euro, be it domestic, cross-border ormulti-currency in nature. The policystatement makes it clear that the arrangement
by which non-euro area NCBs can offerlimited intraday liquidity in euro to theirparticipants, subject to the binding conditions
set out in an agreement with the NCBsconcerned, should be seen as a very specificexception to the rule.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998845The development of the euro banknotes and the preparations
for the cash changeover5.1Origination and procurement
(February to September 1998)The final designs and the technical specificationsfor the euro banknotes were approved by theEMI Council in February 1998. Intensive work
then began to convert the detailed draft designsinto the origination material. The final dies, filmsand files were exchanged between printing
works to enable printing plates to bemanufactured from a single origination source.Production of the pilot series was ready to
start in September 1998. In parallel with this,negotiations were held with the suppliers ofraw materials and security devices to ensure
that the ECB was not only able to guaranteecontinuous sources of supply, but that it wouldalso be able to avoid becoming tied to any
single supplier. The Governing Council of theECB formally decided that the euro banknoteswould not bear any national symbols.5.2Pilot series (September 1998 to
February 1999)The printing of the pilot series involved
producing several million banknotes undernormal operating conditions. The aim was tocheck the compliance of the origination
materials with the current specifications andto establish a preliminary basis for a qualitymanagement system.According to the decision of the GoverningCouncil, each NCB will be responsible for
procuring its own launch stocks. In otherwords, each participating NCB is free todecide where its national supply of euro
banknotes will be printed. There will be nocentrally organised pooling, although NCBsare, of course, free to enter into their own
bilateral or multilateral pooling arrangementsif this facilitates their production work.The Governing Council agreed that theparticipating NCBs could release theirprinting orders on the assumption of aproduction volume of 13 billion eurobanknotes, this figure being subject to annualreview. These banknotes represent an
amount of around E600 billion.5.3Protecting the euro banknotes
against counterfeitingGiven that the euro banknotes can beexpected to be widely used, since they willcirculate not only in the euro area Member
States but also in many other countries, itcan also be assumed that counterfeiters willtake a great interest in them. The Governing
Council has therefore decided on measureswhich will be taken in order to preventcounterfeiting, to monitor any counterfeiting
activities and to assist the law enforcementauthorities in bringing counterfeiters tojustice.First, the euro banknotes will be protectedagainst counterfeiting by means of the
incorporation of effective security features.In this context, ﬁeffectiveﬂ means that, onthe one hand, counterfeiters should find the
euro banknotes difficult to reproduce and,on the other, counterfeits should be easilyidentifiable by different users, for example
cashiers, the general public and banknote-accepting machines.The euro banknotes will be equipped with awide range of advanced security features.These features include the following:Œvisually recognisable features which can
be identified easily by the public, such aswatermarks, security threads, intaglioprinting with tactile properties and foilelements;Œvisually recognisable features which can
be checked using simple devices, such as
UV fluorescent features and microletters;
andŒcovert machine-readable features which
can be checked both in banknote-85ECB Annual Report Ł 1998accepting machines and in banknote-sorting machines.The second area of the ECB™s activity in
respect of anti-counterfeiting measuresrelates to publicity, information and educating
the public.Third, the Governing Council has decided toestablish a database to store the technicaland statistical data in respect of counterfeiteuro banknotes and coins. The relevant data
will be made available to all 15 EU NCBs andto the respective law enforcement bodiesinvolved in combating counterfeiting. As an
important part of the envisaged informationsystem on euro banknote counterfeits, it hasalso been decided to set up a central ESCB
counterfeit analysis centre, which will carryout a technical analysis of euro banknotecounterfeits, classify them, and feed the
relevant technical data into the database.5.4The logistics of the changeover
to the euro banknotes and coinsin 2002With a view to ensuring that the changeoverto the euro banknotes and coins starting at
the beginning of 2002 takes place bothsmoothly and successfully, the logistics of the2002 cash changeover clearly need to be
determined well in advance to enable all thoseconcerned to start the necessary preparationsin good time. In practice, the actual speed of
the cash changeover will depend not only onthe behaviour of the general public, but alsoon the capacity of the various parties involved
and the existing infrastructure. Theorganisation of the changeover is theresponsibility of the Member States. In
addition, the situation in the individualMember States varies with regard to severalissues concerning the currency in circulation
and the logistical infrastructure of the cashsupply (e.g.€the value of banknotes andcoins in circulation in relation to GDP, the
extent of the respective NCB™s branchnetwork, the density of the network ofautomated teller machines (ATMs) dispensingcash and the capacity to convert them quicklyto the euro).Taking account of these differences betweenMember States, while respecting potentiallyvarying political preferences, the EU Council
established a maximum time span for the dualcurrency period, which may be shortened bynational law, rather than stipulating a uniform
approach.1In order to ensure a smooth cash changeover
to the euro, the following two principlesshould be applied:Œthe changeover must be relatively simple
and user-friendly to ensure itstransparency for all citizens throughout
the euro area; andŒthe changeover must proceed in a cost-
effective manner and aim at avoiding
distortions of competition.In the light of these two principles, it has
been decided that the NCBs shouldharmonise some aspects of the cashchangeover within the euro area. With regard
to the early distribution of the eurobanknotes and coins, the Governing Councilholds the view that the possibility of
frontloading euro banknotes and coins to thegeneral public is ruled out by Articles€10 and11 of Council Regulation (EC) No.€974/98 on
the introduction of the euro, since it wouldhave the same effect as issuing or puttingthem into circulation. However, the
Governing Council has endorsed the viewthat frontloading euro banknotes and coinsto credit institutions, security carriers and
other organisations (e.g.€retailers and vendingcompanies) could be considered legallyviable if, and only if, legal or contractual
arrangements could be implemented in eachnational legal system to ensure that the eurobanknotes and coins would not be put into
circulation prior to 1€January 2002.1Article 15 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No.€974/98 of 3 May1998 on the introduction of the euro states: ﬁBanknotes and
coins denominated in a national currency unit (–) shall remain
legal tender within their territorial limits until six months after
the end of the transitional period at the latest; this period may
be shortened by national law.ﬂECB Annual Report Ł 199886Since frontloading to certain target groupswill be necessary in order for the cashchangeover to run smoothly as from 1 January
2002, the Governing Council takes the viewthat the NCBs should not debit thecommercial banks for the frontloaded
banknotes and coins before 1 January 2002.Furthermore, this debiting should not distortcompetition. Accordingly, the principle of
common debiting has been approved.However, a decision has yet to be taken onthe exact debiting model to be used.5.5Implementation of Article 52 of
the Statute of the ESCBTo ensure substitutability of the national
currency units between 1999 and 2002, theexchange of banknotes denominated in thenational currencies of the countriesparticipating in EMU is governed by Article€52of the Statute of the ESCB.2Since 1 January 1999, in accordance with a
decision of the Governing Council, eachparticipating NCB or its authorised agent has
been offering, at one location at least, toexchange the banknotes of other participatingcountries for national banknotes and coins at
the official conversion rate. The NCBs maylimit the number and/or the total value ofbanknotes that they are prepared to accept
for any given transaction or on any one day.It is recommended that the NCBs shouldrepatriate the banknotes of otherparticipating countries. To this end, they mayrepatriate the banknotes themselves, appoint
an agent to perform this repatriation serviceon their behalf or use existing commercialrepatriation channels.2Article 52 of the Statute of the ESCB states: ﬁFollowing theirrevocable fixing of exchange rates, the Governing Council shall
take the necessary measures to ensure that banknotes
denominated in currencies with irrevocably fixed exchange rates
are exchanged by the national central banks at their respective
par values.ﬂ87ECB Annual Report Ł 19986Information and communications systems
6.1ESCB systems
Preparation of new systemsThe conduct of a single monetary policyrequired the establishment of new IT
infrastructural systems and a multitude of highlysophisticated software applications throughoutthe ESCB, i.e. both at the NCBs and at the ECB.
This work was conducted in close collaborationwith the NCBs, and was a process spanningalmost the whole lifetime of the EMI. In
particular, 1997 and 1998 saw the entireESCB-wide infrastructure take shape,culminating in the final implementation of
systems and technical and functional testing in1998. For this purpose, a physical network anda versatile communications infrastructure, the
ESCB-Net, was implemented in May 1998. Thesystem for the exchange of statistical data, whichenables the NCBs to report regularly to the
ECB and the ECB to disseminate aggregate data,has been fully operational and functioningsmoothly since spring 1998. In May 1998 three
applications were implemented that enable theESCB to carry out money market operationsand foreign exchange interventions in a
decentralised fashion. (A more detaileddescription of these systems was provided inthe EMI™s Annual Report 1997.) In July 1998 an
application was delivered which supports thedecentralised management of the ECB™s foreignreserve assets and foreign exchange
interventions and is also used for themanagement of the ECB™s own funds. Thesenew applications provide efficient means for
safe and quick interaction between the ECBand the NCBs.In the second half of 1998 all required ESCBprimary and contingency systems as well as theassociated business procedures were thoroughly
tested in an ESCB-wide overall testing exercisein order to ensure that live ESCB operationsmade a smooth start on 4 January 1999. The
conduct and conclusion of the six-montheffective testing and training period werepositive and any necessary minor changes andadjustments to the IT systems were performed
satisfactorily. The Teleconference Systemconnecting the ECB and the 15 NCBs (as wellas six other non-ESCB institutions), which was
implemented in 1997, was used extensively inthe latter part of 1998. In particular, it provedits worth as the key tool for exchanging urgent
information in the final preparatory work forthe start of Stage Three of EMU and during theoverall testing; it will, if necessary, also play a
role as a contingency tool for other systems. Inaddition, it was confirmed that the secureelectronic mail system which operates between
the ECB and the 15 NCBs would be able tofunction as an efficient contingency tool in theevent of the failure of ESCB systems designed
to exchange relatively high-volume data files.In the field of banknotes, work has startedwithin the ESCB to develop central databasesfor aspects of the future circulation of eurobanknotes. A counterfeit currency database
is being designed that will allow the ECB andthe NCBs, in co-operation with national andEuropean law enforcement authorities and
mints, to combat the counterfeiting ofbanknotes and coins. A currency circulationdatabase will also be developed.The activities performed during thechangeover weekend to change the base
currency of existing systems to the euro orto start new systems in live operationalconditions were conducted successfully.
Similarly, the first months of experience oflive operation generally proved to besuccessful and all the necessary IT systems
were stable and functioned smoothly. TheECB, together with the NCBs, will continueto assess the functioning of the newly
established ESCB-wide systems with the aimof optimising the performance of the systemsand the relevant procedures.Year 2000 activitiesWhile the Year 2000 issue is a matter of veryserious concern to the ECB, the fairly recentECB Annual Report Ł 199888establishment of the EMI in 1994 Œ and of theECB on 1€June 1998 Œ has meant that themajority of ESCB and ECB systems are very
new and their degree of Year 2000compliance should be relatively high. In mid-1998 a group of representatives from the
ECB and the NCBs was set up to analysewhat action will need to be taken in order toreach an acceptable level of certainty that
ESCB-wide systems and applications are Year2000 compliant. The group established amethodology for the conduct of tests of the
component parts of the ESCB-wide systemsand applications and of the interfaces betweenthe ECB and the NCBs. The individual testing
of local ESCB system components will befollowed by bilateral testing between the ECBand the NCBs to assess the ESCB-wide
compliance of systems. Current planning shouldallow problems to be identified and anynecessary changes to critical systems to be
implemented and tested by the middle of1999. Thereafter, in order to minimise anyrisks and complications, a moratorium will be
placed on changes to critical ESCB-widesystems. Furthermore, in the course of 1999,all ECB business areas will prepare alternative
procedures to continue the critical ESCB andECB functions in case the technical systems arenot available on the first business day of 2000.6.2ECB systems
The ECB™s management of the liquidity
situation in the euro area through monetary
policy operations requires, inter alia, ananalysis of various factors affecting theliquidity needs of the euro area banking
sector. For this purpose, specific applicationswere developed in the first half of 1998 andtested within the overall testing in the second
half of the year. In order to support theresearch work carried out at the ECB and toprovide a basis for monetary policy strategies
and decision-making, a statistical data bankwas established. In addition, the ECB hasinitiated the setting-up of decision support
tools to provide consolidated informationfrom both internal sources and the markets.In the process of establishing a new FrontOffice area, a tender was organised for thesupply of a special trading telephone systemand an additional digital voice recording
facility. The system has been operational sinceNovember 1998. To allow secure and reliablecommunication with non-ESCB partners, a
new general external communicationsinfrastructure was implemented at the end of1998. It will be used for any dedicated
bilateral communications requirements.The Web site which was set up for the EMIin 1997 was transformed into the ECB™sWeb site (http://www.ecb.int). It providesgeneral access to information about the ECB,
press releases, texts of recent speeches andreports published by the ECB. In future,various applications will reside on this
infrastructure, including those which willmake possible the timely dissemination ofinformation and data of particular interest to
the markets and the banking community. Thefirst application, which went live in October1998, was a set of databases containing the
lists of those monetary financial institutions(MFIs) which are relevant for statisticalpurposes, eligible counterparties to ESCB
operations and institutions subject tominimum reserves. Also available is the listof assets eligible for use as collateral in
ESCB credit operations. Links to theWeb sites of all 15 NCBs are availablefrom the ECB™s Web site.During 1998 the growth of the ECBnecessitated a substantial increase in the
capacity of many internal systems. As a partof this process, many systems and standardapplications were upgraded to meet the
demands of modern data processingrequirements and to provide ECB staff withthe necessary tools to perform their tasks. In
addition, during 1998 the ECB successfullycompleted the migration of its standardnetwork operating systems to one single
system. The EMI™s local area network (LAN)infrastructure, as established in the earlydays of 1994, was migrated, following a
tender procedure, to the new ECB LANinfrastructure, employing state-of-the-arttechnology.89ECB Annual Report Ł 19987Banking supervision and financial stability
The preparatory work in the field of bankingsupervision and financial stability presentedspecific features in comparison with thatcarried out in other areas, since it focused
on the pursuit of a common understanding ofthe way in which the relevant provisions ofthe Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB should
be implemented. In 1998 the commonunderstanding reached by the EMI Council(described in the EMI™s Annual Report 1997)
was confirmed and expanded upon by theGoverning Council of the ECB. The finalcommon understanding is reviewed below.Article 105 (5) of the Treaty obliges theEurosystem to contribute to the smooth
conduct of policies pursued by the nationalauthorities responsible for the prudentialsupervision of credit institutions and the
stability of the financial system. Given theclose links between monetary policy and theprudential supervisory functions, as well as
the assignment of the responsibility formonetary policy and other tasks to theEurosystem, the main objective of the
provision in question is identified as ensuringeffective interaction between the Eurosystemand the national supervisory authorities. The
practical details of this relationship aredefined in a pragmatic manner. They will befurther developed in the light of actual
experience and the specific needs whichemerge in Stage Three. Two maincontributions on the part of the Eurosystem
to the conduct of policies pursued by nationalsupervisory authorities are identified.First, the Eurosystem plays an active role inpromoting co-operation among the nationalsupervisory authorities, irrespective of the
organisational model adopted in each country,as well as between those authorities and theEurosystem, with a view to achieving a
common understanding on relevant policyissues in prudential supervision and financialstability. This co-operation focuses mainly on
issues of a macro-prudential nature whichhave a bearing on the stability of financialinstitutions and markets. Even thoughArticle 105 (5) of the Treaty applies only to
participating countries, the co-operation, ingeneral, involves all EU supervisoryauthorities. The co-operation relies on the
assistance of the Banking SupervisionCommittee, which is composed ofrepresentatives of all EU NCBs and national
supervisory authorities as well as of the ECB.This multilateral co-operation is expected tointeract smoothly with the co-operation
pursued within the other internationalbanking supervisory fora (the BankingAdvisory Committee and the Groupe de
Contact at the EU level and the BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision at theG10 level) through, inter alia, cross-
participation in the respective meetings.Second, on the basis of Article 12 of theFirst Banking Co-ordination Directive(77/780/EEC) concerning the flow ofinformation between central banks and
supervisory authorities, the Eurosystem may,where appropriate, provide supervisoryauthorities with confidential information on
individual credit institutions and marketsderiving from its activities in the fields ofmonetary policy, foreign exchange policy
and payment systems, provided thatthis information is used exclusively forsupervisory purposes. Conversely, banking
supervisors may, where appropriate, providethe Eurosystem with supervisory informationon individual institutions which could be
useful for the Eurosystem in the performanceof its basic tasks. In the area of the singlemonetary policy, a common understanding
has been reached among banking supervisorson the basic features of the flow ofsupervisory information to the Eurosystem.
First, banking supervisors are prepared toassist the Eurosystem in detecting any non-compliance by the counterparties to the single
monetary policy with their obligations laiddown in the Eurosystem™s rules on monetarypolicy instruments and procedures, including
minimum reserves. Ultimate responsibility forensuring compliance, however, remains withthe competent NCB. Second, in view of theECB Annual Report Ł 199890possible systemic implications, bankingsupervisors are prepared to inform theEurosystem on a case-by-case basis (i.e. in
the light of the specific features of each case)should a banking crisis arise. In the area ofpayment systems oversight, a common
understanding among banking supervisors onthe flow of information to NCBs acting aspayment systems overseers has already been
reached. Work to revise this agreement inthe light of experience gathered is under way.Article 25.1 of the Statute of the ESCB Œwhich applies to all EU countries Œ providesfor a specific advisory function to be carried
out by the ECB in the field of Communitylegislation relating to the prudentialsupervision of credit institutions and the
stability of the financial system. This functionis optional in nature and refers to the scopeand implementation of Community legislation
in the above-mentioned fields. This function,which also includes advice on the possibleneed for new legislation, enables the ECB to
contribute to the framework for theprudential supervision of credit institutionsand financial stability at the Community and
national levels.Article 105 (4) of the Treaty (which appliesto all EU countries with the exception of theUnited Kingdom) stipulates that the ECB shallbe consulted on draft Community and
national legislative provisions falling within itsfields of competence. The precise scope of
this provision is laid down in the CouncilDecision of 29 June 1998 (98/415/EC) onthe consultation of the ECB by national
authorities. In accordance with that Decision,the authorities of the Member States shallconsult the ECB on draft national legislation
relating to financial institutions insofar as ithas a material influence on the stability offinancial institutions and markets, unless the
exclusive purpose of the draft legislativeprovision is the transposition of CommunityDirectives into national law. This function
enables the ECB to provide further input intothe Community and national legislativeprocesses in respect of prudential supervision
and financial stability.Finally, Article 105 (6) of the Treaty Œ whichapplies to all EU countries Œ covers thepossibility of specific tasks in the field ofprudential supervision being conferred upon
the ECB. The right of initiative in this arealies with the European Commission, whilethe ECB is involved in an advisory capacity
and the decision is taken by the EU Councilacting unanimously. However, it is felt thatany transfer of supervisory powers from
national authorities to the ECB is not justifiedat this stage.91ECB Annual Report Ł 19988Co-operation with other institutions
The Eurosystem is a new  participant in thefield of international and European economic,monetary and financial co-operation.Representation of the Eurosystem in the
performance of its basic tasks is decidedby the Governing Council of the ECB andvaries, depending on the institutions or fora
concerned. This external representationimplies close co-ordination within theEurosystem in order to formulate positions
on issues pertaining to its basic tasks. Informalarrangements with certain institutions(e.g.€the OECD and the IMF) had already been
reached in the context of the EMI. As faras the ECB™s international and Europeanrepresentation is concerned, formal and
informal arrangements have been developedsince the ECB™s establishment on 1 June 1998.At the start of Stage Three on 1 January
1999, although not all such arrangements hadyet been finalised, the most relevant oneswere already in place.8.1European relations
In 1998 the EMI and, subsequently, the ECB
further consolidated the already close
co-operation existing with other institutionsof the European Union.EU CouncilThe completion of European legislation forthe launch of the euro required closeinvolvement of the ECB in the preparatory
work carried out by the EU Council. A goodexample of this was the secondary legislationon minimum reserve requirements, statistics
and sanctions, which was adopted on the basisof ECB Recommendations. In addition, regularexchanges of views continued to take place
between the EU Council and the ECB, asprovided for by the Treaty. The President ofthe ECOFIN Council attended meetings of
the Governing Council of the ECB and thePresident of the ECB took part in meetingsof the ECOFIN Council at which mattersrelating to the objectives and tasks of the
Eurosystem were addressed, such as theirrevocable fixing of the euro conversionrates. Moreover, the two informal meetings
of the ECOFIN Council in York in March1998 and in Vienna in September 1998respectively provided an opportunity for
a wide-ranging discussion between theEMI/ECB, the NCB governors and ECOFINministers on issues related to both
international and European developments.Euro-11 groupIn line with the conclusions of the Presidencyof the Luxembourg European Council inDecember 1997, the President of the ECB isalso to be invited to attend meetings of the
newly established informal Euro-11 group.This group, which brings together theEconomics and Finance ministers of the
11 euro area Member States, the EuropeanCommission and, upon invitation,representatives of the ECB, is a forum for
the discussion of issues connected with theirrespective responsibilities for the singlecurrency.European ParliamentThe EMI/ECB also intensified its dialogue withthe European Parliament. In addition to the
hearings in the course of last year™s procedureto appoint the President, the Vice-Presidentand the other four members of the Executive
Board of the ECB, an exchange of views tookplace on a number of other occasions,including the presentation of the EMI™s
Convergence Report to the EuropeanParliament™s Sub-Committee on MonetaryAffairs, the subsequent presentation of the
EMI™s Annual Report 1997 at the plenarysession and the start in autumn 1998 ofregular hearings of the President of the ECB
before the Sub-Committee on MonetaryAffairs. In future these hearings will, as a rule,take place on a quarterly basis and areECB Annual Report Ł 199892intended to form the cornerstone of thedialogue between the ECB and the EuropeanParliament. They reflect the ECB™s readiness
to be open and transparent in discharging itsmonetary policy functions. In addition,members of the EMI/ECB management and
staff participated in other hearings ofcommittees of the European Parliament onissues related to, inter alia, statistics and
payment systems.European CommissionBuilding upon the links already establishedover the past few years, the ECB hasmaintained close relationships with theEuropean Commission. The competent
member of the European Commission hasbeen invited to attend the meetings of theGoverning Council of the ECB in accordance
with Article 109b€(1) of the Treaty.Monetary CommitteeThe Monetary Committee, in which theEMI/ECB participated as an observer,remained a key forum for the involvement ofthe ECB in the preparation of a broad range
of issues for discussion and adoption by theEU Council. Activities ranged from technicalsubjects such as the minting of the euro coins
and institutional issues such as the externalrepresentation of the European Union onEMU matters to a number of topics
concerning the changeover to the euro andthe multilateral surveillance exercise. Withthe start of Stage Three of EMU, the
Monetary Committee was replaced by theEconomic and Financial Committee, on whichthe ECB is now officially represented by two
full members.Other linksThe ECB also maintained a number of linkswith other relevant European bodies. Thisapplies, in particular, to its contribution tothe work of both the Committee of NationalMint Directors and the Committee ofMonetary, Financial and Balance of PaymentsStatistics.8.2International relations
In order to develop working relationships at
both a multilateral and a bilateral level,
arrangements for the ECB to be representedexternally have been made with the followinginstitutions and fora: (1)€intergovernmental
institutions, in particular the IMF and theOECD; (2)€fora such as the G7 and the G10Ministers and Governors (and Deputies);
(3)€the G10 Governors and Committeesestablished under the aegis of the BIS; and(4)€non-EU central banks.ECB representation in intergovernmentalinstitutionsThe IMF, as the cornerstone of theinternational monetary system, plays a keyrole in the process of the multilateral andbilateral surveillance over macroeconomic
policies and financial market stability. It wasimportant for the ECB to be represented atthe IMF from the start of Stage Three, given
the respective mandates of both institutions.At the meeting of the IMF Executive Boardon 21€December 1998 a decision was made
to grant observer status to the ECB. TheECB observer has a standing invitation toattend all meetings of the IMF Executive
Board regarding the Fund surveillance, underArticle€IV, over the monetary and exchangerate policies of the euro area, the Fund
surveillance, under Article€IV, over thepolicies of individual euro area MemberStates, the role of the euro in the
international monetary system, the IMFWorld Economic Outlook, internationalcapital market reports and world economic
and market developments. Moreover, theECB representative takes part, on a case-by-case basis, in meetings concerning items
recognised by the ECB and the IMF to be ofmutual interest for the performance of theirrespective mandates. In January 1999 the first93ECB Annual Report Ł 1998official IMF consultation discussion with theECB took place on the monetary andexchange rate policies of the euro area in the
context of Article IV consultations with theeuro area countries. Furthermore, thePresident of the ECB participates in the
meetings of the Interim Committee as anobserver. In addition, practical arrangementshave been made regarding the exchange of
information and statistical data between theECB and the IMF.The OECD is another intergovernmentalinstitution that addresses issues relating tothe basic tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem.
In 1998 the participation of EMI/ECBrepresentatives in the relevant OECDmeetings was based on informal arrangements
made in 1994 between the OECD and theEMI. The ECB and the OECD are in theprocess of finalising a more formal
arrangement, which will enable the ECB tocontribute to the work of the OECD and toattend all its relevant meetings.ECB representation in the meetings ofthe G7 and G10 Ministers and Governors(and Deputies)At its meeting in Vienna on 11 and12 December 1998 the European Councilendorsed a ﬁReport on the state of
preparation for Stage Three of EMU, inparticular the external representation of theCommunityﬂ. This report states that
ﬁregarding the ECB™s participation in the G7Finance Ministers™ and Governors™ Group,non-European partners have already accepted
that the President of the ECB attendsmeetings of the Group for the discussionswhich relate to EMU, e.g.€multilateral
surveillance, exchange-rate issues, and foragreement of the relevant sections of thepublished Statementﬂ. Pending a final decision
of the EU Council on the externalrepresentation of the Community, the ECBparticipates in the meetings of the G7 andG10 Ministers and Governors (and Deputies)on the basis of informal arrangements.ECB representation in meetings of the G10Governors at the BISAs regards central banking fora, the Presidentof the ECB participates in the meetings of the
G10 Governors, while ECB representativesalso take part in the Committees set up underthe aegis of the BIS, namely the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision, the Euro-currency Standing Committee (renamed asthe Committee on the Global Financial
System), the Committee on Payment andSettlement Systems and all groups establishedby these Committees.Bilateral co-operation with foreign centralbanksContacts and working relationships with non-euro area central banks and other relevantorganisations in mature, emerging market andtransition economies have been developed.
As regards the relationships with centralbanks in mature economies, the introductionof the euro on 1 January 1999 led the
Eurosystem to review and adjust existingswap agreements between euro area NCBs,on the one hand, and the US Federal Reserve
System and Norges Bank€Œ Norway™s centralbank€Œ on the other. More specifically, theGoverning Council jointly agreed with the
Federal Reserve System that the existingbilateral agreements of six euro area NCBs€Œnamely the central banks of Belgium,
Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands andAustria€Œ with the Federal Reserve Systemshould be allowed to lapse. At the same time,
the existing swap agreements between theeuro area NCBs and Norges Bank werereplaced by a new swap agreement between
the ECB and Norges Bank amounting toE1,535 million, which came into effect on1 January 1999.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998949Legal issues
9.1Legal convergence
Member States were obliged, in accordancewith Article 108 of the Treaty, to eliminate
incompatibilities between their nationallegislation Œ including the statutes of theirNCBs Œ on the one hand and the Treaty and
the Statute of the ESCB on the other, by thedate of the establishment of the ESCB at thelatest. In March 1998 the EMI published its
Convergence Report (as required underArticle 109j (1) of the Treaty), whichcontained, inter alia, an assessment of the
compatibility of such national legislation withthe Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.This report distinguished betweenthe statutes of the NCBs and other legislationwhich needed to be adapted in the light of
the relevant provisions of the Treaty and ofthe Statute of the ESCB. With regard to thestatutes of the NCBs, a distinction was made
between adaptation in the area of centralbank independence and other adaptationsrequired to ensure the necessary degree of
integration of the NCBs in the ESCB. As faras the adaptation of legislation other than thestatutes of the NCBs was concerned, the
EMI focused in particular on those laws witha direct bearing on the performance by anNCB of its ESCB-related tasks and laws in
the monetary field, such as acts related toforeign exchange and coinage.In its Convergence Report the EMI notedthat all Member States except Denmark,the legislation of which did not require
adaptation, had introduced, or were in anadvanced stage of introducing, changes in thestatutes of their NCBs, following the criteria
laid down in the EMI™s previous reports onthis subject and in the EMI™s Opinions inconsultation procedures (see Chapter€III,
Section 6, and Table 13 below). The UnitedKingdom, which is exempt from theobligations under Article€108 of the Treaty,
was in the process of introducing a newstatute of the Bank of England which, whileproviding a greater level of operationalcentral bank independence, was not expressly
intended to achieve the legal convergencerequired by the EMI for full compliance withthe Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
Pursuant to Article 109f€(6) of the Treatyand Article€5.3 of its Statute, the EMI wasconsulted on all draft national legislation
related to the adaptation of the statutes ofthe NCBs.In its Convergence Report the EMI concludedthat, with the above exceptions, a legislativeprocess was taking place throughout the
European Union that was intended to preparethe NCBs for Stage€Three of EMU. This processwas eventually completed before the Council of
the European Union (EU Council), meeting inthe composition of the Heads of State orGovernment, convened on 1€May 1998 to adopt
the decisions foreseen in Article€109j€(4) of theTreaty. The EMI also identified imperfections innational legislation which would not jeopardise
the overall functioning of the ESCB at the startof Stage Three, but which would neverthelessneed to be adapted in order to meet the
requirements of the Treaty and the Statute ofthe ESCB for Stage Three. Legislation to thateffect has meanwhile been adopted in France,
Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden, and the ECBwas duly consulted on the corresponding drafts.The ECB will, through the consultation
procedures addressed in Chapter€III, Section 6,of this Annual Report, continue to monitorlegislative developments in the Community and
in individual Member States which fall within itsfield of competence.9.2Preparatory work for Stage
Three of EMUArticle 4.2 of the EMI Statute required theEMI to specify the regulatory, organisational
and logistical framework necessary for theESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three ofEMU. Preparatory work for Stage Three
included a considerable legal componentwhich extended to virtually all areas in whichsuch preparatory work was being undertaken.95ECB Annual Report Ł 1998The ECB participated actively in thepreparation of Community legal acts relevantto the introduction of the euro. In particular,
it contributed, through Recommendations, tothe adoption of secondary legislation of EUinstitutions in the preparation of Stage Three.
Such Recommendations were given on avariety of issues, such as minimum reserves,the ECB™s power to impose sanctions, the
collection of statistical information by theECB, the limits and conditions for capitalincreases of the ECB, and the appointment of
the external auditors of the ECB andthe NCBs. The ECB also issued aRecommendation to EU institutions and to
Member States on the legal protection ofeuro banknotes and coins.In parallel with this, the ECB fulfilled itsobligation to prepare the legal framework,both operational and institutional, of the
ESCB. In this context, the ECB applied theentire set of legal acts which it is empoweredto use under Articles 14.3 and 34 of the
Statute of the ESCB. The ECB adopted twoRegulations (one on minimum reserves andthe other on the consolidated balance sheet
of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector)and a number of Decisions, particularly inrelation to the capital of the ECB.
Furthermore, in view of, inter alia, thedecentralised execution of ESCB taskspursuant to Article€12.1, third paragraph, of
the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB adopted awide range of Guidelines and someInstructions under Article 14.3 of the Statute
of the ESCB. Guidelines and Instructionsadopted by the Governing Council and theExecutive Board respectively are legal
instruments addressed to, and binding on,the euro area NCBs and are intended toensure the harmonised execution of the tasks
of the ESCB across the euro area. To theextent that the substance of such legal actsalso concerns the NCBs of those MemberStates which have not yet adopted the euro,agreements mirroring the content of the legalacts were entered into between the ECB, the
euro area NCBs and the non-euro areaNCBs. This resulted, for example, in legaldocumentation relating to TARGET and to
the correspondent central banking model(CCBM), which enables NCBs to acceptcollateral on a cross-border basis. The
exchange rate co-operation between the euroarea and the NCBs of the non-participatingMember States was also organised by way of
an ESCB Agreement laying down theoperating procedures for ERM II. Finally, theECB supported the standardisation of
contractual documentation necessary for thesmooth functioning of financial markets. Inthis context, standardised ESCB master
agreements on repurchases and foreignexchange swaps, together with a masternetting agreement, were developed, and
contracts supporting the management of theECB™s foreign reserve assets were put in placewith counterparties throughout the world.In addition, the institutional establishment ofthe ECB and of the ESCB has involved the
preparation and adoption of a variety oflegal acts and instruments, such as theHeadquarters Agreement with the ECB™s host
state, the Rules of Procedure of the ECB, theECB€Conditions of Employment and ancillarylabour rules, and the regime applicable to
accounting and reporting within the ESCB.Table 13 shows the legal acts adopted by theECB which have been published or will bepublished shortly in the Official Journal of theEuropean Communities.The ECB intends to publish all such legal actsin the 11 official languages of the Member
States in a Compendium to be made availablein the first quarter of every year.ECB Annual Report Ł 199896Table 13Legal acts and agreementsNo.DateSubjectOfficial Journal ref.

ECB Annual Report Ł 19989810Internal audit activities
Under the provisions laid down in the Statuteof the ESCB, the operational efficiency of themanagement of the ECB is examined by theEuropean Court of Auditors. Furthermore,
the books and accounts of the ECB areaudited by independent external auditors.In addition to these external controls, withinthe framework of its annual audit programme,the ECB™s Directorate Internal Audit is
involved in reviewing the reliability andintegrity of financial information, in particularwith regard to that which is provided in the
financial statements.1998 was unique in that two different sets ofaccounts were closed Œ the first relating tothe liquidation of the EMI at the end of May1998 and the second relating to the first set
of financial statements drawn up for the newlyestablished ECB in early 1999. During theyear the Directorate Internal Audit alsofocused on reviewing the security ofinformation systems under development oralready in operation.In the context of the Internal AuditorsCommittee (IAC), which is the successor to
the TARGET Audit Group (TAG) and iscomposed of representatives of the ECB andthe NCBs™ Internal Audit functions, audit
programmes and audit standards are definedjointly and are used in a decentralised mannerfor the review of ESCB-wide common
infrastructures. Although it was initiallylimited to one of the most critical systems,TARGET, this EU-wide co-operation among
the ESCB™s Internal Audit functions wasprogressively extended during 1998 to includeother key ESCB systems, inter alia, the
decentralised management of the ECB™sforeign reserves.99ECB Annual Report Ł 199811Changeover to the euro
The transition of the banking and financialcommunity from the participating nationalcurrencies to the euro in only three and ahalf days after the irrevocable fixing of the
euro conversion rates was deemed to be aremarkable success. The smooth migrationof all electronic systems and procedures
attested to the quality of the preparatorywork carried out over recent months andyears, both by the banking and financial
industry and by the central bankingcommunity under the guidance initially of theEMI and then of the ECB.In February and March 1998 the EMICouncil discussed issues concerning the
implementation of Article€109l€(4) of theTreaty, which deals with the fixing of theirrevocable conversion rates of participating
national currencies vis-à-vis the euro. Inparticular, the timing of the adoption of theconversion rates by the EU Council was
discussed with a view to maximising the timeavailable for the final adaptation of electronicsystems and procedures. The EMI Council
agreed finally that the irrevocable conversionrates should be fixed on 31 December 1998and that, contrary to alternative proposals,
markets should not be closed by nationalauthorities on that day, with the exception ofstock exchange markets and countries in
which 31€December is a bank holiday. Thereasons for this decision were the following:compliance with the letter of the Treaty; the
request from a large proportion of thebanking community that payment systems, inparticular, should be operational at the end
of the year; and to avert the risk of theemergence of a grey foreign exchange marketfor the euro outside the euro area on
31 December 1998, with potentialimplications for the continuity of contractsdenominated in ECU and converted into
euro.The EMI Council and the Governing Councilof the ECB were consulted by most euroarea Member States in the course of 1998 ontheir national legislation related to thechangeover to the euro. In their Opinions,
the EMI and the ECB focused on differencesbetween the national legal frameworks, whichcould have impaired the singleness of the
monetary policy of the euro area.A significant number of the Eurosystem™sactivities were devoted to the preparationsfor the changeover weekend at the end of1998. There were three main causes for
concern:ŒFirst, a major technical failure affecting
either the Eurosystem or any of thecomponents of the ﬁcore infrastructureﬂof the financial system in the euro area
could have hampered the functioning ofthe operational arm of the monetarypolicy framework of the Eurosystem. This
core infrastructure was deemed to includenational central securities depositories,payment and securities settlement
systems, stock exchanges, financial dataproviders and global custodians.ŒSecond, the exceptional concentration
of operational risks (i.e. migrationprocedures) within a limited period of
time (three and a half days) confrontedthe Eurosystem with potential systemicrisks at the very start of Monetary Union.
This concentration affected not only thecore infrastructure, but also the wholefinancial system within and beyond the
euro area (other Member States andmajor industrialised countries.)ŒThird, the banking and financial community
wanted to ensure that it would beinformed promptly and in a secure manner
of the irrevocable conversion rates,as adopted by the EU Council on31 December 1998, thereby enabling it to
start conversion operations immediately.On 3 November 1998 the Governing
Council approved the following threerecommendations to the banking and financialcommunity:ECB Annual Report Ł 1998100ŁﬁBanks and other financial operators areinvited to set up in-house organisationalarrangements to cope with possible
unexpected events arising during thechangeover weekend. In particular theinstitutions belonging to the ‚core
infrastructure™ of the financial market (...)are also invited to consider, on their ownresponsibility, the means via which
information on such events could bedisseminated among market participants.ŁBanks and other financial operators are
invited to refrain from effecting markettransactions and injecting new orders into
their backup systems which would need tobe settled on 4 January 1999 with a viewto reducing the workload during the
changeover weekend.ŁThe counterparties of the NCBs are
invited to consider all possible solutions,which would allow them to be sufficientlyliquid on 4 January 1999. Given the risk of
technical failures with reference to theparticularly cumbersome procedures forthe redenomination of securities, the
counterparties of the NCBs couldconsider Œ where this is technicallypossible€Œ whether or not they would like
to pre-deposit eligible securities with theNCBs before the end of the year, in orderto create a buffer of collateral which could
be used on 4 January 1999 in the event ofan emergency.ﬂAt the same time, the Governing Council
decided to create an ad hoc ChangeoverWeekend Committee to act as a consultative
body on changeover issues for theEurosystem. This Committee identified anumber of financial institutions (national
central securities depositories, paymentand securities settlement systems, stockexchanges, financial data providers and global
custodians) as forming part of the coreinfrastructure which should report either tothe ECB or to the NCBs on their plans for
the changeover and on details of any incidentsor unforeseen developments. A number ofcontingency measures to be implemented inthe event of a breakdown of the coreinfrastructure were discussed and prepared.In order to follow developments prior to andduring the changeover weekend, a networkof ﬁcentral communication pointsﬂ was set
up to gather and share information, both fromwithin the Eurosystem as well as fromoutside. This monitoring procedure involved
checking the timely implementation by theEurosystem and the core infrastructure of240 relevant conversion steps (ﬁmilestonesﬂ),
which could potentially affect the smoothlaunch of the euro. Contact was establishedwith the non-euro area NCBs, the central
banks of the Concertation Group, theEuropean Commission and a parallel networkof institutions set up by the Banking
Supervision Committee.Credit institutions received prompt andsecure information on the irrevocableconversion rates for the euro.1 Immediatelyafter their adoption by the EU Council, theECB and the euro area NCBs helped todisseminate this information to the bankingcommunity via a wide range of information
services such as Reuters and Telerate, as wellas via the Internet and S.W.I.F.T.On 3 January 1999 the ECB announced in apress release that ﬁin the monitoring ofconversion activities conducted by the ESCB
during the changeover weekend no incidentshave been reported that may impair thesmooth start of the system. The ESCB
considers this to be a sign of the quality ofthe preparatory work conducted over recentmonths and years by the central banking
community and by private financial marketoperatorsﬂ.1See also Chapter II, Section 2.6.
101ECB Annual Report Ł 199812Information activities
The aims of the ESCB™s externalcommunication policy are to foster thetransparency and clarity of its policyobjectives, to inform the public about its
tasks and actions, thereby enhancing itseffectiveness, credibility and efficiency, andto contribute to the accountability of
the Eurosystem without disregarding thestatutory provision relating to theconfidentiality of the proceedings of the
Governing Council of the ECB.The ECB communicates information to thepublic by a variety of means, including pressreleases, press conferences and speeches bymembers of the Governing Council and
various publications. Each of these is animportant tool for explaining the singlemonetary policy of the Eurosystem. Since the
establishment of the ECB, the President hasheld regular monthly press conferences toinform the general public via the media of the
outcome of the deliberations of theGoverning Council; from the start of StageThree of EMU these have included an
explanation of its monetary policy decisions.The President™s introductory statement atthese press conferences as well as press
releases on relevant topics are publishedimmediately after the meetings of theGoverning Council. These introductory
statements, press releases, speeches byGoverning Council members and all otherECB publications are made available on the
ECB™s Web site (http://www.ecb.int) and/oron the Web sites of the NCBs (see the list ofdocuments published by the ECB at the end
of this Report).In accordance with the Statute of the ESCB,the ECB ﬁshall draw up and publish reportson the activities of the ESCB at leastquarterlyﬂ (Article 15.1) and, in addition, ﬁa
consolidated financial statement of the ESCBshall be published each weekﬂ (Article 15.2).Since January 1999 the ECB has produced a
Monthly Bulletin, which is intended to be oneof the ECB™s main tools for analysingeconomic developments in the euro area andexplaining the single monetary policy of the
Eurosystem. Furthermore, the statistical partof this Monthly Bulletin is one of the keysources of euro area statistics. As is the case
for the ECB™s Annual Report, the MonthlyBulletin is produced in all 11 official EUlanguages and made widely available
throughout the euro area and beyond. Thesame is true of many other publications.In 1998 the ECB received 3,500 visitors andhosted 200 information sessions for both thepublic at large and special target groups (from
academic circles, commercial and industrialassociations, the banking community, researchinstitutes and the media) from all over the
world about the ECB, the euro and the singlemonetary policy. In this area, too, the NCBsplayed an important role in bringing the
Eurosystem closer to the citizens of Europe.Contributions to the media and speeches bymembers of the Governing Council have beenadditional vehicles for proactively explainingthe single monetary policy of the Eurosystem
to the public at large.Members of the Governing Council and ofthe Executive Board and staff of the ECBand NCBs have participated in numerousconferences on ESCB-related topics
organised by other EU and non-EUinstitutions.Finally, in accordance with Article 109b (3)of the Treaty, the President and the othermembers of the Executive Board of the ECB,
at their own initiative or upon request, mayalso be heard by the competent committeesof the European Parliament. It has been
agreed that the President of the ECB willappear before the European Parliament or itscommittees at least four times a year to
present the activities of the ESCB and inorder to facilitate a regular exchange ofinformation and views (see also Chapter II,
Section 8). In accordance with the provisionsof national laws, some NCB governors mayalso be heard by the Parliament of their
country.Chapter IIIOther ESCB activitiesECB Annual Report Ł 19981041Oversight of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System
The ECU Clearing and Settlement System(ECU Clearing) came under the oversight ofthe EMI by virtue of Article 109f (2), sixthindent, of the Treaty. Upon its establishment,
the ECB took over the EMI™s responsibilitywith regard to the oversight of the ECUClearing.During 1998 the activity of the Euro BankingAssociation (EBA) focused mainly on the
preparatory work for the Euro ClearingSystem (Euro 1) run by the newly createdEBA Clearing Company, which started
clearing and settlement operations on4 January 1999 (see Chapter€II, Section 4.3).Activities of the ECU Clearing andSettlement System in 1998In 1998 both the number of transactionsprocessed in the ECU Clearing and their value
rose in comparison with 1997, slightlyexceeding, on average, 6,200 payments per
day and reaching an average daily turnover ofECU 55.2 billion.The ECU Clearing functioned fairly smoothlyduring 1998, although some delays wereregistered in the completion of settlement
on several days, caused by either technicalproblems or procedural flaws localised at oneor more clearing banks.The ECU Clearing ceased to operate on31 December 1998.105ECB Annual Report Ł 19982Report on electronic money
In August 1998 the ECB published theﬁReport on electronic moneyﬂ, building onthe analysis conducted under the aegis of theEMI. The Report addresses the reasons why
the issuance of electronic money shouldbe regulated and states the minimumrequirements for electronic money issuers
and desirable objectives. It also tackles thequestion of the status of the issuer ofelectronic money and the role of the
oversight of payment and settlement systemsand prudential supervision with regard to theminimum requirements.At the present time electronic money is still inits infancy, but the possibility of an exponential
growth, especially as a result of its use toeffect payments for goods and services offeredon the Internet and of the introduction of the
euro (which makes cross-border transactions fareasier), cannot be ruled out. Hence electronicmoney is likely to have significant implications for
monetary policy in the future. A number ofadditional regulatory concerns, i.e. the safe andefficient functioning of payment systems and
confidence in payment instruments, theprotection of customers and merchants, thestability of financial markets and protection
against criminal abuse and the level playing-fieldalso have to be taken into account. Therefore,clear rules on the conditions under which
electronic money can be issued need to beestablished. The ECB considers it essential thatthe following minimum requirements be fulfilled:Œissuers of electronic money must be
subject to prudential supervision;Œthe issuance must be subject to solid and
transparent legal arrangements, technicalsecurity, protection against criminal abuse
and monetary statistics reporting;Œissuers of electronic money must be legally
obliged to redeem electronic money
against central bank money at par at therequest of the holder of the electronicmoney; andŒthe possibility must exist for the ECB to
impose reserve requirements on all
issuers of electronic money.The ECB has identified two further objectives,
the pursuit of which it deems to be desirable:the interoperability of electronic moneyschemes and the adoption of adequate
guarantee, insurance or loss-sharing schemesto protect the holders of electronic money.Against this background, the ECB is of theopinion that the most straightforwardsolution would be to limit the issuance of
electronic money to credit institutions, asthis would avoid changing the existinginstitutional setting for monetary policy and
banking business. The issuance of electronicmoney should be limited to ﬁcreditinstitutions as defined in Article I of the First
Banking Co-ordination Directiveﬂ, sinceArticle 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB allowsthe ECB to impose reserve requirements only
on these institutions in Stage Three of EMU.For this reason, the ECB would see greatmerit in seeking an amendment to the First
Banking Co-ordination Directive so as toextend its scope of application to cover thoseinstitutions issuing electronic money which
do not fall within the current definition of aﬁcredit institutionﬂ.These considerations have been largely takeninto account in the European Commission™sproposals for Directives on the taking-up,
the pursuit and the prudential supervision ofthe business of electronic money institutionsand amending Directive 77/780/EEC on
the co-ordination of laws, regulations andadministrative provisions relating to thetaking-up and pursuit of the business of
credit institutions, which were published on15 October 1998. In its formal opinion of18€January 1999 on these draft Directives the
ECB addressed the following major issues:Œall issuers of electronic money should be
legally obliged to redeem electronicmoney at par value. From the monetarypolicy point of view, the redeemability
requirement is, inter alia, necessary inorder to preserve the unit-of-accountfunction of money, to maintain priceECB Annual Report Ł 1998106stability by avoiding unconstrainedissuance of electronic money, and tosafeguard the controllability of liquidity
conditions and short-term interest ratesset by the ESCB. By contrast with theproposal of the European Commission,
electronic money holders should have thepossibility of exchanging their electronicmoney against cash or a bank transfer at
all times; andŒthe business activities open to credit
institutions which choose the limited
authorisation to operate as electronicmoney institutions (ELMI) are too broad
and the risks related to these are notaddressed to an adequate extent.107ECB Annual Report Ł 19981Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus.3Other payment system activities
Since the variety and structure of paymentsystems differ from one country to another,the availability of comprehensive informationis essential. For the EU countries, this
information has been made available inﬁPayment systems in the European Unionﬂ(the ﬁBlue Bookﬂ), which is a descriptive guide
to the payment and settlement systemsin the 15 Member States, published bythe EMI in April 1996. Statistical addenda,
incorporating figures for 1995, 1996 and1997, were published in January 1997, January1998 and January 1999 respectively.For the ECB, it is essential for similarinformation to be made available on candidateEU Member States. The 11 countries which
started the process towards accession inMarch 19981 accepted the ECB™s invitationto set up a project to produce a descriptionof their payment and securities settlementsystems in line with those of the EU countriesincluded in the Blue Book. The intention of
the ECB is to publish these descriptions,together with the related statistical data, inan Addendum to the Blue Book in the course
of 1999.ECB Annual Report Ł 19981084Administration of EMS mechanisms and Community loans
Under Article 109l€(2) of the Treaty the ECBtook over the tasks of the EMI related to theadministration of the mechanisms of theEuropean Monetary System (EMS)€Œ the Very
Short-Term Financing (VSTF) mechanism, theShort-Term Monetary Support mechanism,the creation of ECUs for the purpose of
implementing the EMS Agreement and theadministration of borrowing and lendingoperations concluded by the Community
under the Medium-Term Financial Assistancemechanism.4.1EMS mechanisms
The ECB carried out operations associated with
the creation, utilisation and remuneration ofofficial ECUs until the end of December 1998.
Official ECUs were issued to the NCBs of theEU against the contribution of 20% of theirgross gold holdings and US dollar reserves
through revolving swaps. Contributions werecompulsory for the EU NCBs participating inthe exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and
voluntary for the remaining EU NCBs. The swapoperations were renewed every three months.This allowed the necessary adjustments to be
made in order, first, to ensure that each EUNCB™s contribution to the ECB continued torepresent at least 20% of its gold and US dollar
reserve holdings at the end of the monthpreceding the renewal date, and, second, totake account of changes in the price of gold and
in the US dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis theofficial ECU.In accordance with Article€23.2 of the EMIStatute and Article 20 of the EMS Agreement,the mechanism for the creation of ECUs against
gold and US dollars was unwound by the firstday of the third stage of EMU. As provided forin Article 23.3 of the EMI Statute, any existing
claims and liabilities arising from the VSTFmechanism and from the Short-Term MonetarySupport mechanism1 were settled by the firstday of the third stage of EMU.The ECU mobilisation mechanism has notbeen activated since 1986. No use was madeof the VSTF mechanism in 1998, nor of the
Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism.The latter has not been activated since 1974.At the start of Stage Three of EMU the EMSwas replaced by the new exchange ratemechanism referred to as ERM II (see
Chapter II, Section 2.1).4.2Community loans
In accordance with Article 109l€(2) of the Treaty
and Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC)No. 1969/88 of 24 June 1988, the ECB continuedthe administration of the borrowing and lending
operations concluded by the Community underthe Medium-Term Financial Assistancemechanism. The mechanism provides for loans
to be granted by the European Commission onbehalf of the Community to Member Stateswhich are experiencing or are seriously
threatened by difficulties in their balance ofpayments (current or capital account). In orderto fulfil its administrative function with regard
to such loans, the ECB effects payments arisingfrom these borrowing and lending operations.It verifies the maturity dates laid down in the
borrowing and lending contracts for thepayment of interest and repayment of theprincipal and reports to the European
Commission on the operations carried out forthe account of the EU.In 1998 the ECB continued to receive fromborrowers, namely Greece and Italy, and topay to creditors vis-à-vis the Community the
sums due in respect of capital, interest,commission and expenses on outstandingloans. Following the final repayment made by
Greece in March 1998, no balance remainedoutstanding for Greece at the end of 1998.The following table shows the total of
outstanding Community lending operationsas at 31 December 1997 and 1998.1As laid down in the EMS Agreement and the Agreement between
central banks of the Member States of the European EconomicCommunity of 9 February 1970, as amended.109ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Table 14Outstanding Community loans(as at year-end in millions)Source: ECB.snaolgnidnatstuO

ECB Annual Report Ł 19981105Co-operation in the field of banking supervision and
financial stabilityIn the context of the task of the Eurosystemto contribute to the smooth conduct of thepolicies pursued by the competent national
authorities relating to the prudentialsupervision of credit institutions and financialstability, a number of issues have been
analysed. This activity Œ performed with theassistance of the Banking SupervisionCommittee Œ has replaced the consultative
task carried out by the EMI underArticle 109f (2) of the Treaty. In most casesthe outcome of these analyses has been made
available to other international supervisoryfora.5.1The impact of Monetary Union
on the EU banking systemsIn view of the start of Stage Three a surveyhas been carried out to review the possible
effects of Monetary Union on the EU bankingsystems in the medium to long term and theways in which EU banks are preparing
themselves. In general, it should be notedthat it is difficult to isolate the specific effectsof Monetary Union on the banking sector
from those deriving from other driving forcesfor change (e.g. technology). The basicfinding of the survey Œ which was made
available to the public Œ is that MonetaryUnion is likely to reinforce the alreadyprevailing trends in the EU banking systems,
such as the reduction of the existing excesscapacity, the increasing pressure on banks™profitability, the growth of internationalisation
and geographical diversification outside theeuro area as well as the spread of mergersand acquisitions and a higher level of
conglomeration.Monetary Union will affect banking activitiesin various ways. The reduction in foreignexchange activities of those currenciesreplaced by the euro is the most obvious
effect. Therefore, it is expected that bankswill try to increase their money and securitiesmarket activities to even out lower revenuesfrom foreign exchange trading. Thedevelopment of deep and liquid integratedmoney and capital markets could offer new
opportunities but might, at the same time,reduce banking intermediation. The reductionof government debt owing to fiscal
consolidation under Monetary Union mightboost the issuance of private bonds and,possibly, the securities activities of banks.
Retail deposit business might be affected tothe extent that the establishment of a lowinterest rate environment would induce
customers to seek alternative investments todeposits. Lending business might be favouredby the positive macroeconomic environment
brought about by Monetary Union, but thefurther securitisation and disintermediationexpected might have the opposite effect.
Correspondent banking services mightdecrease owing to the centralisation oftreasury functions by large firms. All in all,
the final impact on banking activities willdepend on the interaction of all theaforementioned factors and is therefore
difficult to predict.Monetary Union will require banks toreconsider their strategic orientation in orderto be able to cope with the challenges posedby the single currency. This process is already
under way. In particular, EU banks aredeveloping three main types of strategicresponse: (1) improvements in services and
procedures (such as the quality of services,staff and the IT infrastructure, and riskmanagement and internal control systems);
(2) changes in product ranges (such as theshift from operating services to consulting,the reconsideration of product ranges and
the development of alternative sources ofincome, e.g.€through geographical expansion);and (3) mergers, strategic alliances and
co-operation agreements.The recent wave of mergers and acquisitionsin the EU banking sector clearly indicatesthat credit institutions are reconsidering theirstrategies. However, it may be difficult to111ECB Annual Report Ł 1998assess the extent to which this process hasbeen triggered by Monetary Union sincesimilar activities can be observed in other
markets (e.g. in the United States). Thecomparatively low degree of concentrationwithin the EU banking sector could provide
room for further consolidation. Whereasmost mergers and acquisitions in the EU haveso far taken place at the domestic level, the
possibility cannot be ruled out that some ofthem were intended to provide a basisfor further cross-border expansion. The
existence of excess capacity in somecountries, the disintermediation process andthe intensification of competition brought
about by Monetary Union constitute factorsencouraging further consolidation.Monetary Union will also affect the featuresand magnitude of banking risks. The positivemacroeconomic effects of Monetary Union
are expected to mitigate credit risk in theeuro area. However, in a context in whichthe development of deep and liquid markets
can facilitate direct access by the bestborrowers, the ensuing concentration of riskyborrowers among banks could increase credit
risk. While market risk within the euro area,especially with regard to foreign exchangeand interest rate risk, is expected to
be reduced significantly, the maturitytransformation risk will persist. It also seemslikely that banks will seek to replace part of
their lost foreign exchange business by newor increased involvement in non-euro areamarkets, with the possibility of increased
country risks. Legal and operational risks mayincrease in the short run for reasons linkedto the conversion to the euro and the
conduct of business in the new legalenvironment. These effects should, however,subside in the long term.All in all, although in the short term the EUbanking systems might be under pressure for
a number of reasons (the adjustment processmade necessary by Monetary Union, financialcrises in emerging markets, the Year 2000
compliance problem, etc.), in the longer termthe adaptation process should result in astronger and fitter EU banking sector.5.2The EU banking systems and
financial crises in emergingmarketsThe Asian financial crisis that erupted in themiddle of 1997 continued to burden the
international financial system in 1998.Moreover, a new wave of financial turbulencewas triggered in August 1998, when the
announcement by the Russian Governmentof a substantial devaluation of the rouble anda debt moratorium triggered a massive
ﬁcapital flightﬂ away from emerging marketsworld-wide. It also became apparent that thedebt servicing problems of the most severely
affected Asian countries (Thailand, Indonesia,South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines)and Russia, amplified by these countries™
worsening macroeconomic conditions, wouldtake time to be resolved and would be likelyto result in significant losses for international
creditor banks. Against this background, asystematic monitoring of the EU banks™exposure towards the countries in financial
crisis was carried out.Over the past few years, owing to significantincreases in lending, EU banks have becomethe largest group of international lenders toemerging or transition economies in Asia,
Latin America and central and eastern Europe.Since the outbreak of the Asian crisis, theexposure of EU banks towards Asia has
decreased significantly, partly reflecting creditwrite-offs, while exposure towards Russia andcountries in Latin America continued to grow
during the first half of 1998. On average, USbanks have been less exposed than EU banks,and Japanese banks have largely withdrawn
from international markets. A significantproportion of the exposure of EU bankstowards emerging markets has been of a
short-term nature and towards the localbanking systems. In general, the EU bankingsystems were in a position to withstand
possible losses deriving from the internationalcrisis because most of the exposure wasaccounted for by large, strong institutions
and the overall profitability of the EU bankingsystems had been positive over the past fewyears. The possible continuation or spread ofECB Annual Report Ł 1998112the international financial turbulence,however, continued to be a source ofuncertainty and risks.Several lessons have been learned from theseevents from a supervisory perspective. First,
further convergence of the rules on countryrisk provisioning is considered desirable, butthe obstacles to the pursuit of this objective
are fully recognised (particularly the absenceof harmonisation of accounting and taxationrules). Second, information on banks™ country
risks should be available to bankingsupervisors more frequently and in a moretimely manner. Third, credit institutions
should adopt, on a systematic basis, soundstandards for credit risk management,particularly in periods of a rapid accumulation
of exposure (as was the case in the emergingmarkets prior to the crises). Fourth, thepresent market risk management models
should be further refined with particularregard to the techniques for examining banks™exposure in the event of extreme market
movements. Recent experiences underlinethe importance of stress testing these models.5.3Macro-prudential analysis
Macro-prudential analysis addressing the
soundness of banking systems is consideredto be increasingly important in the light of
past systemic banking problems and therecent financial crises in emerging markets.An early diagnosis of systemic weakness in
the banking sector can substantially increasethe likelihood and success of corrective policyaction and lower the costs of financial
instability problems. Macro-prudential analysisis of benefit not only to NCBs, but alsoto supervisory authorities as it can help
supervisory resources to be allocated toareas that appear to involve growing risksand enable individual institutions that deviate
from general industry-wide practices to beidentified.First, the preliminary work conducted in thisarea focused on methodological aspects,including the role of the various authoritiesinvolved in the exercise. A key finding wasthat the analysis should be based on closeco-operation between supervisory authorities
and NCBs. Aggregated data collectedby supervisory authorities (supervisoryreporting) and data on the macroeconomic
situation and the financial system collectedby NCBs could be used. A number ofindicators relevant to the soundness of the
banking system can be identified from thesedata in a way that is not too formalised,whereas it has been recognised that
econometric work in this area is still quitescarce, although currently expanding.Second, the ways in which macro-prudentialanalysis of the stability of the EU bankingsystems could be carried out at the EU-wide
level were investigated. The advantages ofthis exercise are manifold. An EU-wideanalysis could, in the first instance, provide a
useful input into the work of nationalsupervisory authorities in assessing themarket conditions in which the supervised
institutions operate, especially those that areactive on a cross-border basis. Second, theanalysis would make it possible to better
understand the EU banks™ behaviour derivingfrom the common factors operating withinthe euro area (the single money market,
common interest rates, etc.). Third, theanalysis would permit a better assessment ofthe status of systemic risk, which will
progressively assume a euro area dimensionas financial markets in the euro area becomemore integrated.Against this background, it was agreed thatthe first steps towards a macro-prudential
analysis at the EU-wide level should be takenin 1999, with the co-operation of the EUsupervisory authorities, the NCBs and the
ECB.5.4Analysis of risk assessment
systemsWork has continued in the area of the riskassessment systems that are used by bankingsupervisors to identify, at an early stage,113ECB Annual Report Ł 1998credit institutions which may be facing aheightened risk of failure. The work entailedthe analysis of formalised risk assessment
systems already in operation or in the processof being developed by the EU bankingsupervisory authorities and the NCBs. This
activity focused mainly on an exchange ofinformation on the underlying principles and
the functioning of the systems. Thisco-operation is expected to continue in 1999.ECB Annual Report Ł 19981146Advisory functions
Article€105€(4) of the Treaty and Article€4 ofthe Statute of the ESCB require that theECB be consulted by the EU Council orthe responsible national authorities, as
appropriate, on any proposed Community ornational legislation within the ECB™s field ofcompetence. The limits and conditions
of consultations on draft legislation bynational authorities for the EMI were setout in Council Decision 93/717/EEC of
22 November 1993, which also applied tothe ECB under Article 109l€(2) in conjunctionwith Article 109f€(6) of the Treaty. Article€1
of this Decision states that: ﬁThe authoritiesof the Member States shall consult the EMIon any draft legislative provisions within its
field of competence pursuant to Article€109fof the Treaty and in particular on:Łcurrency legislation, the status of the euro
and means of payment;Łthe status and powers of national centralbanks and the instruments of monetarypolicy;Łthe collection, compilation anddissemination of monetary, financial,banking and balance of payments statistics;Łclearing and payment systems, in particularfor cross-border transactions;Łrules applicable to financial institutions
insofar as they influence the stability of
financial institutions and markets.ﬂAs from 1€January 1999 the ECB is consulted
under Council Decision 98/415/EC of 29€June1998, which contains provisions similar tothose of Council Decision 93/717/EEC of
22€November 1993.A total of 64 requests for the opinion ofthe EMI/ECB were received in 1998. Ofthe ensuing consultations, 16 concernedproposed Community legal acts and 46
concerned draft national legislative provisionsfalling within the field of competence ofthe EMI/ECB.1 Consultations concerning theadaptation of the statutes of NCBs to meetthe requirements of the Treaty, as well asothers on the introduction of and changeover
to the euro, were particularly relevant. Thebenchmark adopted by the EMI/ECB for theassessment of the proposed legislation was
its compatibility with the Treaty, the potentialimpact on the ESCB™s arrangements for StageThree of EMU and, where appropriate, the
stability of financial institutions and markets.Box 6 below summarises the consultationprocedures in which the EMI/ECB delivered

Treaty and the related Council Regulations(EC) Nos.€3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 104prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from
providing overdraft facilities or any other typeof credit facility to governments andCommunity institutions or bodies, as well as
from purchasing debt instruments directlyfrom them. Article 104a prohibits measures,not based on prudential considerations, which
establish privileged access by governmentsand Community institutions or bodies tofinancial institutions. During Stage Two of
EMU this monitoring exercise was initiatedby the EMI. As from 1 June 1998 the ECBcontinued to monitor the NCBs™ fulfilment oftheir obligations. The European Commissionmonitors Member States™ compliance with theabove provisions.In 1998 the NCBs of all Member Statescontinued to respect the Treaty
requirements.The ECB also monitors NCBs™ secondarymarket purchases of public sector debtinstruments. According to Council Regulation(EC) No.€3603/93, the acquisition of debt
instruments of the public sector in thesecondary market must not be used tocircumvent the objective of Article€104 of
the Treaty. The NCBs™ purchases during 1998were deemed to be in compliance with theTreaty.Chapter IVThe European Systemof Central Banks and theEurosystemECB Annual Report Ł 19981201Organisation of the ESCB and the Eurosystem
The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the15 NCBs. The NCBs of the Member Stateswhich are not participating in the euro areaare, however, members of the ESCB with a
special status: while they are allowed toconduct their respective national monetarypolicies, they do not take part in the decision-
making regarding the single monetary policyfor the euro area and the implementation ofsuch decisions. It is for this reason that the
Governing Council of the ECB decided, forthe sake of transparency and easy reference,to make a distinction between the ESCB and
the ﬁEurosystemﬂ, the latter being composedof the ECB and the 11 fully participating NCBsonly, as long as there are Member States
which have not yet adopted the euro.In accordance with the Treaty establishingthe European Community and the Statute ofthe European System of Central Banks and ofthe European Central Bank (which do not
make a formal distinction between the ESCBand the Eurosystem), the primary objective ofthe ESCB is to maintain price stability.Without prejudice to this objective, it shallsupport the general economic policies in theCommunity and act in accordance with the
principles of an open market economy.The basic tasks to be carried out by the ESCB,i.e. the Eurosystem, are:Łto define and implement the monetarypolicy of the Community;Łto conduct foreign exchange operations;Łto hold and manage the official foreign
reserves of the Member States; andŁto promote the smooth operation of
payment systems.The Treaty grants the ECB the exclusive right
to authorise the issuance of banknotes within
the Community. In addition, the ESCBcontributes to the smooth conduct of policiespursued by the competent authorities relating
to the prudential supervision of creditinstitutions and the stability of the financialsystem, while it also has an advisory rolevis-à-vis the Community and national
authorities on matters which fall within itsfield of competence, particularly whereCommunity or national legislation is
concerned. Finally, in order to undertake thetasks of the ESCB, the ECB, assisted by theNCBs, shall collect the necessary statistical
information either from the competentnational authorities or directly fromeconomic agents.The ESCB is governed by the decision-makingbodies of the ECB: the Governing Council
and the Executive Board. Without prejudiceto this, the General Council is constituted asa third decision-making body of the ECB, if
and for as long as there are Member Stateswith a derogation.The Governing Council, which is the supremedecision-making body of the ECB, comprisesall the members of the Executive Board and
the governors of the NCBs forming theEurosystem. The main responsibilities of theGoverning Council are:Łto adopt the guidelines and make the
decisions necessary to ensure the
performance of the tasks entrusted to theESCB; andŁto formulate the monetary policy of theCommunity, including, as appropriate,decisions relating to intermediatemonetary objectives, key interest rates
and the supply of reserves in theEurosystem, and to establish the necessaryguidelines for their implementation.The Executive Board comprises the President,the Vice-President and four other members,
all chosen from among persons of recognisedstanding and professional experience inmonetary or banking matters. They are
appointed by common accord of thegovernments of the participating  MemberStates at the level of the Heads of State or
Government, on a recommendation from theEU Council after it has consulted theEuropean Parliament and the Governing121ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Council of the ECB (the EMI Council wasconsulted on the initial appointments). Themain responsibilities of the Executive Board
are:Łto prepare the meetings of the Governing
Council;Łto implement monetary policy in
accordance with the guidelines and
decisions laid down by the GoverningCouncil and, in doing so, to give thenecessary instructions to the Eurosystem
NCBs; andŁto be responsible for the current business
of the ECB.The General Council comprises the Presidentand the Vice-President and the governors of
all the NCBs, i.e. of both participating andnon-participating Member States. TheGeneral Council performs the tasks which
the ECB took over from the EMI and which,owing to the derogation of one or moreMember States, still have to be performed in
the third stage. The General Council alsocontributes to particular activities of theESCB, such as the ESCB™s advisory functions
(see Box 6 in Chapter III), the collection ofstatistical information, and the necessarypreparations for irrevocably fixing the
exchange rates against the euro of thecurrencies of the Member States with aderogation.In accordance with Article€9 of the Rules ofProcedure of the ECB, the Governing Council
decided, in July 1998, to establish variousESCB Committees. These Committees arecomposed of experts from the NCBs and the
ECB. They play an important role in theperformance of the ESCB™s tasks and in intra-ESCB co-operation. They provide expertise
in their fields of competence and facilitatethe decision-making process of theESCB/ECB. At present there are 13 such
Committees: the Accounting and MonetaryIncome Committee, the Banking SupervisionCommittee, the Banknote Committee,
the Budget Committee, the ExternalCommunications Committee, the InformationTechnology Committee, the Internal AuditorsCommittee, the International RelationsCommittee, the Legal Committee, the MarketOperations Committee, the Monetary Policy
Committee, the Payment and SettlementSystems Committee and the StatisticsCommittee.The ESCB is an independent system. Whenperforming ESCB-related tasks, neither theECB, nor an NCB, nor any member of theirdecision-making bodies may seek or takeinstructions from Community institutions or
bodies, from any government of a MemberState or from any other body. TheCommunity institutions and bodies and the
governments of the Member States may notseek to influence the members of thedecision-making bodies of the ECB or of the
NCBs in the performance of their tasks. TheStatute of the ESCB makes provision for thefollowing measures to ensure security of
tenure for NCB governors and members ofthe Executive Board:Ła minimum term of office for governors
of five years;Ła non-renewable term of office formembers of the Executive Board of eightyears (it€should be noted that the Statuteof the ESCB provides for a system of
staggered appointments to the firstExecutive Board for members other thanthe President in order to ensure
continuity);Łremoval from office is only possible in the
event of incapacity or serious misconduct;
andŁthe European Court of Justice is
competent to settle any disputes.The capital of the ECB is E5,000 million. TheNCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders
of the capital of the ECB. The subscription ofcapital is based on a key established on thebasis of the 15 Member States™ respective
shares in the GDP and population of theCommunity. At its first meeting on 9 June1998 the Governing Council decided on the
method to be applied for determining theNCBs™ percentage shares in the key for theECB™s capital. The application of this methodECB Annual Report Ł 1998122has resulted in the shares of the 15 NCBsbeing determined with a level of precision offour decimal places. On the basis of the
revised GDP statistical data which becameavailable in November 1998, the ECB revisedthe capital key on 1€December 1998 with
retroactive effect from 1€June 1998 (seethe table below). Furthermore, the GoverningCouncil took a decision on the measures
necessary for the paying-up of the capital ofthe ECB. It was decided that the11€Eurosystem NCBs would pay up their
respective subscriptions to the ECB™s capitalin full according to the key established in thepreceding decision and that they would do so
by 1€June 1998. The General Council decidedthat the NCBs of the four non-participatingcountries would pay up 5% of their respectivesubscriptions to the ECB™s capital as a
contribution to the operational costs of theECB. As a result, the ECB is endowed withan initial capital of slightly under
E4,000€million.In addition, the Eurosystem NCBs were
required to provide the ECB with foreignreserve assets other than the relevant MemberStates™ currencies, euro, IMF reserve
positions and special drawing rights, up to anamount equivalent to E50,000 million (seeChapter II, Section 2.3).Table 15National central banks™ percentage shares in the key for the ECB™s capitalNationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique2.8658%

123ECB Annual Report Ł 19982Liquidation of the European Monetary Institute (EMI)
In accordance with Article 109l of the Treaty,the EMI went into liquidation on theestablishment of the ECB.The EMI was established on 1 January 1994pursuant to Article 109f of the Treaty. Theseat of the EMI was Frankfurt am Main.The EMI™s establishment marked the start ofthe second stage of EMU. Its objectives wereto contribute to the realisation of theconditions necessary for the transition to thethird stage of EMU.The two main tasks of the EMI were:Łto strengthen central bank co-operationand monetary policy co-ordination withthe aim of ensuring price stability; andŁto specify the regulatory, organisationaland logistical framework necessary for theESCB to perform its tasks in the third
stage of EMU.During the period of its operation€Œ between
January 1994 and May 1998 Œ the EMI, assistedby the NCBs, carried out an extensive
body of conceptual, detailed design andimplementation work for the establishmentof the ESCB. In publishing the report on ﬁThe
single monetary policy in Stage Three ŒSpecification of the operational frameworkﬂin January 1997, the EMI provided the public
and the counterparties of the NCBs withcomprehensive information of interestregarding the operational aspects of the single
monetary policy. Further publications onspecific aspects of the future activities of theEurosystem followed in the subsequent
months until the establishment of the ECB.The EMI was liquidated by the ECB inaccordance with the provisions of Article 23of the EMI Statute and Decision No.€10 ofthe EMI Council dated 5 May 1998. The
financial aspects of the liquidation of the EMIare described in detail in the notes to theannual accounts of the ECB; the final financial

Frankfurt am Main, 18 March 1999EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKWillem F. DuisenbergPresident129ECB Annual Report Ł 19981The establishment of the ECB
Pursuant to Article 4a of the Treatyestablishing the European Community, theECB was established on 1€June 1998. Inaccordance with Article 109l (2) of the
Treaty, and pursuant to Article 23 of the EMIStatute, the EMI went into liquidation uponthe establishment of the ECB. All assets and
liabilities of the EMI then passed automaticallyto the ECB, which proceeded to liquidate theEMI in accordance with the procedures laid
down in Decision 10/98 taken by the EMICouncil at its meeting on 5 May 1998. Theaudited final financial statements of the EMI
and the results of the liquidation are set outin the Annex to these Notes and constitutethe main element of the ECB™s opening
balance sheet.In accordance with the provisions ofArticle 28 of the Statute of the ESCB and itsDecision of 9€June€1998 (ECB/1998/2), theGoverning Council of the ECB determined
the extent to which the ECB™s subscribedcapital of E5 billion had to be paid up by thenational central banks of the Member Statesadopting the single currency (ﬁeuro areaNCBsﬂ). According to this Decision, the euroarea NCBs forming part of the Eurosystem
were required to pay up their subscriptionsin full. With its Decision of 1€December 1998(ECB/1998/14), the General Council of the
ECB determined that, pursuant to Article 48of the Statute of the ESCB, the non-euroarea NCBs were to pay up 5% of their
subscribed capital shares as a contribution tothe operational costs of the ECB. Allpayments became due as at 1€June€1998.The capital subscriptions are based on thekey established in accordance with Article 29
of the Statute of the ESCB and laid down inDecision ECB/1998/1 of the GoverningCouncil of 9€June€1998. An initial payment
was made by the NCBs as at 1€June 1998 inthe form of a transfer of their claims onthe ECB relating to the repayment of
contributions to the resources of the EMI, tothe extent possible or necessary to meet theamounts falling due. Further payments in cash,in various currencies, were made by the euro
area NCBs on 1 July 1998 up to the fullamounts calculated on the basis of aprovisional capital key. Settlement of the final
payments due was effected on 4 January 1999,in euro, taking into account: (a)€a revision ofthe capital key of the ECB, as made in
accordance with Decision ECB/1998/13 ofthe Governing Council on 1€December€1998,following the provision of final statistical
information by the European Commission;(b)€the distribution of the final loss of theEMI in accordance with the key for
subscription to the resources of the EMI; and(c)€interest due or payable on unsettledamounts for the period from 1€June€1998 to
4€January€1999.During the period under review, and inaccordance with Article 109l€(1) of theTreaty, the ECB prepared for full operationas from the start of Stage Three of EMU on
1 January 1999. The activities of the ECB in1998 were limited to the completion of thepreparations undertaken by the EMI, together
with the continuing administration of residualtasks taken over from the latter.Between 4 and 7 January 1999, in accordancewith the Decisions taken by the GoverningCouncil pursuant to Article 30 of the Statute
of the ESCB, the participating NCBstransferred foreign reserve assets to the ECBwith a total value equivalent to E39.5 billion;of these assets, E30.2€billion weretransferred in US€dollars, E5.9 billion in gold,and E3.4 billion in Japanese yen. Eachparticipating NCB transferred an amount ofeach of the three denominations of assetsbased on its share in the ECB™s capital key.
US€dollars and Japanese yen were transferredin the form of securities and cash. Theparticipating NCBs were credited with
non-redeemable euro-denominated claimsequivalent to their contributions. The ECBwill remunerate these claims of the NCBs at
a rate derived from the Eurosystem™s mainrefinancing rate.ECB Annual Report Ł 19981302Accounting policies
The accounting policies of the ECB weredefined by the Governing Council on1€December 19981 and are consistent withthe provisions of Article 26.4 of the Statuteof the ESCB, which require a standardisedapproach to the rules for the accounting andreporting of operations of the Eurosystem.
Although this Decision only came into forceon 1 January 1999, since the harmonisationof accounting rules within the Eurosystem
only applies from that date onwards, theaccounts for 1998 have been drawn up inaccordance with its provisions to the extent
that they are applicable to the ECB™s activitiesduring that period. In other cases, the similaraccounting policies of the EMI have been
applied (see the Annex). Material differencesarising from the limited variations betweenthese accounting policies are described in the
notes on the Balance Sheet and on the Profitand Loss Account. The Decision of theGoverning Council also specifies the format
and composition of the published BalanceSheet and Profit and Loss Account. Theprincipal elements of the accounting policies,
to the extent that they affect this financialstatement, are summarised below.During 1998 the accounts of the ECB weremaintained in official ECUs. As at the close ofbusiness on 31 December 1998, all values
were converted into euro at parity with theofficial ECU and the accounts, which alsorepresent the opening balance sheet of the
ECB on 1 January 1999,  are shown in euro.Although the ECB, as a body of the EuropeanCommunities, is not subject to national lawsand regulations on accounting practices, itsaccounting policies and those of the
Eurosystem as a whole follow accountingprinciples harmonised by Community law andgenerally accepted international accounting
standards, unless specific issues material tothe operations of the Eurosystem requireotherwise.The accounts have been prepared on a ﬁgoingconcernﬂ basis. Income and expenses arerecognised on an accruals basis. Transactions
in financial assets are recorded in the booksof the ECB using the cash (or ﬁsettlementﬂ)approach.Current market rates and prices are used forvaluing transactions. On-balance-sheet and
off-balance-sheet financial assets and liabilitiesare revalued as at the year-end using mid-market rates and prices. Revaluation is
performed on a code-by-code basis forsecurities, and on a currency-by-currencybasis for items denominated in foreign
exchange (including on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items).Tangible and intangible fixed assets are valuedat cost less depreciation. Depreciation iscalculated as follows on a straight-line basis,
beginning in the quarter after acquisition, overthe expected economic lifetime of an asset:ŁComputers, related hardware and
software, and motor vehicles: 4 yearsŁEquipment, furniture and plant in building:
10 yearsRealised gains and realised losses are taken
to the Profit and Loss Account. With theexception of the assets of the ECB™s pension
fund, unrealised gains arising from revaluationare not recognised as income, but aretransferred directly to a revaluation account.
Unrealised losses are taken to the Profit andLoss Account when exceeding previousrevaluation gains registered in the
corresponding revaluation account, and arenot reversed in subsequent years against newunrealised gains. Unrealised losses in one
security or currency are not netted againstunrealised gains in other securities orcurrencies. Valuation gains and losses arising
on assets of the pension fund are recognisedas income in the year in which they arise.1ECB Decision of 1 December 1998, a copy of which is available

ECB Annual Report Ł 19981323Notes on the Balance Sheet
Assets1.Claims on non-euro area residents
denominated in foreign currencyThis item consists almost entirely of six-month deposits in pounds sterling and Danish
kroner, which matured on 5 January 1999,the date on which these holdings were sold.(The sterling holdings were sold forward
during December; the results of thesetransactions appear as off-balance-sheetitems.) The deposits were effected at the
beginning of July, when a portion of the fundstransferred in respect of payments of thecapital of the ECB was converted into these
currencies in order to hedge the ECB™sexposure against foreign exchange risk onsubstantial holdings of cash in euro area
currencies pending the determination ofthe irrevocable exchange rates of thesecurrencies against the euro on 31€December
1998. This hedging operation was of anexceptional nature.From 4 January 1999 this position in thebalance sheet has included the cash andsecurities of an initial value of E33.6 billion,as transferred to the ECB by the NCBsas part of the transfer of foreign reserveassets.2.Claims on non-euro area residents
denominated in euroThis position may include current accountand fixed-term deposits, day-to-day money,securities, and loans denominated in euro duefrom residents outside the euro area. The
amounts shown under this item representthe investment of the bulk of the payments ofcapital subscriptions of the ECB received in
1998, together with other working balances.These funds were held in private ECUs andother national currencies of the euro area,
mainly in the form of six-month deposits withthe Bank for International Settlementsmaturing on 5 January 1999, pending theconversion of these currencies into euro at
the rates fixed on the afternoon of31€December 1998. Interest on thesedeposits provided the ECB™s principal source
of income during 1998. No securities wereheld as at 31 December 1998 and no loanswere made during the year.3.Other assets
This item consists of the following majorelements:Tangible and intangible fixed assetsNet of cumulative depreciation totallingE18.6 million (including depreciation duringthe lifetime of the EMI), tangible and intangiblefixed assets comprised the following mainitems on 31€December 1998:EComputers and relatedhardware and software12,510,812
Equipment, furniture, plant inbuilding and motor vehicles3,329,884
Assets under construction(premises refurbishment)11,864,257
Other tangible assets2,407,118
Total30,112,071
Other financial assetsThe principal item under this heading consistsof the assets of the pension fund for ECB
staff (E17.1 million). The assets representthe counterpart of accumulated pension
contributions by the ECB invested as at
31 December 1998 and managed by anexternal funds manager on behalf of the ECB,to whom the corresponding funds were
transferred in December 1998. The assetsinvested include funds arising fromcontributions made by and on behalf of staff
of the EMI who have subsequently transferredto the ECB and have chosen to transfer theiraccumulated EMI benefits to the new scheme.133ECB Annual Report Ł 1998The assets of the fund are not fungible withother financial assets of the ECB. Net incomeon these assets does not constitute income
of the ECB, but is reinvested in the fundsconcerned pending payment of benefits. Thevalue of the assets held is based on the
valuation by the funds manager using year-end market prices. Valuation gains and lossesare recognised in the year in which they arise.As at end-1998 ﬁOther financial assetsﬂincluded claims on certain NCBs totalling
E8 million, in respect of additional capitalsubscriptions to be paid up as a consequence
of the establishment of the definitive capital
key of the ECB on 1€December 1998. Theseclaims were settled on 4€January€1999.Accruals, deferred expenditure and sundry itemsThe principal item is a claim against theGerman Federal Ministry of Finance in respectof recoverable value added and other indirecttaxes paid on goods and services. Such taxes
are refundable under the terms of Article 3of the Protocol on the privileges andimmunities of the European Communities,
which applies to the ECB by virtue ofArticle 40 of the Statute of the ESCB.Liabilities1.Intra-ESCB liabilities
The item, which stood at nil at the end of1998, relates to positions that will arisebetween the ECB and the euro area NCBs asfrom the start of Stage Three. Intra-ESCB
balances arise principally as a result of cross-border payments via the TARGET system. Inaddition, this heading will include the liabilities
of the ECB to the euro area NCBs in respectof the transfer of foreign exchange reserveassets (E39.5 billion), as described underasset item 1 above.2.Other liabilities

of those NCBs to the capital of the ECB andto their share of the EMI™s final loss; and tocertain euro area NCBs in respect of
downward adjustments in their subscribedcapital. These liabilities were settled on4 January 1999.Also included under this heading are amountsdue to creditors and suppliers, and liabilities
in respect of income tax deducted at sourcefrom ECB staff salaries pending its transfer tothe European Communities.3.Provisions

euro area NCBs. The non-euro area NCBsare not required to pay up any capitalsubscriptions beyond the amounts already
decided until such time as they join theEurosystem. In the meantime these NCBsare not entitled to receive any share of
the distributable profits of the ECB, nor arethey liable to fund any losses of the ECB.6.Profit for the year
See ﬁNotes on the Profit and Loss Accountﬂ.135ECB Annual Report Ł 19984Notes on the Profit and Loss Account
Interest incomeIncome of E95.1 million was received,principally on the six-month deposits in whichthe bulk of the ECB™s liquid assets wereplaced at the beginning of July. Furtherinterest income of E2.5 million was receivedon interest-bearing current accounts in whichworking cash balances were held in order tomeet the ECB™s day-to-day liquidity
requirements. Interest of E0.2 million wasdue on deferred payments of capital
subscriptions from participating NCBs.Interest expensesThese include interest due to non-participating NCBs on the deferredrepayment of their net contributions to the
resources of the EMI, after deduction ofamounts used towards the payment of theircapital subscriptions to the ECB, and accrued
premium costs of forward sales of foreigncurrency.Realised gains/losses arising from financialoperationsThe realised gain arose following theconversion into euro, at the irrevocable fixedrates against the euro, of assets and liabilities
denominated in the national currencies of theeuro area Member States.Write-downs on financial assets and positionsAn unrealised loss arose on the sterlingposition taken up as the major part of thehedge against holdings of national currenciesof the euro area countries pending the fixing
of the corresponding exchange rates againstthe euro.Other incomeMiscellaneous income under this headingarose mainly from the release of unusedprovisions taken over from the EMI.Staff costsThis item includes salaries and allowances(E22.2 million), and employer™s contributionsto the ECB™s pension fund and to health andaccident insurance. The emoluments of themembers of the Executive Board of the ECBamounted to a total of E1,019,436.00 for theperiod 1 June to 31€December 1998. Salaries
and allowances of staff, including emoluments
of holders of senior management positions,are modelled in essence on, and arecomparable to, the remuneration scheme of
the European Communities.On the last working day of 1998 the ECBemployed 534 staff, including 54 who heldmanagerial positions. The average number ofstaff employed by the ECB in the period from
1 June to 31€December 1998 was 478,compared with 370 employed by the EMIfrom 1 January to 31€May€1998. 402 EMI staff
transferred to the ECB on 1€June 1998; 375of these subsequently accepted contracts withthe ECB extending beyond the end of 1998.
151 additional staff had been recruited bythe end of the year, 19 members of staff leftthe service during the period and the
contracts of a further 10 staff terminated on31 December 1998.Other administrative expensesThese cover all other current expenses, viz.rental of premises, maintenance of premisesand equipment, goods and equipment of anon-capital nature, professional fees and
other services and supplies, together withthe expenses involved in the recruitment,relocation, installation, training and
resettlement of staff.Depreciation of (in)tangible fixed assets
According to the ECB™s accounting rules,expenditure on single items costing less than
E10,000, excluding VAT, is written off withina year of acquisition. According to the
accounting rules of the EMI, the lower valueECB Annual Report Ł 1998136limit for the capitalisation of tangible assetsfor more than one year was ECU€1,000. TheECB rule has been applied to the residual
book values of tangible assets taken over fromthe EMI with an original purchase cost ofbelow ECU 10,000. As a result, the remaining
undepreciated book value of those assets,amounting to E4.3 million, has been writtenoff. The depreciation on high value assets, ofE2.7 million, includes depreciation on suchassets taken over from the EMI and on assets
acquired subsequently by the ECB.Profit appropriationPursuant to Article 33.1 of the Statute of theESCB, the net profit of the ECB shall betransferred in the following order:(a)an amount to be determined by the
Governing Council, which may not exceed20% of the net profit, shall be transferredto the general reserve fund subject to alimit equal to 100% of the capital;(b)the remaining net profit shall be
distributed to the shareholders of the ECB
in proportion to their paid-up shares.For the purposes of the above, by virtue of
Article 43.5 of the Statute of the ESCB,
ﬁshareholdersﬂ shall be read as ﬁcentral banksof Member States without a derogationﬂ.In accordance with these provisions, theGoverning Council decided on 18€March 1999to transfer an amount of E5,508,000.00 tothe general reserve fund of the ECB. Takingaccount of the fact that the ECB would, as aconsequence, be left with a very small general
reserve for the first year of its full operationalexistence, the Governing Council furtherdecided that the remaining net profit,
amounting to E22,032,512.55, should beretained and carried forward as undistributed
profit.137ECB Annual Report Ł 1998President and Governing Councilof the European Central BankFrankfurt am MainWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of the European Central Bank as at31€December€1998.

In accordance with Article 23 of its Statute,the EMI went into liquidation on theestablishment of the ECB on 1€June€1998.The final financial statements of the EMI
therefore represent the position as at closeof business on 31 May 1998.Also in accordance with Article€23 of itsStatute, all assets and liabilities of the EMIpassed automatically to the ECB on the
latter™s establishment and will be reflectedin the ECB™s financial statements for theyear ended 31€December 1998, with the
exception of EMS-related claims andliabilities, which will have been unwound bythat date.The procedure for liquidating the EMI was laiddown in Decision No.€10/98 of the Council of
the EMI on 5€May 1998. In accordance withthis procedure, the final operating loss of the
EMI is offset against the contributions whichthe national central banks had made to theresources of the EMI under Article 16 of the
Statute in 1994 and 1995.On 4 January 1999, the ECB will repay tothe national central banks their contributionsmade to the resources of the EMI underArticle 16 of its Statute, less their respective
shares of the final operating loss, and lessamounts used by the national central banksto pay up their contributions to the
subscribed capital of the ECB on 1€June 1998.Net amounts remaining due to the nationalcentral banks will be remunerated by the
ECB for the period between itsestablishment and the date of therepayments. Repayment will be effected in
euro, at parity with the ECU.ECB Annual Report Ł 19981422Accounting policies
The final accounts of the EMI have beendrawn up in accordance with accountingprinciples established by the Council of theEMI pursuant to Article 17.3 of its Statute,
and are expressed in official ECUs.Although the EMI, as a body of the EuropeanCommunities, was not subject to nationallaws and regulations on accountingpractices, its accounting policies followed
internationally accepted accountingprinciples, unless specific EMI issues requiredotherwise.Notwithstanding the fact that these are thefinal statements of the EMI, the accounts
have been prepared on a ﬁgoing concernﬂbasis, reflecting the automaticity of thetransfer of its assets and liabilities to the
ECB.EMS-related assets and liabilities are shownat cost. Short-term discount securities areshown at cost plus accrued interest.Securities, other than short-term discount
securities and financial fixed assets, areshown at year-end market value. Financialfixed assets are shown at acquisition cost
less any provision for a permanentdiminution in value. All other financial assetsand liabilities are shown at nominal value.Tangible assets are valued at cost lessdepreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis, beginning in the quarterafter acquisition, over the expected
economic lifetime of an asset, namely:ŁEquipment, furniture and plant in building:10 yearsŁComputers, related hardware, software
and vehicles: 4 yearsApart from EMS-related assets and liabilities,foreign currency translation of balance sheetitems into ECUs is based on the official ratespublished by the European Commission
applying at 31€May 1998 or, otherwise, onclosing market rates for that date. Foreigncurrency transactions reflected in the Profit
and Loss Account are valued at the averageof daily official rates for the period 1 January1998 to 31 May 1998.Income and expenses are recognised on anaccruals basis. Unrealised gains arising from
the revaluation of assets vis-à-vis thepurchase price are not normally recognisedas income but taken into a revaluation
account. For the purposes of the finalstatements, however, the Council of the EMIdecided that any unrealised gains should be
treated as income.In accordance with Article€17.4 of theStatute, the Council of the EMI appointedC&L Deutsche Revision as independentexternal auditors of the EMI™s final financial
statements.143ECB Annual Report Ł 19983Notes on the Balance Sheet
1.EMS-related assets and liabilities
These items relate to the three-monthrevolving swaps of official ECUs created in
exchange for EU central banks™ contributionsto the EMI of 20% of their gold and US dollarreserves. The respective assets and liabilities
are shown in the EMI™s books. The entries donot imply any interest payments or receiptsby the EMI. Interest on official reserves
swapped for ECUs continued to accrue tothe underlying owners. Interest on ECUholdings arising out of swaps only became
due where a central bank™s holdings exceededits forward ECU liabilities; in such cases,payments were covered by interest due from
central banks whose forward liabilities inECUs exceeded their holdings of ECUs. Allswaps outstanding at 31€May€1998 will be
wound up by 31€December 1998.2.Other assets
Cash and bank sight accountsWorking cash balances were held on acurrent account in Deutsche Mark, in whichcurrency almost all of the EMI™s day-to-day
transactions were payable. This account wasused exclusively to deal with payments andreceipts relating to the day-to-day
administration of the EMI. Other cashbalances were held on a one-day noticeinterest-bearing account in Deutsche Mark,
on a two-day notice account in ECUs or wereinvested from time to time in Treasury billsof the Federal Republic of Germany. No such
securities were held as at 31€May€1998.Time deposits
ECU€597.2 million of the resourcescontributed by the EU central banks pursuant
to Article€16.2 of the Statute of the EMI wasplaced in time deposits in January 1995 at afixed term of three years to generate the
income deemed necessary to cover the EMI™sadministrative expenses. These deposits,which constituted a financial fixed asset ofthe EMI, matured on 30€December€1997. Part
of the proceeds was converted into DeutscheMark in January in order to provide a liquiditybuffer which was invested in fixed deposits
with terms of up to five months. Theremainder of the proceeds was similarlyinvested in fixed deposits.Tangible assetsNet of cumulative depreciation of ECU€10.5million these comprised, at record date:ECU19981997Special installations1,722,762

equipment within the EMI™s premises in theEurotower building in Frankfurt am Mainrequired to meet its particular operational
needs, to the extent that these costs wereborne by the EMI. The ECB continues tooccupy these premises. The asset values of
computers and software increasedsubstantially as the installation of ECB andESCB systems progressed.Other assetsThis item principally includes a claim against
the German Federal Ministry of Finance in
respect of recoverable value added and otherindirect taxes paid on goods and services.Such taxes are refundable under the terms of
Article 3 of the Protocol on the privilegesand immunities of the EuropeanCommunities, which also applied to the EMI
by virtue of Article€21 of its Statute.ECB Annual Report Ł 19981443.Other liabilities
Creditors and other liabilitiesThis item principally comprises payments dueto suppliers, together with performance
payments due to EMI staff, income taxdeducted at source from salaries pendingpayover to the European Communities, and
accumulated pension contributions withinterest thereon repayable to staff. Membersof the staff contributed to the pension scheme
a percentage of their basic salary (matchedby a contribution of twice that amount bythe EMI); the staff contribution is repayable
by the ECB at the termination of theemployment contract with the EMI togetherwith accrued interest thereon, unless a
member of the EMI staff has transferred tothe ECB and has elected to use thecontribution in order to enhance his/her ECB
pension rights.Provision for pensions and similar obligationsThis item comprises the accumulated
contributions of the EMI towards the staff
pension scheme. These contributions wererequired to cover the eventual cost ofseverance grants and any ill-health pensions,
which are now the liability of the ECB.Other provisionsThese comprise provisions for the restoration
of the EMI™s premises at the end of its lease
(which has been assigned to the ECB); foroffice rental and service charge paymentsoutstanding in respect of the year to 31 May
1998; for building work in progress; forcompensation in lieu of annual leave not takenby EMI staff; and for the production of the
final accounts of the EMI. A provision ofECU€4.6€million was made, representing thebulk of a payment received by the EMI fromits landlords in recognition of the EMI™sagreement to waive its rights to earlytermination of its lease on the Eurotower.
The amount set aside is earmarkedcontractually for use in funding futureconstruction work on the ECB™s premises.Contributions from EU central banksThese represent the contributions madepursuant to Article 16.2 of the Statute by theEU central banks, as detailed below. The
remaining loss for 1998 has been allocatedagainst these contributions, after being offsetagainst the general reserve fund, in

Interest income was significantly reduced dueto the substantial decline in interest ratessince January 1995, when the bulk of the
EMI™s resources were invested at a term ofthree years.ExpensesStaff costsThis item relates to salaries and€allowances(ECU 12.8 million), and to employer™s
contributions to pensions and health andaccident insurance (ECU€2.1€million), inrespect of staff employed by the EMI. Salaries
and allowances of staff, including emolumentsof holders of senior management positions,were modelled in essence on, and are
comparable to, the remuneration scheme ofthe European Communities.The average number of permanent staffemployed from 1 January to 31 May 1998was 370, compared with 281 for 1997. During
1998 78 permanent staff were recruited and5 staff ceased to be employed. Most EMI staffcontracts were due to expire at the end of
1998. By the date on which these statementswere drawn up, 322 permanent staff hadtransferred to the ECB under new contracts.Number of staffStaff31 May 1998

expenses involved in recruitment, relocation,installation and resettlement of staff.Extraordinary income and valuation gainsExtraordinary incomeThis item represents extraordinary incomearising for instance from the release of
provisions made in previous years in respectof anticipated expenditure arising in thoseyears that are no longer required.Valuation gains realised at liquidationIn accordance with the decision of the EMICouncil, gains arising on the valuation ofassets, which arose due to the increases in
value of the private ECU and the DeutscheMark against the official ECU, have beenrecognised as income in the final financial
statements.Allocation of deficit
Pursuant to Article 17.6 of the Statute of theEMI, the deficit has been offset against the
general reserve fund of the EMI. Theremaining deficit represents a claim againstthe national central banks which participated
in the EMI. In accordance with the decisionof the EMI Council, this claim will be settledon 4€January 1999, in euro at parity with the
ECU, by deducting the respective shares ofthe loss from the repayments of contributionsto the EMI™s resources due from the ECB to
the national central banks on that date.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998146President and Governing Councilof the European Central BankFrankfurt am MainWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of the European Monetary Instituteas at 31€May 1998. The EMI went into liquidation on the establishment of the EuropeanCentral Bank. Its Management is responsible for the preparation of the accounts. It is our
responsibility to form an independent opinion on these accounts based on our audit, and toreport our opinion to you.We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing. An auditincludes examinations, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosuresin the accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies areappropriate to the European Monetary Institute™s circumstances and adequately disclosed.In our opinion, the financial statements, which have been prepared under accountingpolicies set out in Section 2 of the notes on the accounts of the European MonetaryInstitute, give a true and fair view of the financial position of the European Monetary
Institute at 31 May 1998 and the results of its operations for the period 1 January to31€May 1998.Frankfurt am Main, 14 October 1998

Bilateral procedures includeoperations executed through stock exchanges or market agents.Central securities depository (CSD): an entity which holds securities and which enablessecurities transactions to be processed by book entry. Physical securities may be immobilised bythe depository or securities may be dematerialised (i.e. so that they exist only as electronic
records). In addition to safekeeping, a central securities depository may incorporate comparison,clearing and settlement functions.Collateral: assets pledged as a guarantee for the repayment of the short-term liquidity loanswhich credit institutions receive from the central banks, as well as assets received by centralbanks from credit institutions as part of repurchase operations.Convergence criteria: criteria established in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty (and developedfurther in Protocol No. 6). They relate both to performance with regard to price stability,government financial positions, exchange rates and long-term interest rates, and to thecompatibility of national legislation, including the statutes of national central banks, with the Treatyand the Statute of the ESCB. The reports produced under Article 109j (1) by the EuropeanCommission and the EMI examined the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergenceby reference to the fulfilment of these criteria by each Member State.Convergence programmes: medium-term government plans and assumptions provided bynon-participating Member States regarding the development of key economic variables towardsthe achievement of the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in
surplus as referred to in the Stability and Growth Pact. Regarding budgetary positions,measures to consolidate fiscal balances as well as underlying economic scenarios are highlighted.
Convergence programmes must be updated annually. They are examined by the EuropeanCommission and the Economic and Financial Committee. Their reports serve as the basisfor an assessment by the ECOFIN Council, focusing, in particular, on whether the medium-termbudgetary objective in the programme provides for a sufficient safety margin to ensure the
avoidance of an excessive deficit. Countries participating in the euro area must submit annualstability programmes, in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact.Correspondent banking: an arrangement under which one bank provides payment and otherservices to another bank. Payments through correspondents are often executed throughreciprocal accounts (nostro and loro accounts), to which standing credit lines may be attached.
Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across international boundaries but arealso known as agency relationships in some domestic contexts. A loro account is the term used bya correspondent to describe an account held on behalf of a foreign bank; the foreign bank would in
turn regard this account as its nostro account.Correspondent central banking model (CCBM): a model established by the ESCB with theaim of enabling counterparties to use underlying assets in a cross-border context. In the CCBM,national central banks act as custodians for each other. This implies that each national central bankhas a securities account in its securities administration for each of the other national central banks
(and for the ECB).153ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Counterparty: the opposite party in a financial transaction (e.g. any transaction with the centralbank).Credit institution: refers to an institution covered by the definition contained in Article I of theFirst Banking Co-ordination Directive (77/780/EEC), i.e. ﬁan undertaking whose business is toreceive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credit for its own accountﬂ.Current transfers: government transfers to enterprises, households and the rest of the world,net of transfers received from the rest of the world, that are not related to capital expenditure;they comprise, among other operations, production and import subsidies, social benefits andtransfers to EC institutions.Deficit-debt adjustment: the difference between the government deficit and the change ingovernment debt. Among other reasons, this may be due to changes in the amount of financialassets held by the government, a change in government debt held by other government sub-sectors
or statistical adjustments.Debt ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria laid down in TreatyArticle€104c€(2). It is defined as ﬁthe ratio of government debt to gross domestic product atcurrent market pricesﬂ, where government debt is defined in Protocol No. 5 (on the excessivedeficit procedure) as ﬁtotal gross debt at nominal value outstanding at the end of the year andconsolidated between and within the sectors of general governmentﬂ. General government is asdefined in the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts.Deficit ratio: the subject of one of the fiscal convergence criteria named in TreatyArticle€104c€(2). Defined as ﬁthe ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domesticproductﬂ at current market prices, where the government deficit is defined in Protocol No. 5 (onthe excessive deficit procedure) as ﬁnet borrowing of the general governmentﬂ. Generalgovernment is as defined in the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts.Delivery versus payment system (or DVP, delivery against payment): a mechanism in asecurities settlement system that ensures that the final transfer of one asset occurs if, and onlyif, the final transfer of (an)other asset(s) occurs. Assets could include securities or other financialinstruments.Deposit facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties may use tomake overnight deposits at the central bank which are remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate.
EBA (since December 1997 the Euro Banking Association, formerly the ECU BankingAssociation): an interbank organisation which is intended to be the forum for exploring anddebating all issues of interest to its members and, in particular, matters pertaining to the use of the
euro and the settlement of transactions in euro. Within the EBA, a clearing company (ABEClearing, Société par Actions Simplifiée à capital variable) has been established with the purpose ofmanaging the Euro Clearing System as from 1 January 1999. The Euro Clearing System (Euro 1) isthe successor system to the ECU Clearing and Settlement System.ECB (European Central Bank): the ECB has legal personality. It ensures that the tasksconferred upon the Eurosystem and the ESCB are implemented either by its own activitiespursuant to its Statute or through the national central banks.
ECOFIN: see EU Council.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998154Economic and Financial Committee: a consultative Community body set up at the start ofStage Three, when the Monetary Committee was dissolved. The Member States, theEuropean Commission and the ECB each appoint no more than two members of theCommittee. Article€109c€(2) of the Treaty contains a list of the tasks of the Economic andFinancial Committee, including the review of the economic and financial situation of the MemberStates and of the Community.Economic and Monetary Union (EMU): the Treaty describes the process of achievingEconomic and Monetary Union in the European Union in three stages. Stage One of EMU started inJuly 1990 and ended on 31€December 1993; it was mainly characterised by the dismantling of allinternal barriers to the free movement of capital within the European Union. Stage Two of EMUbegan on 1€January 1994. It provided, inter alia, for the establishment of the European MonetaryInstitute (EMI), the prohibition of monetary financing of and privileged access to financialinstitutions for the public sector and the avoidance of excessive deficits. Stage Three started on1€January 1999 in accordance with the decision pursuant to Article 109j (4) of the Treaty, with thetransfer of monetary competence to the Eurosystem and the introduction of the euro.ECU (European Currency Unit): according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 3320/94 of20€December 1994, the ECU was a basket made up of the sum of fixed amounts of 12 out of the
15 currencies of the Member States. The value of the ECU was calculated as a weighted average ofthe value of its component currencies. As the official ECU it served, inter alia, as the numeraire of
the ERM and as a reserve asset for central banks. Official ECUs were created by the EMI throughthree-month swap operations against one-fifth of the US€dollar and gold assets held by the 15
EU€national central banks. Private ECUs were ECU-denominated financial instruments (e.g. bank
deposits or securities) based on contracts which, as a rule, made reference to the official ECU. Theﬁtheoreticalﬂ value of the private ECU was defined on the basis of the value of the individual
components of the ECU basket. However, the use of the private ECU was different from that of
the official ECU and, in practice, the market value of the private ECU could diverge from itsﬁtheoreticalﬂ basket value. Following Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1103/97 of 17 June1997 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro, the private ECU was replaced
by the euro on 1€January 1999 on a one-to-one basis. The official ECU ceased to exist with thetermination of the swap mechanism at the start of Stage Three of EMU.Effective (nominal/real) exchange rates: in their nominal version, effective exchange ratesconsist of a weighted average of various bilateral exchange rates. Real effective exchange rates arenominal effective exchange rates deflated by a weighted average of foreign prices or costs relative
to domestic ones. They are thus measures of a country™s price and cost competitiveness. The euroarea nominal effective exchange rate referred to in this Report is based on BIS calculations. Thefigures are a weighted average of the euro area countries™ effective exchange rates. The weights
are based on 1990 manufactured goods trade, capture third-market effects and refer toextra-euro area trade. The real effective exchange rate for the euro area is derived usingnational CPIs.Electronic money (e-money): an electronic store of monetary value on a technical device thatmay be widely used for making payments to undertakings other than the issuer without necessarilyinvolving bank accounts in the transaction, but as a prepaid bearer instrument (see also multi-purpose prepaid card).EMI (European Monetary Institute): the EMI was a temporary institution established at thestart of Stage Two of EMU (on 1 January 1994). The EMI had no responsibility for the conduct ofmonetary policy in the European Union, which remained the preserve of the national authorities.155ECB Annual Report Ł 1998The two main tasks of the EMI were: (1) to strengthen central bank co-operation and monetarypolicy co-ordination; and (2) to make the preparations required for the establishment of theEuropean System of Central Banks (ESCB) for the conduct of the single monetary policy andfor the creation of a single currency in the third stage. It went into liquidation on 1 June 1998.EMS (European Monetary System): established in 1979 in accordance with the Resolution ofthe European Council on the establishment of the EMS and related matters of 5€December1978. The Agreement of 13 March 1979 between the central banks of the Member States of theEuropean Economic Community laid down the operating procedures for the EMS. The objective
was to create closer monetary policy co-operation between Community countries, leading to azone of monetary stability in Europe. The main components of the EMS were the ECU; theexchange rate and intervention mechanism (ERM); and various credit mechanisms. Thismechanism ceased to exist with the start of Stage Three of EMU.EMU: see Economic and Monetary Union.ERM (exchange rate mechanism): the exchange rate and intervention mechanism of the EMSdefined the exchange rate of participating currencies in terms of a central rate vis-à-vis the ECU.These central rates were used to establish a grid of bilateral exchange rates between participating
currencies. Exchange rates were allowed to fluctuate around bilateral central rates within theERM fluctuation margins. In August 1993 the decision was taken to widen the fluctuation marginsto ±15%. Pursuant to a bilateral agreement between Germany and the Netherlands, fluctuationmargins between the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch guilder were maintained at ±2.25%.Adjustments of central rates were subject to mutual agreement between all countries participating
in the ERM (see also realignment). This mechanism ceased to exist with the start of Stage Threeof EMU.ERM II: as from 1 January 1999 the successor exchange rate arrangement to the ERM, whichprovides the framework for exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area andMember States not participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three. Membership of the
mechanism is voluntary. Nevertheless, Member States with a derogation can be expected to jointhe mechanism. Currently, the Danish krone and the Greek drachma participate in ERM€II with afluctuation band around the central rate against the euro of ±2.25% and ±15% respectively.ESCB (European System of Central Banks): the ESCB is composed of the ECB and thenational central banks of all 15 Member States, i.e. it includes, in addition to the members of the
Eurosystem, the national central banks of the Member States which did not adopt the euro atthe start of Stage Three of EMU. The ESCB is governed by the Governing Council and theExecutive Board of the ECB. A third decision-making body of the ECB is the General Council.EU Council: a body made up of representatives of the governments of the Member States,normally the Ministers responsible for the matters under consideration (therefore often referred
to as the Council of Ministers). The EU Council meeting in the composition of the Ministers ofFinance and Economy is often referred to as the ECOFIN Council. In addition, the EU Council maymeet in the composition of the Heads of State or Government. See also European Council.Euro: the name of the European currency adopted by the European Council at its meeting inMadrid on 15 and 16€December 1995 and used instead of the generic term ECU employed in theTreaty.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998156Euro area: the area encompassing those Member States in which the euro has been adopted asthe single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy isconducted under the responsibility of the relevant decision-making bodies of the ECB. The euroarea comprises Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,Austria, Portugal and Finland.European Commission: the institution of the European Community which ensures theapplication of the provisions of the Treaty, takes initiatives for Community policies, proposesCommunity legislation and exercises powers in specific areas. In the area of economic policy, theCommission recommends broad guidelines for economic policies in the Community and reports tothe EU Council on economic developments and policies. It monitors public finances in theframework of multilateral surveillance and submits reports to the Council. It consists of 20members and includes two nationals from Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom,and one from each of the other Member States. Eurostat is the Directorate General of theCommission responsible for the production of Community statistics through the collection andsystematic processing of data, produced mainly by the national authorities, within the framework ofcomprehensive five-yearly Community statistical programmes.European Council: provides the European Union with the necessary impetus for itsdevelopment and defines the general political guidelines thereof. It brings together the Heads ofState or Government of the Member States and the President of the European Commission(see also EU Council).European Parliament: consists of 626€representatives of the citizens of the Member States. It isa part of the legislative process, though with different prerogatives according to the proceduresthrough which EU law is to be enacted. In the framework of EMU, the Parliament has mainlyconsultative powers. However, the Treaty establishes certain procedures for the democraticaccountability of the ECB to the Parliament (presentation of the annual report, general debate onthe monetary policy, hearings before the competent parliamentary committees).European System of Integrated Economic Accounts (ESA, second edition, 1979): asystem of uniform statistical definitions and classifications aimed at a coherent quantitativedescription of the economies of the Member States. The ESA is the Community™s version of the
United Nations™ revised System of National Accounts. The respective definitions are, inter alia, thebasis for calculating the fiscal convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty. The EuropeanSystem of Accounts (ESA 95) is the new system of national accounts of the EU and will beimplemented as from April 1999, replacing the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts.Eurostat: see European Commission.Eurosystem: comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States which haveadopted the euro in Stage Three of EMU (see also euro area). There are currently 11 nationalcentral banks in the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is governed by the Governing Council and theExecutive Board of the ECB.Excessive deficit procedure: the Treaty provision (defined in Article 104c and specified inProtocol No.€5) that requires Member States to maintain budgetary discipline, defines theconditions which must prevail for a budgetary position to be judged satisfactory and regulates the
steps to be taken should these conditions not be fulfilled. In particular, the fiscal convergencecriteria (government deficit ratio and debt ratio) are specified; the procedure which may resultfrom the EU Council™s decision that an excessive deficit exists in a certain Member State is157ECB Annual Report Ł 1998described; and further steps to be taken in the event that an excessive deficit situation persists areidentified. The Stability and Growth Pact includes further provisions aimed at speeding up andclarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure.Executive Board: one of the decision-making bodies of the ECB. It comprises the President, theVice-President and four other members appointed by the Heads of State or Government of theMember States which have adopted the euro.Fine-tuning operation: a non-regular open market operation executed by the central bankmainly in order to deal with unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market.Foreign exchange swap: two simultaneous spot and forward transactions of one currencyagainst another. The Eurosystem may execute open market monetary policy operations in theform of foreign exchange swaps where the national central banks (or the ECB) buy (or sell) eurospot against a foreign currency and at the same time sell it (or buy it back) forward.
Funded and unfunded pensions: a funded pension scheme is one in which pensioncommitments are covered by real or financial assets, as opposed to an unfunded, or pay-as-you-go,form of pension scheme, in which the current contributions of employers and employees are usedto pay current pensions directly.Funds transfer system (FTS): a formal arrangement, based on private contract or statute law,with multiple membership, common rules and standardised arrangements, for the transmission andsettlement of money obligations arising between the members.General Council: one of the governing bodies of the ECB. It comprises the President and theVice-President of the ECB and the governors of all 15 EU national central banks.
General government: consists of central government, regional or local government and socialsecurity funds, as defined in the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts.Governing Council: one of the governing bodies of the ECB. It comprises all the members ofthe Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the national central banks of the MemberStates which have adopted the euro.Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): Protocol No. 6 on the convergencecriteria referred to in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty requires price convergence to be measuredby means of the consumer price index on a comparable basis, taking into account differences innational definitions. Although current consumer price statistics in the Member States are largely
based on similar principles, there are considerable differences of detail and these affect thecomparability of the national results. In order to fulfil the Treaty requirement, the EuropeanCommission (Eurostat), in close liaison with the national statistical institutes and the EMI,carried out conceptual work on the harmonisation of consumer price statistics. The Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices is the outcome of these efforts.Harmonised long-term interest rates: Protocol No. 6 on the convergence criteriareferred to in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty requires interest rate convergence to be measured bymeans of interest rates on long-term government bonds or comparable government securities,taking into account differences in national definitions. In order to fulfil the Treaty requirement, theEMI carried out conceptual work on the harmonisation of long-term interest rate statistics andregularly collected the data from national central banks on behalf of the European Commission(Eurostat), a task which has been taken over by the ECB.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998158Interbank funds transfer system (IFTS): a funds transfer system in which most (or all)participants are credit institutions.Interlinking mechanism: one of the components of the TARGET system. The term is usedto designate the infrastructures and the procedures which link domestic RTGS systems in orderto process cross-border payments within TARGET.Investment: gross fixed capital formation as defined in the European System of IntegratedEconomic Accounts.Large-value payments: payments, generally of very large amounts, which are mainly exchangedbetween banks or between participants in the financial markets and usually require urgent andtimely settlement.Links between securities settlement systems: the procedure between two securitiessettlement systems for the cross-border transfer of securities through a book-entry process(i.e. without physical transfer).Longer-term refinancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by theEurosystem in the form of a reverse transaction. Longer-term refinancing operations areexecuted through monthly standard tenders and have a maturity of three months.Loss-sharing rule (or loss-sharing agreement): an agreement between participants in atransfer system or a clearing house arrangement regarding the allocation of any loss arising whenone or more participants fail to fulfil their obligation; the arrangement stipulates how the loss willbe shared among the parties concerned in the event that the agreement is activated.Lump-sum allowance: a fixed amount which an institution may deduct in the calculation of itsreserve requirement within the minimum reserve framework of the Eurosystem.Main refinancing operation: a regular open market operation executed by theEurosystem in the form of a reverse transaction. Main refinancing operations are conductedthrough weekly standard tenders and have a maturity of two weeks.Maintenance period: the period over which compliance with reserve requirements iscalculated. The maintenance period for Eurosystem minimum reserves is one month, starting onthe 24th calendar day of each month, and ending on the 23rd calendar day of the following month.Marginal lending facility: a standing facility of the Eurosystem which counterparties mayuse to receive overnight credit against a pre-specified interest rate.
Measures with a temporary effect: comprise all non-cyclical effects on fiscal variables which:(1) reduce (or increase) the general government deficit or gross debt (deficit ratio, debtratio) in a specified period only (ﬁone-offﬂ effects) or (2) improve (or worsen) the budgetarysituation in a specified period at the expense (or to the benefit) of future budgetary situations(ﬁself-reversingﬂ effects).Monetary aggregates: a monetary aggregate can be defined as the sum of currency in circulationplus outstanding amounts of certain liabilities of financial institutions that have a high degree ofﬁmoneynessﬂ (or liquidity in a broad sense). The broad monetary aggregate M3 has been defined bythe Eurosystem as currency in circulation plus euro area residents™ (other than central159ECB Annual Report Ł 1998government) holdings of the following liabilities of euro area money issuing institutions: overnightdeposits, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years, deposits redeemable at notice of upto three months, repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and money market
paper and debt securities up to two years. The Governing Council of the ECB has announced areference value for the growth of M3.Monetary Committee: a consultative Community body which was composed of tworepresentatives from each Member State in a personal capacity (normally one from thegovernment and one from the central bank) and two representatives of the EuropeanCommission. It was created in 1958 on the basis of Article 105 of the EEC Treaty. In order topromote co-ordination of the policies of Member States to the full extent needed for the
functioning of the internal market, Article 109c of the Treaty lists a set of areas where theMonetary Committee was to contribute to the preparation of the work of the EU Council. Atthe start of Stage Three of EMU the Monetary Committee was dissolved and the Economic andFinancial Committee established.Multi-purpose prepaid card: a stored value card which can be used for a wide range ofpurposes and which has the potential to be used on a national or international scale, but which may
sometimes be restricted to a certain area. A reloadable multi-purpose prepaid card is also knownas an electronic purse (see also electronic money).Net capital expenditure: comprises a government™s final capital expenditure (i.e. gross fixedcapital formation, plus net purchases of land and intangible assets, plus changes in stocks) and netcapital transfers paid (i.e. investment grants, plus unrequited transfers paid by the generalgovernment to finance specific items of gross fixed capital formation by other sectors, minuscapital taxes and other capital transfers received by the general government).Net external asset or liability position (or the international investment position(i.i.p.)): the statistical statement of the value and composition of the stock of an economy™sfinancial assets or financial claims on the rest of the world, less an economy™s financial liabilities tothe rest of the world.Net settlement system (NSS): a funds transfer system, the settlement operations of whichare completed on a bilateral or multilateral net basis.
Nominal effective exchange rates: see effective (nominal/real) exchange rates.Non-cyclical factors: indicate influences on the government™s budget balances that are not dueto cyclical fluctuations (the cyclical component of the budget balance). They can therefore resulteither from structural, i.e. permanent, changes in budgetary policies or from measures with aﬁtemporary effectﬂ (see also measures with a temporary effect).Open market operation: an operation executed on the initiative of the central bank in thefinancial markets involving one of the following transactions: (1)€buying or selling assets outright(spot or forward); (2)€buying or selling assets under a repurchase agreement; (3)€lending orborrowing against underlying assets as collateral; (4)€the issuance of central bank debt certificates;(5)€the collection of deposits; or (6)€foreign exchange swaps between domestic and foreigncurrency.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998160Output gap: the difference between the actual and potential output level of an economy as apercentage of the potential output. For monetary policy purposes, the rate of growth of potentialoutput may be considered to be the rate of real output growth consistent with price stability in the
medium term (i.e. no tendency for either inflationary or deflationary pressures to appear). Thismay be similar in practice to the trend rate of growth of the economy. A positive (negative) outputgap means that actual output is above (below) the trend or potential level of output, and suggests
the possible emergence (absence) of inflationary pressures.Outright transaction: a transaction whereby the central bank buys or sells assets up to theirmaturity in the market (spot or forward).
Primary balance: government net borrowing or net lending excluding interest payments ongovernment liabilities.
Real effective exchange rates: see effective (nominal/real) exchange rates.Realignment: a change in the central parity of a currency participating in an exchange rate systemwith a fixed but adjustable peg. In the former ERM a realignment consisted of a change in the ECUcentral rate and the bilateral central rates of one or more of the participating currencies.Reference period: time intervals specified in Article 104c (2a) of the Treaty and in ProtocolNo. 6 on the convergence criteria for examining progress towards convergence.Re-denomination of securities: the denomination of a security is the currency in which the parvalue of the security is expressed (in most cases, the face value of a certificate). Re-denominationrefers to a procedure through which the original denomination of a security, issued in nationalcurrency, is changed into euro at the irrevocably fixed conversion rate.Reference value for the fiscal position: Protocol No. 5 of the Treaty on the excessivedeficit procedure sets explicit reference values for the deficit ratio (3% of GDP) and the debtratio (60% of GDP), whereas Protocol No. 6 on the convergence criteria specifies themethodology for the computation of the reference values relevant for the examination of price and
long-term interest rate convergence.Remote access (to an IFTS): the facility for a credit institution established in one country(ﬁhome countryﬂ) to become a direct participant in an interbank funds transfer system(IFTS) established in another country (ﬁhost countryﬂ) and, for that purpose, to have a settlementaccount in its own name with the central bank in the host country, if necessary, without havingestablished a branch in the host country.Repurchase operation (repo): a liquidity-providing reverse transaction based on arepurchase agreement.Repurchase agreement: an arrangement whereby an asset is sold while the sellersimultaneously obtains the right and obligation to repurchase it at a specific price on a future dateor on demand. Such an agreement is similar to collateralised borrowing, with the exception thatownership of the securities is not retained by the seller. The Eurosystem uses repurchaseagreements with a fixed maturity in its reverse transactions.Reserve base: the sum of the balance sheet items (in particular liabilities) which constitute thebasis for calculating the reserve requirement of a credit institution.161ECB Annual Report Ł 1998Reserve ratio: the ratio defined by the central bank for each category of eligible balance sheetitems included in the reserve base. The ratios are used to calculate reserve requirements.Reserve requirement: the requirement for institutions to hold minimum reserves with thecentral bank. In the minimum reserve framework of the Eurosystem, the reserve requirement ofa credit institution is calculated by multiplying the reserve ratio for each category of items inthe reserve base with the amount of those items in the institution™s balance sheet. In addition,institutions are allowed to deduct a lump-sum allowance from their reserve requirement.Reverse transaction: an operation whereby the central bank buys or sells assets under arepurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system: a settlement system in which processing andsettlement take place on an order-by-order basis (without netting) in real time (continuously). Seealso TARGET system.Securities settlement system: a system which permits the transfer of securities either free ofpayment or against payment.Settlement agent: an institution that manages the settlement process (e.g. the determination ofsettlement positions, monitoring the exchange of payments, etc.) for transfer systems or otherarrangements that require settlement.Settlement risk: a general term used to designate the risk that settlement in a transfer systemwill not take place as expected. This risk may comprise both credit and liquidity risk.
Stability and Growth Pact: consists of two EU Council Regulations on the strengthening ofthe surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co-ordination of economic policiesand on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure and ofan EU Council Resolution on the Stability and Growth Pact adopted at the Amsterdam summit on17 June 1997. It is intended to serve as a means of safeguarding sound government finances in StageThree of EMU in order to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainablegrowth conducive to employment creation. More specifically, budgetary positions close to balanceor in surplus are mentioned as the medium-term objective for Member States, which would allowthem to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while keeping the government deficit below thereference value of 3% of GDP. In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, countriesparticipating in EMU will report stability programmes, while non-participating countries will continueto provide convergence programmes.Standard tender: a tender procedure used by the Eurosystem in its regular open marketoperations. Standard tenders are carried out within a time frame of 24 hours. Allcounterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria are entitled to submit bids in standardtenders.Standing facility: a central bank facility available to counterparties on their own initiative. TheEurosystem offers two overnight standing facilities: the marginal lending facility and thedeposit facility.Stock-flow adjustments: see deficit-debt adjustment.ECB Annual Report Ł 1998162TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer)system: a payment system consisting of one RTGS system in each of the Member Statesparticipating in the euro area. The national RTGS systems are interconnected through theInterlinking mechanism so as to allow same-day cross-border transfers throughout the euroarea. RTGS systems of non-euro area Member States may also be connected to TARGET, providedthat they are able to process euro.Treaty: refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Treaty was signed inRome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958. It established the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC) and was often referred to as the ﬁTreaty of Romeﬂ. The Treaty onEuropean Union was signed in Maastricht (therefore often referred to as the ﬁMaastricht Treatyﬂ)
on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1€November 1993. It amended the EEC Treaty,

4½% and refers to the broad monetaryaggregate M3. The derivation of the referencevalue is based on the contributions to monetary
growth resulting from assumptions made forprices (year-on-year increases in the HICP ofbelow 2%), the medium-term trend in real GDP
growth (of 2-2½% per annum) and the medium-term trend decline in the velocity of circulationof M3 (in the approximate range of ½-1% each
year). Monetary developments against thisreference value will be monitored on the basisof three-month moving averages of the monthly
12-month growth rates for M3. In December1999 the Governing Council will review thereference value for monetary growth (see also
the announcement of the Governing Council of13€October 1998).Further to its decisions on 7 July and13€October 1998, the Governing Counciladopts a Regulation on the application of
minimum reserves. This ECB Regulationfollows the Council Regulation (EC)No. 2531/98 of 23 November 1998
concerning the application of minimumreserves by the European Central Bank andestablishes minimum reserve requirements
for credit institutions in the euro area in thepursuance of monetary policy objectives. TheECB Regulation entered into force on
