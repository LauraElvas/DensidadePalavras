Throughout 2011 price developments were 
commodity price increases, which led to 

part of the year, economic recovery in the euro 

area continued, supported by global growth and 

strengthening domestic demand. At the same 

outlook, as indicated by the economic analysis, 
shifted to the upside. The underlying pace of 

monetary expansion gradually recovered, while 

monetary liquidity was ample and could have 

accommodated upward price pressures. In order 

to ensure that price stability was maintained, the

banking sector worsened. Particularly in the 

second half of the year, contagion effects in 

larger euro area countries gathered strength 

amid rising headwinds from the interplay 

weakening macroeconomic growth prospects, 

especially towards the end of the year. Euro area 

bank funding pressures increased markedly in 

several market segments, including unsecured 

term funding and short-term US dollar funding. 

This led to a strengthening of bank deleveraging 

pressures in late 2011, suggesting a risk of

concerns with the EU™s legislative bodies. The ECB continued to contribute to the key 
policy and regulatory initiatives aimed at 

infrastructures, including legislative initiatives 

at the EU level. The ECB also contributed 

to the work of the Committee on Payment 

and Settlement Systems and the International 

Organization of Securities Commissions, in 

derivatives market infrastructure. Furthermore, 

in May 2011 the Governing Council approved 

the mandate for the European Forum on the 

Security of Retail Payments. Finally, throughout 

2011 an extensive preliminary review of 

the available documentation concerning the 

TARGET2-Securities design took place,

Substantial progress was made in 2011 

on the Eurosystem™s programme for a new 

multi-currency securities settlement solution 

called TARGET2-Securities (T2S). After
 more than two years of negotiations, the legal 

documentation was approved by the Governing 

Council, paving the way for central securities 

depositories and the Eurosystem to enter 

into a contract with each other in 2012. The 

negotiations with the non-euro area central 

banks that would like to make their currencies 

available to T2S for the settlement of securities 

transactions were also concluded. There were 

also positive developments on technical matters, 

notably the publication of the user detailed 

on forthcoming enhancements to Eurosystem

removal of the repatriation requirement and 

the support of cross-border tri-party collateral 

management services within the correspondent 

central banking model. Turning to organisational issues, the ECB 
had 1,440.5 full-time equivalent permanent 

positions at the end of 2011, compared with

PART OF 2011Looking at monetary policy decisions in 2011 

in more detail, the euro area economy began 

the year with a positive underlying growth 

momentum and broadly balanced risks amid 

elevated uncertainty. It was expected that 

euro area exports would be supported by the 

expansion in the world economy. Private
 sector demand was also seen to be making an 

increasing contribution to growth, in the light 

the accommodative monetary policy stance and 
the measures adopted to improve the functioning 

macroeconomic projections, which foresaw 

annual real GDP growth in a range between 

1.3% and 2.1% in 2011 and between 0.8% and 

2.8% in 2012.At the same time, there was evidence of upward 







commodity prices, which was also discernible 

in the earlier stages of the production 

process. Given the favourable underlying 

growth momentum, this could have triggered 

second-round effects and more broad-based 







staff macroeconomic projections foresaw 








and 2.6% for 2011 and between 1.0% and 2.4% 

for 2012, which was an upward shift compared 

with the December 2010 Eurosystem staff 

macroeconomic projections, mainly owing to 

higher energy and food prices. 
Consequently, the Governing Council noted 
in March that the risks to the medium-term 

outlook for price stability were on the upside, 

having considered the risks to be broadly 

balanced but likely to be moving to the upside 

the Governing Council stressed its preparedness 

upside risks to price stability over the medium 

term did not materialise. These risks related, in 

particular, to
 stronger than assumed increases 
in commodity prices, but also to greater 

than assumed increases in indirect taxes and 

consolidation in the coming years, as well as to 

higher than expected domestic price pressures in 

the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic 
analysis with the signals from the monetary 

analysis suggested that the underlying pace 

of monetary expansion was still moderate. 

At the same time, the low level of money and 

credit growth had thus far led to an only partial 

unwinding of the large amounts of monetary 

liquidity accumulated in the economy prior 



the potential to facilitate the accommodation 

of price pressures emerging at the time in 

commodity markets as a result of strong world 

economic growth and ample liquidity related 

to expansionary monetary policies at the 

global level. In the light of the upside risks to price stability 















expectations at levels consistent with price 

stability, the Governing Council decided to 

increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis 

points at its meeting on 7 April 2011, having kept 

them unchanged at historically low levels for

the medium term. Given the low interest rates 

across the entire maturity spectrum, the stance 

of monetary policy remained accommodative,

economic growth which had occurred over

crisis peak of 59.4 in February. However, a 

series of unforeseen, adverse events caused 

the global economy to lose some momentum 



The Great East Japan Earthquake not only 

had a direct impact on Japanese economic 

activity but also spilled over to the rest of the 

world through the disruption of global supply 

chains. In addition, rising commodity prices 

had a dampening effect on real incomes in the 

major advanced economies. The divergence 

in growth patterns continued, not only 

between advanced and emerging economies 

but also among advanced economies. 

In emerging economies, growth remained 

relatively robust, albeit with some moderation 

in the latter part of the year, which helped to 

alleviate the build-up of overheating pressures. 

In advanced economies, the continuing repair 

of public and private sector balance sheets as 

well as the persistent weaknesses in labour and 

housing markets continued to restrain growth 

(see Chart 2). Notwithstanding differences in 

labour market developments across advanced 

economies, unemployment in the OECD area 

remained stubbornly high.During the second half of 2011 business and 
consumer sentiment continued to deteriorate,

escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in the 

euro area and the drawn-out discussions on 

the US debt ceiling. These developments to 

some extent offset the positive impetus from 

the unwinding of supply disruptions that had 

followed the Japanese earthquake in March. 
Overall, the underlying growth momentum 

of the global economy weakened. By the end 

of the year, however, data releases and survey 

indicators were both indicating tentative signs of 

a stabilisation of activity in the global economy. Chart 2 Main developments in major

DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMODITY PRICES WERE 

MIXED IN 2011The price of Brent crude oil was on average 

USD 111 per barrel in 2011, 38% above the 
average in 2010. The rise in the annual average 

was the biggest since 2005. Having risen sharply 

to a peak of USD
 126 per barrel on 2 May 2011, 
oil prices then declined to USD
 108 per barrel 
at the end of December 2011, compared with 

USD 93 per barrel in early January 2011. The sharp upward trend in oil prices that had 
started in September 2010 continued until 

early May
 2011 Œ closely resembling the surge 
in oil prices that occurred between 2007 and  

mid-2008. The increase was supported by a 

pick-up in global oil demand and by the severe 

disruption to the oil supply from Libya amid 

the political turmoil in that region. Moreover, 

non-OPEC oil supply outages that were 

stronger than expected further exacerbated the 

already tight situation in terms of supply and  

demand which persisted throughout most of the

proved to be resilient in the second half of 2011 

despite a slowdown in global growth. Towards 

the turn of the year, oil prices were supported by

disruption to the oil supply from Iran. By contrast, the prices of non-energy

The moderate depreciation of the euro was 

therefore characterised, as in the preceding 
year, by elevated levels of implied volatility

the euro broadly appreciated, but thereafter 

commenced a downward trend that steepened 

during late summer. This trend was halted in 

October, when the euro appreciated markedly 

against the US dollar and the Japanese yen amid 

temporarily declining volatility. The euro™s 

subsequent weakening against these currencies 

was partly offset by a strengthening against 

other currencies, particularly those of central 

and eastern European economies. As a result, the 

nominal effective exchange rate of the euro, as 

measured against the currencies of 20 of the euro 

area™s most important trading partners, declined

20112.2 MONETARY AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
MONETARY GROWTH REMAINED MODERATEHaving recovered from the muted developments 
observed in early 2010, broad money growth 

remained at moderate levels in 2011. The annual 

growth rate of M3, which had stood at 1.7% in 

December 2010, remained stable at around 2% 



growth in aggregate demand. The heightened 



uncertainty that characterised the second half 

of the year encouraged portfolio shifts both into 

and out of monetary assets. This resulted in a 

considerable increase in the short-term volatility 

of the annual growth rate of M3 (which reached 

2.9% in September 2011, before declining to 

stand at 1.5% in December, and then recovered 

to stand at 2.5% in January 2012). Transactions 

(mainly interbank transactions) conducted via 

central counterparties (CCPs), which are part 

of the money-holding sector, also added to the 

increased volatility of monthly data on money 

and credit (see Chart 6). The annual growth rate of loans to the private 

sector (adjusted for the impact of loan sales and 

securitisation activity) was also affected by such 

factors. Accordingly, having hovered above 

2.5% for most of 2011, it declined markedly 

towards the end of the year (standing at 1.2% in 

December, down from 2.4% in December 2010). 

Data on lending for January 2012 suggest that the 

risk of credit being severely curtailed declined. 

In this respect, the non-standard measures 

adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB 

in early December Œ particularly the three-year 

LTROs Œ alleviated the funding pressures faced 

by MFIs (see Box 1 for a description of these 

measures). Overall, looking beyond short-term 

volatility, developments in money and credit 

indicate that the pace of underlying monetary 

expansion was moderate in 2011. PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS WERE THE KEY 

DRIVER OF DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPONENTS 

OF M3Portfolio considerations relating to the 

interest rates paid on the various instruments 

contained in M3 drove developments in the 



of 2011. The spread between the interest 

rates paid on overnight deposits and other 

short-term deposits widened in that period, 

encouraging the money-holding sector to 

allocate funds to other short-term deposits. 



and economic uncertainty increased, late 

summer saw considerable portfolio shifts 

away from riskier assets and into M3. The 

preference shown for liquidity, combined with 

the fact that the spread between the interest 

rates paid on overnight deposits and other 

short-term deposits had stopped widening by 

that time (and had even decreased slightly), 



for M3 were allocated to overnight deposits 

(see Charts 7 and 8). The annual growth rate of marketable 
instruments, which increased to -0.5% in 

December 2011, up from -2.3% in December 

2010, displayed a high degree of volatility 

in the course of the year. This less negative

Asset markets are playing an increasingly important role in many economies, and policy-makers 
have become far more aware that sizeable changes and corrections in asset prices may lead to 

in reducing the risks to price stability that arise from such developments. Recent research suggests 

that money and credit indicators can be particularly helpful in predicting boom and bust cycles in 

asset prices. This provides a further reason for central banks to monitor such variables closely.1Detecting asset price booms and bustsDesigning an early warning system for asset price imbalances can be divided into three steps.

2 time, a cross-check of the results stemming from the various methods is warranted. The second step 

involves selecting appropriate leading indicators and designing models to link the indicators to the 

indicator over a sample period and/or across a panel of countries. The usefulness of an indicator is 

typically assessed by comparing the number of false alarms with the number of correct signals given 

by the indicator. A number of different (and complementary) methods have been used in the literature 

to predict asset price misalignments, and two of them have recently been applied in ECB studies.

choiceﬂ method, which uses probit/logit regression techniques to evaluate an indicator™s ability to 

predict either a boom or a bust by estimating the probability of such an episode occurring within a 

given time frame. A warning signal is issued when this probability exceeds a certain threshold.The role of money and credit as early warning indicators
A crucial aspect of the functioning of early warning indicators is the selection of indicator variables 
which, according to historical regularities, exhibit unusual behaviour prior to booms and busts. 

Money and credit developments stand out in this regard, as a number of theoretical channels link 

these variables to asset prices and, ultimately, consumer prices. First of all, asset prices affect money 

demand as part of a broader portfolio allocation problem, whereby the returns on various assets

tighter the constraints will be, given that there is less collateral available to secure loans.4 At the same time, the causality might also run in the opposite direction. For example, rising demand 

frictions, increase asset prices.

2011These results can be used to assess the possible emergence of booms and busts in asset markets 
in the euro area. First, recent developments in the global credit gap, the domestic credit growth 

and house price growth gaps and the investment-to-GDP ratio do not seem to give any particular 

indication of a forthcoming boom or bust at the euro area level. Second, the probit boom and 



(see Chart A). The results indicate that the probability of a forthcoming bust increased further 

to stand at 28% in the third quarter of 2011, albeit remaining below the 35% threshold. At the same 

time, the probability of a forthcoming boom remains fairly low, at around 10%. 
This quantitative information is also provided in graphical form in Chart B. The vertical and 
horizontal axes indicate the probabilities of booms and busts respectively, with the origin 

representing the 35% threshold. The four quadrants represent the various possible combinations 

in terms of the probabilities of booms and busts. Current developments continue to place the 

euro area in the bottom-left quadrant, which is characterised by a probability of either a boom or 

a bust occurring in the next two years below the respective thresholds. However, the probability 

of a bust seems to have been increasing in the past few quarters, thus approaching the situation 

depicted in the bottom-right quadrant.Overall assessment

individual countries and groups of countries which perform reasonably well. These studies also

Eurosystem™s accommodation of the ensuing liquidity needs. Accordingly, the very high level 



to ensure the effectiveness of the single monetary policy. Ensuring that solvent banks are not 

liquidity-constrained in their funding has been a key feature of the Eurosystem™s non-standard 

measures (see Box 1). This contributes to the effective transmission of monetary policy to the 

wider euro area economy, and thereby to maintaining price stability in the euro area over the 

medium term. In Monetary Union, the risk that the Eurosystem central banks (that is, the ECB and the euro 
area NCBs) face relates to the conduct of monetary policy operations itself, not to the associated 

TARGET2 balances. A central bank always faces counterparty risk when implementing monetary 

policy. However, such risk is mitigated by a risk management framework. For the provision of 

central bank liquidity to banks, this includes the requirement of adequate collateral valued at 

market prices and subject to haircuts. In addition to pledging collateral, the banks remain fully 

responsible for the borrowing they obtain from the Eurosystem (see Section 1 of Chapter 2). 

The residual risk that may emerge despite risk mitigation measures is, as a rule, shared among 

the euro area NCBs in accordance with their respective shares in the ECB™s capital and is not 

related to the TARGET2 positions of individual central banks.The claims or liabilities that relate to TARGET2 are regularly published by all Eurosystem 
central banks as part of their balance sheets. As far as the consolidated balance sheet of the

EURO AREA GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS FACED 

INCREASING TENSIONS IN 2011AAA-rated long-term government bond yields 

generally declined in 2011, both in the euro area 

and in the United States. From around 3.3%, 

where they had stood in both regions at the 

beginning of January, they fell to 2.0% in the 

United States and to 2.6% in the euro area at the 

end of December (see Chart 12). 
US ten-year government bond yields moved 

broadly in tandem, continuing a trend that had 

started around mid-2010. In the remainder of the 

year, however, yields in the two areas tended to 

diverge, primarily because those in the euro area 



were, in turn, related mainly to developments in 

the sovereign debt crisis.

a solid economic recovery. In the euro area, 

market sentiment provided additional support,

regarding an extension of the scope and size 

of the European Financial Stability Facility 

(EFSF). In the United States, government bond 

markets found additional support in the tax 

plans announced by the US Administration in 

December 2010.The second phase started in March, when the 
upward trend in government bond yields came 

to a halt in both the euro area and the United 

States, paving the way for a prolonged period 

of decline. The trend reversal was triggered 

by political tensions in northern Africa and 
the Middle East, and by the earthquake in 





euro-denominated assets. Some of the decline 

in yields was also due to a less positive 

assessment of growth in the United States, 

amid a tightening of monetary policy in China 

and declining commodity prices, which market 

participants tended to associate with signs of a 

slowdown in the world economy. In the euro 



sovereign debt markets and rising concerns 

about a possible restructuring of Greece™s 

sovereign debt fostered a decline in yields in 

AAA-rated countries against the background 

of high liquidity premia.As from July the sovereign debt crisis in the 

euro area 
moved beyond smaller economies 
and began 
to spread to some large countries 
as well. This 
caused AAA-rated ten-year 
government bond yields 
to decline further 
in the wake of an 

safety purchases of bonds.

in market uncertainty in early August, sparked

and of the announcement by the Federal Open

bonds rose considerably.A key feature of the euro area government bond

fundamentals. Overall, falling long-term yields in 

some AAA-rated euro area countries and rising 

yields in lower-rated euro area countries could be 

taken as an indication that the risk gap between 

the two groups of countries was perceived to be 

widening. However, the positive co-movements 

in sovereign credit default swap (CDS) premia 

between all euro area countries provide evidence 

that sovereign debt was perceived to have become 

riskier in the euro area as a whole, although to a 

varying extent (see Box 5).Box 5TURBULENCE IN THE EURO AREA SOVEREIGN DEBT MARKETS AND SPILLOVERS TO THE FINANCIAL

to emerge and have reached unprecedented levels, especially for those countries that experienced

of an econometric model.

 2 Overall, the two charts provide evidence that, although yield correlations 
moved into negative territory in late 2009, those for CDSs remained generally positive, despite 

noticeable swings and a trend decline since 2010. At the heart of the divergent development of 

the two sets of correlations lies the fact that CDSs are mainly measures of default risk, while 

bond yields are also affected by variations in the preference for liquidity exhibited by market 


estimation is preferred, as the time window over which correlations are computed is optimally chosen by the model itself and as the 

resulting correlations can be interpreted more as ﬁlocal correlationsﬂ (i.e. referred to the latest points in the sample over which the 

estimation is performed), rather than as average correlations in the given sample.

liquid and relatively safer, with the German bond market featuring prominently among them. 

The appearance of negative correlations between government bond yields in the euro area should 

therefore not be interpreted solely as a sign that credit risk declined for some countries while 

it increased for others. In fact, the decreasing but generally still positive bilateral correlations 

between euro area sovereign CDS premia and the CDS premium paid on Greek public debt since

2011The ten-year government bond yield differentials

continued to rise in April and May as the need 

to restructure the Greek public debt attracted 

broader attention (see the chart in Box 1).  

In early June 2011 spreads in Greece, Ireland 

and Portugal stood more than 500 basis points  

higher, on average, than in May 2010, when

EURO AREA EQUITY PRICES DECLINED SHARPLY IN 2011 
All in all, equity prices in the euro area 

dropped by around 20% in 2011, while those in 

the United States remained broadly stable over 

the same period (see Chart 13). At the same 

time, broad equity indices declined by 7% in 

the United Kingdom and by 19% in Japan. The 

more marked decline of the euro area index 

relative to its US counterpart in 2011 was due 

primarily to developments in the second half of

lower growth in earnings in the euro area.institutions are supposedly largely unaffected by developments in sovereign risk, given that

Time-varying correlations between these two CDS indices, as well as their respective volatilities,

re-activation of the Securities Markets Programme and the outcome of the EU summit of 21 July, 

the correlation tended to decline, 
levels prevailing at the end of August. The overall upward trend in the correlation underlined the

equity indices in the euro area and the United 

States increased on the back of releases of 

favourable economic data, positive earnings 

announcements and a slight rebound in risk 

appetite. Overall, the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 

index and the Standard & Poor™s 500 index 

gained 9% and 12% respectively between 

the end of November 2010 and the end of

came to a halt, mainly as a result of political 

tensions in northern Africa and the Middle East, 

the actual and expected consequences of the 

earthquake in Japan and more acute tensions 

in euro area sovereign debt markets. Later, in 

the course of the second quarter of the year, 

equity prices declined moderately in both the 

United States and the euro area, as market 

participants started to discount the implications of 

a re-assessment of the outlook for global growth.The downturn in equity prices picked up pace in 



reaction to the downgrading of US sovereign 

debt by one of the major rating agencies, as well 

as rising uncertainty about the extent to which 

the euro area sovereign debt crisis would spread. 

Overall, the Dow Jones EURO STOXX index 

declined by around 23% in the three months 

to the end of September, while the Standard & 

Poor™s 500 index lost 14%. At the same time,

Developments in the United States were similar, 



by more than 20% over the same period.Aside from being affected by the aforementioned 
factors, negative developments in equity prices in 

the third quarter of 2011 also resulted from data 

on weak corporate earnings. The annual rate of 

growth in the actual earnings per share of euro area 

corporations included in the Dow Jones EURO 

STOXX index decreased from 29% in May to 20% 

in August. The expected rate of growth of earnings 

per share over the short term also decreased from 

12% in May to 10% in August. 
In the last quarter of the year, notwithstanding an 
increase in the implied volatility of broad equity 



segments and uncertainty about global economic 

growth, stock prices returned to an upward path on 

both sides of the Atlantic. In particular, the broad-

based Dow Jones EURO STOXX index and the 

Standard & Poor™s 500 index gained around 5% 

and 10% respectively over the quarter. Throughout 

this period, changes in market sentiment related 

to the euro area sovereign debt crisis continued 

to weigh on euro area stock prices. However, 

especially in November and December, equities 

were supported by economic data releases in the 

United States that were better than expected, by 

positive developments in market sentiment ahead

households decreased in 2011, standing at an 

estimated 1.5% in December, down from 2.5% 

in December 2010. This was the result of a 

reduction in the contribution made by loans to 

households remaining on MFIs™ balance sheets 

(i.e. not adjusted for sales or securitisation), which 

was almost half of that seen in 2010, while the 

contribution made by the annual growth rate of 

loans from non-MFIs registered a sharp increase 

and turned positive (the annual growth rate of 

these loans stood at 2.3% in December 2011, up 

from -2.4% in December 2010). The contrasting 

developments in MFI and non-MFI loans to 



bulk of non-MFI loans are accounted for by

in the net percentage of banks reporting the

on the supply side, such as geopolitical tensions or extreme weather conditions in commodity-

producing countries. A common feature across the two periods under review is that such supply 

disruptions occurred at a time when demand was already very strong. In 2008 the ensuing tightness 

in the oil market was additionally aggravated by concerns about relatively low inventory levels.In the case of oil prices, the peak of the 2011 surge was lower than that of the 2008 surge when 
measured in US dollar terms, but was at approximately the same level when measured in euro 

terms, at •85 per barrel (see Chart A). In the case of food commodity prices measured in euro 

terms, the peak reached during the 2011 surge was higher than that during the 2008 surge. In 

both periods prices were driven by strong demand from emerging market economies for high-

protein foods, such as meat and dairy products, and from industrialised countries for grains and 

oilseeds in the context of fast-growing biofuel production. However, as global supply conditions 

had had some time to adapt, the strong demand triggered by such changes in diet or energy

in the 2011 surge than in that in 2008, the difference was less pronounced than in the case of 

international commodity prices. It is important to note that aggregate EU food commodity prices 

conceal very different developments in certain categories (see Chart B). For example, in the case 

of cereals and dairy products, prices in 2011 did not reach the levels recorded in 2008, while for 

the aggregate they were higher. Moreover, the respective price peaks also occurred at somewhat

of 2007, while meat prices did not peak until early 2009. Such differences are important, as the

through their direct effect on consumer prices for energy and food. Indeed, when commodity 

prices peaked in mid-2008 and early 2011, these two components accounted for around 60% of 



observed in mid-2008 (see Chart C). Oil price movements have an almost immediate effect on fuel 

prices within the HICP energy component, in particular those for personal transport equipment. 

As a result, and in view of their weight, fuel prices accounted for most of the level and pattern 





than half of those seen in 2008. Gas and electricity prices are not affected immediately by oil price 

movements, instead tending to react with a lag of a couple of months. Differences between the 



price components: gas prices made a stronger contribution in 2008, while electricity prices made 

a stronger contribution in 2011. A possible reason for the smaller role of gas prices in 2011 is the 

gradual development of spot markets in recent years, which may have dampened the impact of 

index-linked gas prices. The higher contribution of electricity prices in 2011 appears to be largely 

related to higher prices for renewable resources and changes in taxes.Chart C Contributions to energy price

of change in the energy component of the 

HICP Œ constituting 10.4% of the overall HICP Œ 
 remained in double digits throughout 2011, 

reaching a 12-month average of 11.9%. This 

had the strongest impact on the prices of items 

directly related to oil prices, such as liquid

transport equipment. In addition, there was a 

marked rise in the prices of electricity, gas and 

heating fuel. 
Mirroring developments in international food 

commodity prices, HICP food prices increased 

further, in particular processed food prices, which 

rose steadily throughout 2011. The average 

annual rate of change in prices for processed 

food stood at 3.3% in 2011, which was markedly 

higher than that for 2010 (0.9%) and 2009 (1.1%).

pattern was observable in all the main services

PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION DECREASED IN 2011Owing primarily to higher global demand for 

raw materials, supply chain price pressures 

rose steadily from their trough in the 

summer of 2009 until mid-2011. As a result, 

industrial producer price inflation increased 

in late 2010 and the first half of 2011. 

Thereafter it declined, mainly reflecting the 

impact of fluctuations in commodity prices. 

On average, producer prices in industry 

(excluding construction) in the euro area 

grew by 5.9% in 2011, compared with 

2.9% in 2010 and a fall of 5.1% in 2009 

(see Chart 20). The annual rate of change in 

producer prices for energy stood at 11.9%, 

compared with 6.4% in 2010 and a decline of 

11.8% in 2009.Excluding construction and energy, the annual 
growth rate of industrial producer prices was 

also higher than in previous years (3.8% 

in 2011, compared with 1.6% in 2010 and 

a fall of 2.9% in 2009). The easing in price 

pressures during the second half of the year 

was more visible at the earlier stages of the 

pricing chain (producer prices for intermediate 

goods) than at the later stages (producer prices 

for consumer goods).LABOUR COST INDICATORS INCREASED

growth rate of negotiated wages rose steadily over

the information to hand points towards weak 

developments in industrial activity (including 

construction), while the services sector appears 

to have held up somewhat better. 
Growth in private consumption in 2011 was 
lower than in 2010, when it increased by 








growth in consumer spending on retail goods 

and, to a lesser extent, services. Data on 

new passenger car registrations indicate that 

car purchases declined in 2011, albeit not as 

sharply as in the previous year. The weakness 

in consumption is consistent with the erosion

consolidation efforts in a number of countries. 

These consolidation efforts stem particularly 

from restraint in the compensation of government 

employees, which accounts for about half of total 

government consumption. Other components of 

government consumption, such as intermediate 

consumption expenditure, have also been growing 

only moderately in the light of the consolidation 

requirements. 
The contribution to growth from inventories 
is likely to have been limited in 2011. This 

would represent a slowdown in the rate of stock 

building compared with 2010, when inventories 

contributed 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth. 

In line with falling growth and a deteriorating 

outlook for economic activity, the contribution 

to overall growth from inventories turned 

negative in quarter-on-quarter terms in the third 

quarter of 2011.Euro area trade continued to recover in the 

year to the third quarter of 2011. However, 



the double-digit growth rates seen in the 

same period a year earlier. Real exports of 

goods and services increased by 5.8% in the 

year to the third quarter of 2011, while real 

imports rose by 3.7%. Throughout this period 

exports consistently outpaced imports on a 

quarterly basis. As a result, the contributions to 

quarterly GDP growth from net exports were 

positive in each quarter, thereby supporting 

the recovery in the euro area over this period. 

Overall, the trade dynamics in the year to the 

third quarter of 2011 broadly mirrored the 

uneven expansion of the global economy. 

Growth in intra-euro area trade and imports 

from countries outside the euro area were 

rather subdued as the lingering sovereign 

debt crisis weighed on euro area demand. 

Extra-euro area exports were robust, 

particularly those to Asia and Latin America 

(see Chart 23), while exports to most advanced 

economies Œ including the United States and 

the United Kingdom Œ expanded slowly.

2011The increase in extra-euro area export volumes 
of goods in the year to the third quarter of 

2011 was broad-based across major product 

categories. By contrast, the moderate increase 

in import volumes was largely driven by 

intermediate goods (which are also used as an 

input for exported products), whereas imports 

of consumer goods declined, owing to weak 

private consumption in the euro area. The 

current account of the euro area as a whole 

remained close to balance in 2011.INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE FURTHER BEFORE 

STARTING TO EASEAt the sectoral level, the largest increase in 

output in 2011 was in the industrial sector. Value 

added in industry (excluding construction) rose 

on an annual basis by 4.5% on average during 



with an increase of 6.6% in 2010. However, 

the growth dynamics weakened over the year, 

in line with the slowdown in GDP. This is 



industrial production (excluding construction), 

which fell to -1.6% in December 2011, down 

from almost 7% in January. Among the components of industrial production 

(excluding construction), intermediate and 

capital goods showed the strongest increases in 

2011, while production of consumer goods was 

more muted (see Chart 24). At the same time, 

production of energy contracted sharply.Construction production contracted further in 
2011 after a period of protracted slowdown. 

Following a contraction of 4.4% in 2010, value 

added in construction declined on average by 



2011. Annual growth of value added in services 

recorded an average of 1.3% during the same 

period. This is broadly unchanged from the

2011improvement in the year as a whole took 
place within services. Employment in 

industry (excluding construction) rose to 

a lesser extent. Total hours worked rose 

more strongly than headcount employment 

in 2011, particularly at the beginning of the 

year. This should merely be seen as a reversal 

of the developments witnessed during the 
downturn, as a large part of the total labour 

adjustment at the time took place through 

a reduction in hours worked per person 

employed, rather than through a reduction in

2011of the smaller employment adjustment is undoubtedly also due to the shortened working 
hour schemes (often government-supported) which were widely used in many countries  

(most notably, Belgium, Germany and Italy).Over the course of the recession, euro area headcount employment fell by some 3.8 million (i.e. 
2.6%), while more than 8 million jobs (roughly 6%) were lost in the United States. The different 

reactions for employment and hours in the two economies led to a much slower increase in 

registered unemployment in the euro area, albeit from a markedly higher initial level and despite 

rather different labour supply dynamics.

US labour productivity in the aftermath of the recession.3Until the middle of 2011 labour market conditions showed signs of improvement in both 

economies, with hours and employment starting to expand Œ albeit gradually Œ and unemployment 

declining somewhat. Overall, euro area employment has increased by roughly 900,000 jobs  

(i.e. 0.6%) since the trough was reached, while around 2 million jobs (1.5%) have been created 

in the United States. To some extent, the lower employment creation seen in the euro area in 

the post-crisis period is a natural consequence of the higher degree of labour hoarding seen 

over the course of the recession. Consequently, the euro area unemployment rate remained 

high in the aftermath of the recession, rising to 10.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the 

United States, meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined by almost 1 percentage point to 

8.7% in the same quarter. 
Rising long-term unemployment on both sides of the Atlantic

on both sides of the Atlantic. Longer unemployment spells may lead to a strong deterioration 

in both human capital and labour market attachment, which in turn may lead to harmful 
2 In the euro area, labour force growth largely stagnated following the onset of the recession. This can be attributed almost equally to a 
slowdown in both population and participation growth. In the United States, by contrast, the labour force contracted by around 0.5%, 

largely owing to a strong decline in the participation rate, while population growth slowed only slightly.3 See the box entitled ﬁRecent sectoral productivity developments in the euro area and the United Statesﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin

December 2011.62ECBAnnual Report

2011As labour market developments tend to 
lag behind overall cyclical developments, 

employment growth in 2011 was stronger than 

in 2010. This, combined with a slowdown in 

GDP growth, implies that productivity growth 

per person employed declined in 2011. Annual 

productivity growth declined from 2.2% in 

quarter. The decline in productivity growth was 

broadly based across sectors. Growth in overall 

productivity measured by hours worked also 

declined, albeit to a lesser extent.After bottoming out in April 2011, the 
unemployment rate edged upwards again, 

exceeding its previous peak of May 2010 

(see Chart 25). In December 2011 the 
unemployment rate stood at 10.6%, up 

0.7 percentage point from its trough in April.2.5 FISCAL DEVELOPMENTScrisis has evolved into a sovereign debt crisis,

sector and heightened uncertainty regarding 


government debt sustainability weakened and

term unemployment is much lower in the United States than in the euro area, with the share of 

those unemployed for over six months generally peaking at around 25% in the aftermath of the 

recession in the United States, compared with around 65% of the total in the euro area. However, 

the share has increased considerably in the United States in the latest recession and has stood at 

over 40% since the beginning of 2010, although this is still 20 percentage points lower than in 

the euro area. In part, this rise is undoubtedly due to the severity of the recession and the lack 

of new employment possibilities in a still depressed US labour market, but it may also be partly

The recent recession took a heavy toll on labour markets on both sides of the Atlantic, with 
labour utilisation rates still some way short of their pre-crisis levels. The deterioration in the 

labour market was particularly large in the United States. Employment growth is likely to 

remain subdued for some time to come in both the euro area and the United States. Longer-term 

improvements to euro area labour markets are likely to depend heavily on the ability to restructure 

enhancing employment in the longer term. Further reforms may be needed in the euro area to 

help ease labour market transitions, particularly for young entrants to the labour force, who have 

so far been disproportionately hit by the crisis, as well as for the growing ranks of long-term 

unemployed.
estimates vary considerably. Focusing on the recent episode, Daly, Hobijn and Valletta conclude that the fact that the maximum 
payment duration of US unemployment insurance has been extended considerably is likely to have contributed only modestly to 

the increased unemployment durations seen in the United States since 2008 (see Daly, M., Hobijn, B. and Valletta, R., ﬁThe recent 

evolution of the natural rate of employmentﬂ, 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper
, No 2011-05, September 2011). 
For this episode, the large employment declines seen in some sectors and the resultant mismatch in worker attributes versus openings, 

as well as reduced geographical mobility owing to the bursting of the US housing bubble, are all likely to have been more important

and policy-makers. From a solvency perspective, i.e. when assessing the sustainability of 
government debt, it is important to take both government liabilities and government assets into 

account. This box argues that focusing only on gross government debt may provide an incomplete 

picture, since to some extent assets represent a buffer, and governments could in principle sell 

their assets to redeem debt. Moreover, in some cases, the increase in government liabilities is

TY In most non-euro area EU Member States, 
output continued to recover in 2011 (see 

Table

of a slowdown towards the end of the year,

deteriorating economic growth and heightened

growth, particularly in Latvia, Lithuania and 

Poland, net exports continued to contribute to 

economic growth in 2011 in most countries. 
 In several countries, weak labour market 







consolidation constrained the recovery. 

Furthermore, deteriorating economic sentiment, 

deleveraging of the banking sector, country-









sector balance sheets gradually became a more 

apparent drag on domestic demand. 
Looking at the main components of domestic 
demand, private consumption still remained 

above-mentioned factors. Unemployment rates 

remained high in all non-euro area EU countries, 
and the economic recovery brought about an 

improvement in the labour market in only a few 

of them. Despite slack in labour markets and 

constraints in the public sector, wage growth 

inter alia, composition effects and labour 

market bottlenecks. The growth of credit to 

the private sector continued to be weak in most 

non-euro area EU countries, as a result of both 

tight supply-side conditions owing to capital 

and funding pressures and low demand in line 

with moderate economic activity and debt 

deleveraging. In an environment characterised 

by high spare capacity, investment growth 

gradually gained momentum in most countries,

Lithuania, Poland and Sweden, i.e. countries 

where the contribution of domestic demand 

was the largest. On the other hand, GDP growth 

weakened markedly in the United Kingdom, in

in the government debt ratio in Hungary was 

exclusively due to the aforementioned partial

question and improving sentiment in the euro 

area, which is these countries™ main trading 

partner. In the second half of 2011, however, 

increasing global risk aversion contributed to 

a depreciation of those currencies against the 

euro. In Hungary, the weakening of the forint 

took place against the backdrop of renewed 

concerns about central bank independence and 

the interruption of the talks between the IMF 

and the EU and the Hungarian government 

about a new precautionary loan agreement 

(see also Box 9). The opposite pattern of 

exchange rate movements was observed for the 

pound sterling, which depreciated against the

appreciation of the Swedish krona against 



strong recovery of the Swedish economy, the 

krona remained broadly stable in 2011. The

mortar from all the joints of the brick facades of the wing buildings.
the horizontality of the brick courses was to be accentuated by varying not only the width, but also the colouring, of the 
the facades.The restoration works on the eastern wing building were completed in 2011, while those on the western wing building

of non-standard measures, including the second 

covered bond purchase programme and the 

Securities Markets Programme.During 2011 the Governing Council changed 
the key ECB interest rates on four occasions 

(see Chart 29). On 13 April 2011 the interest rates 

on the MROs, the marginal lending facility and 

the deposit facility were increased by 25 basis 

points to 1.25%, 2.00% and 0.50% respectively. 

There was a further 25 basis point increase in 

all key ECB rates with effect from 13 July. 

The Governing Council decided to lower the key 
ECB rates by 25 basis points with effect from 

9 November. On 14 December all key rates were 

lowered by a further 25 basis points, bringing 

them back to the levels at which they started the

three-year supplementary LTRO 
3 which was 
settled on 22 December, 523 counterparties 

participated for a total amount of •489.2 billion, 

which included •45.7 billion that was moved 

from the 12-month supplementary LTRO allotted 

in October 2011. A total of 123 counterparties 

made use of the possibility to shift between 

operations, whereas 58 decided to keep their 

borrowing in the 12-month supplementary LTRO, 

which thereafter had a remaining outstanding 

amount of •11.2 billion.In addition to the open market operations 
used for the implementation of monetary 

policy, the ECB can also provide eligible 

counterparties with liquidity in other currencies 

(see Section 1.2).SECURITIES MARKETS PROGRAMMEThe Governing Council decided in May 2010 

to establish the Securities Markets Programme 

(SMP). The objective of this temporary 

programme is to address the malfunctioning 

of certain euro area debt securities market 
segments and to restore an appropriate 

monetary policy transmission mechanism. The 

programme is implemented by Eurosystem 

portfolio managers carrying out purchases of 

certain euro area sovereign debt securities in 

market interventions. In 2011 a total amount 

of •144.6 billion of securities was purchased 

under the SMP, with the bulk of the purchases 

being made in the period between the statement 

of the President of the ECB on 7 August 2011 

on the active implementation of the SMP and 

the end of the year. By 30 December 2011 the 

Eurosystem had purchased securities under the 

SMP with a total settlement amount of around 

•211.4 billion.4
3 MROs over its lifetime. After one year (i.e. starting on 
26 December 2012), counterparties will have the possibility to 



part thereof) borrowed.

2011THE SECOND COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMMEOn 6 October 2011 the Governing Council 
decided to launch a new covered bond purchase 

programme, CBPP2. This programme was 

launched with a view to easing funding 

conditions for banks and companies and 

encouraging banks to maintain or expand 

lending to their customers. It allows the 

Eurosystem to purchase eligible euro-

denominated covered bonds issued in the 

euro area for an intended nominal amount of 

•40 billion. The purchases are conducted in 

both the primary and secondary markets on 

the basis of certain qualifying criteria. The 

programme is expected to be fully implemented 

by the end of October
 2012 at the latest.  
By 30 December 2011 covered bonds in the 

amount of •3.1 billion had been purchased. 

The Governing Council also decided to make 

the CBPP2 portfolio available for securities 

lending. Lending is voluntary and conducted 

through securities lending facilities offered 

by central securities depositories, or via 

matched repurchase transactions with eligible 

counterparties. 
The previous covered bond purchase programme 
(the CBPP) was completed in 2010. Under this 

programme, a nominal amount of •60 billion 

was purchased over a one-year period from 1 

July 2009 to 30
 June 2010. Since March 2010 
the securities held under this programme have 

been made available for securities lending 

on demand to eligible counterparties against 


has remained limited in terms of amounts, it is 

considered useful for a proper market functioning 

that the securities held under the programme are 

in principle available for lending.FINE-TUNING OPERATIONSIn order to absorb the liquidity injected 

through the SMP, the ECB conducted weekly 




for a weekly amount corresponding to the 
size of the SMP operations settled up to the 






were carried out as variable rate tender 

procedures with a maximum bid rate equal 

to the prevailing MRO rate. Moreover, the 

counter the liquidity imbalance on the last 

day of the maintenance periods. 12 liquidity-

absorbing operations were conducted, with 

a one-day maturity, as variable rate tender 

procedures with a maximum bid rate equal 










 •154 billion was absorbed via these operations, 

with 136 counterparties participating. Since 







on the last day of the maintenance period have 

been temporarily discontinued. In relation 

to the three-year LTRO, •141.9 billion was 

provided via a one-day liquidity-providing 







21 December 2011. 
STANDING FACILITIESCounterparties can use the two standing 

facilities on their own initiative to obtain 

overnight liquidity against eligible collateral or 

to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. 

At the end of 2011 2,605 counterparties 

had access to the marginal lending facility 

and 2,976 counterparties had access to the 

deposit facility. The use of the deposit facility 

remained at high levels, in particular during 

the second half of 2011, with a peak of •452 

billion on 27
 December
 2011, which was 
followed by even higher usage of •528 billion 

on 17 January 2012. The average daily use of 

the deposit facility was •120 billion (compared 

with •145.9
 billion in 2010 and •109 billion 
in 2009). In 2011 use of the deposit facility 

followed a broadly similar pattern during 

each reserve maintenance period: the deposit 

facility amounts were lower at the beginning 

of each period, but increased subsequently 







requirements. The average daily recourse to 

the marginal lending facility was •2.1
 billion 
(compared with •0.62 billion in 2010).84ECBAnnual Report

2011MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM 
Credit institutions in the euro area are required 
to hold minimum reserves on current accounts 

with the Eurosystem. In 2011, as has been 

the case since 1999, the minimum reserve 

requirements were equal to 2% of credit 

institutions™ reserve base and amounted to 

•208 billion on average, which was 2% lower 

than in 2010. As the Eurosystem remunerates 

reserve holdings at a rate corresponding to the 

MRO rate, the minimum reserve system does 

not impose a tax on the banking sector. In view 

of the full allotment policy applied in the MROs 

in 2011, the Governing Council considered that 

the minimum reserve system did not need to 

be applied to the same extent as under normal 

circumstances to steer money market conditions. 

On 8 December the Governing Council thus 

decided to reduce the reserve ratio to 1% as 

of the reserve maintenance period starting on 

18 January 2012 in order to support bank lending 

and liquidity in the euro area money market. ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR CREDIT OPERATIONS 
As required by Article 18.1 of the Statute 

of the ESCB, and in line with central bank 

practice worldwide, all credit operations of the 

Eurosystem are based on adequate collateral. The 

concept of adequacy implies that the Eurosystem 

is to a large extent protected from incurring 

losses in its credit operations (see below for more 

details on risk management issues). 
The Eurosystem accepts a broad range of assets 
as collateral in all its credit operations. This 

feature of the Eurosystem™s collateral framework, 

together with the fact that access to Eurosystem 

open market operations is granted to a large pool 

of counterparties, has been key in supporting the 

implementation of monetary policy in times of 



framework has allowed the Eurosystem to 

provide the necessary liquidity to address the 

impaired functioning of the money market 



encountering widespread collateral constraints. 

have been accepted as eligible collateral 
in the Eurosystem™s standard framework. 

However, these instruments had already been 

accepted as eligible collateral, following the 

temporary expansion of the list of eligible 

collateral in 2008. In addition, at its meeting 

on 8 December 2011, the Governing Council 

decided, in connection with other non-standard 

monetary policy measures, to increase collateral 

availability.In 2011 the average amount of eligible collateral 
was •13.2 trillion, a 6% decrease compared 

with 2010 (see Chart 32). This development was 



in uncovered bank bonds, mainly owing to 

the expiry of some of the state guarantees on 

unsecured bank bonds, as well as in asset-backed 

securities (ABSs), which was largely attributable 

to tighter rating requirements implemented as of 

1 March 2011. Central government securities, 

which amounted to •6 trillion, accounted for 

46% of total eligible collateral, followed by 

uncovered bank bonds (•1.9 trillion, or 14%) 

and covered bank bonds (•1.5 trillion, or 12%).

2011As well as marketable collateral, eligible 
collateral includes non-marketable assets, 

mostly credit claims (also referred to as bank 

loans). In contrast to the situation for marketable 

assets, the volume of potentially eligible non-

marketable assets cannot easily be measured. 

The deposited amount of non-marketable assets 

reached •0.4 trillion in 2011. The average amount of collateral put forward 
by counterparties decreased to •1,790 

billion in 2011, from •2,010 billion in 2010 

(see Chart 33). At the same time, the average 

amount of outstanding credit also decreased, by 

approximately •137 billion compared with the 

previous year, partly as a result of the expiry 

of one-year LTROs towards the end of 2010. 

Consequently, the share of deposited collateral 

not used to cover credit from monetary policy 

operations increased during 2011, whereas 

the absolute amount decreased slightly. This 
suggests that, at least at the aggregate level, the 

Eurosystem™s counterparties experienced no 

shortage of collateral. As regards the composition of collateral put 
forward (see Chart 34), non-marketable assets 



became the largest component in 2011, 

accounting for 23% of the total (compared 

with 18% in 2010). Mirroring developments in 

total eligible collateral, the shares of ABSs and 

uncovered bank bonds decreased. By contrast, 

also owing to the sovereign debt crisis in some 

euro area countries, the average share of central 

government bonds increased slightly from 

13% in 2010 to 14% in 2011.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES RELATED TO CREDIT

2011the risk of counterparty default. This risk is 
mitigated by requiring counterparties to submit 

adequate collateral. However, in the event 

of a counterparty default, the Eurosystem 

would also be exposed to credit, market and 

liquidity risks associated with the resolution of 

collateral assets. In addition, liquidity-providing 

operations in foreign currencies against euro-

denominated collateral also entail currency risk. 

In order to reduce all these risks to acceptable 

levels, the Eurosystem maintains high credit 

standards for assets accepted as collateral, 

valuates collateral on a daily basis and applies 

appropriate risk control measures. The 

establishment, as an independent business area, 

the continued work of the Risk Management 

Committee, has further contributed to enhancing 

risk management practices within the ECB 

and the Eurosystem (see also Section 1.6 of 

Chapter 7).As a matter of prudence, the Eurosystem has 
established a buffer against potential shortfalls 

resulting from the eventual resolution of 

collateral received from defaulted counterparties. 

The level of the buffer is reviewed annually, 

pending the eventual disposal of the received  

collateral and in line with the prospect of 















and regularly reported to the ECB™s decision-

making bodies.In 2011 the ECB made a number of adjustments to 
its eligibility criteria and risk control framework.Following the decision of the Governing 
Council of 28 July 2010, the new ﬁhaircutﬂ 

schedule resulting from the biennial review of 

the Eurosystem risk control measures entered 

into force on 1 January 2011.On 18 February 2011 the Governing Council 
approved the rating tool of Coface Serviços 

Portugal, S.A. for use within the Eurosystem 

Credit Assessment Framework (ECAF).On 31 March 2011 the Governing Council 

decided to suspend the application of the 

minimum credit rating eligibility requirement 

for marketable debt instruments issued 

or guaranteed by the Irish government.  

On 7
 July 2011 the Governing Council decided 
to adopt the same treatment for marketable 

debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the 

Portuguese government. The decisions followed 

the positive assessment of the economic and 



Irish and Portuguese governments, negotiated 

with the European Commission, in liaison 

with the ECB and the IMF, and were taken 

on the basis of the strong commitments of the 

respective governments to fully implement the 

programmes.Following the Governing Council decision 
announced on 16 December 2010 to establish 

loan-by-loan information requirements 

for ABSs in the Eurosystem collateral 

framework, starting with residential mortgage-

backed securities, the ECB announced on 

29
 April
 2011 its intention to introduce, within 
the next 18 months, these requirements also 

for commercial mortgage-backed securities 

and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) 

transactions accepted in the Eurosystem 

collateral framework. The provision of loan-

by-loan information will become an eligibility 

requirement upon the entry into force of the 

obligation to submit loan-level data.In the context of the measures to support bank 
lending and money market activity announced 

on 8 December 2011, the Governing Council 

decided to increase collateral availability 

by: i) reducing the rating threshold of two  

ﬁtriple Aﬂ ratings at issuance for certain ABSs 
and ii) allowing NCBs, as a temporary solution, 

to accept as collateral additional performing 

eligibility criteria. The Eurosystem included, 

among the assets eligible for use as collateral

on the basis of harmonised criteria, together with 

the aim of enhancing the Eurosystem™s internal 

credit assessment capabilities. In addition, 

potential external credit assessment providers

OREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKSIn 2011 the Eurosystem undertook one 

intervention in the foreign exchange markets.  

In response to the movements in the exchange 

rate of the yen associated with the natural  

disaster in Japan, and at the request of the 

Japanese authorities, the authorities of the 

United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, 
as well as the ECB, joined Japan, on 18 March, 

in a concerted intervention in foreign exchange 

markets. The ECB did not undertake any foreign 

exchange operations in the currencies that 

participate in ERM II. The standing agreement 

between the ECB and the IMF to facilitate 

the initiation of special drawing right (SDR) 

transactions by the IMF on behalf of the ECB 

occasions in 2011.The temporary liquidity swap line which the 
ECB established with the Federal Reserve 

System in 2007, which was reactivated in 

May 2010 to counter strains in the European 

US dollar funding markets, was extended 
twice in 2011, on the last occasion until 
1 February 2013. In close cooperation with 
other central banks, the Eurosystem provided 

US dollar funding to counterparties against 

eligible collateral in operations which took the 

form of repurchase agreements and were carried 

allotment. In addition to these regular weekly 

seven-day operations, the Governing Council 

decided on 15 September
 2011, in coordination 
with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, 

the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, 

to conduct three US dollar liquidity-providing 

operations with a maturity of approximately 

three months covering the end of the year.  

In 2011 the Eurosystem conducted 50 operations 

with a seven-day maturity, as well as one 14-day 

operation at year-end and four 84-day operations. 

In 27 operations no bids were submitted by 

counterparties. On 30 November the ECB, the 

Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the 

Swiss National Bank decided to continue to 

offer three-month tenders until further notice.  

This decision was taken as part of coordinated 

actions by these four central banks, as well as 

the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of 

Canada, to enhance their capacity to provide 

The purpose of these actions was to ease strains 

effects of such strains on the supply of credit 

to households and businesses and so help foster 

economic activity. One of these actions was the 

decision of the ECB, in cooperation with the 

other central banks, to establish a temporary 

network of reciprocal swap lines. This action 

enables the Eurosystem to provide euro to those 

central banks when required, as well as enabling 

the Eurosystem to provide liquidity, should it 

be needed, in Japanese yen, pounds sterling, 

Swiss francs and Canadian dollars (in addition 

to the existing operations in US dollars). The 

establishment of temporary bilateral liquidity 

swap arrangements among these central banks 

was agreed as a contingency measure so that 

liquidity could be provided in each jurisdiction 

in any of their currencies, should market 

conditions so warrant. These swap lines are 

authorised until 1 February 2013.88ECBAnnual Report

2011On 25 August 2011 the Governing Council 
decided, in agreement with the Bank of England, 

to extend the liquidity swap arrangement with the 

Bank of England up to 28 September 2012. The 

swap facility agreement of 17
 December 2010 had been authorised until the end of September 

2011. Under this facility, the Bank of England 

can provide, if necessary, up to GBP 10 billion 

to the ECB in exchange for euro. The agreement 

allows pounds sterling to be made available to 

the Central Bank of Ireland as a precautionary 

measure, for the purpose of meeting any 

temporary liquidity needs of the banking system 

in that currency. In the week ending 30 December 2011 
liquidity-providing repurchase transactions of  

•1.5 billion were outstanding. These transactions 

were conducted by the ECB in connection with 

liquidity arrangements in place with central 

banks outside the euro area.1.3 I
NVESTMENT ACTIVITIESThe ECB invests the funds related to its foreign 

reserve portfolio as well as its own funds. These 

investment activities, which are separate from 

monetary policy programmes such as the SMP 

and CBPP2, are organised in such a way as to 

ensure that no inside information about central 

bank policy actions may be used when making 

investment decisions (i.e. there is a ﬁChinese 

wallﬂ). Should inside information be passed on, 

be it on purpose or not, the ECB™s investment 

activities may be suspended in full or in part, 

which means that the compositions of the ECB™s 

investment portfolios compared with their 

respective benchmarks are not allowed to change.FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was 

originally set up through transfers of foreign 

reserve assets from the euro area NCBs. Over 








changes in the market value of the invested assets, 

as well as foreign exchange and gold operations 

of the ECB. The main purpose of the ECB™s 

foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever 






of liquid resources for its foreign exchange 

policy operations involving non-EU currencies. 

The objectives for the management of the ECB™s 

foreign reserves are, in order of importance, 

liquidity, security and return.The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of 
US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs. The 

US dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively 

managed by the ECB and those euro area NCBs 

that wish to take part in this activity as agents 

for the ECB. Since January 2006 a ﬁcurrency 

specialisation modelﬂ has been in operation to 

operations. Under this scheme, each NCB which 

wishes to be involved in ECB foreign reserve 

management, or group of NCBs acting jointly 

for this purpose, is as a rule allocated a share in 

the US dollar or the Japanese yen portfolio.5 The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve 

assets 6 at current exchange rates and market 
prices increased from •60.6 billion at  

end-2010 to •65.6
 billion at end-2011, of which 
•45.3 billion was in foreign currencies and 
•20.3 billion was in gold and SDRs. The increase 
in the value of the foreign reserve portfolio 

yen against the euro, along with positive 

contributions from the capital gains and interest 

income generated by portfolio management 


offset by the foreign exchange intervention in 

March (see Section 1.2). Applying the exchange 

rates of end-2011, US dollar-denominated 

assets represented 76% of the foreign currency 

reserves, while those denominated in Japanese 

yen accounted for 24%. The value of gold and 

SDR holdings increased by approximately 16%. 

This increase was mostly due to the appreciation 

of gold by around 11% in 2011 (as measured in

at the start of 2011 when Eesti Pank transferred 

its share of gold to the ECB as part of its transfer 

of foreign reserve assets to the ECB.In 2011 the list of eligible instruments in which 
the ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio can be 

invested was unchanged. OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENTThe ECB™s own funds portfolio consists of 

the invested counterpart of the ECB™s paid-up 

capital, as well as amounts held in its general 

reserve fund and its provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 

risks. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide 

the ECB with income to help cover its operating 

expenses. The objective of its management 

is to maximise expected returns, subject to a

The value of the portfolio at current market 
prices grew from •13.3 billion at end-2010 

to •15.9 billion at end-2011. The increase in 

market value was due to an increase in the ECB™s  

paid-up capital effective on 28 December 2011, 

an increase in the provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 

risks and, to a lesser extent, investment returns.In 2011 the list of eligible instruments in which 
the ECB™s own funds portfolio can be invested 

was unchanged.To comply with the strict Chinese wall in place 
at the ECB, the implementation of the CBPP2 

and the SMP led to a partial freeze in the 

investment activities related to the ECB™s own 

funds portfolio in 2011.RISK M

in its investment activities and monetary policy

a detailed limit structure is in place. The 

monitoring of limit compliance is performed 

daily. Furthermore, regular reports ensure that 

all stakeholders are adequately informed of the 

level of such risks. In 2011 the ECB continued to enhance 
the information technology infrastructure 

supporting the risk management framework for 

its investment operations and monetary policy 

portfolios. This framework now also covers the 

portfolio of covered bonds purchased by the 

ECB under the CBPP2.One of the indicators used to monitor market 

maximum loss for a portfolio of assets in a 

The value of this indicator depends on a series 

of parameters used for the calculation, in

asset price volatility. As an illustration, 

computing this indicator for the ECB™s 

investment portfolio on 30 December 2011, 


time horizon of one year, and a sample of one 

year for asset price volatility, would result in a 

VaR of •13.08 billion.
7 Computing the same 
sample would result in a VaR of •12.16 billion. 

The largest part of this market risk is due to 

movements in currency and gold prices. The 

low levels of interest rate risk in the ECB™s 


relatively low in 2011.Following the decisions of the Governing Council that the 
7 CBPP, CBPP2 and SMP portfolios will be held until maturity,

these portfolios is not included in the estimates.90ECBAnnual Report

USERS
 The Eurosystem maintains close relations with 

TARGET2 users. Regular meetings were held 

between the NCBs and national TARGET2  

user groups in 2011. In addition, joint meetings 



of the European credit sector associations took 

place on a quarterly basis to discuss TARGET2 

business issues at the pan-European level. An 

ad hoc group composed of representatives 

from these two groups was created to address 

major changes affecting TARGET2, such as 

the connection of TARGET2-Securities (T2S). 

Further strategic issues were addressed in the 

Contact Group on Euro Payments Strategy, a 

forum composed of senior representatives from 

commercial and central banks.MANAGEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM RELEASESThe Eurosystem attaches the greatest 

importance to the development of TARGET2 

in order to further increase the level of service 

offered and to meet the needs of its participants. 

In preparation for the connection of T2S to 

TARGET2, the Eurosystem launched a user 

consultation in September 2011 on the necessary 

adaptations in TARGET2. Such adaptations fall 

within the scope of the Eurosystem™s strategy 

for improving the compliance of TARGET2 

with ISO 20022 standards.the SSP was implemented.

comprised a limited number of enhancements 
to the TARGET2 system and the technical 

implementation of a network which links the

include a limited number of functional changes 
with a small impact on TARGET2. For this 

reason, unanimous agreement was reached with 

TARGET2 participants that the release would

TARGET2-Securities (T2S) is the future 

Eurosystem service for securities settlement 

in central bank money in Europe. The project 

is currently in the development phase, and 

the settlement platform is due to go live in 

June 2015. 30 central securities depositories 
(CSDs) are presently involved in the project 

and it is expected that most traded securities 

in Europe will be settled in T2S, leading to 

settlement costs. By removing the distinction

2011between cross-border and domestic settlement, 
T2S will constitute a major breakthrough in 

the creation of an integrated capital market for 

Europe, providing a solid basis for increasing 

trading sector. Although T2S is a Eurosystem 

initiative, it will also settle securities transactions 

in currencies other than the euro if the relevant 

central bank, with the support of its market, 

gives its consent.which is the contractual agreement to be signed 
by the Eurosystem and each CSD that plans 

to participate in T2S. Following more than 

two years of negotiations with the CSDs, the 

of the agreement in November 2011. CSDs 

which decide to participate in T2S are expected 

to sign the agreement at the latest by June 2012. 

The Eurosystem is offering certain incentives to 

encourage CSDs to sign in a timely manner and 

migrate early to T2S.In parallel with the negotiations with CSDs, 
the Eurosystem also continued discussions on 
the Currency Participation Agreement with the 

non-euro area central banks that had shown 

interest in allowing their national currencies to 

be settled in T2S. A task force, which included 

experts from all interested non-euro area central 

banks, actively supported the T2S Programme 

resolution of issues related to this agreement. 

Discussions were completed in January 2012 

and the non-euro area central banks were invited 

to sign the agreement by the end of March 2012, 

so that CSDs know which currencies are to be 

settled in T2S before they decide whether to 

sign the T2S Framework Agreement.Several CSDs have so far announced that 
wave: Monte Titoli (the Italian CSD), BOGS 

(the CSD for Greek government securities), 

Depozitarul Central S.A. (the Romanian CSD) 

and SIX Securities Services (the Swiss CSD). 

Full functional coverage will thus be ensured 
from the very start of T2S operations, with the 

participation of CSDs from within and outside 

the euro area.The remaining elements of the T2S price 
list, in
 particular the fees for information 
services and the treatment of markets in which  

end-investors hold accounts at the CSD, were 

list has remained lean and transparent, while 

also ensuring that settlement and information 

costs of those services. The low fees, savings 

in collateral and liquidity, and harmonised back 

major cost savings to the settlement industry. The T2S governance arrangements, which 
determine how decisions on T2S will be made 

in the future, were agreed with all stakeholders 

in 2011. The new arrangements will be put in 
place once the Framework Agreement and 

Currency Participation Agreement have been 

signed.In 2011 the Eurosystem also made important 
progress on ﬁconnectivityﬂ to T2S, i.e. the choice 

of networks through which market participants 

and CSDs will be able to send instructions to and 

receive messages from T2S. T2S will provide 

the option of connecting to the platform via 

two value-added network service providers, as 

well as via a dedicated line providing only basic 
connectivity services. A tender for the value-

added network service providers was launched 

in July 2011. Several bids were received by the 

end of September
 and agreements were signed 
with the two selected providers in January 2012. 

For the implementation of the dedicated line, 

the Eurosystem has chosen to use an existing 

Eurosystem network, which will be adapted 

for T2S.version in May for a public consultation. A
 stable version was then published in October
 2011, taking into account the feedback received. This 
version can be considered as the basis for the 
93ECBAnnual Report
2011adaptation of CSD and central bank systems to 
T2S and can be used by all directly connected 

participants when they design and build their 

interfaces with T2S.Finally, the T2S Programme Board has further 
strengthened its commitment to post-trade 

harmonisation. In 2011 a Harmonisation Steering 

Group, composed of senior-level representatives 

from the industry and the public sector, was 

established to make sure that the harmonisation 

requirements are met in time for the launch of 

T2S. For further details on T2S harmonisation 

integration, see Section 4 of Chapter 3.2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR COLLATERAL A common set of eligible assets may be used 

to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit 

operation, not only at the domestic level but 

also across national borders. The cross-border 

mobilisation of collateral in the euro area is 

conducted mainly via the correspondent central 

banking model (CCBM) and through eligible 

links between euro area securities settlement 


is provided by the Eurosystem, the latter is a 

market-led initiative. In addition, cross-border 

collateral can be mobilised on the accounts of 

NCBs with a non-domestic (international) CSD 

on an exceptional basis.At the end of 2011 the amount of cross-border 
collateral (including both marketable and non-

marketable assets) held by the Eurosystem stood 

at •731 billion, down from •762 billion at the 

end of 2010. Overall, at the end of 2011 cross-

border collateral represented 29.9% of the total 

collateral provided to the Eurosystem.COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICESThe CCBM remained the main channel 

for transferring cross-border collateral in 

Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday 

credit operations in
 2011. Assets held in 
custody through the CCBM decreased from 

•507 billion at the end of 2010 to •434 billion 
at the end of
 2011. Cross-border collateral held 
on accounts of NCBs with a non-domestic 

(international) CSD on an exceptional basis 

amounted to •122 billion at the end of 2011.The CCBM was initially set up in 1999 as an 
interim solution and, since it builds upon the 

principle of minimum harmonisation, market 

participants have called for some improvements. 

In particular, they have requested that it no 

longer be necessary to repatriate (marketable) 

assets from investor CSDs to issuer CSDs 

before they are mobilised as collateral through 

the CCBM, and that tri-party collateral 

management services which are currently 

only used domestically may also be used on a  

cross-border basis. The Eurosystem supports the 

inclusion of these enhancements to the CCBM 

and is currently working on their incorporation 

into the framework. Issues related to euro securities settlement and 
collateral mobilisation in Eurosystem credit 

operations are discussed in the Contact Group on 

Euro Securities Infrastructures, which is a forum 

for representatives of market infrastructures, 

market participants and central banks.EL

SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSCross-border collateral can also be mobilised by 

using links between national SSSs. However, 

such links are only eligible for Eurosystem 

credit operations if they meet the Eurosystem™s 

user standards. Once the securities have been 

transferred to another SSS via eligible links, 

they can be used through local procedures 
in the same way as any domestic collateral. 

The amount of collateral mobilised through 
direct and relayed links increased from 

•109 billion at the end of 2010 to •175 billion at 
the end of 2011. In 2011 three new eligible links (two direct 
links and one relayed link) were added to 

the list of eligible links. In total, there are 

now 54 direct and 8 relayed links available to 

counterparties, of
 which only a limited number 
are actively used.94ECBAnnual Report

2011In accordance with Article 128 of the Treaty, 
the Governing Council of the ECB has the 

exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro 

banknotes within the EU. The ECB and the 

NCBs may issue these banknotes.3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF BANKNOTES 
AND COINS 
DEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINSAt the end of 2011 there were 14.9 billion 

banknotes in circulation, with a total value of 

•888.6 billion. This compares with 14.2 billion 

banknotes, with a total value of •839.7 billion, 

at the end of 2010 (see Chart 35). In 2011 

the annual growth rate of the •5, •10 and 

•20 banknotes was 3.0% in value terms. The 

•50 banknotes showed by far the highest 

annual growth rate, at 8.9%, followed by 

the •100 banknotes, at 6.4%. Demand for 

•500 banknotes, which are largely used as a 



of 2011 and recorded an annual growth rate of 

4.1% (see Chart 36) after having been fairly 
stable since the beginning of 2010. The •50 

banknote was the most-used denomination, 

accounting for 41% of the total number of 

banknotes in circulation. In value terms, the •50 

and the •500 banknotes had the largest shares, 

at 34% each. 
the high-value banknotes is held outside the 



foreign demand (as well as domestic demand) 

had risen from autumn 2008, but declined 

slightly during 2010, before picking up again 

in 2011. It is estimated that 20-25% of the euro 

banknotes in circulation, in terms of value, 

are held outside the euro area, predominantly 

in countries neighbouring the euro area. They 

are mainly held as a store of value, but are also 

used for transaction purposes on international 

markets.

3.3 BANKNOTE PRODUCTION AND ISSUANCE
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS 
For 2011 the production of a total of 6.0 billion 
euro banknotes, with a value of •171.3 billion, 
was allocated to the euro area NCBs. 

The allocation of euro banknote production 

continued to be based on decentralised 

production with pooling, an arrangement 

initially established in 2002. Under this 

arrangement, each euro area NCB is responsible 

for the procurement of an allocated share of 

the total requirement for certain denominations 

(see Table 13).ROADMAP FOR GREATER CONVERGENCE OF NCB 

CASH SERVICESIn 2007 the Governing Council adopted a roadmap 

for procedural steps contributing, in the medium 

term, to increased convergence of NCB cash 

services. Most roadmap items have meanwhile 

been implemented. These are: i) remote access to 





minimum NCB opening hours for cash services in 



of orientation-independent banknote deposits and 

withdrawals as a common free-of-charge NCB 

service.The two remaining roadmap items, which are 
the electronic messaging between NCBs and 

national and international professional clients 

on cash transactions and the convergence of 

banknote packaging for NCB cash services, 

are pending implementation in the medium 

term. The implementation at the NCB level 

follows individual timetables which have been 

communicated to the European Payments 

Council and the European Security Transport 

Association in their capacity as main cash 

stakeholders at the European level. Both 

measures are intended to facilitate cash 

transactions across national borders and thus 

complement Regulation (EU) No 1214/2011 on 

the professional cross-border transportation of 

euro cash by road between euro area countries, 

which will enter into force at the end of 

November 2012.See the ECB™s website.14 A group comprising 32 central banks and banknote printing

series of euro banknotes in 2011, focusing on 

developing the origination materials (i.e. the 

master materials used for banknote production) 

and carrying out test prints to assess the 

capacity to produce the new banknotes in a 

large-scale production environment. The new 

series will retain the most important design

2011The ECB, assisted by the NCBs, develops, 
collects, compiles and disseminates a wide 

range of statistics which support the monetary 

policy of the euro area, various other tasks of 

the ESCB, and, since its creation on 1 January 

2011, the tasks of the European Systemic Risk 

Board (ESRB). These statistics are also used 

extensively by public authorities Œ for example, 

in the European Commission™s scoreboard 

for monitoring macroeconomic imbalances Œ 


the general public. In 2011 regular euro area 

statistics continued to be provided in a smooth 

were devoted to further improving the ESCB™s 

statistical framework in accordance with the 

annually reviewed work programme. Major 

challenges in 2011 resulted from data demands 

function, which can require the use of micro 

databases and registers. 4.1 N
EW AND ENHANCED EURO AREA STATISTICSIn June 2011 the ECB released new and 

enhanced statistics based on data reported by 






in securitisation transactions, and insurance 

corporations and pension funds, which broaden 
















breakdowns of monthly statistics on MFI balance 

sheet items and MFI interest rates on loans and 






corporations improve two sets of statistics that are 

important for analysing the money-issuing sector. 

Moreover, the two new quarterly datasets on the 







vehicle corporations and on the outstanding 

amounts and selected transactions of insurance 

corporations and pension funds Œ together with 

the new statistics on investment funds published 

since 2010 Œ close some gaps in the harmonised 







intermediaries, a sector of growing importance 






A new table on insurance corporations and 

pension funds has been added to the Eurosystem™s 

joint dissemination framework showing euro 

area aggregates and all corresponding national 

data on the websites of the ECB and the 

respective NCBs. The dissemination of statistics 

was also improved by, among other things,  

an educational video on statistics.In May 2011 the ECB released a new 
statistics for the euro area and the individual 

Member States. In response to the increased 

instrument, residual and original maturity, 

currency and holder were disseminated. 4.2 OT
HER STATISTICAL DEVELOPMENTSBuilding on the notable example of the 

Centralised Securities Database, which contains 

reference data, prices and corporate information 

on all individual securities considered statistically 

relevant for the ESCB, the Governing Council 

approved in 2011 the systematic collection and 

compilation of statistics on securities holdings 

on the basis of security-by-security information. 

This endeavour, which will make it possible to 

analyse the securities holdings of institutional 

sectors in greater detail, will require the 

preparation of a legal act and the creation of a 

database for producing more harmonised and 

higher-quality statistics. In November 2011 the ECB, in cooperation 
with the European Commission, released the 

results of the survey on small and medium-sized 


two years, covers all 27 EU countries plus ten 

countries in the neighbouring region, including 

EU candidate countries. The ECB runs part 

of the survey every six months for companies

measures for the mutual exchange of information 

with the European Commission and the national

continued work on developing a register of

2011Consistent with the approach adopted throughout 
the Eurosystem, the purpose of research activities 

at the ECB is to: i) provide research results 

relevant for the formulation of policy advice on 

monetary policy and other Eurosystem tasks,  

ii) maintain and use econometric models in  

order to construct economic forecasts and 

projections and compare the impact of 

alternative policy choices, and iii) communicate 

with the academic and research community,  

for example through the publication of research 


by participating in and organising research 

conferences. The following two sections analyse 

the main research areas and activities in 2011.5.1 RESEAR
CH PRIORITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTSEconomic research at the ECB is performed 

in a decentralised manner by several business 

areas according to their needs and expertise. 

The Directorate General Research is charged 

with coordinating this research work, as well 

as producing high-quality research itself. 

Its Director General chairs the Research 

Coordination Committee (RCC), which aligns  

research activities at the ECB with the 

requirements of the institution and the needs 

of its policy processes. The RCC establishes

seminar series, of which two are of particular 

relevance: the Joint Lunchtime Seminars,  

co-organised with the Deutsche Bundesbank  

and the Center for Financial Studies, and the 

Invited Speaker Seminars. These two series 

comprise weekly seminars, at which external 

researchers are invited to present their recent 

work at the ECB. The ECB also organises 

research seminars outside the scope of these two 

series on a more ad hoc basis.External researchers visit the ECB on an ad hoc basis or in the

F MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED ACCESSPursuant to Article 271(d) of the Treaty, the 
ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the 

compliance of the 27 EU NCBs and the ECB 

with the prohibitions implied by Articles 123 

and 124 of the Treaty and Council Regulations 

(EC) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93. Article 123 

prohibits the ECB and the NCBs from providing 

overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 

facility to governments and EU institutions 

or bodies, as well as from purchasing debt 

instruments directly from them. Article 124 

prohibits any measure, not based on prudential 

considerations, which establishes privileged

above provisions. 
The ECB also monitors the EU central banks™ 
secondary market purchases of debt instruments 

issued by the domestic public sector, the 

public sector of other Member States and EU 

institutions and bodies. According to the recitals 

of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93, the 

acquisition of public sector debt instruments 

in the secondary market must not be used to 

circumvent the objective of Article 123 of the 

Treaty. Such purchases should not become 

public sector.The monitoring exercise conducted for 2011 
indicates that the following cases could be 

seen as non-compliant with the provisions of  

Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty and the 

related Council Regulations. First, Národná banka Slovenska bought a 
euro-denominated security of a public sector 

entity on the primary debt market for asset 

management purposes. This was due to an 

operational mistake, and the security was sold 

immediately after recognition of the error.

timely and effective implementation of the 

Basel III agreements and liquidity standards 

(see Section 3 of Chapter 3). The ECB fully 

supported the aim of addressing targeted risk 

exposures through delegated acts that empower 

the European Commission to impose stricter 

prudential requirements where necessary to 

address changes in the intensity of micro- and 

macro-prudential risks which arise from market 

developments. The ECB recommended that 

national authorities should also be allowed 

to impose stricter prudential requirements to 

the Member State concerned. The ECB opinion on the proposal for a

institutions. These cases concerned the sovereign 

debt crisis and austerity measures, matters of 






Hungary did not comply with the obligation 

to consult the ECB on four occasions.  

Two cases which related to draft laws 

pertaining to foreign currency loans were of 


associated with foreign currency loans. The third 

case concerned the Law on the Magyar Nemzeti 

Bank, the preliminary draft of which was sent for 

consultation, but was subsequently substantially 

changed. The ECB was not properly consulted 

as regards the deadlines and the extent of the 

amendments. Finally, the Hungarian authorities 

failed to consult the ECB on a constitutional 

amendment allowing the Magyar Nemzeti Bank 

authority (see Box 9). These latter cases were of 

to central bank independence. The three other cases concerned Lithuania, 
the Netherlands and Spain. The Lithuanian 

authorities did not consult the ECB on 







entrusting certain additional powers to 
Lietuvos bankas to address the problems of 

distressed banks and providing for the creation 

of a bridge bank. This case was of general 










resolution measures. The Dutch Ministry of 

Finance failed to consult the ECB on a draft 







Dutch deposit guarantee scheme from ex post to 

ex ante. This was a clear and important case as 








the ECB was not consulted on amendments 

to Spanish deposit guarantee legislation, 

concerning in particular an increase in ex ante 

was a clear and important case as the matter 

concerned the deposit guarantee scheme and 








to the ESCB.There were considered to have been clear and 
repetitive cases of failure to consult the ECB 

by Greece and Hungary in 2011. Repetitive 

cases are those where the same Member State

capital buffer of the sector seemed to have 

half of the year. This was partly attributable to 

insurers™ preference to hold excess capital in 

order to maintain a targeted credit rating, but 

was also due to the pre-emptive building-up 

of additional buffers in an uncertain economic 

situation. A major risk facing euro area insurers 

is that a prolonged period of low interest rates,

Furthermore, low market valuations of bonds

by the current crisis bear the risk of having a 

negative impact on insurers that have invested 

in such portfolios.The hedge fund sector suffered considerable 

investment losses in 2011, albeit not as large 

as those following the failure of Lehman

period, the sector was less leveraged, which

to the modelling of bank defaults, including the interconnected nature of default risk, the 


 non-linearities and the role played by the shadow banking sector, in particular in the context of 

different regulatory environments. Another line of research within this work area focuses on 

the evaluation of different macro-prudential regulatory policies, such as capital regulation or 

loan-to-value ratios, and of the effects arising from their interaction with other policies, such 

as monetary policy. A cross-country team is developing a canonical model of such policies that 

incorporates relevant forms of systemic instability and aims to identify and assess regulatory 

policies limiting systemic risks.The second area of research deals with early-warning models and systemic risk indicators and is 
of a more operational nature. Research on these topics suggests that the value of early-warning 

indicators has increased overall thanks to improved methodologies and the use of so far less 

exploited data sources. The greater effectiveness of new early-warning tools has also resulted 

from shifting the focus of the analysis somewhat from predicting crises to predicting growing 

imbalances. In general, the work carried out by the network™s researchers within the second area 

shows how the predictive power of early-warning models can be improved by using individual

the ESAs to provide aggregated information on a 

regular basis and addresses data that are already

requirements currently being devised by the 

ESAs and the European Commission. These 

requirements will directly contribute to ESCB 

statistical work, avoid duplication of reporting 

and ensure consistency in the data for economic

been involved in several workstreams to develop 

statistics (e.g. consolidated banking data and 

securities holdings statistics) that could also 

support the ESRB (see Section 4 of Chapter 2).The ECB makes important contributions to the 
ESRB risk surveillance and risk analysis work

that presents statistical information (in tables 

and charts) and indicators broken down by risk 

category, namely macroeconomic risk, credit 

risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk,

NANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION3.1 BANKINGThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS) published its new capital and liquidity 

standards (Basel III) in December
 2010. The
 ECB actively participated in the development of 

the new Basel III framework and contributed 

substantially to the various impact assessments 

that aimed to quantify the possible effects of 

the real economy. In line with the commitment 

made by G20 leaders in November 2010, 

are now focusing on the timely and consistent 

implementation of the Basel III standards. 

The ECB continues to participate in the follow-
up work currently being carried out in various 

workstreams of the Basel Committee, including 

of the reform package in the coming years. 

The ECB also contributes to the implementation 
of the Basel standards in Europe. Against this 

background, the ECB welcomes the European 

Commission™s proposals made on 20 July
 2011 for a directive and regulation which will 

transpose the Basel III framework into European 

law. These proposals represent an important 

step towards strengthening the regulation of the 


On 27 January 2012 the ECB published 
its opinion on the proposed directive and 
regulation.17 In its opinion the ECB welcomes 
the strong commitment of the EU to 

implementing international standards and

opinion are as follows.First, concerning the proposed regulation, which 
will be directly applicable across Member 

States, the ECB strongly supports the ﬁsingle 

rulebookﬂ approach, which will ensure that 


in the Single Market comply with one set of 

prudential rules. This approach is expected to 

among other things. In this context, the ECB 

fully supports the aim of addressing targeted 

risk exposures concerning, inter alia, certain 

sectors, regions or Member States through 

delegated acts that empower the Commission to 

impose stricter prudential requirements where 

necessary to address changes in the intensity 

of micro- or macro-prudential risks which 

arise from market developments. However, the 

ECB considers it important that the proposed 

regulation makes it possible for Member States 

to apply more stringent prudential requirements 

This framework should allow only upward

principle of an EU rulebook. Furthermore, 

this framework should be subject to strict 
safeguards, under the coordination of the ESRB, 

in order to guard against possible unintended 

consequences, spillover effects and misuse. 

Second, it is crucial that EU banks are seen to 

maintain the same level of resilience and loss-

absorbing capacity with regard to regulatory 

capital as their international peers. In this context, 

it should be ensured that the EU qualifying 

criteria for common equity tier 1 for joint 


of common equity tier 1, are equivalent to the 

Basel international standard. Third, the ECB is 

which the ECB views as a key element of a 

wider macro-prudential toolkit. Finally, the 

ECB strongly supports the introduction of 

liquidity risk requirements and a leverage ratio 

into the EU regulatory framework, subject to 

appropriate review and calibration. The
 liquidity requirements include the introduction of a  

short-term liquidity coverage ratio, which aims 

liquid assets to withstand an acute stress scenario 

lasting one month, and a longer-term net stable 

funding ratio, which increases the incentives 

for banks to fund themselves using more stable 

sources on a structural basis.CON/2012/5.17 119ECBAnnual Report

minimising short-term disturbances to the

SEPAThe Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is an 

initiative aimed at achieving a fully integrated 

market for retail payment services in euro, 

with no distinction between cross-border and 

national payments. During 2011 the Eurosystem 

continued to monitor and support the work 

24 Special attention was paid to 
the migration to the new SEPA instruments. 

According to the SEPA indicators, the migration 

in the euro area from domestic credit transfers 

to SEPA credit transfers reached 23.7% in 

December 2011. As regards the SEPA direct 

debits, the migration amounted to only 0.5% 

in December 2011. An end-date regulation to 

support the migration to the SEPA credit transfer 

and direct debit schemes was proposed by the 

European Commission. In its opinion, the ECB 

welcomed the Commission™s proposal, which 

promotes binding end-dates for migration, 

deeming them crucial for the success of the 

of a long-term solution for interchange fees for 

direct debits.25 The need to urgently adopt an end-date regulation 

was also stressed by the SEPA Council, the

2011to promote an integrated euro retail payments 
market by ensuring the proper involvement of 

all parties and by fostering consensus on the next 

steps towards the realisation of SEPA. Besides 

the banking industry, public administrations 

and end-users (such as consumers and corporate 

entities like small and medium-sized enterprises 

and retailers) are represented. Four Eurosystem 

central banks also participate on a rotating 

basis.There are several areas where further progress is 
needed in order to ensure the success of SEPA. 


SEPA for cards. First, in order to enhance the 

security level of card transactions and to 

reduce card fraud based on ﬁskimmingﬂ
 26, the 
Eurosystem encouraged the market to migrate 

to EMV-chip technology and abandon  

the magnetic stripe. It also urged the different 

stakeholders involved to develop solutions to 

minimise fraud related to the use of magnetic 

stripes for as long as the global migration to 

EMV-chip technology remains incomplete 

(e.g. by blocking by default magnetic stripe 
transactions). Second, in order to create an 

integrated and competitive cards market, 

discussions with stakeholders were initiated on 

harmonised business practices. Furthermore, 

in the area of functional standardisation, 
the Eurosystem organised an ad hoc Forum 
on Cards Standardisation in March 2011. 
In addition, it actively promoted the work on 
establishing a harmonised SEPA security 

Attention also needs to be paid to innovation. 
The full migration to the SEPA schemes and 

the realisation of an integrated and competitive 

cards market based on common business 

practices, technical standards and security 

requirements form the foundation for innovative 

services offered on a pan-European scale. In this 

context, the Eurosystem stressed the need for 

to be offered throughout SEPA. Although clear 

market demand for this kind of service exists,

opened by the European Commission in 

September 2011 into the European Payments 

Council™s standardisation process for payments

relevant authorities within the EEA on the 

issue of retail payment security, a European 

Forum on the Security of Retail Payments was 

established in 2011 on the initiative of the ECB 

(see Section 5.2 of this chapter).SECURITIES MARKETS 
Since 2001 the Short-Term European Paper 

(STEP) initiative, pursued by market participants 

under the auspices of the European Banking 

Federation (EBF) and ACI Œ the Financial 

Markets Association, and steered by the STEP 

Market Committee, has promoted the integration 

of the short-term debt securities market in the 

euro area. It has done so through a voluntary 

core set of market standards and practices which 

can be applied to issuance programmes on 

existing markets such as the Euro Commercial 

Paper (ECP) market or the French commercial 

paper (TCN) market.The STEP label was introduced in 2006 and, in 
December 2011, there were 166 active STEP-

labelled programmes. STEP debt securities

 steady development of the market 
is due to the fact that STEP criteria can be 
applied to other existing market programmes 

and that STEP is regarded by the Eurosystem as 

a non-regulated market for collateral purposes. 

The temporary expansion of the list of assets 

eligible as collateral in Eurosystem credit 

operations to include STEP securities issued by 



following the Governing Council™s decision 

in October 2008, was discontinued as from 

1 January 2011. Despite some volatility in the 
outstanding amounts during 2011, the STEP 

market did not suffer substantially from this 

discontinuation and continued to grow. As of 

1 January 2012 STEP-labelled securities issued 
by credit institutions again became eligible 

collateral with the Eurosystem as a result of the 

removal of the eligibility requirement that debt 

instruments (other than covered bank bonds) 

issued by credit institutions must be admitted to 

trading on a regulated market.To increase transparency in the area of asset-
backed securities (ABSs), the Governing 

Council decided in December 2010 to establish 

loan-by-loan information requirements for 

ABSs in the Eurosystem collateral framework. 

It decided to start with residential mortgage-

backed securities, which is by far the largest 

relevant asset class, and introduced a lead 

time of about 18 months for such securities. 

This implies that the loan-level template that 

was published at the same time needs to be 

complied with by summer 2012. In April 2011 

the Governing Council took a similar decision 

on commercial mortgage-backed securities and 

small and medium-sized enterprise ABSs, with 

the same timetable for implementation. A well-functioning securitisation market, 
supported by standardisation and enhanced 

transparency by ensuring investor access to

of resilience, a few improvements to some parts 

of the framework were recommended. In 2011 

the overseers monitored the implementation 

of these improvements. At the end of 2011 

the implementation of one recommendation 
(related to documenting the obligation of the 

providers of the TARGET2 Single Shared 

Platform to provide adequate information to

with volunteering euro area NCBs, assessed 

changes to the business functionality (e.g. the 

implementation of two additional liquidity 

distribution windows during the EURO1 

operating hours). The Eurosystem concluded 

that these changes would not adversely 

affect the compliance of EURO1 with the 

CPSIPS. Overall, the EURO1 system operated 

smoothly throughout 2011 and no incidents  

occurred.CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM The Continuous Linked Settlement system 

(CLS) was launched in 2002 and is operated 

by CLS Bank International (CLS Bank). The 

system provides a multi-currency service for 

the synchronous Œ i.e. payment versus payment

relating to foreign exchange transactions. 

Through its PvP mechanism, CLS virtually 

eliminates the principal risk associated with the

INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem also has oversight 
responsibility for retail payment systems and 

payment instruments. In 2003 the Governing 

Council adopted oversight standards for retail 

payment systems which draw on the CPSIPS. 

These standards are currently being reviewed 

and, additionally, oversight expectations for 

links between retail payment systems are under 

development.The ECB is the lead overseer of the STEP2 
system, which is a pan-European automated 

clearing house for retail payments in euro and 

is managed and operated by EBA CLEARING. 

STEP2 offers the processing of different kinds 

of retail payment, such as SEPA-compliant 

transactions (SEPA credit transfers and SEPA 

direct debits) and transactions according to 

domestic technical standards for which the 

services are limited to the respective domestic 

banking community (e.g. in Italy).In October 2011 a new settlement service 
Serviceﬂ) was introduced. STEP2 arranges the 

settlement of the values of payment transactions 

that are bilaterally exchanged between Irish 

banks via the domestic retail payment system 

operated by the Irish Retail Electronic Clearing 

Company Ltd. The settlement takes place in 

the TARGET2 system on pre-funded TARGET 

sub-accounts of the involved Irish banks. The 

ECB assessed the new service before its launch 

against the applicable oversight standards and 

came to the conclusion that the new service 

does not negatively affect the compliance of the 

STEP2 system with the oversight standards.oversight assessments of card payment schemes 
operating in the euro area and made further 

progress on the oversight assessments of 

international card payment schemes. Furthermore, in May 2011 the Governing 
Council approved the mandate for the European 
Forum on the Security of Retail Payments. 

The forum, which is a voluntary cooperative 

initiative in particular between overseers and 

supervisors of payment service providers, 

aims at sharing knowledge and enhancing 

understanding on issues related to the security 

of retail payments. In 2011 the focus of the 

forum was on the security of internet payments

amendment of the Treaty (Article 136), and 

given the decision of the euro area Heads of

into force in July 2012. The ESM will in future 

replace both the European Financial Stability 

Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial 

Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which were 

established as temporary instruments in 2010. At their meeting of 11 March 2011, the Heads 
of State or Government of the euro area agreed 
to extend the effective lending capacity of the 

EFSF to •440 billion and to ensure an effective

Government agreed on 26 October 2011 to hold 

Euro Summit meetings on at least a half-yearly 

basis to provide strategic orientations on the 









and to take better account of the euro area 

dimension of domestic policy decisions. It was 

also agreed that the Presidents of the Euro 

Summit, the Commission and the Eurogroup 

would hold meetings at least once a month, to 

which the President of the ECB may be invited.2On 9 December 2011 the euro area Heads of 

State or Government agreed on a reinforced 

architecture for EMU that would include a 

on Stability, Coordination and Governance 

in the Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ.  

This Treaty, which is compatible with EU law, 
is intended as a major step towards closer and 


and stronger governance in the euro area. It is 

open to non-euro area Member States and was 

signed in March 2012 by the Heads of State 

or Government of all EU countries, with the 

exception of the United Kingdom and the Czech 

Republic. It will enter into force after it has been 

Notwithstanding the progress made in 
strengthening economic governance, the ECB 

considers that reforms should have gone further 

still. In particular, one of the key aspects of 

the required ﬁquantum leapﬂ in economic 

governance Œ greater automaticity in decision-

majority voting to the maximum extent 

possible Œ has so far been only partly achieved. 

Moreover, as regards the new macroeconomic 

surveillance framework, it remains crucial that 

the effectiveness of the new mechanism is not 

weakened by its broad scope, also in terms of the 

indicators used, so that it can correct imbalances 

and vulnerabilities at an early stage. THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER AND  THE EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY Based on the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs 

and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth,  

EU surveillance over the economic policies 

of its Member States is now organised in an 

annual cycle consisting of a European and a 

national semester. Under this new process, 

while remaining legally separate, so as to 

enhance the overall consistency of policy advice

 2011 with the publication 
of the Commission™s Annual Growth Survey,

The ECB provided its assessment of the Commission proposals 
1 in its opinion on economic governance reform in the European 
Union (CON/2011/13) of 16 February 2011.
The Presidents of the European Supervisory Authorities and the 
2 CEO of the EFSF/Managing Director of the ESM may also be 

invited on an ad hoc basis.134ECBAnnual Report

2011on 24 and 25 March 2011, provided strategic 
guidance to be taken into account by Member 

States in the preparation of their stability and 

convergence programmes and national reform 

programmes. Following a review of these 

programmes, the ECOFIN Council issued 

policy recommendations to each Member 

State in June 2011, ahead of the adoption of 

national budgets and other policy measures, 

which takes place in the second half of the 

year. In the Annual Growth Survey published 

in November 2011, the Commission assessed 

compliance with the policy recommendations at 









for 2012, in particular achieving growth-

lending to the economy, promoting growth 

and competitiveness, tackling unemployment 

and the social consequences of the crisis, and 

modernising public administration. In the opinion of the ECB, although it is too 
early to fully assess the effectiveness of the 

European semester in improving the conduct of 

 the framework can contribute to a more integrated 

and consistent approach to economic policies 

and surveillance. Overall, it remains important 

to maintain peer pressure and ensure that policy 

recommendations to Member States are not 

watered down in the surveillance process. 
As a further step to enhance economic 
governance in the euro area, the Commission 

presented, in November 2011, two draft 

regulations to strengthen budgetary surveillance 

of euro area countries experiencing or threatened 















draft national budgetary plans so as to facilitate 

the prevention and timely correction of 

under consideration within the EU Council and 

the European Parliament.THE EURO PLUS PACTAt their meeting on 11 March 2011,  

the Heads of State or Government of the euro 

area adopted a Pact for the Euro. The Pact 
aims to further strengthen the economic pillar 

of EMU and achieve a new quality of policy 

coordination, with a focus on areas falling 

under national competence which are key 

for improving competitiveness and avoiding 

harmful imbalances. The monitoring of progress 

is to take place in the context of the European 

semester. The Pact is also open to non-euro area 

Member States and, as it has been signed by 

Bulgaria, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland 

and Romania, it was renamed the Euro Plus Pact. 

The ECB welcomed the concrete commitment 

of the participating Member States to undertake 

particularly ambitious actions in areas such as 

competitiveness, employment and the long-term 

what has already been agreed.THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTIn 2011 all Member States, except Estonia,

was signed on 9
 December 2011 in Brussels, 
with accession foreseen for 1 July 2013. As a

of the General Council of the ECB and of the 

candidate countries, i.e. countries for which 

the EU has accepted an application for EU 

membership, accession negotiations continued 

with Turkey (opened in October 2005) and with 

Iceland (opened in July 2010). After granting 

Montenegro candidate status in December 2010, 

the European Council launched the accession 

process with the country in December 2011 

with a view to opening accession negotiations 

in June 2012. In March 2012 the European 

Council also decided to grant candidate 

status to Serbia. The European Commission 

reiterated its recommendation to open accession 

negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic 

of Macedonia, a candidate country since 2005, 

but no date has yet been set. The ECB continued its policy dialogue 
with the central banks of the EU candidate 

countries in 2011 through bilateral meetings 

and within the overall institutional framework 

for the enlargement process set up by the EU.  

The ECB organised annual high-level policy 

dialogues with the Central Bank of the 

Republic of Turkey and Hrvatska narodna 

banka. The relations between the ECB  

and the Central Bank of Iceland were reinforced 

and a delegation from the latter headed by 

Governor Már Guðmundsson was hosted in 

Frankfurt in September 2011. Furthermore,  

close relations with the central banks of the

IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
integration, the monitoring and analysis 
of developments in the global economic 

environment are critically important for the 

conduct of economic policy in the euro area. 

The ECB also plays an important role in the 

process of international multilateral surveillance 

of macroeconomic policies, which at the central 

banking level is mainly coordinated by the 

BIS. The ECB also participates in the relevant 

meetings of other international organisations 

such as the IMF and the OECD, as well as fora 

central bank governors.The international economic environment in 
2011 was characterised by a slowdown in the 

economic recovery, with growth declining to 

1.6% for advanced economies (against 3.2% in 

2010) and to 6.2% for emerging and developing 

economies (against 7.3% in 2010), according to 

the IMF. At the same time, external imbalances, 

which had decreased in 2009 in the context of 

and remained at elevated levels in 2011.  

remained essentially the same. As in recent years, 

the euro area™s current account was broadly 

balanced in 2011. On various occasions in 2011 

the ECB stressed the risks and distortions that 

would ensue if global imbalances were to remain 

at unsustainable levels, and expressed support 

for a rebalancing of global demand patterns. 

In terms of structural factors that would help 

in substantially reducing global imbalances, 

complete the structural reform agenda. Similarly, 

economies with external surpluses could also 

contribute substantially by increasing domestic 

consumption, developing more extensive social 

In that context, the ECB took part in the 
and central bank governors which led to an 
agreement on a set of ﬁIndicative guidelines 

for assessing persistently large imbalancesﬂ 

in April
 2011. The ECB was also involved in 
and central bank governors, a G20 Action 

Plan, which was adopted by G20 leaders 

in November
 2011. This plan aims both to 
address short-term vulnerabilities and to reduce 


commitments by G20 members that will help 

lay the foundations for sustainable and balanced 

medium-term growth. Finally, the euro area itself is subject to 
international policy surveillance exercises by 

the IMF and the OECD. In 2011 the IMF 

conducted its regular review of the monetary, 

as a complement to its reviews of the individual 

euro area countries. It prepared two reports 

assessing euro area policies, including the

2011At their sixth summit in Cannes in 
November 2011, the G20 leaders followed up 
on the commitments made at their meeting in 

Pittsburgh in September 2009, where they had 

launched a framework for strong, sustainable 

and balanced growth. The aim of this framework 

is to help manage the transition from crisis 

response to a strong, sustainable and balanced 

pattern of global growth. The framework 

foresees a process of mutual assessment of 

how the national and regional policies and 

and whether they are consistent with the 

framework™s objective. The
 G20 leaders also 
agreed on a set of conclusions to guide the 

action plan for local currency bond markets. 

In addition, in recognition of the increasing 

the G20 agreed on common principles for 

cooperation between the IMF and regional 

intended to help achieve a more stable and 

resilient international monetary system. In
 this context, discussions also focused on IMF 

surveillance, the IMF™s lending instruments, 

IMF resources and the special drawing right 

(SDR) 3 basket, as well as work on assessing 
developments in global liquidity and the analysis 

of drivers of reserve accumulation. As a follow-up to the commitment made by G20 
leaders at their London summit in April 2009 to 

increase the resources available to international 


New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB)
 4 became 
effective in March 2011. Participation in the 

NAB was extended from 26 to 40 members, and 

the overall amount of these credit lines to the 

IMF increased from SDR 34 billion to  

SDR 370 billion. Most bilateral borrowing and 

note purchase agreements signed since 2009 

between the IMF and its member countries,  

in the amount of around SDR 180 billion, are to 

be incorporated over time into the NAB.  

In November 2011 the IMF agreed to further 

amend its lending instruments to respond to the 

liquidity needs of countries with strong 

fundamentals that are affected by contagion.  
In this context, it was decided to increase the 

created in August
 2010 by allowing it to be used 
by members with 
actual balance of payments 
needs and by enabling six-month arrangements 

in addition to the existing options of one and  

two-year arrangements. Given these changes, 

the Precautionary Credit Line was renamed the 

Precautionary and Liquidity Line.5The G20 and the IMF Executive Board also 

exchanged views in 2011 on the composition of 

the currency basket that determines the value of 

role of currencies in the global trading and 

SDR valuation, including stability in terms of 

major currencies, remained valid, though there 

admission to the basket. In the current four-

currency SDR basket, the contribution of the 

euro was set on 1 January 2011 at 42.3 euro
 cent, or 37.4% of the basket on that date.  One of the core activities of the IMF, 
surveillance, underwent its regular triennial 

review in 2011. This exercise considered lessons 

for surveillance emerging from the global 

made since 2008 (including the new spillover 

reports mentioned above). It was agreed that 

the surveillance framework should be more 

integrated, even-handed and effective so that it 

can better identify and address risks, including 

stability. The special drawing right (SDR) is a unit of account used by 
3 the IMF and some other international institutions, as well as a 
potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members.
The NAB are credit arrangements between the IMF and a 
4 number of IMF member countries and institutions that provide 

supplementary resources to the IMF.

OOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES 
 OUTSIDE THE EUAs in previous years, the Eurosystem organised 
seminars and workshops with non-EU central 

banks in order to foster policy dialogue. The ECB 

also actively participated alongside the European 

Commission in the EU™s macroeconomic 

dialogue with key emerging market economies 

and EU neighbouring countries. In addition, 

the technical cooperation provided by the 

Eurosystem remained an important tool for 

strengthening the administrative capacity of 

central banks outside the EU, especially in the 

EU™s neighbouring regions, and for enhancing 

compliance with European and international 

standards.FOSTERING POLICY DIALOGUE 
The ECB continued to deepen its relations with 

the central banks and monetary authorities of 

various countries. For example, the ECB took 

part in EU macroeconomic dialogues with 

Brazil, Russia, India and China.In the context of the ECB™s bilateral relations 
with the People™s Bank of China (PBC),  

range of topics, such as the rebalancing of global 

growth, monetary policy challenges, asset price 

bubbles and associated risks, the reform and 

international role of currencies. The sixth high-level seminar of the Eurosystem 
and the Bank of Russia was held on  

3 and 4 February
 2011 in Frankfurt. Discussions 
focused on the Russian economy, on the role of 

money and credit in the conduct of monetary 

policy and on the new supervisory architecture 

in the EU and Russia. The sixth high-level seminar of central banks 
area took place in Amsterdam on 27 and 

28 June 2011 and was jointly organised by the 
ECB, De
 Nederlandsche Bank and the Bank 
of Korea, in its capacity as 2011 chair of the 

Banks. The purpose of the seminar was to 

exchange views on key policy issues of mutual 
interest and to deepen relationships between the 

monetary authorities of the two regions.On 5 and 6 July 2011 the ECB organised an 
economics conference on emerging Europe.  

The main focus of the conference, which was 

held in Frankfurt, was on the effectiveness 

of policy responses to the crisis, sustainable 

stability challenges in central, eastern and  

south-eastern Europe.The Eurosystem held a third high-level seminar 
with central banks and monetary agencies of 

the member states of the Gulf Cooperation 

Council, which was co-organised by the ECB 

and the Central Bank of the United Arab 

Emirates and
 held on 19 January 2012 in 
Abu Dhabi. The
 topics of the seminar were 
challenges in the euro area, systemic risk 

architecture.TECHNICAL COOPERATIONSince 2003 the ECB, together with the NCBs, 

has implemented several EU-funded technical 

 EU neighbouring countries. This activity peaked 

in early 2011, when the ECB coordinated the 

highest number of simultaneous programmes in 

its history.  The ECB and 21 NCBs

144ECBAnnual Report

20111 A
CCOUNTABILITY AND COMMUNICATION POLICYCentral bank independence has established itself 
over the past few decades as an indispensable 

element of the monetary policy regimes of 

both advanced and emerging economies. 

The decision to grant central banks 

economic theory and empirical evidence, both 

of which show that such a set-up is conducive 

to maintaining price stability. At the same time, 

it is a founding principle of democratic societies 

that any independent institution bestowed with a 

public function must be accountable to citizens 

and their representatives. Accountability is 

therefore an important counterpart of central 

bank independence. The ECB™s commitment to accountability 
and transparency is illustrated by its reporting 

to European citizens and their elected 

representatives, the European Parliament.  

The Treaty lays down precise reporting 

requirements for the ECB, which include the 

publication of a quarterly report, a weekly 


The ECB goes far beyond these statutory 

obligations in its regular reporting, for instance 

by publishing a Monthly Bulletin, rather than 

the required quarterly report. The ECB™s 

commitment to accountability and transparency 

is also illustrated by the numerous speeches 

delivered by the members of the Governing 

Council, which deal with a broad variety of 

topics of relevance to the ECB™s tasks.External communication at the ECB aims to 
enhance the public™s understanding of the 

ECB™s policies and decisions and, as such, is an 

integral part of the ECB™s monetary policy and 

its other tasks. Two key elements Œ openness and 

transparency Œ guide the ECB™s communication 

activities. Both contribute to the effectiveness, 

policy and its other statutory tasks. They also 

support the ECB™s efforts to give a full account 

of its actions.The ECB™s concept of real-time, regular and 
comprehensive explanations of its monetary 

policy assessment and decisions, which was 
introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely 

open and transparent approach to central 

bank communication. Monetary policy 

decisions are explained at a press conference 

immediately after the Governing Council has 

taken them. The President delivers a detailed 

introductory statement at the press conference, 

explaining the Governing Council™s decisions.  

The President and Vice-President are then 

at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 

Since December 2004 decisions taken by the 

Governing Council other than those setting 

interest rates have also been published every 

month on the websites of the Eurosystem 

central banks.ECB legal acts are made available in all the 

Governing Council™s monetary policy decisions, 

the decisions taken by the Governing Council in 

addition to decisions setting interest rates, and 


Eurosystem. 1 The ECB™s Annual Report is also 
languages. 2 The Convergence Report and the 
quarterly issues of
 the ECB™s Monthly Bulletin 
are made available either in full or in summary 

3 For the 
purposes of public accountability and 

transparency, the ECB also publishes other 

documentation Œ in addition to the statutory 

in particular press releases announcing staff 

macroeconomic projections, policy positions 

and information of relevance to the general 

public. The preparation, publication and 

distribution of the national language versions of 

the ECB™s key publications are undertaken in 

close collaboration with the NCBs.1 at the EU level. 2 (by agreement with the Central Bank of Malta, following the

CCOUNTABILITY TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTThe European Parliament, as the institution 
which derives its legitimacy directly from the 

citizens of the EU, plays the most important 

institutional role in holding the ECB to 

account. Since its establishment, the ECB has 

maintained a close and fruitful dialogue with the  

European Parliament. The President of the ECB continued to report 
on the ECB™s monetary policy and its other 

tasks during his quarterly hearings before  

the European Parliament™s Committee on 

Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) 

in 2011. In addition, he met the Conference 

of Presidents of the European Parliament in 

February 2011. He also attended an extraordinary 

ECON hearing in August to exchange views 

with members of the European Parliament 

 In December 2011 he appeared before the 

plenary session of Parliament to present the 

ECB™s Annual Report 2010.Other members of the ECB™s Executive Board 
also appeared before the European Parliament 

on a number of occasions. The Vice-President 

presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2010 to 

ECON. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell appeared 

before ECON to inform its members about 

payment issues in January 2011. She also 

participated in a public hearing on the Single 

Euro Payments Area organised by ECON 

in April 2011. Jürgen Stark participated in 

a public hearing on economic governance 

organised by ECON in October 2011. In line 

with past practice, a delegation from ECON 

visited the ECB in December 2011, in order 

to exchange views with the members of the  

Executive Board. During the various exchanges of views between 
MEPs and ECB representatives during 2011, 

a wide range of issues were addressed. The 

European Parliament expressed support for 

the ECB and its policies on many issues. It 

recognised the ECB™s success in achieving its 

determined policy conduct during the crisis, 

and also acknowledged the ECB™s constant 
and rigorous contributions with regard to 

strengthening economic governance. Beyond 

macroeconomic developments and the ECB™s 

monetary policy, the main issues discussed 

concerned the causes, impact and resolution  








fruitful dialogue was conducted on issues 

related to economic governance, and the topic 

also addressed.RESOLUTION OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISISA very important topic in discussions between 

the ECB and the European Parliament in 2011 









economic crisis (see Section 1 of Chapter 4). 

The European Parliament repeatedly welcomed 

the determined stance taken by the ECB 

throughout the crisis. It noted that the ECB had 

been successful in maintaining price stability 

in spite of unfavourable macroeconomic 

conditions and acknowledged the necessity 

of non-standard monetary policy measures.  

The Parliament also emphasised the importance 







recovery from the crisis. The Parliament 

welcomed the establishment of a permanent crisis 

management mechanism Œ the European Stability  

Mechanism Œ and stressed the need to bring the 

latter more closely under the EU framework. 
During his appearances before the European 
Parliament, the President of the ECB recalled 

the severity of the crisis and emphasised 

that the decisions taken by the ECB had been 

indispensable to prevent a further deterioration 

that the ECB would continue to do whatever 

necessary to maintain price stability in the  

euro area and thus deliver on its primary 

mandate. He expressed his appreciation for the 

constructive dialogue with the Special Committee 

on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, 

emphasising the ECB™s responsibility to 

contribute with its expertise to parliamentary 

debates in order to facilitate progress on issues 

of high relevance to the smooth functioning

the ECB and the European Parliament. In the 

course of the year the European Parliament

Group on the Fiscal Stability Union, which 

discussed the Treaty on Stability, Coordination 

and Governance in the Economic and Monetary 

Union (for further information on these issues, 

see Section 1 of Chapter 4).During his appearances before the European 
Parliament, the President of the ECB engaged 

in an in-depth discussion of the new legislation 

and encouraged MEPs to be ambitious in 

their approach. He stressed the importance 

of more automaticity in the decision-making 

procedures under the Stability and Growth 

Pact. This position followed earlier calls by 

the ECB in 2010 for a ﬁquantum leapﬂ towards 

strengthening the institutional foundations of 

economic governance in EMU. The President 

of the ECB also welcomed the Parliament™s 

contribution during the legislative procedure 

to further strengthening the provisions of the

European Parliament paid particular attention 

to the democratic legitimacy aspects of the 

new governance framework, by introducing 

the concept of ﬁeconomic dialogueﬂ between 

national and EU policy-makers and the

the third revision of the Capital Requirements 

Directive and the revision of legislation 

pertaining to credit rating agencies also started. 

were discussed. During his appearances before the European 
Parliament, the President of the ECB 

welcomed the instrumental role played by 

the European Parliament in the pursuit of an 

a true European perspective. The President 

stressed the importance of maintaining political 

momentum in order to further implement the 


European Market Infrastructure Regulation, 

he expressed a preference for an arrangement 

involving cooperation and information-sharing 

among supervisory authorities in the form 

of colleges rather than bilateral procedures.  

He emphasised the importance of sound bank 

resolution mechanisms, which would limit the 

costs associated with a bank failure in the case 

of a cross-border group. On all these issues the 

President of the ECB stressed the importance of 

regulatory arbitrage. The ECB™s opinions on EU legislative proposals

advice to members of the European Parliament. Proposals for a regulation on common provisions for monitoring

20113 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIESThe ECB addresses a variety of audiences Œ 
parliaments and the general public Œ with 

and economics. Its mandate and decisions 

are therefore explained through a range of 

communication tools and activities which are 

as effective as possible, taking into account 

the different audiences and the relevant 

communication environments and needs.In 2011 the ECB™s communication activities 
focused on explaining the events and 

economic crisis with special regard to the 

sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the measures 

decided on by the Governing Council and 

executed by the Eurosystem. The vast majority 

of public speeches delivered by members of the 

Executive Board were related to these issues. 

These topics also dominated the questions 

and requests for information received from 

the media, the public and visitors to the ECB.  

The activities of the European Systemic Risk 

role in supporting it, also featured regularly in 

the ECB™s communication activities.The ECB publishes a number of regular and 
periodic studies and reports. These include: 

the Annual Report, which presents a review 

the Monthly Bulletin, which provides regular 

updates on the ECB™s assessment of economic 

and monetary developments and detailed 

biannual Financial Stability Review, which 

system with regard to its ability to absorb 

adverse shocks. The ECB also provides a 

wide range of statistical data, primarily by 

interactive charts on the ECB™s website, but 

also in hard copy in the monthly editions of the  

Statistics Pocket Book.All members of the ECB™s Governing 

Council contribute directly to enhancing 

public knowledge and understanding of the 

Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving 

testimonies before the European Parliament and 

national parliaments, delivering public speeches 

and granting interviews to the media. Over the 

course of 2011 the members of the Executive 

Board delivered around 150 speeches to a 

variety of audiences and granted around 240 

interviews to the media. They also had many 

articles published in journals, magazines and 

newspapers.The euro area NCBs play a key role in ensuring 
the dissemination, at the national level, of 

Eurosystem information and messages to the 

general public and other interested parties. 

They address a variety of national and 

regional audiences in their own languages and 

environments.In 2011 the ECB organised 16 seminars for 
journalists aimed at enhancing the knowledge  

and understanding of the national and 

international media as regards the ECB™s 

mandate, tasks and activities. It organised 

seminars on its own and in cooperation with 

the NCBs, the European Commission, the 

European Journalism Centre and other public 

authorities and foundations. The ECB welcomed 

approximately 13,500 visitors to its premises in 

information in the form of presentations given 

by ECB staff.All documents published by the ECB 
and other information about its various 

activities are available on the ECB™s website.  

 224 million pages were viewed and 57 million 

documents were downloaded. In 2011 the ECB 

replied to around 100,000 enquiries from the 

public requesting information on a number of 

issues related to the ECB™s activities, policies 

and decisions. The online educational game

to mark the end of Jean-Claude Trichet™s term 

as President of the ECB on 19 October 2011. On 1 October 2011 the Generation •uro 
Students™ Award was launched for secondary 

school students in the euro area. This 

competition, which will be held each year, 

aims in the long run to enhance the economic 

literacy of teenagers and to give them a better 

understanding of the role of the central bank

aims to satisfy the strong need for information 

on the unfolding of the crisis on the part of the 

media and the general public. It provides, in a 

user-friendly and compact form, a summary 

sovereign debt crisis from an ECB perspective. In preparation for the tenth anniversary of 
the introduction of the euro banknotes and 

coins on 1
 January 2012, a commemorative 
of the euro banknotes and coins, educational 

material and a competition for children aged 

9 to 12 were produced. In addition, as part of 

the communication activities on banknotes, the 

Euro Exhibition featuring a range of interactive 

elements and games travelled to Bucharest, Paris 

with NCBs and other institutions, such as 

museums. By the end of 2011 around 226,000 

people had visited the Euro Exhibition since its 

creation in 2008.In 2011 the Cultural Days of the ECB were 

dedicated to Italy and organised in cooperation 

with the Banca d™Italia. Italian art and culture 

were celebrated between 19 October and  

17 November at well-known cultural locations 

in Frankfurt through a wide variety of events, 

ranging from classical concerts, a jazz evening, 

art lectures and exhibitions, as well as children™s 

events. The Cultural Days initiative was 

launched in 2003 with the aim of raising cultural 

awareness and giving the residents of Frankfurt

EUROPEAN 
SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKSThe Eurosystem is the central banking system 
of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and 

the NCBs of the EU Member States whose 

currency is the euro (17 since 1 January 2011). 

The term ﬁEurosystemﬂ, now enshrined in the 

Lisbon Treaty, was adopted by the Governing 

Council in order to facilitate understanding 

of the
 structure of central banking in the euro 
area. This term underlines the shared identity, 

teamwork and cooperation of all its members.The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the 
NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it also 

includes the NCBs of the Member States which 

have not yet adopted the euro.The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the 
ESCB and ensures that the operations which 

form part of the tasks of the ESCB are carried out 
either through its own activities or via the NCBs, 

to which the ECB shall have recourse to the extent 

deemed possible and appropriate. The ECB has 

legal personality under public international law. 

The Lisbon Treaty
 established the ECB as an EU 
institution. However, the institutional features of 

the ECB remain unchanged.Each NCB has legal personality according 
to the law of its respective country. The euro 

area NCBs, which form an integral part of the 

Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon 

the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules 

established by the ECB™s decision-making 

bodies. The NCBs also contribute to the work 

of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through 

their participation in the Eurosystem/ESCB 

committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). 

They may perform non-Eurosystem functions on 

their own responsibility, unless the Governing

153ECBAnnual Report
2011The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by 
the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 

Governing Council and the Executive Board. 

The General Council is constituted as a third 

decision-making body of the ECB, for as long 

as there are EU Member States which have not 

yet adopted the euro. The functioning of the 

decision-making bodies is governed by the 

Treaty, the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant 

Rules of Procedure.
1 Decision-making within 
the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised. 

However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs 

jointly contribute, strategically and operationally, 

to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, 

with due respect to the principle of 

decentralisation in accordance with the Statute 

of the ESCB.1.2 TH
E GOVERNING COUNCILThe Governing Council comprises the 

members of the Executive Board of the ECB 

and the governors of the NCBs of the Member 

States which have adopted the euro. Its main 

responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaty, are:to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions 
 Œnecessary to ensure the performance of the 

to formulate the monetary policy of the 
 Œeuro area, including, as appropriate, 
decisions relating to intermediate monetary 

objectives, key interest rates and the supply 

of reserves in the Eurosystem, and to 

establish the necessary guidelines for their 

implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice 

a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt 

am Main, Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an  

in-depth assessment of monetary and economic 

developments and takes related decisions 

while the second meeting usually focuses on 

issues related to other tasks and responsibilities 

of the ECB and the Eurosystem. In 2011 

two meetings were held outside Frankfurt, 
one hosted by Suomen Pankki Œ Finlands 

Bank in Helsinki and the other hosted by the 

Deutsche Bundesbank in Berlin. In addition to 
these meetings, the Governing Council may also 

hold meetings by means of teleconference or 

take decisions by written procedure.on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, 
the members of the Governing Council do not 

act as national representatives, but in a fully 

by the principle of ﬁone member, one voteﬂ 

applied within the Governing Council. In 2008 

the Governing Council decided to continue its 

existing voting regime Œ as provided for by 

Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB Œ and 

to introduce a rotation system only when the 

number of governors in the Governing Council 

exceeds 18. 1.3 TH
E EXECUTIVE BOARDThe Executive Board comprises the President and the 

Vice-President of the ECB and four other members 

appointed by the European Council, acting by

2011Three further committees exist. The Budget 
Committee, which was established under 

Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure, assists 

the Governing Council in matters related to 

the ECB™s budget. The Human Resources 

Conference was established in 2005 under 

Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure as a forum 

for the exchange of experience, expertise 

and information among Eurosystem/ESCB 

management. The Eurosystem IT Steering 

Committee was established in 2007 by the 

Governing Council, with a mandate to steer 

continuous improvement in the use of IT within 

the Eurosystem.1.6
 CORPORATE 
GOVERNAN
CE In addition to the decision-making bodies, the 

corporate governance of the ECB encompasses 

a number of external and internal control layers, 

two codes of conduct, an Ethics Framework 

and rules concerning public access to ECB 

documents.EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two 

control layers, namely the external auditor, 

which is appointed to audit the annual accounts 

of the ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the 

ESCB), and the European Court of Auditors, 

management of the ECB (Article 27.2). 

The annual report of the European Court of 
Auditors, together with the ECB™s reply, is 

published on the ECB™s website and in the 

to reinforce public assurance as to the 

independence of the ECB™s external auditor, the 


2  
Good practices for the selection and mandate  

of external auditors, published on the ECB™s 

website, provide high-level guidance for each 

Eurosystem central bank when selecting external 

auditors and determining their mandate. 

The good practices also enable the Governing 
Council to formulate its recommendations to the 
EU Council on the basis of harmonised, 

consistent and transparent selection criteria.INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB 

is based on an approach in which each 

organisational unit (section, division, directorate 

or directorate general) has primary responsibility 

for managing its own risks, as well as for 

operations. Each organisational unit implements 

operational control procedures within its area 

of responsibility in accordance with the risk 

tolerance set ex ante by the Executive Board. In 2011 the ECB continued, together with 
the NCBs, to implement the operational risk 

management framework for Eurosystem tasks 

and processes. The business areas of the ECB 

also updated their operational risk assessments. 

The ECB continued to regularly test and 

review the business continuity arrangements 

for its critical operations. Furthermore, in 

2011 the ECB reviewed its crisis management 

framework and conducted a training programme 

for the crisis management team. In cooperation 

with the NCBs, the ECB launched a business 

impact analysis to identify the time criticality of 

Eurosystem functions. The Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
assists the decision-making bodies in ensuring 

an appropriate level of protection for the 

Eurosystem by managing and controlling the 

risks originating from its market operations.  

In 2011 the RMC discussed the assessment 

of risks related to monetary policy operations 

and to the management of the ECB™s foreign 

reserves. It also considered the risk aspects of 

various options for addressing the deteriorating 

liquidity conditions of banks in countries 

under stress, the monitoring of Eurosystem

Management Division into a Risk Management 








area. It is responsible for the risk management

proposing improvements to the Eurosystem™s 

operational framework for monetary policy and 

foreign exchange policy from a risk management 

perspective. The organisational change was

banks in general (and the ECB in particular). 









Governing Council to all Eurosystem central 

banks that there should be separate reporting 

lines to the board members responsible for the 

market operations function and for the risk 

management function. This organisational 

development is in line with best practices in 

governance advocating the independent conduct 








organisations.Independently from the internal control structure 
and risk monitoring of the ECB, audit missions 

are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit 

under the direct responsibility of the Executive 

in the ECB Audit Charter
 3, the ECB™s internal 
auditors provide independent and objective 

assurance and consulting services, bringing a 

systematic approach to evaluating and improving 

the effectiveness of risk management, control 

and governance processes. The ECB™s internal 

audit activities conform with the International 

Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal 

Auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors.A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal 
Auditors Committee, which is composed of 

the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the 

NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the 

auditing of Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and 

operational systems.An ECB Audit Committee further enhances 

the corporate governance of the ECB and 

the Eurosystem as a whole. It is composed of 

three Governing Council members, with Erkki

transparency, while at the same time taking into 

account the independence of the ECB and of the 

tasks.11 In 2011 the ECB amended its Decision 
on public access to ECB documents in order to 

take into account the new ESRB-related

GEMENT 
In 2011 the ECB continued to develop and 
implement human resources management 

policies in four areas: working culture, 

recruitment, professional development and 

employment conditions. WORKING CULTURE 
In 2011 developments related to the working 

culture of the ECB focused on diversity and 

professional ethics. The ECB organised a high-

level diversity forum in March 2011, and regular 

monitoring of gender diversity data has been 

efforts were directed towards further embedding 

the Ethics Framework for members of staff in 

the ECB™s working culture. RECRU
ITMENT 
On 31 December 2011 the actual full-time 

equivalent number of staff holding employment 

contracts with the ECB was 1,609 (1,607 on 

31 December 2010).
13term contracts (limited in nature or convertible 

to permanent contracts) were offered in 2011. 

By contrast, 38 members of staff employed on a 

in 2011 (28 in 2010), following resignation or 
retirement. Furthermore, to cover for absences 

of less than one year, 147 short-term contracts 

were issued during 2011 (in addition to a number 

of contract extensions), while 123 short-term 

contracts expired in the course of the year. The ECB continued to offer short-term contracts to 
staff from NCBs and international organisations, 

thus fostering an ESCB-wide team spirit and 

cooperation with international organisations.  

On 31 December 2011 152
 employees from 
NCBs and international organisations were 

working at the ECB on various assignments, 4% 

less than in
 2010. 
In September 2011 the ECB welcomed the 

sixth intake of participants in its Graduate 

Programme. The participants, who are recent 

graduates from leading universities, have a 

broad educational background and are each 
assigned to two
 business areas on a rotational 
basis for a total period of two years. As in previous years, traineeship opportunities 
were offered throughout the year to students 

and graduates with backgrounds in economics, 

statistics, business administration, law or 

translation. On 31 December 2011 108 trainees 

were being hosted by the ECB (17% more than 

in 2010). The ECB also awarded six fellowships 

Fellowship Programme, which is open to leading 

economists, and four fellowships to young 

researchers in the context of its Lamfalussy 

Fellowship Programme. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Mobility and staff development measures 

continued to be the main tools for professional 

development at the ECB. The ECB™s internal 

mobility policy enables the ECB to broaden 

staff awareness and to increase synergies across 

business areas. The ECB™s internal recruitment 

policy also aims to facilitate internal mobility 

by placing emphasis on broad competencies.  

In the course of 2011 237 staff members, 

including 64 managers and advisers, moved 

internally to other positions, on either a 

temporary or a longer-term basis. The ECB, like all ESCB central banks, actively 
participates in the external mobility schemes 

promoted by the Human Resources Conference, 

which enables the ECB to second staff to the 

27 NCBs in the EU or to relevant international 

organisations (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) for 

periods of two to twelve months. A total of six 

members of staff were seconded under this 

scheme in 2011 (new cases). In addition, the ECB 

granted unpaid leave, for up to three years, to 
 27 members of staff (new cases) in order that they 

could study or take up employment with another 

organisation. The total number of staff members 

on unpaid leave at the end of December 2011 was 

55 (compared with 45 in 2010). 
In addition to contracts based on full-time equivalent positions, 
13 seconded from NCBs and international organisations and 
contracts awarded to Graduate Programme participants.163ECBAnnual Report
2011The ECB continued to promote the acquisition 
and development of skills and the enhancement 

of the competencies of management and 

staff. In addition to various in-house training 

opportunities, coaching services were made 

available to staff, and management and 

staff continued to
 take up external training 
opportunities to address individual training needs 


from opportunities organised as part of ESCB 

training programmes or training offered by the  

NCBs. First-level managers (59 deputy heads of 

division/heads of section)
 also participated
 in a 
structured feedback exercise in 2011, in
 which colleagues (staff and peers) and external 

counterparts completed a questionnaire on the 

managerial and leadership skills of the managers. 

Overall, the feedback was very positive. As a 

follow-up, the results were analysed with the 

support of external coaches and individual 

action plans were devised to further enhance
 the individuals™ performance as managers.THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE 
The activities of the Human Resources 

Conference and its Task Force on Training and 

Development covered several aspects of human 

resources management in 2011, including the 

organisation of several ESCB training activities 

and intra-ESCB mobility. The ESCB Training 

and Development Community, an electronic 

platform for accessing training and mobility 

opportunities within the ESCB, was launched 

in April 2011 with a view to further enhancing 

intra-ESCB cooperation. The training calendar 

for 2012 foresees a total of 46 sessions of ESCB 

training activities, hosted by 23 central banks. 

Three new ESCB training courses will be 

launched in 2012. EMPLO

TIONS
 The ECB™s employment conditions are designed 

to be attractive and to balance the needs of staff 

with those of the organisation. In 2011 the ECB 

reviewed its leave provisions. It introduced a 

longer paternity leave period following the birth 
or adoption of a child. Moreover, the length 

of the adoptive leave period was increased, 

and the minimum period to request unpaid 
parental leave and unpaid leave was reduced.  

An Occupational Safety and Health Committee 

was also established, with a view to involving 

staff representatives in discussions regarding 

safety and health issues at the ECB.As for working time-related policies, at the 
end of 2011 193 staff members were working 

part time, slightly more than in 2010. The 

number of staff on unpaid parental leave as at 

31 December 2011 was 33 (compared with 24 
in 2010). The teleworking pilot project launched 

in 2008 continued during 2011. In
 parallel, a consultation on a permanent policy took 
place. The new policy will enter into force 

on 1 February 2012. In 2011, on average, 

around 309
 staff members teleworked each 
month. In
 2011 as a whole, 826 staff members 
teleworked at least once. 2.2 STAFF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE The ECB fully recognises the importance of a 

constructive dialogue with its staff. In 2011 the 

ECB consulted and exchanged information with 

the staff representatives on changes related to 

remuneration, employment, working conditions, 

health and safety conditions, and pensions. 

In this context, 219 letters were exchanged. 
In addition, the ECB continued to have frequent 
oral discussions with staff representatives on 

employment and social matters. A discussion with the recognised trade union 
IPSO 14 led to the signing of an addendum to the 
2008 memorandum of understanding between 

the ECB and IPSO, comprising several 

provisions aimed at further enhancing the social 

dialogue at the ECB. 2.3

EW ECB PREMISES 
Construction works on the various building 

elements of the ECB™s new premises progressed 

visibly in 2011, with the high-rise structure 

growing above ground from February 2011. 

The concreting works for the new foundation 
plate of the Grossmarkthalle (the former 

wholesale market hall), as well as the structural 

works for a new basement and new ground 

Structural works for the future house-in-house 

concept were undertaken, and renovation 

works for the roof shells and the concrete grid 

facade were ongoing. Spring saw the start of 

renovation works for the facade of the western 

wing building, while the renovation works for 

the facade of the eastern wing building were 

completed in the autumn. In late summer the 

installation of new glass panes in the renovated 

original steel frames of the northern staircase 

began. Structural works for the underground 

while the main structural works for the logistics 

centre were concluded in the autumn. The 

structural works for both entry control points 

also progressed. The steel construction for the 

new entrance building to connect the former 

market hall with the high-rise was started at the 

end of 2011.In February 2011 the contract for the remaining 
structural works for the high-rise was awarded to

NVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
The ECB aims to make prudent use of natural 

resources in order to preserve the quality of 

the environment and to protect human health. 

It has established an environmental policy and 

is committed to continuously improving its 

environmental performance and to minimising 

its ecological footprint. To systematically 

pursue environmental sustainability, the ECB 

has adopted an Environmental Management 

System that complies with the international 

standard EN ISO 14001 and Regulation (EC) 

No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and 

of the Council on the voluntary participation by 

organisations in a Community eco-management 

and audit scheme. In 2011 the Environmental 

surveillance audit. A comparison of the data for 

2009 and 2010 revealed a further 7.8% reduction 

in carbon emissions over this period. As carbon 

emissions mainly arise from the production of 

electricity and heating and cooling, the ECB 

switched to 100% electricity from renewable 

local energy resources (hydropower, from the 

river Main), and improvements to the technical 

infrastructure on its main premises were 

initiated. Between 2008 and the end of 2011 
the ECB™s carbon emissions were reduced by 

approximately one-third.In addition, measures continued to be put 
in place in the context of the environmental 

programme implemented by the ECB with the 

aim of continuously improving its environmental 

performance. A sustainable procurement guide 

was developed and a pilot phase launched 

for its implementation. In October 2011 a  

ﬁgreen dayﬂ event was held to inform employees 

about the ECB™s policy and to encourage 

them to make an active contribution. Special 

attention is being paid to the establishment of  

state-of-the-art sustainability features in the 

operation and maintenance plans for the ECB™s 

new premises. 2.7 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICE

standards and benchmarks. All staff are expected 

to maintain high standards of professional 

ethical behaviour in the performance of their 

duties, as well as in their relations with NCBs,

of having a constructive dialogue with its 

staff. In 2011 the ECB continued to develop 

and implement human resources management 

policies in four areas: working culture, 

recruitment, professional development and 

employment conditions. Developments related 

to the working culture of the ECB continued 

to focus on diversity and professional ethics. 

The ECB organised a high-level diversity 

forum in March 2011 and enhanced the regular 

monitoring of gender diversity data.Mobility and staff development measures 
remained the main tools for professional 

development. Moreover, the ECB continued 

to support staff in the areas of childcare 

and the reconciliation of work and family 

commitments.The average number of staff (full-time 
equivalents) holding contracts with the ECB
 1 rose from 1,565 in 2010 to 1,601 in 2011. At 

the end of 2011 1,609 staff were employed.

the ECB also holds securities for monetary 

policy purposes, acquired in the context of 

the Securities Markets Programme and the 

two covered bond purchase programmes.  

The various purposes and objectives of the

from its investment portfolios and its holdings 
of securities purchased for monetary policy 

purposes. They encompass credit, market and 

liquidity risks. The ECB closely monitors and 

measures such risks on an ongoing basis and, 

where appropriate, mitigates them through the 

implementation of risk management frameworks. 

These frameworks take into account the 

objectives and purposes of the various holdings 

of securities, as well as the risk preferences 







They also include eligibility criteria and a system 

of exposure limits.BUDGET PROCESSSpending against agreed budgets is monitored 

regularly by the Executive Board, taking

4 FINANCIAL RESOURCESCAPITALIn December 2010 the ECB decided to increase 

its subscribed capital by •5 billion, from 

•5.8 billion to •10.8 billion. This decision 
resulted from an assessment of the adequacy of 

its statutory capital, which was launched in 2009. 

The capital increase was deemed appropriate in 

view of increased volatility in foreign exchange 

rates, interest rates and gold prices, as well as 

in view of the ECB™s exposure to credit risk.  

In order to smooth the transfer of capital to the 

ECB, the Governing Council decided that the 

euro area NCBs should pay their additional 

capital contributions in three equal annual 

instalments due in December 2010, 2011  

and 2012. As a consequence of Estonia™s adoption of 
the single currency on 1 January 2011, Eesti 

Pank paid up an amount of •13 million as 









instalment of Eesti Pank™s contribution to the 

increase in the ECB™s subscribed capital at 

end-December 2010. 
On 28 December 2011 the NCBs of the euro 
area, including Eesti Pank, paid an amount 

of •1,166 million as the second instalment of 

their contribution to the increase in the ECB™s 

subscribed capital. As a result of the above payments in 2011, 
the ECB™s paid-up capital amounted to 

•6,484 million on 31 December 2011. Detailed 
information on these changes is provided  

in note 17, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ, of the  

Annual Accounts.PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE,

E R
ISKS Since most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities 

are periodically revalued at current market 

exchange rates and security prices, the ECB™s 


rate exposures and, to a lesser extent, interest 

rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly 

from its holdings of gold and foreign reserve 

assets denominated in US dollars and Japanese 

yen, which are predominantly invested in 

interest-bearing instruments.In 2005, taking into account the ECB™s large 
exposure to these risks and the size of its 

revaluation accounts, the Governing Council 

decided to establish a provision for foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate and gold price risks. 

In 2009, following the establishment of the 

programme for the purchase of covered bonds 

(see note 5, ﬁSecurities of euro area residents 

denominated in euroﬂ, of the Annual Accounts), 

the Governing Council decided to extend  

the scope of the risk provision to also cover 

credit risk. The size of and continuing requirement for this 
provision is reviewed annually, taking a range 

of factors into account, including in particular 

the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, 

the extent of materialised risk exposures in 

for the coming year, and a risk assessment 

involving calculations of Values at Risk (VaR)  

on risk-bearing assets, which is applied 

consistently over time. The risk provision, 

together with any amounts held in the ECB™s 

general reserve fund, may not exceed the value 

of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2010 the provision for 
foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and 

gold price risks amounted to •5,184 million.  

In accordance with Article 48.2 of the Statute 

of the ESCB, Eesti Pank contributed an amount 

of •13 million to the provision with effect from 

1 January 2011. In addition, after taking the 
171ECBAnnual Report
2011results of its risk assessment into account, the 
Governing Council decided to further increase 

the size of the risk provision to •6,363 million 

as at 31 December 2011. This sum represents 

the current maximum allowed ceiling.5 FINANCIAL RESULTSFINANCIAL ACCOUNTSUnder Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, 

the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 

by the Executive Board, in accordance with 

the principles established by the Governing 

Council. The accounts are then approved by the 

Governing Council and subsequently published.FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2011In 2011 the net income of the ECB prior 

to the transfer of •1,166 million to the risk 

provision was •1,894 million, compared 

amounting to •728 million after this transfer, 

was distributed to the euro area NCBs.In 2011 net interest income amounted to 
•1,999 million, compared with •1,422 million 
in 2010. The increase in net interest income 

was mainly due to additional income generated 

on the securities purchased under the Securities 

Markets Programme and an increase in interest 

income on the ECB™s share of the total euro 

banknotes in circulation as a result of a higher 

average rate used by the Eurosystem in its 

operations decreased marginally from 
•474 million in 2010 to •472 million in 2011. 
Higher net exchange rate gains on foreign 

ECB™s participation in the concerted international 

intervention in the foreign exchange markets in 

March 2011, were offset by lower net realised 

price gains on sales of securities.losses on security holdings which are shown on 

the Balance Sheet at their market value as at 

end-2011, amounted to •157 million in 2011, 

compared with •195 million in 2010.As at end-2010 unrealised foreign exchange 
gains, mainly arising on the US dollar portfolio 

and the Japanese yen portfolio, amounted to 

•6,271 million, and unrealised gold price gains 

amounted to •13,079 million. In 2011 the 

depreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the Japanese 

yen and the US dollar resulted in an increase in 

unrealised foreign exchange gains, which rose 

to •7,976 million, while the rise in the price of 

gold during 2011 led to unrealised gold price 

gains amounting to •15,718 million. In line with 

the Eurosystem™s accounting policies, these 

gains were recorded in revaluation accounts.No impairment losses were recorded at the 
year-end. Regarding the ECB™s holdings of 

Greek government bonds purchased under the 

Securities Markets Programme, the private 

sector involvement (PSI) initiative announced 

in 2011 was not expected to result in changes to 


these holdings, as it was designed to voluntarily 

restructure debt held by the private sector.Total administrative expenses of the ECB, 
including depreciation, amounted to •442
 million in 2011, compared with •415 million in 2010. 

The vast majority of the costs incurred in 

connection with the construction of the ECB™s 

new premises have been capitalised and are 

excluded from this item.172ECBAnnual Report

STATEMENTS 
position of the ECB and the results of its 

operations. They have been drawn up in 

accordance with the following accounting 

policies,2 which the Governing Council of the 
ECB considers to be appropriate to the nature  

of central bank activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been 

applied: economic reality and transparency, 

prudence, recognition of post-balance-sheet 

events, materiality, going concern, the accruals 

principle, consistency and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in 

the Balance Sheet when it is probable that 


the associated risks and rewards have been 

transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of 

the asset or the amount of the obligation can be 

measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTINGThe accounts have been prepared on a historical 


valuation of marketable securities (other than 


all other on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet 

assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 

basis of the date on which they were settled.denominated in foreign currency are recorded 
in off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. 

At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet 

entries are reversed and transactions are booked 
on-balance-sheet. Purchases and sales of 

foreign currency affect the net foreign currency 

position on the trade date, and realised results 

arising from sales are also calculated on that 

date. Accrued interest, premiums and discounts 

foreign currency are calculated and recorded 

daily, and the foreign currency position is also 

affected daily by these accruals.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign 

currency are converted into euro at the 

exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet 

date. Income and expenses are converted at the 

exchange rate prevailing on the recording date. 

The revaluation of foreign exchange assets 

and liabilities, including on-balance-sheet and  

off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a 

currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency 

is treated separately from the exchange rate 

revaluation.Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at 
the year-end. No distinction is made between 

the price and currency revaluation differences 

for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is 

accounted for on the basis of the price in 

year ending 31 December 2011, was derived 

from the exchange rate of the euro against  

the US dollar on 30 December 2011.in terms of a basket of currencies. To revalue 
the ECB™s holdings of SDRs, the value of the 
Decision ECB/2006/17 of 10 November 2006, OJ L 348, 
1 11.12.2006, p. 38, as amended, containing the detailed accounting 
policies of the ECB, was repealed and replaced by Decision 

ECB/2010/21 of 11 November 2010, OJ L 35, 9.2.2011, p. 1, 

with effect from 31 December 2010.
These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 
2 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach 

Eurosystem operations.176ECBAnnual Report

2011SDR was calculated as the weighted sum of 
the exchange rates of four major currencies  

(the US
 dollar, euro, Japanese yen and 
pound sterling) converted into euro as at 
 30 December 2011.SECURITIESMarketable securities (other than those 

assets are valued either at the mid-market 

prices or on the basis of the relevant yield 

curve prevailing on the balance sheet date, 

on a security-by-security basis. For the year 

ending 31 December 2011, mid-market prices 

on 30 December 2011 were used.maturity and illiquid equity shares are all valued 
at cost subject to impairment.INCOME RECOGNITIONIncome and expenses are recognised in the 

period in which they are earned or incurred. 

Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of 

foreign exchange, gold and securities are taken 

gains and losses are calculated by reference to 

the average cost of the respective asset.Unrealised gains are not recognised as income 
but are transferred directly to a revaluation 

account.








Account if, at the year-end, they exceed previous 
revaluation gains registered in the corresponding 

revaluation account. Unrealised losses on any 

one security or currency or on gold are not netted 

against unrealised gains on other securities or 

currencies or gold. In the event of an unrealised 











Account, the average cost of that item is reduced 

to the year-end exchange rate or market price.






and Loss Account and are not reversed in 
subsequent years unless the impairment 
decreases and the decrease can be related to 

an observable event that occurred after the 

Premiums or discounts arising on purchased 

maturity, are calculated and presented as part 

of interest income and are amortised over the 

remaining life of the securities.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby 

the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 

agreement or conducts credit operations  

against collateral.Under a repurchase agreement, securities are 
sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement 

to repurchase them from the counterparty at an 

agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised 

deposits on the liability side of the Balance 

Sheet and lead to an interest expense in the 








such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet 

of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement, 
securities are bought for cash with a 

simultaneous agreement to sell them back to 

the counterparty at an agreed price on a set 

future date. Reverse repurchase agreements 

are recorded as collateralised loans on the 

asset side of the Balance Sheet but are not 

included in the ECB™s security holdings.  










and Loss Account.Reverse transactions (including security 
lending transactions) conducted under an 

automated security lending programme are 

recorded on the Balance Sheet only where 

collateral is provided in the form of cash placed 

on an account of the ECB. In 2011 the ECB did 

not receive any collateral in the form of cash in 

connection with such transactions.177ECBAnnual Report
2011OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange 
forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 

exchange swaps and other currency instruments 

involving an exchange of one currency for 

another at a future date, are included in the net 

foreign currency position for the purpose of 

calculating foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-
by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 

margin of open interest rate futures contracts 









 The valuation of forward transactions in securities 

and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 

accepted valuation methods using observable 

market prices and rates, as well as discount factors

the balance sheet date. Important post-balance-sheet events that do not 
affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 

balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM BALANCESIntra-ESCB balances result from cross-border 

payments in the EU that are settled in central 

bank money in euro. These transactions are for 

the most part initiated by private entities  

(i.e. credit institutions, corporations and 

individuals). They are settled in TARGET2 Œ the 

Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross 

settlement Express Transfer system (see
 Chapter 2 
of the Annual Report) and give rise to bilateral 

balances in the TARGET2 accounts of EU central 

banks. These bilateral balances are netted out and 

then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis, leaving 
each NCB with a single net bilateral position  

vis-à-vis the ECB only. This position in the books 

of the ECB represents the net claim or liability of 

each NCB against the rest of the ESCB. Intra-

Eurosystem balances of euro area NCBs vis-à-vis 

the ECB arising from TARGET2, as well as other 

intra-Eurosystem balances denominated in euro 

presented on the Balance Sheet of the ECB as a 

single net asset or liability position and disclosed 

under ﬁOther claims within the Eurosystem (net)ﬂ

in the notes on accounting policies).Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the 
transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB by 

NCBs joining the Eurosystem are denominated 

in euro and reported under ﬁLiabilities equivalent 

to the transfer of foreign reservesﬂ.TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, with the exception of land and works 

of art, are valued at cost less depreciation. Land 

and works of art are valued at cost. Depreciation 

is calculated on a straight-line basis, beginning 

in the quarter after acquisition and continuing 

over the period for which the asset is expected to 

be available for use, as follows:As at 31 December 2011 the non-euro area NCBs participating

2011The length of the depreciation period  
for capitalised building and refurbishment 

expenditure relating to the ECB™s existing 

rented premises has been adjusted to ensure 

that these assets are fully depreciated before  

the ECB moves to its new premises. Costs incurred in relation to the ECB™s new 
premises are recorded under the heading 

ﬁAssets under constructionﬂ if they comply with 

the capitalisation criteria. These costs will be 

once the assets are available for use. For the 

depreciation of the ECB™s new premises, costs 

will be assigned to the appropriate components

mainly to the transfer by Eesti Pank to the ECB

accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute of 

the ESCB. In addition, minor weight differences

This asset represents the ECB™s holdings of 

SDRs as at 31 December 2011. It arises as the 

result of a two-way SDR buying and selling 

arrangement with the International Monetary 

Fund (IMF), whereby the IMF is authorised 

to arrange sales or purchases of SDRs against 

euro, on behalf of the ECB, within minimum 

and maximum holding levels. For accounting 

purposes, SDRs are treated as a foreign currency

due to the appreciation of the US dollar and 

the Japanese yen against the euro, which was 

partially offset by a decrease in the holdings 

of Japanese yen as a result of the ECB™s

increase in unrealised gains from the revaluation

the end of June 2010. In 2011 the amortisation 

of premiums and discounts relating to these

(see ﬁIncome recognitionﬂ in the notes on

announced the second covered bond purchase 

programme. Under this programme, the ECB and 

the NCBs started to purchase euro-denominated 

covered bonds issued in the euro area with 

the objective of easing funding conditions for 

credit institutions and enterprises, as well as 

encouraging credit institutions to maintain and 

expand lending to their clients. The purchases

182ECBAnnual Report

2011Under the Securities Markets Programme, 
established in May 2010, the ECB and the 

NCBs may purchase euro area public and 

private debt securities in order to address the 

malfunctioning of certain segments of the 

euro area debt securities markets and restore 

the proper functioning of the monetary policy 

transmission mechanism. The net increase in 

this item in 2011 was due to further purchases 

that more than offset redemptions in 2011. Securities purchased under the Securities 
Markets Programme and the covered bond 

to-maturity securities and are valued on an 

amortised cost basis subject to impairment  

(see ﬁSecuritiesﬂ in the notes on accounting 

policies). Annual impairment tests were  

conducted on the basis of the information 

available and estimated recoverable amounts as 

at the end of 2011.In this context, the Governing Council 
considered the impact of the private sector 

involvement (PSI) initiative announced in 2011, 

which proposed a restructuring of part of the 

debt issued by the Hellenic Republic to secure 

debt sustainability in the long term. Part of the 

ECB™s holdings under the Securities Markets 

Programme comprises debt securities issued 

by the Hellenic Republic. However, given 

that the initiative was designed to voluntarily 

restructure debt held by the private sector, it 

was not expected to result in changes to any 


the ECB™s holdings of these securities. As at 

31 December 2011 the Governing Council 

considered that there was no evidence to assume 

that the initiative would not be successfully 

implemented, therefore, no impairment losses 

were recorded at the year-end.Furthermore, no impairment was recorded in 
respect of the other securities purchased under 

the Securities Markets Programme or the 

securities bought under the two covered bond 

purchase programmes.The Governing Council assesses on a regular 

securities held under the Securities Markets 

Programme and the two covered bond purchase 

programmes.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSIn February 2012 the Eurosystem central banks 

exchanged their holdings of Greek government 

bonds purchased under the Securities Markets 

Programme for new securities issued by 

the Hellenic Republic. The newly acquired 

securities have the same characteristics as 

those purchased under the Securities Markets 

Programme in terms of their nominal values, 

coupon rates, interest payment dates and 

redemption dates. The new securities were not 

included on the list of eligible securities that 

were subject to restructuring in the context of 

the PSI initiative.6 INTRA-

vis-à-vis the ECB (see ﬁIntra-ESCB balances/

liability vis-à-vis the euro area NCBs at the end 

of 2010 but a net claim at the end of 2011. This 

change resulted mainly from an increase in the 

outstanding amounts related to back-to-back 

swap transactions conducted with NCBs in 

connection with US dollar liquidity-providing 

operations (see note 11, ﬁLiabilities to

SIONS 
This item consists of a provision for foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 

risks and other miscellaneous provisions.The provision for foreign exchange rate, interest 
rate, credit and gold price risks will be used to 

the extent deemed necessary by the Governing 

Council to offset future realised and unrealised 

losses, in particular valuation losses not covered 

by the revaluation accounts. The size of and 

continuing requirement for this provision 
is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s 

assessment of its exposure to the above risks. This 

assessment takes a range of factors into account, 

including in particular the level of holdings of 

risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised risk 

results for the coming year, and a risk assessment 

involving calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on 

risk-bearing assets, which is applied consistently 

over time.
15 The provision, together with any 
amount held in the general reserve fund, may not 

exceed the value of the ECB™s capital paid up by 

the euro area NCBs. 
As at 31 December 2010 the provision for foreign 
exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price 

risks amounted to •5,183,637,388. Eesti Pank 

contributed an amount of •13,294,901 to the 

provision with effect from 1
 January 2011.16 Taking the results of its assessment into account, 

the Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 

31
 December 2011, an amount of •1,166,175,000 
to the provision out of income arising from 

securities purchased under the Securities Markets 








and Other interest expenseﬂ) and out of part of the 

income on euro banknotes in circulation (see note 

24.2, ﬁInterest income arising from the allocation 

of euro banknotes within the Eurosystemﬂ). This 

•728,136,234 and, together with the amount 

contributed by Eesti Pank, increased the size of the 

provision to •6,363,107,289. Following the 

increase in the ECB™s paid-up capital in 2011 

(see
 note 17, ﬁCapital and reservesﬂ), this amount 
corresponds to the value of the ECB™s capital paid 

up by the euro area NCBs as at 31 December 2011.

ECB had infringed a DSSI patent
 27 in the 
production of euro banknotes. The CFI 

dismissed DSSI™s action for damages against 
the ECB.
28 The ECB is currently pursuing 
actions to revoke the patent in certain national 

jurisdictions and has already succeeded in 

revoking it in a number of jurisdictions. 

has in no way infringed the patent, and will 

consequently also enter a defence against any 

infringement action brought by DSSI before any 

competent national court. As a result of the CFI™s dismissal of DSSI™s 
action for damages against the ECB, as well as 

the ECB™s successful actions to date in a number 

of national jurisdictions to revoke national 

portions of DSSI™s patent, the ECB remains
