ixxiIntroduct ion and Overview
The globa l recovery is gaining strength, though 
signi cant downside risks could still come into play. 
The April 2011 
World Economic Outlook
 projects world real GDP growth of 4½ percent in 2011 and 

2012, following last year™s slightly stronger 5 percent 

pace. Emerging and developing economies 

are expected to expand markedly fasterŠat 

6½ percentŠthan the more sluggish rate of 

2½ percent projected for advanced economies. This 

growth setting, and the accommodative monetary 
policies of the major central banks, revived capital 

 ows to emerging economies. It also conspiredŠin 
concert with adverse supply shocks and concerns 

about political unrest in the Middle East and 
North AfricaŠto drive up commodity prices 

close to levels reached before the 2008Œ09 crisis. 

Key downside risks include (i) oil prices exceeding 

those currently predicted by futures markets; 

(ii) signi cant 
 scal and 
 nancial vulnerabilities 
lurking behind recent benign market developments, 

especially in the euro area; and (iii) overheating in 

emerging market economies.
Against this backdrop, Europe™s recovery is 
expected to solidify. This edition of the 
Regional 
Economic Outlook puts growth for all of Europe at 
2.4 and 2.6 percent for 2011 and 2012, respectively, 

after 2.4 percent last year (Table 1). In the baseline, 

in ation is likely to pick up to 3.8 percent this year 
on the back of the economic upturn and buoyant 

commodity prices before easing back to 3 percent 

in 2012. This path assumes that the large increase 

in food and energy prices remains temporary and 

does not trigger generalized in
 ation through 
second-round effects, obviating the need for sharp 

monetary tightening, which could hurt the recovery.
Real activity in advanced Europe is projected to 
expand by 1.7 and 1.9 percent this year and next, 

compared with 1.7 percent in 2010. The landscape 

should continue to be varied within advanced 

Europe, though private demand is expected to 

continue to strengthen in the core euro area and 

the Nordic countries, largely offsetting the impact 

of 
 scal consolidation on growth, while remaining 
weak in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, where 
efforts to work off large precrisis imbalances 

persist. The Greek and Portuguese economies are 

projected to be in recession this year.
Growth in emerging Europe is expected to be 
stronger, at 4.3 percent in 2011 and 2012, after 

4.2 percent in 2010.1 The recovery is set to broaden 
as domestic demand takes over as the main pillar of 

growth and all countries post positive growth for 

the  rst time since the 2008Œ09 crisis. Nonetheless, 
large differences in cyclical positions, capital 

in ows, current account balances, and in
 ationary 
pressures remain.The recoveries in advanced and emerging Europe 
are likely to be mutually reinforcing as the continent 

bene ts from the symbiotic relationship between 
its two parts, with advanced Europe continuing 

to absorb the lion™s share of emerging Europe™s 

exports. In parallel, faster-growing emerging 

Europe™s importance as a market for advanced 

Europe™s 
 rms will expand. But the biggest growth 
potential derives from building cross-border 

production chains based on national comparative 

advantage in a diverse, yet compact, geographical 

area with vastly improved institutions. German 

 rms are in the lead in this effort. Imports from 
emerging Europe rose to account for 12 percent of 

Germany™s imports, compared with their 8 percent 

share in the rest of advanced Europe. Both shares 

are still small, leaving ample room for further 

intraregional integration.
The main risk to the outlook for Europe arises 
from tensions in the euro area periphery. Other 

global worries also pose risks, although concerns 

about overheating in the emerging economies of 

the continent are more muted than in other regions. 
1 For purposes of the 
Regional Economic Outlook
, emerging Europe comprises (i) central and southeastern 

Europe with the exception of the Czech Republic and 

countries that have adopted the euro, (ii) the European 

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, 

and (iii) Turkey.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEWxiiiStrong policy responses have successfully contained 
the sovereign debt and 
 nancial sector troubles 
in the euro area periphery so far, but contagion to 

the core euro area, and then onward to emerging 

Europe, remains a tangible downside risk. Negative 

feedback loops between concerns about the stability 

of government and bank balance sheets are proving 

dif cult to break. And concerns about weak 
 scal 
and  nancial sector balance sheets extend beyond 
the euro area periphery. In emerging Europe, 

public  nances have also sharply deteriorated 
and banks are burdened by large numbers of 

nonperforming loans. Emerging Europe suffered 

disproportionately in the 2008Œ09 crisis, so output 

gaps generally remain negativeŠonly Belarus and 

Turkey are growing very fast. In
 ationary pressures 
from high commodity prices pose challenges for 

policymakers, especially where output gaps are 

closing, food and energy prices account for a large 

share in the consumer price index (CPI), and central 
banks™ credibility is less  rmly established.
Dealing decisively with the 
 nancial tensions in 
the euro area requires comprehensive and bold 

policy action. The stakes are high. Unrelenting 

reform efforts at the national level of the crisis-

af icted countries need to be the 
 rst line of 
defense. Restoring 
 scal health, squarely addressing 
weak banks, and implementing structural reforms 

to restore competitiveness are key. Further 

strengthening the European Union-wide crisis 
management framework is critical to securing a 

successful overall outcome. The European Union 

(EU) decisions of this March are certainly welcome, 

but challenges now lie in their implementation.
Restoring con
 dence in the euro area™s banking 
system is a prerequisite to turning the page on the 

crisis. The upcoming round of strong, broad, and 

transparent stress tests provides an opportunity 

to address remaining vulnerabilities. But to be 

effective, the stress tests need to be followed by 

credible restructuring and recapitalization programs. 

Efforts to strengthen the banking systems in 

vulnerable countries will need to accelerate, and 

policies to promote deeper integration of the EU 

 nancial systemŠincluding cross-border merger 
and acquisitionsŠshould be part of the solution 
too, buttressed by further progress in strengthening 
pan-European institutions and governance. In 

emerging Europe, the main concern is mounting 

nonperforming loans, while capitalization appears 

comfortable for now. A second wave of bank 

consolidation and the prospective introduction 

of Basel III offer opportunities to strengthen the 

sector.
Fiscal consolidation and bank balance sheet repair 
are critical to defusing downside risks. Public debt 

sustainability is vital to an enduring solution for the 
 nancial tensions in the euro area and to breaking 
negative feedback loops between sovereign and 

banking sector instability. Countries under market 

pressure have appropriately front-loaded their 

 scal adjustments, which they now must see 
through. Other countries can afford to phase in 
 scal consolidation more gradually, but a coherent 
and credible consolidation strategy embedded in 

a medium-term framework is still necessary for 

rebuilding  scal buffers and quelling ever-rising 
public debt ratios. In emerging Europe, reducing 

 scal vulnerabilities is equally important. Key 
 scal 
indicators have deteriorated more than in other 

emerging economies and now often exceed prudent 

thresholds. Moreover, where in
 ation is becoming 
a concern, consolidation is also called for from a 

demand-management perspective.
Monetary policy in the euro area can afford 
to remain relatively accommodative, though 

normalization lies ahead as economic slack 

gradually dissipates. Reemerging in
 ation risks 
pose an additional challenge. In emerging Europe, 

in ation is running above target in many countries 
and second-round effects are harder to stave off. 

Tightening cycles are already under way and 
 scal 
policy should support them.
The euro area-wide safety net is being strengthened 
to address  nancial tensions and to avoid 
future crises. Commitments have been made to 

improving lending capacity and pricing under 

the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). 

Making those commitments operational by 
 lling 
in the still-missing speci cs is now essential. The 
permanent successor arrangement, the European 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
xivStability Mechanism (ESM), is taking shape, and 
is appropriately larger and more 
 exible than the 
original EFSF. A revamped Stability and Growth 

Pact (SGP) and the new Excessive Imbalances 

Procedure (EIP) strengthen crisis prevention.
Looking at the crises in the euro area periphery, 
and in emerging Europe, more broadly in the 

aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse reveals 

common patterns and suggests a number of policy 

lessons. Financial integration in the wake of euro 

adoption contributed to strong cross-border capital 
 ows into government debt, interbank markets, 
and the nontradable sector. Government bond 

yields quickly converged across the euro area, 

banks™ cross-border exposures built up, and the 

nontradable sector boomed. Policymakers failed 

to confront asset price bubbles forcefully in the 
relatively protected nontradable sector, further 

boosting its perceived pro
 tability. After many years 
of ever-higher current account de
 cits and eroding 
competitiveness, 
 nancing abruptly dried up, 
plunging the economies into deep recessions. Large 

adjustment needs, high indebtedness, and negative 

feedback loops between banking and sovereign 

instability make for a protracted recovery.
Yet, 
 nancial integration does not lead inexorably 
to such boom and bust cycles and, in fact, 

can contribute to income convergence. The 

internationalization of banking was not adequately 

matched by regulatory, supervisory, and banking 

reforms. National authorities retained ultimate 

responsibility, including for any public rescues. 

Moreover, 
 nancial markets failed to re
 ect 
mounting vulnerabilities in risk premiums until it 
was too late for a soft landing.
Stepping back from 
 nancial integration would be 
wrong. Instead, integration should be completed 

and adequate supportive policies should be put in 

place. Obstacles to cross-border equity investments 

and mergers and acquisitions should be removed so 

that debt  ows are no longer favored. Competition 
in the nontradable sector should be sharpened and 

policies should swiftly address any future asset price 
bubbles to avoid luring investment into relatively 

unproductive uses. Banking supervision, regulation, 

and resolution need to be elevated to the level at 

which banks operate in a 
 nancially integrated 
region.Overcoming the crises in Europe ultimately 
requires restoring productivity growth in the 

af icted countriesŠa task that goes well beyond 
the changes in European governance frameworks 

and the completion of 
 nancial integration. Labor 
productivity growth fell short in these countries 

over the past decade, despite ample access to 

 nancing from abroad. Fostering the return to a 
vibrant tradable sector is a multifaceted undertaking, 
but  rst results are already in hand in the Baltic 
countries and in Bulgaria, as well as in Ireland and 

Spain, where export growth is picking up sharply 

and competitiveness indicators are improving.
The remainder of this edition of the 
Regional 
Economic Outlook discusses in more detail the 
outlook and policy priorities for advanced Europe 

in Chapter 1 and for emerging Europe in Chapter 2. 

The role of 
 nancial integration in the buildup and 
resolution of imbalances within the euro area and 

adjacent countries is analyzed in Chapter 3. The 

Appendix lists current IMF arrangements with 

European countries. 
11. Advanced  Europe: Tackling the Sovereign Crisis
Despite   headwinds from sovereign and 
 nancial tensions, 
the recovery continues. But downside risks still loom large, 

and divergences across advanced Europe persist. To avoid 

a protracted period of low growth punctuated by economic, 

 nancial, and social crises, further bold measures at the 
national level are needed to address weak banks, credibly 

restore 
 scal health, and bolster structural reforms. 
An additional strengthening of the EU-wide policy 

response, building on the March 24Œ25 decisions, will also 

be essential, as will stronger economic governance and an 

integrated 
 nancial stability framework at the EU level 
to prevent the buildup of macroeconomic imbalances as 

witnessed prior to the crisis. Meanwhile, monetary policy 

can remain accommodative, though normalization lies ahead 

as economic slack wanes and the balance of in
 ation risks 
shifts.
Recovery ContinuesRecovery Is Becoming More Self-Sustained …Despite lingering 
 nancial tensions, growth in 
advanced Europe has strengthened. The initial 

momentum provided by 
 scal stimulus, the 
restocking cycle, and the global upswing is gradually 

giving way to a more broadly based recovery in 

which private domestic demand is playing a larger 

role (Figure 1.1). And while the worst postwar 

recession is likely to leave lasting scars on the 
level
 of output, the recovery is now tracking the pattern 

and timing of past upturns in the euro area, with 

growth
 back to precrisis rates two and a half years 
after the failure of Lehman Brothers (Figure 1.2).
However, this general picture masks substantial 
divergences in growth trajectories (Figure 1.3 and 

Table 1 in the Introduction and Overview). The 

initial recovery in the core euro area and Nordic 

countries occurred at a more gradual pace than 

elsewhere in the world. But government-supported 

work-time reductions minimized the upsurge in 

unemployment (for example, in Germany and Italy)

to households (for instance, in France), sowing the 

seeds for private consumption to resume gradually 

as the employment outlook stabilized. In turn, the 

improvement in pro
 tability prompted 
 rms to 
unfreeze the investment plans put on ice during 

the crisis, even as banks remained reluctant to lend, 

while the robust recovery in global trade continued 

to support the more competitive economies, 

including Germany and Sweden, which rebounded 

 rmly in 2010 (Box 1.1).
Conversely, in the most vulnerable euro area 
countries, the correction of precrisis imbalances 

has forced a major adjustment. Front-loaded 
 scal 
tightening under intense market pressures and 

continuous private sector deleveraging are taking 

their toll on activity. As detailed in Chapter 3, 

a legacy of poor competitiveness and inappropriate 

trade specialization also hinder export growth, and 

current account de
 cits remain large, especially 
in Greece and Portugal (Chen, Milessi-Ferretti, 

and Tressel, forthcoming; and Jaumotte and

Currentof the real estate bubble triggered extensive job 
loss in the construction and 
 nancial sectors. 
The UK economy is facing considerable short-

term uncertainty, as growth turned 
 at in late 
2010Štaking out temporary weather-related 

effectsŠand  scal consolidation accelerates. 
However, the adjustment of its exchange rate and 

its accommodative monetary policy stance should 

help mitigate the contractionary effect of its sizable 

up-front  scal adjustment.
Unemployment responses to the crisis have varied 
extensively across countries (Figure 1.4). In most 

of Northern Europe, the deterioration in labor 

markets was generally contained compared with 

past recessionsŠdespite a more severe output 

contractionŠwith  rms resorting to labor 
hoarding. In some countries, part-time schemes 
further supported job retention. In Germany and 

Norway, for example, the unemployment rate barely 

inched up during the crisis. In contrast, it rose 

markedly in some other countries, such as Spain 

and Ireland, where activity in the construction 

sector contracted sharply following the burst of 

housing bubbles, leaving many low-skilled workers 

without jobs. Youth unemployment, in particular, 

increased substantially. In extreme cases like Spain, 

close to one young worker out of two is now out 

of work, raising the specter of a ﬁlost generation.ﬂ 

Likewise, temporary contract workers bore the 

greatest burden of the adjustment, and where 

it was not already high before the crisis, the 

long-term unemployment rate is creeping up. 
1. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS3Because adjustments have been concentrated in 
these speci c populations, they are likely to be 
associated with losses in human capital and rising 
inequality, potentially threatening Europe™s social 

cohesion and stability.
… Despite Divergent Growth and Financial TensionsProtracted recessions in part of the euro area 
present challenges to growth in advanced Europe. 

So far, the growing traction from domestic demand 

has remained immune to the slump in the euro 

area periphery. This is not surprising, given limited 

trade linkages between northern Europe and the 

euro area periphery (Table 1.1). For example,

4Box 1.1Domestic Demand and Recovery in the Large Euro Area CountriesGiven lingering uncertainties and market pressures, what does the future hold for domestic demand in the euro area? This box 
investigates the question using econometric analysis for the four largest countries of the euro area, and 
 nds that growth divergences 
will continue to be underpinned by differing trajectories for domestic demand. For Germany, the worst of the crisis seems over 
and domestic demand is set to expand. At the other end of the spectrum, the adjustment in Spain still has a long way to go. France 
stands in between, as its strong social safety net tends to smooth 
 uctuations. Although domestic demand has recovered moderately, Italy™s 
growth prospects remain weak against the backdrop of trend losses in competitiveness.
While private domestic demand is beginning to play a larger role in the euro area recovery, there are important 
differences across the four largest economies (
 rst 
 gure). Consumption is recovering in France and Italy, while 
it remains fairly sluggish in Germany and is barely growing in Spain (on a cumulative quarter-over-quarter basis 

since 2009:Q2). Investment is on the rebound in Germany, but it remains sluggish in Italy and lagging in France, 

and it continues to plunge in Spain. This box will elaborate on these dynamics and offer some implications for the 

recovery looking ahead, drawing on behavioral equations for consumption and investment estimated for each of 

the four large euro area countries.
ConsumptionImproving income and labor market conditions are supportive, while stabilization in credit markets is a boon in Italy and Franc
e, 
although negative wealth effects remain a drag in Spain 
(second  gure)
.The divergent income dynamics that supported consumption in Spain but not in Germany during the crisis 
are now reversing (third 
 gure). In Spain, despite skyrocketing unemployment, overall real disposable income 
was resilient during the crisis, re
 ecting increased transfers and postponed tax payments. In Germany, despite 
good employment performance during the crisis, a drop in self-employed earnings and capital income drove 

real disposable income down marginally. However, disposable income is picking up in Germany and is poised 

to support consumption in the coming quarters, while ongoing labor market adjustment and 
 scal withdrawal 
in Spain may weaken consumption.

-8-6-4-202468101. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS5Wealth effects continue to restrain consumption 
in Spain, while they have turned supportive 

elsewhere. Wealth effects exerted a strong drag on 

consumption during the downturn in all countries 

but GermanyŠwhere real estate prices had 

remained muted before the crisis. Since then, the 

pickup in 
 nancial wealth and housing prices has 
started to support consumption again in France 

and, to a lesser extent, in Italy. However, Spain 

continues to experience a signi
 cant housing 
market correction that will hinder consumption in 

the near term.
While car scrapping schemes played a stabilizing role 
during and beyond the recession, their withdrawal is 

weakening consumption. In Germany, almost all the 

support provided during the crisis has already been 

subtracted, but in Spain further negative ﬁpaybackﬂ 

effects are possible in the coming quarters.
Investment

The accelerator effect has turned positive, except in Spain, but higher labor costs remain a constraint, as do higher costs of 
capital, except in Germany 
(fourth 
 gure)
.The growth accelerator will continue to support investment as the recovery strengthens, but Spain™s depressed 
outlook will remain a constraint. The growth rebound in Germany pushed up demand for capital goods from 

 rms to a much larger extent than in Italy and France. In Spain, a depressed outlook continues to weigh on 
investment decisions.
The negative effect of higher labor costs on 
 rms™ pro
 tability will wane, while stabilizing credit supply is poised 
to support investment again, with Spain the exception. Re

Gradual repair of banks™ balance sheets and the stabilization in lending conditions will, to some extent, provide 

increasing support to investment, although Spain™s ongoing housing market correction will be a curb in the near 

term. In addition, increasing tiering in costs of capital will remain a challenge as long as sovereign bond markets 

stay under pressure.

(2009:Q2–2010:Q4)banking sectors, while pressuring banks™ balance 
sheetsŠwhich contain signi
 cant amounts of 
domestic sovereign bonds. This adverse feedback 

loop between the sovereign and the banking sectors 

in the periphery threatened to fundamentally 

disrupt funding markets (Figure 1.5). Pressures 

became increasingly severe in Ireland and led the 

authorities to embark on an adjustment program 

supported by the EU and the IMF (Appendix). 

Similarly, Portugal has now asked for external 

 nancial assistance.
Spillovers to the real economy have nonetheless 
remained largely con
 ned to affected countries. 
The crisis-management framework put in place 

in the spring was activated quickly. The European 

Central Bank (ECB) stepped up its Securities Markets 

Program, which has now accumulated •76.1 billion 

of securities. The European safety net set up in May 

2010 was tapped to fund part of the Irish program, 

with the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) 
Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland sell less than 
6 percent of their exports to Greece, Ireland, 

Portugal, and Spain combined, two to three times 

less than combined trade with the dynamic regions 
of central and eastern Europe and emerging Asia. 

This disconnect is somewhat less evident for the 

United Kingdom, given its tight trade linkages with 

Ireland, although the depreciation of the pound has 

cushioned the effects.
The renewed bout of 
 nancial turmoil has 
arguably mattered more. As the situation in the 

Irish banking sector deteriorated, a new wave of 

market turbulence erupted in November 2010. 

Sovereign risks intensi
 ed again in the euro area 
periphery countries, spilling over to more countries, 

including Belgium and Italy. Government bond 

spreads surged to substantially higher levels than 

those experienced during the turmoil in May 2010. 

These developments raised further concerns about 

periphery governments™ ability to support still-weak 
Box 1.1 (concluded) 1. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS7economies, where better employment prospects 
have improved households™ income outlooks, 

despite higher commodity prices. Although 
 scal 
consolidation is set to dampen growth somewhat, 

steps taken to restore the soundness of public 

 nances will bolster con
 dence and help pave 
the way for a more solid medium-term outlook. 

Robust growth in emerging countries and better 

short-term prospects in the United States will 

continue to provide support to the tradable 

sector (Figure 1.7), but less so in the euro area 
periphery countries, which will suffer from deeper 

 scal austerity measures, sharper private sector 
balance sheet deleveraging, and more severe 

structural unemployment. Thus, intra-euro area 

growth differentials will persist, with 2011 growth 

projected to range between Œ3 percent in Greece 

and 2½ percent or more in Austria, Finland, 

Germany, and Luxembourg.
The outlook also foresees differentiated 
recoveries outside the euro area, although for 

different reasons. Despite some support from the 

depreciated pound and a rapid unfreezing of past 

investment decisions, stronger headwinds from a 

front-loaded  scal strategy and higher household 
debt levels will restrain growth somewhat in the 
successfully issuing its  rst supporting bond in 
January 2011. In addition, the ECB extended the full 

allotment regime of its re
 nancing operations until at 
least July 2011. These measures helped mitigate the 

perception of risk for core countries™ banks, though 

without completely eliminating it (Figure 1.6). 

And a concomitant strengthening of national reforms 

allowed Spain to decouple from other periphery 

countries in early 2011.The Outlook Remains for Uneven Growth …Growth prospects will depend critically on the 
way in which the remaining tensions in the euro 

area periphery and European 
 nancial sectors are 
resolved. Under the assumption of credible policies 

to restore con dence and address underlying 
weaknesses (see below), the forecast remains for 

a gradual and uneven expansion, with countries 

under market pressures continuing to lag behind 

the recovery in northern Europe. Real GDP 

is projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2011 

and 1.8 percent in 2012 in the euro area, driven 

by the strengthening recoveries in Germany, 

France, and other smaller northern euro area

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
8One overarching concern is whether the recoveryŠ
and investment, in particularŠcan proceed despite 
persistent weaknesses in European banking 

sectors. As discussed earlier (IMF, 2009), recoveries 

following 
 nancial crises tend to be weak, with 
 rms™ investments suffering particularly badly 
from sluggish credit. Although these features have 

de nitely been at play in advanced Europe since 
2008, no decisive evidence yet indicates that a true 

credit crunch is taking hold. Household credit has 

begun to recover and credit to enterprises appears 

to have bottomed out in the euro area, as banks 

managed to slow down the deleveraging process 

(Figure 1.8 and Box 1.2). Moreover, enterprise 

credit is typically a lagging indicator because 
 rms 
United Kingdom, to 1.7 percent in 2011 and 2.3 percent in 2012. Switzerland, having suffered 

less from the global crisis and bene ting from a 
healthy 
 scal outlook, is more advanced in the 
recovery cycle, although the appreciation of its 

currency will weigh on exports. All in all, growth 

can be expected to converge gradually toward 

potential, at 2.4 percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent 
in 2012. In Sweden, rapidly improving 
 nancial 
conditions have propelled the economy out of 

recession faster than elsewhere, but with growth 

foreseen at 3.8 percent in 2011 and 3.5 percent in 
2012, the  rst signs of overheating, especially in the 
real estate sector, are emerging.

shift away from wholesale funding, and the 
normalizing of monetary conditions will force 

banks to reprice risk. In the meantime, banks in the 

euro area periphery countries will also have to work 

through a growing share of doubtful assets.
… With Substantial Downside RisksIn that context, although the resilience of the global 

recovery could provide somewhat stronger-than-

expected momentum to the recovery in advanced 

Europe, downside risks still loom large. Japan™s

initially  nance new investment from internal 
resources. Indeed, the balance sheets of large 

 rms in the core economies are generally in good 
shape, allowing them to self-
 nance their expansion 
projects and, in some places, to provide funding to 

suppliersŠthus alleviating somewhat the tighter 
lending standards affecting small and medium 
enterprises. Large 
 rms have also continued tapping 
capital markets at costs that remain attractive by 

historical standards. Barring a shock to con
 dence, 
investment is therefore expected to continue 

recovering in the near term, albeit gradually. 

However, constraints on bank intermediation 

are likely to appear during the next few years, as

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
10Box 1.2 Deleveraging in the Euro AreaDespite some reduction since the beginning of 
the crisisŠmainly through higher capitalŠeuro 

area banks™ leverage remains high by international 

standards.
1 In the run-up to the crisis, euro area 
banks had high leverage multiples (asset to capital 

ratios) that allowed them to turn relatively low 

operating performance into high return on equity 

( rst 
 gure). This high leverage was achieved 
through heavy reliance on short-term wholesale 

funding, which dried up as counterparty risk 

concerns related to subprime and periphery debt 

exposures surged. Reductions in bank leverage 

ratios have been particularly strong in the euro 

area periphery (Ireland, Greece, and Spain), 

even though large banks in these countries were 

generally less leveraged than those in the core. 

Deleveraging also occurred in core countries, 

particularly in Austrian, Belgium, French, and 

Italian banks. The reduction was achieved mostly 

through an increase in capital buffers, although 

a decline in assets took place in the context 

of bank restructuring in Ireland, Belgium, and 

Luxembourg (second 
 gure). 
While the overall level of assets changed relatively 
little, two speci
 c classes of assetsŠinternational 
claims and loansŠcontracted signi cantly in the 
wake of the crisis. International claims, which 

expanded steadily in the years before the crisis, 

contracted sharply as interbank markets froze during 

the global crisis, and again during the Greek crisis 

in May 2010 as wholesale funding markets came 

under stress (third  gure). Among domestic claims, 
the bulk of the adjustment was driven by loans to 

non nancial corporations, which declined in the 
periphery (Ireland, Spain), but also in countries 

whose banks were exposed to subprime products 

(Germany, Belgium). Lending to households has 

been more resilient overall and continued to expand 

in the majority of countries (fourth 
 gure).

Contributions to Change in Bank Leverage(Percent)1. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS11Ongoing regulatory reforms to reduce banking 
sector vulnerabilities may reinforce deleveraging 

pressures. The new set of regulations known as 

Basel III designed by the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision (BCBS) requires higher and 

better quality of capital, especially for systemically 

important 
 nancial institutions (SIFIs). IMF analysis 
estimates that implementation of the Basel III rules 

over a three-year period could reduce European 

SIFIs core Tier 1 ratios by as much as 2.1 percentage 

points, from 9.0 to 6.9 percent (Ötker-Robe, 

Pazarbasioglu, and others, 2010), some of which 

would need to be offset by banks. This could entail 

in particular further deleveraging during the coming 

years and result in further contractions in some asset 

classes if retained earnings fall short or additional 

capital cannot be raised easily. However, because 

implementation is spread out over eight yearsŠuntil 

early 2019Šthe impact on assets may be weaker. 
In turn, deleveraging is likely to dampen future 
activity, although the effect appears manageable. 

Deleveraging affects real activity through two 

opposing channels. Lower bank leverage has 

a con dence-enhancing effect as larger capital 
buffers increase banking sector soundness and lead 
to lower risk premiums and cheaper funding, in 

turn supporting credit. Nonetheless, deleveraging 

caused by the shrinking of assets can constrain 

bank credit supply, and hence, activity. Estimates 

coordinated by the Financial Stability Board and the 

BCBSŠin which the IMF participatedŠsuggest, 

however, that the impact on aggregate output 

of the transition toward higher capital standards 

would remain modest: An increase by 1 percentage 

point in the capital target over an eight-year period 

would shave off 0.1 percent from the level of GDP 

(Macroeconomic Assessment Group, 2010). 
Deleveraging would also negatively affect credit. A complementary econometric panel analysis shows that 
credit growth, both to 
 rms and households, is negatively affected by bank leverage. The effects are relatively 
large for the corporate sector, with a 10 percent increase in bank leverage estimated to reduce credit growth 

to non nancial enterprises by 2¾ percent in the euro area. Because initial conditions differ, the impact varies 
across euro area countries ( fth 
 gure). The analysis also points to the role of household indebtedness in 
dampening credit, both to households and  rms, suggesting that the legacy of the crisis and necessary private 
sector balance sheet adjustment will weigh on lending in the near term, independently of bank deleveraging. 

A 10 percent increase in the household debt ratio is estimated to reduce credit growth by 3 percent in the euro 

area, as banks compensate for higher risks or lower return on their stock of mortgages, or on new loans, by 

tightening lending standards across a broader set of borrowers, while more indebted households reduce their 

demand for credit. Change in International Claims of Euro Area Banks

12by a shrinking investor base. In addition, as 
explained in the April 2011 Global Financial Stability Report
 (IMF, 2011), banks™ reluctance 
to deleverageŠas they then have to book the 

accompanying lossesŠhave made them increasingly 

eager to 
 nd alternative funding sources to reduce 
dependence on wholesale markets. In some 

countries (for example, Spain and Greece), this 

has triggered a competition war for retail deposits, 

putting unsustainable pressures on interest margins. 

In other countries, covered bonds issuance has 

picked up, but over-collateralization required even 

for the best rated banks means that only a limited 
portion of their balance sheets can be funded in 

this way. And reliance on ECB funding has become 

entrenched for a number of second-tier banks 

in large European countries; nearly all banks in 

Greece, Ireland, and Portugal; and some small and 

mid-sized Spanish saving banks.
With liquidity pressures remaining acute, a negative 
shock could rapidly spill over through the periphery 

and potentially beyond. Despite some reduction 

during the last year, cross-border exposures 
East, and disruptions to energy supplies could 
derail global growth, with detrimental consequences 

for the most export-dependent European countries, 

and for private consumption. Deep-rooted 
 nancial 
and structural problems in the most vulnerable 

euro area countries are likely to keep European 

con dence volatile, and new spells of anxiety in 
 nancial markets could emerge if, for example, the 
political resolve to tackle the crisis disappoints.
A major point of pressure in the immediate future 
stems from large rollover needs in euro area 

periphery countries from both the banking and 

the sovereign sectors. Combined bonds due in 

2011 amount to 10 percent of GDP or more in 

Greece, Portugal, and SpainŠroughly twice the 

2007 amount. Rollover needs have also increased 

signi cantly in Belgium, Ireland, and the United 
Kingdom. More generally, crisis-related funding 

pressures in high-de cit countries have forced 
governments to assume additional risks by shifting 

to shorter maturities and to rely more heavily on 

private syndication (De Broeck and Guscina, 2011). 

In periphery countries, this pressure is compounded

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
14are the foundation for restoring con dence in the 
countries under severe market pressures. In the 

euro area periphery, adjustments to past imbalances 

will take time to deliver better growth and 

employment prospects. Measures to date have been 

wide ranging (Table 1.2). But it will be essential for 

governments to maintain their resolve to tackle 

 scal consolidation, repair their 
 nancial systems, 
and continue critical structural reforms.
Structural reforms will also be needed elsewhere 
in Europe because solid sustainable growth will 

be a major postcrisis antidote to entrenched 

unemployment, declining standards of living, and 

deteriorating  scal positions. Efforts to increase 
employment rates in the core euro area and to 

improve educational outcomes in the whole region 

would go a long way to achieving these goals. 

In Scandinavian countries, measures are already 

in the works to lower labor taxation (Sweden) or 

reorient labor market policies toward upgrading 

skills (Denmark). The agreement by European 

leaders on the ﬁPact for the euroﬂ is encouraging 

in the sense that it cuts through the debate about 
whether and what reforms are still needed, but 

national authorities must now commit to the 

immediate implementation of speci
 c actions. 
In parallel, better surveillance needs to be established 

within the euro area to  ag and to nip in the bud 
future macroeconomic imbalances to avoid a replay 

of the current crisis (see Chapter 3). 
These reforms can and should go hand in hand with 
reducing inequalities, which are strongly linked to 

unemployment and more generally to the low rate 

of labor utilization in Europe (Box 1.3). In countries 

where unemployment remains unacceptably high, 

measures put in place to improve labor market 

functioning also aim to equalize opportunities for 

all citizens, by reducing rents for insiders in both 

the labor and product markets. Pension reforms 

that lengthen the contribution period in line with 
rising life expectancy increase intergenerational 

fairness (for example, in France, Greece, and Spain). 

Measures to harmonize employment protection 

between types of job contracts should reduce the 

disproportionate burden on temporary workersŠ

those last hired and  rst 
 red. Removing the 
the periphery, indirect tax changes contribute to 
positive headline in
 ation. Ireland, nonetheless, 
is expected to experience subdued price increases 
in 2011, at 0.5 percent, following two years of 

de ation. Outside the euro area, the pickup in 
in ation has been further ampli
 ed in the United 
Kingdom by a series of VAT increases and the 

lagged effects of the currency depreciation: 

in ation is expected to stay signi
 cantly above the 
Bank of England target, at 4.2 percent in 2011, 

before cooling to 2 percent in 2012, as base effects 
come into play. In contrast, monetary tightening 

and the unfolding appreciation of the krona are 

expected to keep Sweden™s in
 ation more stable, at 
2 percent in both years, despite the strength of its 

economy. Switzerland too is expected to continue 

experiencing very low in
 ation, at just 1 percent, 
as the appreciation of the currency feeds through. 

Nonetheless, in all countries, in
 ation risks have 
become tilted to the upside, and guarding against 

second-round effects will be critical. Turning the Page on the Crisis: Policy RequirementsPolicy actions taken in Europe since the emergence 
of the sovereign debt turmoil helped to contain the 

crisis, but not suf
 ciently to decisively put it behind 
us. Bold steps are needed to assuage market concerns 

about sovereign and 
 nancial risks and to tackle 
the underlying root causes of the crisis. Ultimately, 

more rather than less economic and  nancial 
integration will be key to the region™s success, along 

with a strengthening of euro area-wide economic 

governance. Although policymakers have started 

addressing these dif cult issuesŠmost notably 
at the March 2011 European CouncilŠfurther 

improvements in the macroeconomic landscape 

will depend on rapid implementation of their 

commitments.

weaknesses remain crucial throughout Europe and

16Box 1.3 Unemployment and Inequality in the Wake of the CrisisUnemploymen t rose more in the euro area periphery than in other European countries, but youth and temporary 
workers everywhere were particularly hard hit by the crisis. In most of northern Europe, the deterioration in 

labor markets was generally contained compared with past recessionsŠdespite the sharper output contractions 

experienced this timeŠwith  rms resorting to labor hoarding, and in some countries part-time schemes further 
supported job retention. In contrast, unemployment rose more sharply in some peripheral countries, such as 

Spain and Ireland, where the burst of housing bubbles exacerbated the recession (
 gure). And the more fragile 
segments of the labor marketŠyoung, low-skilled, and temporary workersŠsuffered the most. With long-term 

unemployment slowly creeping up, there is a risk that many unemployed will become discouraged and leave the 

labor market. This would have adverse consequences on Europe™s social fabric, public 
 nances, and growth.
How have labor market developments likely affected income inequality in Europe during the crisis? What 
features of labor markets aggravated the impact of the crisis on inequality? And what can be done to alleviate the 

problem? Cross-country econometric analysis of the determinants of inequality in Organization for Economic 

Cooperation and Development countries (over a period, 1980Œ2005, that does not include the recent crisis) 

suggests that the recession likely exacerbated inequality through rising unemployment and dwindling job 

creation, despite the safety nets and automatic stabilizers at work. A jobless recovery or ingrained long-term 

unemployment could further worsen economic disparities and undermine both economic performance and social 

cohesion. ﬁHowﬂ the economy recovers and grows (that is, which income groups bene
 t the most) will matter for 
income inequalities.
Cross-country differences in income inequality re
 ect the interplay of labor, social, and educational factors. 
In line with the literature, the following robust results were found (see table):
Ł Labor utilization signi cantly in
 uences income distribution.
 Unemployment is found to have a regressive impact 
on income equality, and a higher employment rate is associated with lower economic disparities. Social 

expenditures play an important role in alleviating income inequality across all speci
 cations, highlighting 
the supporting role of unemployment bene
 ts in times of crisis, and more generally of social protection 
in assisting the most vulnerable. Educational attainment, proxied by the share of population with at least 

secondary education, is associated with a more even income distribution.
Ł The longer the unemployment duration, the higher the income inequality.
 Both short- and long-term unemployment widen 
income dispersion, with a slightly higher coef cient for the latter, re
 ecting deeper income losses as the spell of 
unemployment lengthens.
Ł Better job opportunities for underutilized groups enhance equity.
 Higher employment rates for women and youth reduce 
disparities.
Ł Dual labor markets worsen inequality.
 A higher share of temporary contracts in total employment contributes to 
widening income distribution because it tends to be associated with more wage and bene
 t disparity between 
the temporary and permanent workforces. This is particularly relevant for countries that used a ﬁdualﬂ system 

to enhance labor market 
 exibility, resulting in increased use of temporary contracts. 
The results suggest that the rise in unemployment during the crisis increased inequality by an estimated 
2 percentage points in the euro area as a whole, and by as much as 10 percentage points in Greece, Ireland, 

Portugal, and Spain, where the labor market situation deteriorated much more sharply. The recession also 

increased the number of discouraged workers who dropped out of the labor force, a factor that is likely to have

1. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS17further exacerbated income disparities. On the other hand, social safety nets are likely to have cushioned the 
impact of unemployment on inequality.
This suggests the following policy recommendations:

Ł More inclusive labor markets will be required to narrow income inequalities.
 Evidence shows that a pervasive dual 
system, with a  exible temporary workforce and a highly protected permanent workforce, can actually increase 
unemployment (Blanchard and Landier, 2002; Jaumotte, 2010; and Dao and Loungani, 2010). Combining that 

evidence with the analysis here suggests that reforms to rebalance employment protectionŠwith a view to 

supporting job creationŠby relaxing protection on regular workers while enhancing it for temporary workers 

would be bene
 cial for income equality, too. Improving wage-bargaining arrangements to allow wages to re
 ect 
productivity more closely in countries where they have grown most out of line would also help.
Ł Active labor market measures could help reduce structural unemployment.
 Longer unemployment duration poses a risk of 
entrenching cyclical unemployment into a structural phenomenon as workers lose human capital and become 

detached from the labor force. Lam (forthcoming) found evidence of the effectiveness of certain active

uncertainty about asset quality, increasing capital 

buffers of viable banks, and identifying and 

resolving insolvent banks. While the July 2010 EU 

stress tests increased transparency with regard to 

banking sector exposures, they failed to identify 

the most pressing risks, as evidenced in Ireland 

where the two largest banksŠat the core of the 

country™s dif
 cultiesŠpassed the stress tests. The 
new round of stress tests to be released in June 

2011 will need to be far more probing. And to give 

teeth to these tests, member states need to put in 

place credible and speci c ex ante plans to deal with 
the vulnerable institutions identi ed by the stress 
tests. In some countries, such as Ireland, Spain, and 

the United Kingdom, national supervisors have 

already moved ahead. But in many other countries, 

the resolve to put the banking sector on a stronger 

footing still needs to be demonstrated.An additional issue is that  nancial integration in 
EU banking markets remains incomplete. While 

capital  ows cross borders with little impediment, 
and banks transact freely in the money market, 

other elements of the 
 nancial system, including 
portfolio allocation, securitization, and retail 

banking, remain very much national affairs. 

Moreover, apart from some regional clusters, 

cross-border mergers and acquisitions are still 

limited. This is unfortunate because deeper 

 nancial integration carries the potential to alleviate 
some of the current banking sector weaknesses, 

allowing, in particular, for the injection of fresh 

capital in circumstances where domestic sources 
are constrained. Clearing the obstacles to further 

 nancial integration will require rapid progress on 
the single rulebook for banks and harmonization of 

supervisory practices. Standardization of products 

and more uniform consumer protection regimes are 

also needed (see Chapter 3 for more details).The need for an integrated, pan-European 
approach to supervision and regulation has become 

even more evident. The European Supervisory 

Authorities (ESAs) and European Systemic Risk 

Board (ESRB)Šall launched in January 2011Š

will provide much needed tighter coordination 

of 
 nancial supervision and macroprudential 
Ł Decisions to provide 
 nancing under the 
ESM will be made by mutual agreement in the 

EurogroupŠby which non-abstaining member 

states must agree unanimouslyŠon the basis of 

debt sustainability analysis, which will involve the 

IMF. In addition to lending to member countries, 

the euro area-wide facilities will be allowed to 

participate in primary markets in the context 

of a program with strict conditionality, on an 

exceptional but yet-to-be de
 ned basis. 
Ł Private sector involvement in the context of 
ESM loans will remain an action of last resort, 

decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with 

IMF policies, and 
 nancing will be provided 
only if debt sustainability is demonstrated to 

be achievable. Collective actions clauses will 

be introduced starting in June 2013 and ESM 

loans will enjoy preferred creditor status.
Clearer parameters for the crisis management 
mechanisms are certainly welcome but challenges 

now lie in their implementation. The larger effective 

size of the EFSF should bolster market con
 dence, 
provided the mechanism by which this is secured 

is clari ed as soon as possible, and a decision on 
adapting the interest rate charged on EFSF loans 

taken to help support 
 scal sustainability. Beyond 
2013, the proposed permanent facility, with its 

emphasis on prevention and early support, provides 

a robust and orderly framework for assisting 

euro area members, including through strict 

conditionality to support discipline. To broaden the 

avenues of support, though, some added 
 exibility 
in the instruments would be helpful. Additionally, 

in the shorter run, the interdependence between 

national banking systems and sovereigns remains 

unaddressed, and the onus of dealing with 
 nancial 
sector issues was left squarely with the national 

authorities, despite the high potential for cross-

border contagion.Accelerate Financial Sector Reforms and Resume Financial IntegrationIndeed, addressing weaknesses in the banking 
sector remains a prerequisite for breaking the

Restore Fiscal HealthSecuring public debt sustainability constitutes 
another vital ingredient to an enduring solution to 

the crisis. With the recovery gradually broadening, 

now is the time to start reconstituting the 
 scal 
buffers that proved essential during the recession 

and to secure medium-term sustainability. Absent 

such action, markets would feel increasingly 

uncomfortable funding ever-rising public debt 

in EuropeŠas they did in the most vulnerable 

euro area countriesŠin turn, jeopardizing the 

recovery. Getting the speed, size, and composition 

of the 
 scal adjustment right is imperative 
too. Sovereigns that have come under market 

scrutiny have had no choice but to front-load the 

consolidation, but other European countries can 

afford to phase in the tightening to smooth over 

time the negative impact on domestic demand and 

employment.
policies within the euro area and the EU. Adequate 
resources, good information gathering and sharing, 

and focused coordination of their activities will be 

critical to the success of these new institutions. 
Moving toward a robust and 
 exible framework 
for crisis management and resolution, with 

appropriate tools and mandates to intervene 

and resolve ailing institutions at an early stage, is 

equally urgent. The EU proposal to harmonize 

these tools across countries is the right step 

toward ensuring more orderly ex ante solutions. 

But more needs to be done to progress from 

a setting structured along national lines to an 

integrated EU framework that fully addresses 

unavoidable coordination problems. Clear rules 

for allocating losses to private stakeholders and 

sharing the burden of potential public support 

among member states are still missing; so are 

mechanisms for rapid 
 nancing of resolution 
effortsŠincluding through a deposit guarantee 

scheme prefunded by the industry. Ultimately, 

only a European Resolution Authority would be 

able to deal cost effectively with the resolution

consolidation in the euro area and other European countries over the next three years is broadly 

appropriate, with the bulk of the de
 cit reduction 
occurring through expenditure reductions.
The negative impact of 
 scal consolidation on 
growth is expected to be limited this year for 

most European countries, but more substantial in 

2012Ša suitable timing given the strengthening 

recovery. Lagged effects from the stimulus 

measures still occurring in 2010 in most countries 

will likely smooth the effects of the consolidation 

measures, with the drag on growth this year 

ranging from 1½ to 2 percentage points in Greece, 

Portugal, and Spain to ½ percentage point or less 

in Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland 

(Figure 1.12). 
Still, these  scal consolidation strategies will only 
fully work if embedded in credible medium-term 

plans. Some countriesŠsuch as Greece, Ireland, 

Portugal, and Spain, but also Austria, France, 

Germany, Italy, and the United KingdomŠhave 

already elaborated speci c consolidation plans 
beyond this year. Others have yet to 
 esh 
them out. 
Set the Stage for Gradual Monetary Policy NormalizationWith the recovery in train, monetary policy should 
also move closer to normalization. In countries 

most advanced in the recovery cycle, central 

banks have already started raising policy rates 

(for example, Israel, Norway, and Sweden). The 

ECB has recently followed suit as the output gap 

in the euro area is gradually closingŠeven after 

taking into account  scal consolidation. In a few 
countries both inside and outside the euro area, 

strong momentum in mortgage credit and housing 

prices highlights the risk that assets could become 

overvalued again when loose monetary conditions 

are in place for too long (for example, Austria, 

Finland, France, Sweden, and Switzerland) (Figure 

1.13). Conversely, in the United Kingdom, where 

the recovery is currently more tepid and 
 scal 
tightening stronger, policy rate normalization may 

need to proceed more slowly.
1. ADVANCED EUROPE: TACKLING THE SOVEREIGN CRISIS23Strengthen Preventive SurveillanceIn the run-up to the crisis, the Stability and Growth 
Pact (SGP) failed to prevent the trend increase 

in public debt. Stronger enforcement, as well as 

required corrective actions on a preemptive basisŠ

even before the Excessive De
 cit Procedure is 
activatedŠand until medium-term objectives 

are reached, will go some way to improving its 

effectiveness. However, national 
 scal frameworks 
must also be strengthened, given member 

states™ reluctance to relinquish additional  scal 
prerogatives to the center. Some countries have 

announced their intentions to introduce national 
 scal rules (for example, Germany and France). 
There is also room to strengthen 
 scal governance 
arrangements, transparency, and public 
 nance 
management at the national level. The planned EU 

directive to de
 ne minimum standards and goals 
for such frameworks should help ensure they are 

fully in line with common objectives.
Coordination fell short of identifying the broader 
risks of growing macroeconomic imbalances 

within the EU, and even more important, within 

the euro area. As further detailed in Chapter 3, 

rather than a lack of 
 scal integration, it was the 
inability of national authorities to react to local 

developments in credit, demand, and wages that led 

to the buildup and eventual bursting of imbalances 

in some countries, with detrimental consequences 

for the area as a whole. The new Excessive 

Imbalance Procedure should be strengthened to 
provide an effective platform for discussing and 

coordinating national responses at the EU level.
In the shorter term, commodity price increases 
pose a challenge to the anti-in
 ation credentials 
of central banks: following the recent surge in 

commodity prices, fuel and food in
 ation now 
accounts for between half and three-quarters of 

current headline in
 ation across Europe, in sharp 
contrast with just a year ago (Table 1.4). Although 

core in ation is projected to remain low, and the 
impact of recent increases in commodity prices 

should prove temporary, central banks will have 

to keep a watchful eye on wage developments and 

in ation expectations for potential second-round 
effects. Removal of automatic wage indexation 

mechanisms in countries where they are still in 

place (for example, Spain) would help prevent these 

second-round effects from materializing.
In the euro area, remaining fragility in the  nancial 
system could hold growth back, justifying a 
 exible 
approach to exiting extraordinary crisis measures. 

The eventual exit will need to occur gradually as 

national actions to strengthen banking sectors are 
implemented and systemic uncertainty recedes. 

Depending on these, the ECB may need to 

extend further in time its regime of full-allotment 

re nancing for some of its liquidity operations, 
while re ning its collateral framework to discourage 
systemic bidding, minimize distortions to market-

based bank  nancing, and avoid moral hazard 
associated with unlimited liquidity provisions. 

Meanwhile, macroprudential policies will need to 

play a larger role in mitigating risks in member 

countries where these conditions encourage less 

cautious lending behaviors.

Emerging Europe returned to growth last year, but 
performance varied widely across the region, re
 ecting the 
idiosyncratic legacies of previous boom-bust cycles. For 2011 

and 2012, an economic expansion of 4¼ percent is projected 

with much less disparity in intraregional growth, as domestic 

demand takes over as the main driving force. Policymakers™ 

emphasis should be on protecting the solidifying recovery 

against still-considerable downside risks from unsettled 

global and euro area 
 nancial markets and from reemerging 
in ationary pressures. To this end, they need to tackle 
 scal 
and  nancial sector vulnerabilities. Fiscal policy should 
support monetary policy to the extent possible to stave off 

price pressures in the wake of high global commodity prices 

and narrowing output gaps. For the many countries hard hit 

by the 2008Œ09 crisis, bringing down unemployment while 

reorienting their economies toward the tradable sector remains 

an ongoing task.Developments in 2010On the Back of an Overall Favorable External Environment, Emerging Europe Turned the 
Corner in 2010Emerging Europe put the deep recession of 2009 
 rmly behind it and expanded by 4.2 percent 
in 2010, broadly in line with projections in the 
previous Regional Economic Outlook
. Exports 
bene ted from the revival of global demand, while 
feared spillovers from sovereign debt trouble in the 

euro area periphery did not materialize. Recoveries 

of domestic demand were uneven across the region 

though, giving rise to large growth disparities. 

Poland and Turkey grew strongly, at higher-than-

expected rates of 3.8 and 8.2 percent, respectively. 

A heat wave and surging oil prices had opposing 

effects on Russia™s growth, which came in at 

4 percent. The recovery remained in its infancy in 

much of southeastern Europe.
Exports Were Key for Getting the Recovery Under Way …Exports expanded by a solid 9.3 percent, putting 
legs under the recovery in emerging Europe. 

Exports were the 
 rst demand component to 
rebound following the 2008Œ09 crisis, buoyed 

by the pickup in growth of critical trading partners 

in advanced Europe, especially Germany. 

By end-2010, export volumes matched or exceeded 

precrisis levels in most countries. In contrast, the 

recovery of domestic demand came later and often 

struggled to sustain itself (Figure 2.1).
1In an encouraging sign, average export growth 

during 2009Œ10 outpaced growth of trading 

partner imports (Figure 2.2). Export sectors 

seem to be generally competitive and able to gain 

share in their traditional markets, expand beyond 

them, or improve the quality of their product 

mix. This speaks to competitiveness gains from 

postcrisis real devaluations. Relative incentives to 

produce tradables have also improved given that 

pro t margins for nontradables fell sharply in the 
aftermath of the 2008Œ09 crisis.
… While Domestic Demand Developments Were Mixed across the RegionOn average, domestic demand growth in the region 
was a strong 5.8 percent. However, this average 

primarily re ects powerful dynamics in Poland and 
Turkey, both countries where precrisis overheating 

had been more contained, and in the European 
CIS countries, which bene
 ted directly or indirectly 
from the rebound of commodity prices. In 

contrast, domestic demand still declined in the 
rest of the region, albeit not as much as in 2009. 
1 The early revival of exports did not always translate 
into a sizable contribution of net exports to economic 

growth in 2010. The subsequent pickup of domestic 

demand was strong in some countries, reducing the 

growth contribution or even turning it negative for the 

year as a whole.

EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY27Box 2.1 Russia: A Tepid Recovery from a Deep RecessionRussia™s recent experience, during both the crisis and the recovery, has differed notably from that of other 
countries in the region. These differences re
 ect Russia™s reliance on commodity exports, signi
 cant policy 
shortcomings, and some one-off factors. 
Crisis
During the global crisis, Russia™s swing in growth was appreciably larger than in most other countries (
 rst 
 gure). This weak performance occurred despite Russia™s formidable reserve holdings and large current account 
and  scal surpluses before the crisisŠcharacteristics that, other things equal, should have put it in a relatively 
strong position to weather the storm. The output collapse also de
 ed the relatively strong policy response by the 
authoritiesŠa massive 
 scal stimulus, large-scale liquidity support to the banking system, and deft management 
of the ruble exchange rate (at the cost of about US$200 billion in reserves), which bought time for the private 

sector to hedge its foreign exchange exposures.
The main explanation for the depth of the slump during the crisis is Russia™s dependence on its oil and gas 
sectors, which left it highly exposed to the sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2008. Although energy 

directly accounts for about two-thirds of Russia™s exports and for an estimated 20 percent of GDP, the overall 

impact of oil prices on the Russian economy extends beyond these numbers as, indirectly, oil prices are key 

determinants of capital 
 ows, credit availability, investment, and incomes. In addition, oil prices are important 
for public  nances because every US$10 per barrel decline in oil prices reduces 
 scal revenues by some 62 billion 
rubles (about 1½ percent of GDP).
The abrupt drop in oil prices during the crisis highlighted the connection between oil prices and capital 
 ows 
to Russia when Russian corporations hedged their uncovered foreign currency exposures, triggering massive 

capital out ows. In turn, as cheap foreign funding dried up, long-standing weaknesses in the banking sector were 
exposed and private sector credit collapsed, thereby compounding the recession.
At the same time, as in many other countries in the region, adjustment from precrisis overheatingŠwhich in 
Russia had been fueled by expansionary 
 scal and monetary policies owing to weak policy frameworksŠfurther 
deepened the downturn.
Recovery

Russia has experienced only a sluggish recovery from the recession thus far. Real GDP grew 4 percent in 2010, 
about half of which re
 ected carryover from 2009. Even though estimates of potential growth have been 
lowered from about 5½ percent before the crisis to about 4 percent at present, this performance could be 

regarded as somewhat disappointing when considering the large remaining output gap, the continued highly 

accommodative policies of the government, and strongly rebounding world oil prices. Several factors have 

contributed to this outcome.
First, a historic heat wave and drought in the summer temporarily derailed Russia™s recovery. The severe weather, 
which lasted for several weeks, affected harvests, construction activity, industrial production, and retail activity, 

and was the key contributor to a sharp contraction of real GDP in the third quarter (0.9 percent, quarter over 

quarter, seasonally adjusted). The dismal third quarter had a large downward effect on average GDP growth 

for the year in 2010, even though some catching up from summer production losses likely took place in the 

fourth quarter.

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
28Second, Russia continued to experience substantial 
capital out ows in 2010, in sharp contrast to many 
other emerging market economies and despite high oil 

prices. In addition to scheduled debt repayments, the 

out ows likely re
 ected investors™ renewed focus, in the 
wake of the crisis, on the lack of progress in addressing 

the economy™s fundamental underlying problems. These 

problems include, in particular, the poor investment 

climateŠas evidenced by Russia™s consistently low 

scores on the World Bank™s Doing Business indicators 

(where Russia ranks 123rd for overall ease of doing 

business) and other international comparisonsŠand 

persistent weaknesses in monetary and 
 scal policy 
frameworks. 
Third, the slow recovery also re
 ects ongoing problems 
in the banking system, including a large overhang of 

nonperforming and restructured loans. Credit growth 

remained stagnant through the  rst quarter of 2010 and 
recovered only timidly in the course of the year. 
Fourth, structural reformsŠmuch needed to develop the 
economy™s productive capacity and develop new engines 

of sustainable growthŠremained stalled, and investors 

perceived the prospects for their reinvigoration to be 

limited in the run-up to the 2012 elections.
Policies

Against the background of this fragile recovery, the 
Russian authorities have continued their exit from crisis-

related policy support. However, the exit strategy has 

not been suf ciently bold and is undermined by weak 
policy frameworks, posing further risks to a sustainable 

recovery.
On the  scal policy side, the withdrawal of the massive 
stimulus provided during the crisis has been lagging. 

Most of the 
 scal expansion during the crisis took the 
form of permanent measures, which increases the risk 

that the stimulus will not be reversed and that 
 scal 
policy will become procyclical as the economy recovers 

further. At 12.9 percent of GDP, the 2010 federal 

government non-oil de
 citŠwhich should be the anchor 
for  scal policy in an oil-producing country like Russia, given the volatility of oil prices and the nonrenewable 
nature of oilŠremains nearly 8 percentage points higher than the government™s long-term target of 4.7 percent of 

GDP, a target that remains appropriate (second 
 gure). 
The 2011Œ13 budget envisages a reduction in the federal non-oil de
 cit of only 2.5 percent of GDP 
over three years, mostly resulting from a signi
 cant hike in the payroll tax, a reduction in civil service

supportive of long-term growth. 
On the monetary side, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has been slow to respond to rising in
 ation, owing in 
part to concerns about growth. Monetary easing was paused in June but policy rates effectively remained on hold 

for the remainder of the year despite a surge in in
 ation from a low of 5½ percent in July to 9.5 percent in March 
2011 (third  gure). Although spikes in food and petroleum prices largely drove the sharp increase in in
 ation, 
core in ation has also been steadily on the rise, pointing to signi
 cant second-round effects. Following an initial 
increase in the CBR deposit rate by 25 basis points in late December 2010, in February 2011, the CBR raised 

both the deposit rate and several of its key lending rates by 25 basis points, more clearly signaling the start of a 

tightening cycle. The CBR also raised reserve requirements in February and March.
In the  nancial sector, the extraordinary liquidity support extended to banks during the crisis has been withdrawn 
and regulatory forbearance is being unwound. However, banks remain fettered by bad loans, with weak balance 

sheets weighing on credit growth. Delays in implementing consolidated supervision and connected lending 

regulations amplify  nancial sector risks.
Against this background, the outlook remains for a moderate recovery in Russia with GDP growth projected to reach 
4.8 percent in 2011. Higher-than-projected oil prices could result in a more favorable growth outcome in the short 

term, but achieving a sustainable recovery will require completion of the exit from crisis-related support, strengthening 

 scal and monetary policy frameworks, and reinvigorating the structural reform agenda. Regarding the latter, President 
Medvedev™s recently proposed 10-point action plan to improve Russia™s investment climateŠwhich includes measures 

to enhance governance and business infrastructure, and reduce the in
 uence of the state in the economyŠis an 
encouraging step in the right direction, but effective and timely implementation of these measures is key.

appreciation was strongest in Turkey (4 percent), 

and depreciation was largest in Serbia (9 percent). 

On average, they remained 14.5 percent depreciated 

from their peak in August 2008.
Capital in ows primarily took the form of portfolio 
investment. Traditionally, portfolio investment 

makes up less than 10 percent of in
 ows to the 
region, with bank/other investment and foreign 

direct investment (FDI) accounting for the rest in 

roughly equal shares. In 2010, however, two-thirds 

of the in
 ows were portfolio investment, with 
banks still in no mood to ramp up leverage and 

direct investors more cautious about the region™s 

prospects. This eased the 
 nancing of government 
de cits, although at the price of public 
 nances 
becoming more vulnerable to the vagaries of 

 nancial markets.
3Nine countries in the region maintain active 
or precautionary arrangements with the IMF 

(Appendix). In light of selective and potentially 

unstable capital  ows, a number of countries 
received balance of payments support from the 

IMF. FYR Macedonia secured a precautionary 

credit line, and Poland renewed and augmented 

its  exible credit line in January 2011. The stand-
by arrangement with Belarus was completed 

in March 2010, although the need for external 

adjustment has since resurfaced. Hungary™s 

program supported by the EU and the IMF lapsed 

in October 2010.Credit remains tight in the region, although with a few exceptions. The worst of the credit crunch is 

over, but real credit still contracts in just under half 

of the region™s economies. At the other end of the 

spectrum, Belarus and Turkey experienced double-

digit growth. In between are a number of countries, 

such as Poland, that have returned to positive but 

moderate credit growth (Figure 2.3). In general, 

credit growth in the region remains constrained by

their current account positions improve further. 
Russia and Ukraine benefited from pronounced 

terms-of-trade gains and their current account 

balances did not change dramatically despite a 

strong rebound in domestic demand. However, 

buoyant domestic demand translated into sharply 

wider external deficits in Belarus, Moldova, 

and Turkey. Poland™s current account deficit 

also widened.Capital  ows are returning to the region, 
albeit, compared with the boom years, in more 

modest amounts and in a more discriminatory 

way (Figure 2.6). Poland and Turkey were the 

main magnets for foreign investors, in light of 

their favorable recent growth records and the 

accessibility of their capital markets. However, 

 nancially less integrated countries and economies 
still struggling to overcome the crisis or beset 

by large vulnerabilities were shunned. Serbia, for 

example, suffered exchange rate weakness during 

much of last year. Russia, traditionally an important 

destination for emerging market investors, could 

not attract net in ows in 2010, amid a poor 
investment climate and persistent weaknesses in its 

monetary and

Figure 2.6Emerging Europe: Net Capital Inflows1(Percent of GDP)2. EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY31… And Monetary Policy Took First Steps toward TighteningA number of countries tightened monetary 
policy. Poland and Russia stepped up their anti-

in ationary rhetoric toward year-end as in
 ation 
rose and followed up with hikes of headline policy 

rates early this year. Fast-growing Turkey raised 

reserve requirements and increased the volatility 

of market interest rates, then subsequently 

lowered policy rates, to defuse risk to 
 nancial 
stability from capital in ows and rapid credit 
growth (Box 2.2). Rate hikes in Hungary and 

Serbia responded to in ationary pressures, but 
were also motivated by the need to alleviate 

 nancial strains (Hungary) and to continue 
building central bank credibility in the face of 

currency depreciation (Serbia). Albania hiked 

policy rates in late March.
Poland, Serbia, and Turkey also adopted 
macroprudential measures to contain risky lending 

and in ationary pressures. Turkey introduced 
ceilings for loan-to-value ratios for housing loans 

and increased minimum payments on credit card 

balances. Poland™s regulators tightened criteria for 

the assessment of retail loans and required higher 

debt-service-to-income ratios for foreign currency 

loans. The Serbian authorities moved to phase out a 

credit subsidy program.
Most countries continued to phase out their crisis-
related support measures for the banking sector, 

although lowered required reserve ratios remain 

common and outstanding liquidity support is still 

considerable in Belarus and Ukraine. Moreover, 

regulatory frameworks were strengthened in 

many countries.
The Outlook for 2011 and 2012High frequency indicators point to a continuation 

of the recovery in 2011. Industrial production 

is currently expanding in most countries in the 

range of 5Œ15 percent, with little sign of loss of 

momentum; industrial con dence is improving 
too. Only in Croatia and Serbia are industries 

still struggling to sustain growth. On the demand 
rising nonperforming loans, already highly leveraged 
borrowers, and the tightness of critical funding 

from foreign parent banks. Between late-2008 and 

mid-2010, western banks reduced their exposure 

to emerging Europe by a cumulative 15 percent. 

A small increase in exposure occurred in the third 

quarter of 2010Šthe result of renewed 
 ows to a 
few well-performing countries. 
Equity markets in emerging Europe generally 
performed well in 2010 on the back of the global 

and regional recoveries, low global interest rates, and 

a return of risk appetite. Unsurprisingly, economies 

doing well or displaying strong indications of a 

decisive turnaround recorded the best performance 

in equity markets. Poland and Turkey, and to a lesser 

extent Russia, fall in the 
 rst category with equity 
market gains between 20 and 30 percent. By end-

2010, stock market indices exceeded their precrisis 

peaks in Turkey and had some 20 percent to go in 

Poland and Russia. Sharply improved economic 

prospects in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine meant 

large stock market gains and recovery levels similar 

to those in Poland and Russia. In contrast, stock 

markets advanced little from their depressed 

levels in southeastern Europe, with its 
 edgling 
economic recovery. Hungary™s 
 nancial markets 
moved sideways amid changing directions in 

economic policy.
Concerns about Deﬁ cits Motivated Fiscal 
Consolidation …The region™s 
 scal de
 cit narrowed from 
6.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.5 percent of 

GDP in 2010. Most of the improvement was 

cyclical, as the recovery lifted revenues and 

Russia™s treasury bene
 ted from oil- and gas-
related receipts, but many countries also adopted 

tightening measures. Fiscal consolidation efforts 

differed across countries: Albania, Bulgaria, Latvia, 

Lithuania, Moldova, and Romania all put in place 

measures in excess of 2 percent of GDP in an 

effort to curb high de
 cits; Poland refrained from 
discretionary 
 scal policy changes; and Belarus 
and Russia actually loosened 
 scal policy further 
last year.
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
32Box 2.2 Turkey’s New Monetary Policy StrategyIn response to surging capital in ows, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) stepped up its efforts to safeguard 
 nancial stability. Differences in the phasing of business cycles around the world translated for Turkey into 
stronger domestic than external demand, a widening current account de
 cit 
 nanced primarily through short-
term in
 ows, and rapid credit expansion. Against this background, the CBT has emphasized both 
 nancial and 
price stability in its policy decisions since November 2010. This is consistent with the CBT™s mandate in the 

Central Bank Law to enhance the stability of the 
 nancial system, although price stability remains its primary 
objective. The CBT has also called for a coordinated response from the 
 nancial supervision and 
 scal authorities 
to the  nancial stability concerns arising from large capital in
 ows. 
In the view of the CBT, the simultaneous achievement of price and 
 nancial stability goals requires additional 
policy tools. The CBT saw the policy interest rate as unable to deliver both objectives simultaneouslyŠthe level 

appropriate to containing in ation could accentuate risks to 
 nancial stability by attracting additional capital 
 ows. 
The CBT has therefore expanded its toolkit, using the policy interest rate to achieve the in
 ation target while 
direct liquidity measuresŠreserve requirements and the CBT™s interest rate corridorŠare assigned to moderating 

credit growth and lengthening the duration of capital 
 ows and bank funding. 
In line with this strategy, the CBT™s monetary policy has several key elements: 

Greater volatility of short-term market interest rates.
 The CBT drastically cut its overnight borrowing rate (the rate at 
which banks place deposits at the CBT) by 400 basis points to 1¾ percent in early November to push down the 

short end of the yield curve. This measure was reinforced by periodic adjustments to the amount of auctioned 

repurchase agreements (repos) to generate greater volatility in short-term market interest rates within the now-

wider interest rate corridor. The corridor was widened slightly further in December.
Liquidity withdrawal.
 Required reserves on lira-denominated liabilities were raised in several steps from November 
to April to withdraw liquidity, while rates were differentiated by maturity to lengthen the duration of bank 

funding and broaden the base.
1 In addition, daily preannounced foreign currency purchases by the CBT were 
sharply scaled back in steps from US$140 million in mid-December to US$50 million at the beginning of 2011, 

thereby reducing the creation of counterpart domestic liquidity.
Lowering the policy rate.
 With headline in ation projected to decline sharply in the near term, the policy interest 
rate was reduced by ½ percentage point in December to curb the trend appreciation of the lira. A further cut of 

¼ percentage point was made in January.
The CBT regards its new strategy as similar in spirit to conventional in
 ation targeting. It considers the 
combination of toolsŠrepo rate, required reserve ratios, interest rate corridorŠas its new policy instrument, and 

that the mix can be adjusted as needed to secure both price and  nancial stability. Moreover, it expects that the 
recently taken measures tightened the policy stance, with the higher required reserve ratios more than offsetting 

the loosening effect of the lower policy rate. 
Turkey™s new monetary policy strategy has achieved some success, but its ability to contain in
 ation and credit 
growth has yet to be proved (
 gure). The strategy has been effective at moderating exchange rate pressures, 
as can be seen from the decoupling of the lira from other emerging market currencies since mid-November. 
Note: The main author of this box is Justin Tyson.
1 Proceeds from repos with foreign banks and domestic nonbanks were included in the base. As a result, the required reserve 
base is very comprehensive and includes all banks™ liabilities with the exception of proceeds from CBT and domestic bank 

repos.
2. EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY33This decoupling likely re
 ects the lower average and higher volatility of returns on very short-term in
 ows (as 
can be seen from the initial decline in the short end of the yield curve and the increased variability in the market 

repo rate). However, rapid credit growth continues unabated, and the recent nominal depreciation will add to 

in ation pressures from a closed output gap and global commodity price increases. The limited progress made 
through March in slowing credit growth may be due in part to the cuts in the policy rate. This is because the 

CBT is injecting suf cient liquidity to enable banks to meet the higher required reserve ratios while also allowing 
interbank interest rates to settle, on average, near the new lower policy rate. Moreover, with banks borrowing 

more from the CBT, their marginal funding costs have fallenŠbecause of the lower policy rate and exemption of 

CBT repos from required reservesŠreducing the need for higher interest rates on bank loans. Market concerns 

about the effectiveness and sustainability of the lower policy rate may underpin the 200-basis-point increase in 

government bond yields in recent months.

EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY35Growth Should Hold Steady at Slightly More Than 4 Percent This Year and Next …
Growth projections for 2011 and 2012 have 
been revised up slightly for emerging Europe, to 

4.3 percent in both years (Table 2.1).
Ł Exports will likely continue to support growth. 
Trading partner imports are projected to 

expand by 6½ percent, down from the rebound 

rates of last year but still solid. The region™s 

exporters are expected to retain much of the 

edge they gained in the previous two years. 
Ł Domestic demand will become the main pillar 
of growth as it catches up to recover in those 

countries where it had languished. Private 

consumption and investment are both expected 

to do well, as suggested by the improved 

readings for con dence, credit tightness, and 
capacity utilization (Figure 2.7). Investment 

and consumption ratios should stabilize and 
start to pick up modestly, reversing some 

of their steep declines in the wake of the 

2008Œ09 crisis. In a virtuous cycle, the initial 

domestic demand impulse lifts incomes and 
employment, further strengthening domestic 

demand (Figure 2.8).Ł Consequently, intraregional growth 
differentials are abating. Growth rates are 

expected to be positive in all countries this year 

for the  rst time since the crisis and will move 
into a relatively narrow range of 1¾ percent 

to 5¼ percent by 2012. Very fast growth in 

Belarus and Turkey is projected to slow as 

the macroeconomic policy stance tightens 
and base effects run their course, respectively. 

The Baltics, Bulgaria, and, with somewhat of 

a delay, Romania will reap the full-year effect 

of the ongoing recovery. Growth in Russia 

will also likely strengthen, by an estimated 

¾ percentage point, absent a repeat of last 

year™s heat wave. In Poland, growth is expected 

to hold steady. Hungary™s government is 

putting in place considerable  scal stimulus 
through tax cuts  nanced by a rollback of 
pension reform, while also imposing special 

levies on selected industries. Growth there is

And commodity prices might turn out to be 

higher than suggested by futures prices amid 

unexpectedly tight supply conditions. 
Ł Negative output gaps may put less downward 
pressure on wages and prices than envisaged. 

Estimates of output gaps are inherently 

imprecise. Moreover, spare capacity in the 

economy as a whole might not curb wage and 

price demands when underemployed resources 

cannot be reallocated to high demand sectors in 
the short term.
Ł Monetary policymakers will need to stay on

to expand at a rate similar to the rates in other 

emerging market regionsŠonly China and India 

are expected to enjoy considerably higher growth 

(Figure 2.9). However, no extra rebound effect

 projections put this year™s 
aggregate current account de
 cit at 0.3 percent 
of GDP, essentially unchanged from 2010, and 

expect a widening to 1.1 percent of GDP next 

year (Table 2.2). Russia™s current account surplus 

rises further in 2011, but it is expected to fall back 

somewhat in 2012 as the balance of payments 

impact from buoyant import growth is no longer 

trumped by rising oil prices. Elsewhere, rising oil 

prices put pressure on current account balances 

this year. Current account balances deteriorate in 

the Baltics, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland, but all 

de cits should remain easily 
 nanced by FDI and 
net transfers from the EU. In Turkey, Belarus, and 

Serbia, deteriorations build on already large de

in 2010 and therefore are a cause for concern. 

External debt ratios are set to decline very gradually, 

remaining above 75 percent of GDP in Bulgaria, 

Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, 

Romania, and Ukraine.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
38In an adverse scenario in which western banks take 
a signi cant hit, they might have to resort to sizable 
cuts of their exposures to emerging Europe, and 

access to funding might become more dif cult 
generally for all but the strongest of borrowers as 

investors become more averse to vulnerabilities. 

Even less drastic developments could prompt 

western banks to curtail 
 nancing for banks in 
emerging Europe, which would choke off the 

 edgling recovery of private credit and derail the 
good prospects for growth in the baseline.
Against this background, the authorities in 
emerging Europe should make every effort to 

reduce vulnerabilities. Government 
 nancing costs 
are sensitive to vulnerabilities, especially those in the 

 scal and 
 nancial sectors, and have become more 
so since the crisis (Figure 2.10).Fortunately, 
 nancial tensions in the euro area have 
not prompted  nancial markets to price in an extra 
risk premium for emerging Europe, re
 ecting the 
expectation that sovereign debt problems in the 

euro area periphery will remain contained 

and will be resolved without major disruptions. 

Still,  nancing costs in emerging Europe, just as in 
emerging market economies more generally, depend 

on country-speci
 c vulnerabilities and on global 
risk appetite.
Ł Sovereign bond spreads in emerging 
Europe and the euro area countries that 
have experienced most market pressures 

(Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain)
5 have 
demonstrated little correlation with each other. 

Over the past two years, spreads for sovereigns 

in emerging Europe have been trending 

downward while for some euro area countries 

they have risen sharply (Figure 2.11, panel 1). 

Financing conditions in emerging Europe have 

instead moved in lockstep with other emerging 

markets, with global risk appetite driving both 

(Figure 2.11, panel 2). Even when controlling

case of Spain.
still hurt growth through several channels. 
Most countries would have to cope with 

sizable adverse terms-of-trade effects. 

Domestic, as well as external, demand would 

suffer if in
 ationary pressures make tighter 
macroeconomic policies necessary in both 

emerging Europe and its trading partners. 

Tighter policies could also spell the end of the 

favorable 
 nancing conditions that sovereigns 
in the region now generally enjoy.
Sovereign Debt Problems in the Euro Area Are Another ConcernStrong  nancial and economic linkages with 
advanced Europe mean that an escalation of the 

sovereign debt problems in the euro area could 

have serious repercussions for emerging Europe.

market pressure and in emerging Europe is 

independent of Western banks™ exposure to 

the local economy, and small in any event 

(Figure 2.12, panel 1). For example, exposure 

to Hungary is some 60 percent of GDP 

compared with exposure to Poland of about 

20 percent of GDP. Yet, the association 

of these countries™ spreads with spreads in 

euro area countries under market pressure 

is about the same and very small. Likewise, 

local interbank interest rates seem no more 
sensitive to spreads in euro area high-spread 

countries with heavy dependence on funding 

from Western banks than in those without

 nancial 
markets are not yet concerned about spillovers 

through the bank funding channel.

EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY41(Figure 2.13).6 Debt stock vulnerabilities 
are high in Albania and Hungary, as well as 

arguably in Poland.
7 Albania and Hungary, 
along with Turkey, also have uncomfortably 

high short-term government debt, which 

exposes them to rollover risk. High 
 scal 
de cits constitute a considerable 
 ow 
vulnerability in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and 

Romania. Foreign-currency-denominated debt 

is high in Hungary and Serbia, exposing their 

public  nances to exchange rate risk.
Ł Emerging Europe™s public 
 nances no longer 
compare favorably with other emerging markets 

(Figure 2.14). In 2007, both de cit and public 
debt indicators for the region matched up 

well against other emerging markets, but 2012 

de cit ratios are expected to remain above 
those in Latin America and emerging Asia, and 
public debt has lost much of the edge it once 

had over emerging Asia.
Ł The cross-regional comparison does not 
take into account particularly pronounced 

population aging in emerging Europe and the 
strains it will inevitably put on public  nances.
8Recent experience further underscores the need 
for robust  scal positions with regard to solvency 
6  Key fiscal indicators that should not exceed prudent 
thresholds include public debt, the fiscal balance, public 

debt exposed to foreign currency risk, and public debt 

exposed to rollover risk, all expressed as a percentage of 

GDP. The primary gap is generally another key indicator 

of fiscal vulnerability. However, in emerging Europe the 

primary gap identifies the same countries as particularly 

vulnerable as the primary balance and is therefore omitted. 

The primary gap is defined as the difference between the 

actual and the debt-stabilizing primary balance.
7 Poland™s debt-to-GDP ratio of 56 percent of GDP is high 
by emerging market standards. However, Poland has set 

aside assets of some 15 percent of GDP in second-pillar 

private pension funds, much more than other countries. 

Public debt net of these assets is close to the emerging 

market average. Assets of second-pillar private pension 

funds are also considerable in Hungary but public debt net 

of these assets is still uncomfortably high.
8 Over the next 20 years, the old-age dependency ratio 
will rise to 29 percent in emerging Europe compared 
with 18 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and 
in Asia according to U.S. Census Bureau projections.
Key Policy Questions Going ForwardIn light of these downside risks to the outlook 
and the considerable slack evident in many 

economies in emerging Europe, policymakers face 

three main policy questions. What should be done 

to reduce  scal and 
 nancial vulnerabilities? How 
far has the region progressed in switching to a 

new growth model driven by the tradable sector? 

What can policymakers do to nudge it toward that 

model?Fiscal PolicyFiscal Positions Are Set to Tighten in 2011 and Remain Unchanged in 2012The region™s 
 scal de
 cit is projected to decline 
from 4½ percent of GDP in 2010 to 2½ percent 

of GDP in 2011, and remain largely unchanged in 

2012 (Table 2.3). Discretionary measures equivalent 

to 1.7 percent of GDP are chie
 y responsible for 
the 2011 de cit reduction. Much of the regional 
improvement is attributable to Russia, while 

consolidation measures in the rest of the region 

are similar to last year™s (about 1 percent of GDP). 

Poland is assumed to put in place consolidation 

measures of about one percent of GDP, in 

line with its convergence plan. A few countries, 

including Croatia, Hungary, Kosovo, and Turkey, 

go against the grain and loosen their 
 scal stances. 
Projections for 2012 do not factor in signi cant 
further measures for the region as a whole.
Despite this consolidation,  scal vulnerabilities 
remain elevated in many countries. 
Ł Public debt ratios in 2012 will still be trending 
upward in two-thirds of the countries and will 

exceed 40 percent of GDP in half the region. 
Ł Aggregate indicators disguise much weaker 
public  nances in individual countries. Key 
 scal vulnerability indicators in many countries 
are above both emerging market averages 

and, even more so, prudent thresholds

loops between 
 nancing costs and de
 cits means 
that buffers need to be built into public  nances, and 
the more jittery 
 nancial markets are the bigger the 
buffers need to be. Otherwise, a jump in 
 nancing 
costs can call public solvency into question, thus 
justifying the very increase in 
 nancing costs. As the 
problems in the euro area periphery demonstrate, 

reassessment of solvency risks by

can be swift and come with little warning. Emerging

Fiscal Consolidation Will Need to ContinueAlthough signi cant consolidation has occurred in 
a number of countries, and further consolidation 

is planned, the repairs to public 
 nances remain 
a work in progress. Public revenues are unlikely 

to return to the levels at the height of the 

boom (Box 2.3). Consolidation efforts should 

be supplemented by a strengthening of 
 scal 
frameworks to include enhanced transparency, 

better public  nancial management, and stronger 
governance arrangements.

countries but on aggregate they are perhaps smaller 

than generally believed (first figure).
1 A number of 
countries, such as the Baltic countries, Bosnia and 

Herzegovina, Romania, and Serbia, put in place 

very large consolidation measures. These actions 

were motivated by the need to address rapidly rising 

deficits, preserve exchange rate pegs, or respond to 

market pressures. In another group of countries, 

including Bulgaria, Montenegro, and Poland, fiscal 

policy is countercyclical, with stimulative discretionary 

measures in the downturn and largely balancing 

restrictive measures during the recovery. Russia stands 

out as having implemented very significant fiscal 

stimulus operations, only part of which are expected 

to be rolled back this year and next. As a result 

of Russia™s large weight in the regional economy, 

cumulative discretionary fiscal measures in emerging Europe are expansionary to the tune of 1.5 percent 

of GDP, even though most countries implemented more consolidation measures than stimulus measures.
The quality of the 
 scal measures varies. On the positive side, some 70 percent of the adjustment for the average 
country comes from expenditure-side rather than revenue-side measures (second 
 gure). Expenditure-focused 
 scal adjustment is typically more durable and less contractionary than reliance on tax hikes and other levies 
(IMF, 2010e). However, Russia implemented much of its stimulus through permanent expenditure measures,

Reducing Financial Sector VulnerabilitiesNot All Countries’ Banking Systems Are Back to Business as Usual Yet …
Banking system pro tability is uneven across the 
region (Table 2.4). Banks in Turkey went through 

the crisis relatively unscathed, and Russian banks™ 
Continued 
 scal consolidation would not only reduce 
 scal vulnerabilities, it increasingly would also be 
helpful from a demand-management perspective. 

In quickly growing countries, stepped-up 
 scal 
consolidation would ease the burden on monetary 

policyŠan important consideration in an environment 

in which higher interest rates might attract unduly large 

capital  ows. Countries with still-
 edgling recoveries 
will have to tread more carefully, but the general lesson 

that recent events have put a premium on sound 

public  nances still applies and con
 dence effects 
from tackling 
 scal weaknesses decisively should not 
be discounted. Successful strategies will need to be 
and Hungary has relied on tax hikes for selected industries. A number of countries also resorted to diverting 
contributions to private second-pillar pension funds to the public pension system. These additional revenues 

reduce the headline de cit in the short term but fail to improve public 
 nances in the long term because future 
pension expenditure rises commensurately. Therefore, they are not considered 
 scal measures here. Hungary 
went further: participants in the second pillar would forgo most of their rights under the public pension system 

unless they transferred their accumulated pension assets back to the public pension system. Most opted for the 

transfer, enabling Hungary to book a large 
 scal surplus in 2011.
Any further cyclical de
 cit improvement after 2012 is likely to be small. Headline 
 scal balances deteriorate 
signi cantly during 2009Œ12, even more than identi
 ed discretionary 
 scal measures would suggest. On average, 
they decline by 2.9 percentage points compared with cumulative stimulus measures worth 1.5 percent of GDP 

(third  gure). It seems fair to assume that any remaining economic slack in 2012 is probably quite limited and 
that revenues not recovered by then will probably be lost permanently. These losses have been very large in some 

countries, re
 ecting mainly the evaporation of boom-related revenues. In the absence of fresh measures, one 
would therefore expect 
 scal balances to remain broadly unchanged from 2012 onward.

EMERGING EUROPE: UNDERWRITING A SOLID RECOVERY47discussed revisions to Basel II™s Pillar 1 and the 
introduction of new liquidity standards, Basel III also 

contains revisions to the supervisory review process 

(Pillar 2), including extended guidance on  rm-wide 
governance and risk-management practices and 

the design and implementation of sound stress-

testing programs, which are particularly relevant for 

the region. The reciprocity agreement embedded 

in the operation of the proposed countercyclical 

capital buffer, whereby internationally active banks 

would be required by their home supervisors to 

calculate the capital buffer add-on for exposures to 

a country, whether booked at the local subsidiaries 

or offshore, will also promote a level playing 
 eld 
that was badly lacking during the most recent boom 

(Caruana, 2010). The new macroprudential focus 

of Basel III implies that governance arrangements 

for  nancial stability will need to be reviewed, and 
that the consistency between microprudential, 

macroprudential, and monetary objectives, 

instruments, and policies must be examined soon.
… So Supervisors Need to Remain VigilantSupervisors need to keep abreast of persistent 

and emerging vulnerabilities. The legacy of the 

boom-bust cycle is still present in most countries. 

Real estate prices remain depressed or keep falling, 

and are often supported by formal or informal 

barriers to initiating foreclosure proceedings. 

The share of foreign currency loans is close to peak 

levels, making the broader economy vulnerable 

to exchange rate pressures and exposing banks 

to indirect currency risk (Figures 2.18 and 2.19). 

As recommended in a recent European Bank 

Coordination Initiative report on local currency 

and capital market development (EBCI, 2011), 

supervisors should ensure that the pricing of foreign 

currency loans adequately re
 ects the associated 
credit and  nancial stability risks.
13 The ongoing 
sovereign debt troubles in the euro area pose funding 

risks for the region™s banks. Furthermore, borrowers™

9 At the same time, several Austrian, 
Belgian, and German banks that bene

state aid, and in some cases took large losses in 

emerging Europe during the recession, are looking 
to divest a signi
 cant part of their business in the 
region.10 These transfers of assets from weaker 
to stronger owners should enable greater access 

to capital and enhance capacity to  nance credit 
growth in the future.
11A Strategy for Basel III Implementation Needs to Be Designed Soon …The transition to the Basel III framework is an 
opportunity to further strengthen the resilience of 

the region™s banking systems.

14 Although the deep 
recession of 2009 has mostly corrected the large 

external imbalances built up in the boom years, 

many resources have been idled. With the old 

growth model exposed as unsustainable, the goal 

must now be to reengage most of these resources 

in a vibrant tradable sector. Empirical evidence 

suggests that export activity has a signi
 cant 
positive effect on both research and development 

spending and on product innovation,
15 thus, 
greater reliance on external demand could yield 
14  See also European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD, 2010). Several countries in 

central Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, 

and the Slovak Republic, already have large tradable 

sectors. As these countries show, having a vibrant 

export sector is not the same as running current 

account surpluses.

16Its Gestation Will Likely Take Some TimeThe cross-sectoral reallocation of labor continues, 

and countries will have a hard time exporting 

their way out of high unemployment quickly. 

In most countries, employment still lingers far 

below precrisis level, and employment growth in 

countries with large declines in employment in 

the year following September 2008 has not been 

stronger than elsewhere in the region since then 

(Table 2.5). Where external imbalances were the 

largest, employment has declined more in the 

nontradable than in the tradable sector, but only 

tentative signs of the required labor reallocation 
16  At the same time, large productivity improvements are 
still to be gained in the nontradable sector throughout 

the region.Table 2.5Emerging Europe: Employment Growth, 2008:Q3–2010:Q3(Percent)Total

17 Except for 
Latvia and Turkey, employment has not grown 

faster in the tradable sector than in the nontradable 
sector during the past few quarters. Projected real 

export growth for 2011Œ12 is generally unrelated to 

the change in employment since the onset of the 

crisis (Figure 2.20). Thus, the pace of job creation 

in the tradable sector will likely fall short of the rate 

needed to reabsorb the unemployed quickly.
Signs of reallocation of capital from the 
nontradable to the tradable sector are also still 

scant. Data on the sectoral distribution of 

domestic credit to corporations suggest that 

reallocation has yet to get under way in countries 

with the largest precrisis external imbalances. In 

Bulgaria and Lithuania, the ratio of credit to the 

primary and tradable secondary sectors to GDP 
17  The tradable sector is proxied by manufacturing, 
and the nontradable sector is proxied by construction, 

financial intermediation, and real estate.
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
50has not increased signi cantly more (or decreased 
less) than that of credit to the other sectors since 

end-2008 (Figure 2.21). In Latvia and Romania, 

that ratio has grown at a slower pace than that 

of credit to the construction sector. Data on 

foreign direct investment (FDI) 
 ows are slightly 
more encouraging (Figure 2.22). In the Baltics, 

Croatia, and Serbia, FDI  ows to the primary 
and tradable secondary sectors, even if small, 

achieved the same level (as a share of GDP) in 

2010 as in 2007 despite the general decline of 

FDI  ows to the region. In Bulgaria, they are 
now higher than 
 ows into construction, real 
estate, and 
 nancial intermediation. However, 
such 
 ows have signi
 cantly declined in most 
other countries.
Public Policies Can Spur the TransformationIn the short to medium term, macroeconomic 

policies can encourage the transformation to the 

tradable sector through their effects on the real 
exchange rate. In countries with 
 xed exchange 
rates, 
 scal policy can support competitiveness by 
preventing overheating that would draw resources 

to the nontradable sector. Countries with 
 exible 
exchange rates should emphasize 
 scal rather than 
monetary tightening as the recovery progresses. 

Regardless of the exchange rate regime, 
 scal policy 
can support the adjustment to the new growth 

model through permanent shifts in the composition 

of public expenditures, especially through public 
sector wage moderation and highly productive 
public investment.
18Although budgetary resources are scarcer in the 

postcrisis environment and 
 scal consolidation 
is a priority, public investment in human capital 

and structural reforms are needed to brighten 

medium-term growth prospects. Honkapohja (2010)

of economic activity is best avoided.

Europe would enhance productivity growth 

and shift production toward increasingly more 

sophisticated products. At the same time, the extent 

of the necessary sectoral reallocation of human 

resources calls for support for training programs 

to address skill mismatches and, in many cases, 

for further labor market reforms. Also, micro-

competitiveness could be supported through 

further improvements in the business environment, 

in particular in the European CIS and western 

Balkan countries where announced reform plans 

still await implementation (Figure 2.23). Such 

improvements would be particularly effective in 

making skilled labor emigration relatively less 

attractive and return migration more attractive.
Export potential could also be increased directly by 
investments in infrastructure and, more broadly, by 

support for logistics chains. The region still needs 

signi cant improvements in physical infrastructure. 
With limited domestic  scal space, 
 nancing 
such large projects would be a good use of EU 

funds. Public-private partnerships should also be 

sought and innovative private sector 
 nancing 
mechanisms, such as the credit enhancement 

recently proposed by the European Commission, 

should be explored.19 Improvements in logistics and 
removal of nontariff barriers would also directly 

bene t export performance. The 2010 World Bank 
Logistics Performance Index documents both a 

general improvement in this matter across the region 

and large scope for intraregional convergence of the 

western Balkans and the CIS toward the new EU 

member states and Turkey (Figure 2.24).

In the run-up to the crisis, 
 nancial integration in Europe 
boosted investment and reduced saving in countries that 

previously had high interest rates. As capital in
 ows 
increasingly went into the nontradable sector and contributed 

to credit and housing booms, countries in the euro area 

periphery and countries in emerging Europe with 
 xed 
exchange rates built up large current account imbalances, 

with ultimately unsustainable trajectories of net external 

asset positions. Financial markets did not pay suf
 cient 
attention to these vulnerabilities, and policies did too little 

to address market failures. When capital 
 ows slowed, the 
boom ended, and sharp recessions ensued. The absence of 

EU-wide institutions to deal with banking crises and the 
incomplete integration of capital markets compounded the 

crisis. To overcome the crisis decisively, the most critical factor 

in the longer run is restoring growth in the crisis-af
 icted 
countries. To prevent new crises, more vigilance is needed, 

better institutions to deal with  nancial sector problems 
must be developed, and more, rather than less 
 nancial and 
economic integration is needed.
The establishment of the Economic and Monetary 
Union (EMU) in 1999 marked an important step 

toward 
 nancial integration in Europe. In 1999, 
11 member states of the European Union (EU) 

adopted the euro as their common currency, and 

six more countries followed in the subsequent 

years.
1 Several countries in central and eastern 
Europe (CEE)Šnotably the Baltic countries and 
BulgariaŠpegged their currencies unilaterally to the 

euro, thus tying their monetary policies to that of 

the European Central Bank (ECB).Rising current account imbalances accompanied 
 nancial integration, and countries with high 
current account de
 cits were particularly hard hit 
1 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, 
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. 

They were followed by Greece (2002), Slovenia (2007), 

Cyprus, Malta (both 2008), the Slovak Republic (2009), 

and Estonia (2011).by the 2008Œ09 
 nancial crisis. In the euro area 
periphery, strong cross-border capital 
 ows in the 
run-up to the crisis fueled credit, asset price, and 

domestic demand booms, which led to a surge 

in imports, rapid expansion of the nontradable 

sector, deterioration of competitiveness, and 

widening current account de
 cits. This pattern 
was also observed in countries with exchange 

rates pegged to the euro in anticipation of early 

euro area entry. When capital 
 ows slowed, 
the domestic demand booms ended, and sharp 

recessions ensued. 
The legacy of the boom years and subsequent 
crisis is likely to depress growth in the euro area 

periphery and countries with exchange rates pegged 

to the euro for some time. The debt overhang in 

the private sector and sharply deteriorated public 

 nances will subdue domestic demand, while the 
erosion of competiveness during the boom is 

bound to depress exports. In the absence of labor 

mobility and exchange rate 
 exibility, and with 
limited wage and price adjustment capacity, 

turning these dynamics around is proving to be 

quite challenging.
This chapter 
 rst discusses the contribution of 
 nancial integration to rising current account 
imbalances before the crisis. It shows how 
 nancial 
integration led to sharp compression of interest 

rate differentials, which boosted investment and 

reduced saving in countries that previously had high 

interest rates, and how strong credit and housing 

booms led to massive current account de
 cits. 
The chapter then reviews why the unwinding of 
the imbalances led to such a severe crisis. It will 

show that the widening of current account de
 cits 
ultimately was the result of an unsustainable and 

risky growth pattern, which went on for too long as 

markets paid insuf
 cient attention to rising 
risks, and policies did too little to address these 

market failures. 
The aggravation of the crisis by the absence of 
EU-wide institutions to deal with banking crises 
and by the incomplete integration of capital

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
54Imbalances and CrisisThe elimination of exchange rate risk in the wake 
of monetary integration led to rapid reductions in 

risk premiums and to interest rate convergence, 

particularly for money market and government 

bond rates (Figure 3.1). Progress in 
 scal 
consolidation, aimed at meeting the Maastricht debt 

and de cit criteria, further reduced risk premiums. 
In the  rst half of the 1990s, the governments of 
Finland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain still paid spreads 

of 400 basis points or more over German bund 

rates, re
 ecting a history of frequent devaluations. 
In the run-up to the euro introduction, during 1995 

to 1998, these spreads disappeared almost entirely, 

bringing immediate and tangible bene ts in the 
form of lower funding costs for the public sector, 

corporations, and households. The process repeated 

itself for countries adopting the euro at later stages, 

as well as for the hard peg countries in emerging 

Europe that had tied their currencies to the euro. 

Interest rate convergence tended to be far less 

pronounced in the central European countries that 
kept 
 exible exchange rates, and for countries that 
were not members of the EU.
3 Monetary integration also encouraged larger 
cross-border  nancial exposures (Figure 3.2). 
In the banking sector, the share of interbank 

loans to banks within the euro area increased from 
15 percent in the late 1990s to 25 percent in the 
late 2000s, and to 20 percent from 10 percent for 

interbank loans to banks in the EU but outside the 
euro area. In addition, home bias for investment 

funds™ allocations of equity and debt securities 

declined signi cantly.
4Not all  nancial markets became equally integrated: 
by 2007, debt markets had become most integrated, 

while cross-border  ows in foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and equity portfolio investment 

remained more limited. External debt liabilities 
3 The exception is the Czech Republic.
4 By contrast, retail lending remained largely within 
national borders because banking groups typically 

expanded into other European countries by establishing 

branches or subsidiaries rather than through direct cross-

border lending.
markets is also discussed. Although the EU has 
fostered  nancial integration by relaxing constraints, 
harmonizing various aspects of the 
 nancial 
system, and adopting a common currency, this 

process has been allowed to outpace development 

of the institutions necessary to support the single 

 nancial market. In the absence of EU-wide 
institutions, the approach to dealing with banking 

sector problems remained national throughout the 
crisis. Banking and sovereign debt problems have 

thus exacerbated each other, leading to vicious 

circles in the periphery.
Finally, the chapter discusses that while the crisis 
has led to a sharp adjustment of earlier current 

account imbalances, just dealing with imbalances is 

not enough. The most critical factor in the longer 

term is restoring GDP growth in the crisis-affected 

countries, with stronger roles for the tradable sector 

and exports, and less reliance on the nontradable 

sector, capital 
 ows, and domestic demand. 
Ultimately, growth and convergence will need to 

be backed by productivity increases. To foster 

ef ciency increases and prevent the reemergence 
of imbalances, better policies are needed at the 

national level, while better governance at the EU 

level would give teeth to such policies.  
The chapter focuses on the original EMU members, 
Greece, the Baltic countries, and Bulgaria. 

These countries shared the euro, or had a hard 

peg to the euro, for at least 
 ve years before the 
start of the global crisis in 2007.
2 To highlight the 
role of 
 nancial integration, as opposed to trade 
integration, developments in four central European 

countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, 

and the Slovak Republic), which during the run-up 

to the global crisis all had  exible exchange 
rates, are compared with developments in the 

focus countries. 
2 Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic, which 
entered the euro area between 2007 and 2009, did not 

meet this criterion. Luxembourg is excluded because of 

its small size and role as a financial center.
3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES55were generally several times larger than FDI and 
external equity investment (Figure 3.3). Within 

debt markets, a number of countries™ cross-border 

holdings were largely con
 ned to sovereign debt 
(Figure 3.4).Cross-border mergers and acquisitions remained 
small compared with domestic mergers and 

acquisitions (Figure 3.5), and remained much lower 

than mergers and acquisitions across regions in the 

United States (Umber, Grote, and Frey, 2010). High 

concentration of corporate control (Becht and 

Mayer, 2000), regulatory differences (particularly 

in the application of takeover regulations), and 

predictability of national regulatory agencies 

seem to have been the most important barriers to 

cross-border equity  ows, including in the banking 
sector in the EU (Koehler, 2007; and Campa and 

Moschieri, 2008). 
The Widening of External ImbalancesThe decline in interest rates boosted investment and 

reduced saving in countries where interest rates had 

previously been high. The impact was particularly 

pronounced in relatively poor countries because 

the expected rapid income growth there made 

borrowing more attractive (Figures 3.6 and 3.7, 

and Table 3.1). 
Ł Household balances deteriorated as household 
saving declined and residential real estate 

investment increased. Countries with housing 

price booms saw the largest deterioration in the 

saving-investment balance.
Ł Corporate balances worsened as corporate 
saving declined, probably as a result of the 

increase in unit labor costs (see next section). 
In the hard peg countries, corporate investment

56booms also contributed signi cantly to the 
current account deterioration.
By contrast, in countries where income levels 
and interest rate levels had already converged, 

 nancial integration did not further compress 
interest rates, and domestic demand remained 

much more muted. In fact, private sector balances 

improved, although partly for reasons not directly 

related to  nancial integration. Corporate saving 
increased because wage moderation led to an 

increase in the share of pro
 ts in national income. 
Germany had entered the euro area with an 

impaired competitive position, re
 ecting in part 
the overhang from German reuni
 cation, which 
took many years of internal devaluation to correct. 
An additional factor hurting its competitiveness 

was the convergence of interest rates in the 

wake of the euro™s introduction, which negated 

Germany™s comparative advantage of low funding 

costs. Corporate investment was weak, re
 ecting 
both weak domestic demand and outsourcing to 

suppliers in emerging Europe.
Current account balances in the EU started to 
widen as a result, peaking in 2007 (Figures 3.8, 3.9, 
and 3.10). Current account balances deteriorated 

sharply in Ireland, Spain, and the hard peg 

countries. By 2007, current account de
 cits in

3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES57exceeded 10 percent of GDP. By contrast, current 
account balances improved sharply in Austria, 

Germany, and the Netherlands.
The convergence in interest rates not only fueled 
private sector spending, it also boosted government 

primary spending. The interest rate compression 

provided a substantial windfall for countries like 

Italy and Greece, allowing these countries to reduce 

their overall de
 cits while increasing primary 
spending (Figure 3.11). The boom in private sector 

domestic demand fueled a surge in government 

tax revenue, which created further space to boost 

primary expenditure (Figure 3.12). As a result, 

countries in the periphery saw a sharp increase 

in primary expenditure between 2000 and 

2007Ševen though this was not visible in headline 

 scal balances at the time.

Government Bond RatesIn general, the change in 
 scal balances played only 
a modest part in increasing external imbalances. 

The improvement in headline balances was the real 

problem, because it disguised deterioration in the 
underlying  scal situation. Interest savings and what 
turned out to be the temporary revenues had been 

used to boost primary expenditure. 
Shocks external to the EU and euro area also 
contributed to rising imbalances. The integration 

of China into the world economy bene
 ted 
Germany, which exported high-end machinery, but 

hurt southern Europe (Chen, Milesi-Ferretti, 

and Tressel, forthcoming). The integration of CEE 

countries into Europe boosted German 
 rms™ 
productivity as they set up production platforms 

in the region, but competed with other countries™ 
exports (Marin, 2010). Similarly, the appreciation 

of the euro between 1999 and 2008 had a bigger 

impact on some countries in the periphery, 

for which trade with countries outside the euro area 

is very important, than on countries in the core, for 

which trade with other euro area countries is more 

important.
5 5 The bulk of the appreciation of the CPI-based real 
effective exchange rate in Greece and Portugal was 

due to the nominal appreciation of the euro (Chen, 

Milesi-Ferretti, and Tressel, forthcoming).
3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES59The CrisisThe credit booms in Europe came to a sudden end 
in September 2008 after Lehman Brothers 
 led for 
bankruptcy. All types of capital 
 ows reversed in 
the fall of 2008, but cross-border banking 
 ows 
experienced the most severe retrenchment 
(Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011). As risk aversion 

among investors rose sharply and equity markets 

plunged, many advanced-country banks, when 

confronted with liquidity and capital shortages, 

sharply curtailed new lending or even deleveraged.

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES61In a change of strategy, they advised their 
subsidiaries and branches in emerging Europe that 

new credit would henceforth need to be 
 nanced 
solely by increases in local deposits (Figure 3.13).
66 The effect was compounded by the freezing of the 
international syndicated loans market, as well as a halt in 

the growth of direct cross-border loans.
In the euro area periphery, Ireland and Spain 
suffered wrenching private sector adjustments. 

Before the crisis, Ireland and Spain had both 

experienced investment booms, which now 

collapsed. In Portugal and Greece, whose 

investment paths had been stable or declining, 

the impact of the crisis was initially less severe. 

Subsequent stress in the public sector affected them 
more (Figure 3.14, Table 3.2).

64temporary and matched by the increased future 
capacity of the recipient countries to service their 

debts. As exports subsequently grow, imbalances 

should decline. 
However, these large capital in
 ows fueled an 
unbalanced and unsustainable growth pattern:
Ł Growth in the current account de
 cit countries 
was increasingly driven by sectors such as 

construction and 
 nancial intermediation with 
small tradable components, while growth in 

the surplus countries was tilted toward the 

tradable sector, especially industry (Table 3.3). 

As a result, the surplus countries saw sizable 

increases in their export-to-GDP ratios 

(Figure 3.18), while countries with small current 

account de cits experienced much smaller 
increases, and countries with very high current 

account de cits became even more closed in 
the 2000s. 
Why Was the Crisis So Severe?Why did the widening of current account 

imbalances culminate in such a severe crisis? In 

itself, the widening of external imbalances was not 

surprising. Capital can be expected to 
 ow from 
richer to poorer countries, where the marginal 

productivity of capital is higher. Indeed, current 

account positions in the late 2000s were closely 

linked to both per capita income and interest 

rate differentials before monetary integration 

(Figure 3.6).8 Nor are higher current account 
de cits always a concern. To the extent that 
in ows are used to expand production, especially 
export capacity, current account de
 cits should be 
8 Together, per capita income and interest rate 
differentials in the early 1990s explain about 85 percent 
of the variation in current account balances in the 

late 2000s.

66nature and the failure to prevent bubbles. 
With competition rather limited, investors 

in the nontradable sector enjoyed rents 

unavailable in the tradable sector, which was 

fully exposed to the harsh winds of global 

markets. Pro
 tability in the nontradable sector 
jumped as asset price bubbles developed 

unchecked in key subsectors such as 

construction (Figures 3.22 and 3.23). 
Ł With incentives stacked toward the 
nontradable sector, investment took off and 

foreign capital  owed in. Beginning in 2002Œ
03, the share of FDI in the current account 

de cit countries declined while bank and 
portfolio in
 ows surged (Figure 3.24). As the 
capital stock in the nontradable sector grew, 

marginal productivity of capital declined over 

time (Table 3.4). 
Ł This pattern of growth led to a steady widening 
of current account balances, which resulted 

in large changes in net external asset positions 

(Figure 3.25)Šan ultimately unsustainable 
trend. Ł As current account de
 cits widened, countries 
became increasingly dependent on continuing 

capital in ows, and a sudden stop of capital 
in ows could cause a large-scale 
 nancial 
disruption, with a severe impact on growth.
Ł Strong growth in the nontradable sector, in 
turn, contributed to rising wages, which put 

pro tability in the tradable sector under pressure 
(Figures 3.19, 3.20, 3.21) and made the current 

account de cit countries less attractive for FDI.

January 2010–March 2011 Figure 3.173. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES67Markets Underestimated RisksBefore the recent global crisis, markets tended to 
underestimate these risks. This pattern was also 

observed in countries with exchange rates pegged 

to the euro in anticipation of early euro area entry. 

Risk premiums remained low, so current account 

imbalances became wider and more persistent, 
thus contributing to large changes in net external 

asset positions. Markets showed little concern until 

mid-2007, ignoring solvency risk and covering large 

 nancing needs at low interest rates, which boosted 
self-feeding bubbles in nontraded sectors. By failing 

to demand higher risk premiums, markets failed to 

rein in this unhealthy development until it was too 

late for a soft landing. This situation is not unique 

to the European debt crisis but follows a pattern 

familiar from other crisis cases, including the Latin 

American debt crisis of the early 1980s, the Asian 

crisis of the late 1990s, and the U.S. subprime crisis 

of the late 2000s. 
One reason markets underestimated risks may 
have been the expectation that euro area banks and 

governments would be bailed out. Markets found 

it dif cult to imagine that the euro area countries 
would not come to the rescue of members in 

troubleŠparticularly given the interconnectedness 

of their banking systems. The regulatory 

environment also considered all sovereign bonds to 

be safe assets.
Yet the underestimation of risk was not con
 ned 
to Europe. The belief was widely held that 
macroeconomic volatility had declined and the 
central problem of depression prevention, for all 

practical purposes, had been solved (the ﬁGreat 

Moderationﬂ). Large capital 
 ows seemed to 
carry few risks when crisis was seen as a remote 

possibility.
Economic Policies Failed to Address ImbalancesEconomic policies failed to suf ciently correct 
market failures and check overoptimistic 

expectations. 
Ł With interest rates set at the euro area average 
and markets not differentiating between 

countries, the credit boom became dif
 cult 
to stop once it had started. Indeed, as the 

economy heated up and in
 ation and wages 
started to rise, high in
 ation led to negative 
real interest rates, further boosting demand 

for credit (Figure 3.26). In emerging Europe, 

and as discussed in the October 2010 Regional 
Economic Outlook, the new EU member states that had  xed their currencies to the euro 
at an early stage (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, 

and Lithuania) all experienced credit and 
domestic demand booms and very high 

current account de
 cits, while countries that 
retained greater monetary independence 

generally experienced less pronounced 

imbalances (Box 3.1).

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES69Why Is Resolution of the Crisis So Protracted?The boom-bust cycle in the euro area periphery 
was not unique. During the boom years, countries 

throughout the world experienced credit and asset 

price escalations. Stark differences across regions 

also occurred in other monetary unions. In the 

United States, Arizona, California, Florida, and 

Nevada went through severe boom-bust cycles, 

while other states were much less affected.
The crisis in Europe was prolonged by the 
incomplete integration of the 
 nancial system 
and the absence of a centralized mechanism to 

deal with it. The result was a vicious circle in 

which sovereign debt and banking sector problems 

aggravated each other.
Financial Integration Is IncompleteFinancial integration in the EU and the euro area is 

still incomplete and uneven. Some elements of the 

 nancial system are highly integrated: capital 
 ows 
cross borders with little impediment, and banks 
transact freely in the money market. But home 

bias in portfolio allocations remains, securitization 

is very much a national affair (for example, no 

uniform mortgage contract exists), and cross-

border retail banking is virtually nonexistentŠ

cross-border provision of retail 
 nancial services 
amounts to less than 1 percent of total loans. Apart 

from some regional clusters, cross-border mergers 

and acquisitions are still limited in most European 
banking markets, with foreign acquisitions 

accounting for only 20 percent of banking activity, 

compared with 40 percent in other sectors.
12 For the euro area as a whole, foreign bank 

participation in domestic markets amounted to 

27 percent in 2009 (Figure 3.28).12 The situation is different in many countries of 
emerging Europe, where foreign banks tend to dominate 

the banking sector, reflecting a conscious decision by 

the governments to divest to Western banks because 

domestic and state-owned banks repeatedly caused crises 

and slowed the transition process.
larger capital buffers and provisions in good 
times, which would have raised the cost of 

capital and slowed the expansion of 
 nancial 
sector balance sheets, or at least made banks 

less vulnerable in the subsequent bust.10While credit excesses, housing booms, 

competitiveness losses, and lack of 
 scal discipline 
all played a role, their contributions were country 

speci c. Greece suffered most from the lack of 
 scal discipline. Ireland and Spain experienced 
a lack of political fortitude to use 
 scal policy 
and macroprudential tools to manage credit and 

housing cycles.
1110 During the boom years, many countries in emerging 
Europe strengthened prudential regulations to slow 

credit growth. Although these measures had limited 

effectiveness in slowing credit, they resulted in the 

creation of large capital and liquidity buffers, which 

protected the banks during the crisis of 2008Œ09.
11 During the boom years, Spanish banks were required 
to build supplemental reserves to cover future loan 

losses (ﬁdynamic provisioningﬂ). While this helped to 

build buffers, it was less successful in slowing credit 

growth.

¹ Real GDP divided by total capital stock.
² Change in real GDP divided by change in total capital stock.As a result, banking  ows to the euro area 
periphery during the boom years largely took the 

form of debt rather than equity, which exposed 

banks in the periphery to rollover risk. By contrast, 

in emerging Europe, with fewer implicit barriers to 

bank expansion, most of the bank 
 ows went from 
parent banks to their local subsidiaries. Although 

nominally in the form of debt, in practice the 
 ows 
were more like equityŠparent banks could not 

suddenly withdraw funding from their subsidiaries 

because such an action would lead to liquidity 

shortages in the subsidiary and likely intervention 

by supervisors. The more stable funding structure 

bene ted banks in emerging Europe during the 
crisis, and may have been one of the reasons that 

banking crises in the region were largely avoided.
Institutions Supporting the Single Financial Market Are Still Being BuiltThe EU has fostered 
 nancial integration by 
relaxing constraints (for example, the single 

passport for cross-border banking) and 

harmonizing various aspects of the 
 nancial 
system, and by adopting a common currency in the 

euro area, but this process has been allowed to run 
of the banking system. It is not surprising, 
then, that the ef ciency bene
 ts conferred by 
heightened competition in a single market have 

been limited at best and have recently suffered a 

setback (Box 3.2).

74Box 3.1Why Did the Currency Board Countries in Emerging Europe Have Such Large Imbalances?As discussed in Chapter 3 of the October 2010 
Regional Economic Outlook: Europe
 (IMF, 2010b) the large capital 
 ows that went to emerging Europe in the years before the global economic crisis did not affect all countries 
equally. In some countries, current account de
 cits widened to over 15 percent of GDP and in
 ation reached 
double digits, while in others imbalances remained more contained.
One important factor in these differences was the exchange rate regime. The largest imbalances occurred in new EU 
member states with hard currency pegs to the euro (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). In most new member 

states with more  exible exchange rate regimes, imbalances were milder (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, 
and the Slovak Republic). Imbalances were also less in countries with 
 xed exchange rates that were not yet EU 
members (Bosnia and FYR Macedonia). Capital  ows into these countries were lower, probably partly because of 
the memory and legacy of various con
 icts in the region, and partly because they were not yet in the EU).
Why did imbalances in new member states with hard pegs become so much larger than in new member states 
with more  exible exchange rate regimes?  
Ł From a demand perspective, a boom in domestic demand drove GDP growth in countries with 
 xed exchange 
rates (see  gure). These countries saw sharp increases in their domestic demand to GDP ratios, while the 
exports to GDP ratios increased much less. In countries with 
 oating exchange rates, the growth pattern was 
more balanced.Ł From a supply perspective, GDP growth was driven to a large extent by the nontradable sector. Countries with 
more  exible exchange rates had much stronger growth in manufacturing. These differences re
 ect differences 
in capital in ows. In the Baltics and Bulgaria, capital 
 ows largely went to the nontradable sector, whereas in 
the countries with more  exible exchange rates, a much larger share went to the tradable sector.

3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES75When faced with large capital in
 ows, the 
 xed exchange rate regime countries had few instruments at their 
disposal to stop the credit boom. Indeed, they experienced a vicious circle. As the economy heated up and 

wage growth and in
 ation increased, real interest rates dropped, further boosting demand for credit. Sharp 
wage increases led to a deterioration of the tradable sector™s competitiveness, which led to a reduction in the 

growth of exports. Countries with more 
 exible exchange rates did not experience the same vicious circleŠ
they could keep real interest rates higher by letting the nominal exchange rate appreciate, which mitigated the 

credit boom.planned coordination. There is little alternative 
to harmonization of regulations and supervisory 

practices at the EU level and an approach to crisis 

management and resolution that employs a pan-

EU backstop. Only then will location no longer 

matter for  nancial institutions™ costs of and access 
to funding, and only then will the  nancial system 
be decoupled from the sovereign, a link that in the 

current crisis has proved to be detrimental in both 

directions. 
More Complete Financial Integration Would Have Helped Resolve the Crisis How would this deeper integration forti
 ed by 
proper institutions have helped in resolving the 

crisis?Ł First, banks would have suffered less spillover 
from sovereign debt trouble. Deposit guarantees 

or any other implicit guarantees would not have 

depended on the sovereign signature, which 

would have kept funding costs for banks in euro 

area periphery countries in check.
Ł Second, it would have given the EU more 
options for dealing with weaknesses in the 

banking system. If domestic markets had been 

more open to foreign banks, national public 

sector policies for supporting and recapitalizing 

banksŠwhich has perpetuated the adverse 

feedback between banks and sovereignŠwould 

not have been the only viable measures.
14 14 Achieving these changes would require rapid progress 
on the single regulatory rulebook for banks and on 

harmonizing supervisory practices to eliminate multiple 

reporting requirements. Standardization of products, 
Ł Third, it would have facilitated consolidation 
of the 
 nancial sector typical in the aftermath 
of a crisis and helped avoid the tendency to 

ring-fence national systems. Consolidation 

is now occurring slowly, if at all, and often 

within borders. In many cases, restructuring 

has led to refocusing on the domestic market 

and sales of foreign operations, thus reducing 

 nancial integration. Similarly, national 
authorities, mindful of their taxpayers, are ring-

fencing operations under their purview, thus 

diminishing the bene ts of the single market.
Ł Finally, had a pan-EU supervisory regime been 
in place, excessive exposures or expansions of 

banking systems well beyond the 
 scal capacity 
of the sovereign may have been spotted and ill-

considered unilateral policy moves avoided. 
Experience in the United States illustrates that more centralized crisis resolution mechanisms and more 

integrated capital markets can make a difference 

(Box 3.3). The United States also went through 

a severe boom-bust cycle, with large differences 

across regions. Although the U.S. 
 scal de
 cit is 
now higher than that of the euro area countries, 

and some individual states have come under 

signi cant 
 scal pressures, the U.S. capital market 
has not disintegrated along state lines.
In sum, increased  nancial integration will 
improve risk sharing and should help stabilize 

national demand, contributing to the resolution 

of imbalances and helping prevent their 

reemergence. But it will need to be accompanied 
the establishment of a pan-European approach to 
securitization, and more uniform consumer protection 

regimes are also needed. REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
76Box 3.2 Recent Developments in Bank Competition in Europe Globalization and  nancial integration have changed the business environment in which banks operate. 
The impact has been profound in Europe, supported by the introduction of the euro, signi
 cant liberalization, 
and harmonization of 
 nancial sector regulation as policymakers pursue the goal of a single market. A fully 
integrated 
 nancial market promotes innovation and competition and ensures ef
 cient provision of 
 nancial 
goods and services. At the same time, the global 
 nancial crisis has made clear that harmonized and well-designed 
regulation and prudent supervision of the banking sector are indispensible for preventing excessive risk taking. 

The crisis took a heavy toll on European banks and required the introduction of bank support schemes to avoid 

disorderly bank failures that could have pushed the 
 nancial sector into collapse. With advice from the ECB and 
the European Commission, national authorities implemented support schemes for their domestic banks. The 

Commission had to balance the need for state aid on the one hand with safeguarding competition and avoiding 

market segmentation along national borders on the other. Whether this has been achieved is a key question for 

policymakers. A competitive and suf
 ciently integrated banking sector should facilitate adjustment and the needed 
recapitalization, and cross-border restructuring through mergers and acquisitions is an essential element.
The level of bank competition can be measured in various ways. Historically, inferences about the level 
of competition relied on structural characteristics such as concentration ratios for the largest banks, or 

overall pro
 tability. However, high capital returns may simply re
 ect high ef
 ciency instead of monopolistic 
rents. Moreover, structural features could be less relevant in gauging market competition in very open, 

globally integrated, and highly contestable markets. Unrestricted entry and exit of 
 rms, including those 
from abroad, may force banks to act competitively even if their numbers are small. Indeed, Claessens and 

Laeven (2004) show for a large cross-country sample that being open to new entry is the most important 

competitive pressure; they 
 nd no evidence that banking system concentration is negatively associated with 
competitiveness.
The H-statistic (H) developed by Panzar and Rosse (1987) is a widely used measure for competitive behavior that 
relies on market contestability and potential competitors. It focuses on the degree to which changes in the costs 

of inputs lead to subsequent changes in revenues. Under a monopoly, an increase in input prices will increase 

marginal costs and reduce equilibrium output and total revenues (H < 0). Under perfect competition, an increase 

in input prices will be fully passed on to the output price (H = 1). Positive values less than 1 imply some degree 

of monopolistic competition. Estimation results for the periods 1995Œ2000, 2001Œ07, and 2008Œ09 show the 

following:
1Ł In the period shortly after the introduction of the euro (2001Œ07), competitive bank behavior broadly 
converged across euro area member countries to a lower overall level and closer to the U.S. level.
Ł In the aftermath of the 
 nancial crisis, several European countries and the euro area as a whole saw a 
further small but statistically signi
 cant deterioration in their levels of banking competition. However, 
the overall deterioration in competition in Europe appears no worse than the deterioration in the 

United States. 
The 
 nding that large and 
 nancially integrated countries or regions tend to exhibit less competitive behavior 
than smaller regions exhibit is in line with other studies, including Bikker and Spierdijk (2008), who also 
 nd 
Note: The main author of this box is Thomas Harjes.
1 Postcrisis estimates only provide preliminary evidence in view of the limited number of observations and the fact that 
structural changes in the aftermath of the crisis may have distorted the long-term market equilibrium in some countries, which 

could invalidate the H-statistic.
3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES77some deterioration in competitive behavior over time for Europe™s banks. They argue that banks in large 
and integrated 
 nancial markets are pushed by rising capital market competition and tend to shift from 
traditional intermediation to more sophisticated and complex products associated with less price 

competition. However, the further deterioration in competitive pricing observed in the aftermath of the 

crisis is unlikely to yet re
 ect structural market changes and evolving bank business models. Instead, 
signi cant bank losses and the subsequent need for recapitalization may have temporarily limited competitive 
pressures. Finally, little evidence yet suggests that national support schemes in Europe have further hindered 

competition. Nevertheless, the European Commission and other regulatory agencies should continue to 

insist on bold restructuring and balance sheet repair in instances in which state aid has been granted with 

a view toward maintaining a level playing 
 eld for healthy and competitive banks with sound business 
models.

78Box 3.3 Crisis Resolution and Financial Integration in the United StatesLike Europe, the United 
States experienced large 

regional differences in 
the housing boom-bust. 
California, Florida, Nevada, 

and Arizona went through 

the most severe cycles. 

In these states, housing 

prices more than doubled 
from 2000 to their peak, 
and then declined sharplyŠ

in Nevada by more than 

50 percent. In other states, 

the amplitude of the cycle 

was not as large. These 

differences in the housing 
boom-bust were associated 

with stark differences in the 
severity of the recession 

( rst three 
 gures). Between 
late 2006 and late 2010, 
the unemployment rate 

rose by 10 percentage 

point in Nevada, and only 

½ percentage point in 

North Dakota.
1 Differences in unemployment rate 

levels were similarly starkŠ

ranging from 4 percent 
in North Dakota to 

14½ percent in Nevada. 
However, unlike in Europe, 
 nancial markets in the 
United States remained 
fully integrated. Some states 

experienced sometimes severe 
 scal pressures,
2 but there were no concerns that these pressures would affect the 
 nancial sector or reduce market access for the private sector, and there was no differentiation in private sector 
 nancial market access by state.

 ted from an oil industry boom.
2 In California, the recession™s negative effect on revenues together with the strict balanced budget provision led to the 
issuance of IOUs in lieu of some payments in the summer of 2009. The budget approval process was further complicated by 

the requirement of a two-thirds super majority of votes to pass the budget bill.

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES79This marked difference between the United States and Europe is likely the result of the different 
 nancial 
sector crisis resolution mechanisms, the better integration of capital markets, and the larger role of the federal 

government. With much smaller state debts, and with bail-out responsibility assigned to the federal level, concerns 

about the public  nances of individual states do not spill over to the private sector.
Ł In Europe, individual countries were responsible for rescuing insolvent banks, while in the United States, 
 nancial bailouts took place at the federal level.
3 Thus, in Ireland bank support weighed on public 
 nances, 
while in the United States the bailouts of AIG and investment banks were done at the federal level rather than 

by the state where the bank was headquartered.  
Ł In the United States, failing banks often are taken over quickly by other banksŠincluding from other statesŠ
while in Europe such takeovers of problem banks have been uncommon.
3  The federal government stepped in to save Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial, and a host of 
others. In September 2008, the Treasury was given authority to use $700 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program 

to purchase assets, make equity investments and loans, and provide asset guarantees in a range of 
 nancial institutions and 
markets. At the height of the crisis, the Treasury also guaranteed more than $3 trillion in assets to prevent runs on money 

market mutual funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation extended the coverage of insured deposits to $250,000, 

provided an unlimited guarantee of transactions deposits, and guaranteed new bank debt issues. The Federal Reserve provided 
a range of liquidity support to depository institutions, securities dealers, select foreign central banks, and key markets, and
 conducted unconventional large-scale asset purchases to support the housing sector and the economy. See IMF (2010c).

80Ł In the United States, state debt is relatively lowŠin 2008, federal debt held by the public was about 2½ times 
as large as debt issued by states.
4 Constitutional and statutory provisions in many states limit debt issuance, and 
most states are governed by balanced budget provisions (last 
 gure, top panel).
5Ł In the United States, the borrowing 
 exibility and safe haven status of the federal government provides a 
backstop for the individual states during bad times. A sizable part of the federal stimulus went to states, helping 

to prevent sharp spending cuts at the state level. More broadly, unlike in Europe, the much larger role of the 

central  scal authority in the United States may have a stabilizing effect on individual states. Spending by the 
federal government is about as large as spending of individual states (last 
 gure, lower panel). 
4  By 2010, outstanding federal debt had increased to 60 percent of GDP, suggesting that the ratio increased even further. 
No data on 2010 individual state debt are available yet.
5  Some of these provisions are implicit rather than explicit: ﬁsome balanced budget requirements are based on interpretations 
of state constitutions and statutes rather than on an explicit statement that the state must have a balanced budgetﬂ (National 

Conference of State Legislatures, 2010).

 nancial crisis, the macroeconomic balance 
approach is used to compare actual current account balances with ﬁequilibriumﬂ current accounts, which are 

determined as a function of fundamental factors.
1 This notion of ﬁequilibriumﬂ measures levels of the current 
account that are consistent with underlying macroeconomic conditions and does not explicitly address the 
sustainability of current account positions.
A simple empirical model was used, based on the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues methodology.
2 In this model, current accounts as ratios to GDP are determined as a function of the initial net foreign asset 

position, the  scal balance, the per capita growth rate, the level of per capita GDP, the oil trade balance, and key 
demographic features (see Annex for technical details). This approach con
 rms that current accounts moved away 
from their equilibrium values in the period immediately before the global crisis (
 rst 
 gure, 
 rst and second panels). 
During 2001Œ04, most actual current account balances were not signi
 cantly different from their estimated 
equilibrium values. Re
 ecting comparatively older populations (and, in some cases, natural resources and 
importance as 
 nancial centers) a number of countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the 
Netherlands were in surplus, whereas countries in the southern periphery of the euro area (Greece, Portugal, 

and Spain) were showing a modest de
 cit, and new EU member states (notably the Baltics, Hungary, Romania, 
and the Slovak Republic), characterized by much lower GDP levels, displayed somewhat larger de
 cits. This 
juxtaposition is consistent with convergence theory, according to which capital should 
 ow downhill to equilibrate 
its relative return (Abiad, Leigh, and Mody, 2007). 
Subsequently, during 2005Œ08, current accounts moved away from their estimated equilibrium values in a 
signi cant number of cases. De
 cits in the periphery of the euro area and new member states became larger 
than could be explained by equilibrium models. In the periphery of the euro area, the gaps between the de
 cits 
and their estimated equilibrium intervals ranged from about 1 percent of GDP in Portugal to nearly 5 percent 

of GDP in Spain. Among the new member states, the gaps ranged from about 1 percent of GDP in Estonia and 

Lithuania to more than 9 percent of GDP in Bulgaria. Overoptimistic expectations of rapid income convergence 

together with underestimations of risk and policies that supported the allocation of resources to the nontradable 

sector, underpinned these developments (see main text). Conversely, in a few countries (notably Germany) 

surpluses began to exceed equilibrium values. While these diverging current account developments were not 

mirror images inside the euro area or the EU, they were 
 nanced largely by intra-euro area or intra-EU capital 
 ows (Chen, Milesi-Ferretti, and Tressel, forthcoming).  
Current accounts began moving back toward equilibrium as a consequence of the global crisis. The return of risk 
aversion and risk differentiation sharply curbed cross-border capital 
 ows. The resulting contraction in private 
and public domestic demand led to an acute reduction of current account de
 cits. Current account balances 
in surplus countries also narrowed as exports declined and domestic demand held up better than in the de
 cit 
countries.
Note: The main author of this box is Irina Tytell.
1 Two other approaches to determining sustainable current account balances exist. One is a reverse ﬁearly warningﬂ type 
exercise that links the probability of a crisis to the degree of imbalance and derives ﬁsafe levelsﬂ of current account 

imbalances. This approach is based on historical observations of the association of imbalances with subsequent crises. 

Another approach is based on evaluating the current account balance that stabilizes the net foreign asset position of the 

country in question (see Lee and others, 2008).
2 See Lee and others (2008); and also Jaumotte and Sodsriwiboon (2010); Barnes, Lawson, and Radziwill (2010); and Decressin 
and Stavrev (2009).

were used rather than those for actual growth.

3. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES83EU- and IMF-supported adjustment programs. For some countries, including Belgium, France, Italy, and 
Spain, a modest further improvement in the external accounts would be desirable. Strikingly, a number of 

countries in eastern Europe are set to run current account balances well above what would be consistent 

with fundamentals. The gaps between the de
 cits and their estimated equilibrium intervals are projected to 
range between about 2 percent of GDP in Bulgaria to 10 percent of GDP in Latvia. This possibly re
 ects 
a combination of private sector balance sheet repair currently under way, and still-heightened risk aversion 

toward the region, both of which may temporarily depress domestic demand. A subsequent recovery 

of domestic demand would likely bring current account balances back in line with equilibrium values. 

Similarly, a number of surplus countries are set to continue to run surpluses that exceed values justi
 ed by 
fundamentals.
The ongoing fiscal adjustment could have sizable effects on current account balances in a number of 
countries. Fiscal deficits rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and are currently 

being brought down to preserve sustainability of the public finances across the EU. In some countries 

(for example, Greece), projected fiscal deficits remain higher than targets stipulated in their most recent 

Stability and Convergence Programs (SCPs), while in other countries (for example, Germany) the situation 

is now reversed (second figure, first panel). A simulation based on the model mentioned above shows that 

additional adjustment to align projected fiscal balances to current SCP targets could be enough to bring 

Italy™s, France™s, and Belgium™s current account deficits within the normal range (second figure, second 

panel). In Greece, continued fiscal consolidation would further reduce, although not eliminate, remaining 

imbalances. At the same time, additional consolidation could further increase the current account balance 

in Ireland. 
by robust institutional arrangements and 
backstops at the EU or euro area level. Finally, 

 nancial integration will remain imperfect for 
some time, so 
 scal and structural policies 
will also need to be implemented to facilitate 

adjustment to shocks under a common 

monetary policy. 
Restoring Growth and Preventing Future Excessive ImbalancesThe crisis led to a sharp adjustment of earlier 
current account imbalances, and current account 

balances in many countries are now close to 

ﬁequilibriumﬂ (Box 3.4). Current account de
 cits 
in Spain and Ireland declined signi cantly by 2010, 
while current account de
 cits in the Baltics and 
Bulgaria disappeared or turned into surpluses. 

Looking ahead, de cits are set to be reduced to 
levels compatible with equilibrium values of the 

current account, with a few notable exceptions 

(Greece and Portugal). In Greece, policies are in 
place to further improve the external 
accounts under the EU/IMF-supported 

adjustment programs. 
To overcome the crisis decisively, adjusting 
imbalances is not enough: the most critical factor 

in the longer term is restoring GDP growth in 

the crisis-affected countries to secure lasting 

prosperity. Strong GDP growth would also 

make it easier to put public 
 nances on a 
sustainable footing and improve the health of 

banking systems.
A sustainable recovery in crisis-affected countries 
will require a growth pattern different from 

that of the precrisis years, with a stronger role 

for the tradable sector and exports, and a less 

prominent role for the nontradable sector, capital 

 ows, and domestic demand. The previous 
growth pattern, which relied on large capital 

in ows, led to pronounced boom-bust cycles. 
These cycles increased growth volatility but had 

no appreciable effect on average growth while 

leaving a legacy of high external indebtedness

euro area periphery, Ireland™s competitiveness 

has improved considerably, while Spain has 

experienced a strong increase in exports. In 

Greece and Portugal, export growth is still weak, 

even though Greece has seen an improvement in 

competitiveness.
Ultimately, growth and convergence will depend 
on productivity increases. On this front, some 

countries have performed poorly over the past 

decade, despite ample access to foreign capital. 

In Portugal, for example, labor productivity grew 

by much less than its starting position pointed it 

toward. Apparently it failed to put the large capital

86Box 3.5How Can the Reemergence of Excessive Imbalances Be Prevented?Policies can help prevent a recurrence of imbalances. 
They could do so, for example, by improving 
 scal 
institutions, helping to channel capital 
 ows to 
productive uses, and promoting strong private sector 

balance sheets. In addition, structural reforms could 

improve domestic price and wage adjustment and 

stimulate healthy private saving and investment 

behavior.
Identifying effective policy measures for reducing or 
preventing excessive current account imbalances is not 

an easy task. First, many policies may have multiple 

effects that yield ambiguous overall implications for 

imbalances, thus requiring a case-by-case analysis to 

determine their suitability. Second, many policies are 

dif cult to quantify, so that existing indicators often 
suffer from measurement errors and small-sample 

biases. For these reasons, the recommendations below 

are merely suggestive. Actual policies need to be 

carefully tailored to speci c circumstances in every 
country, and the estimated effects on imbalances 

should be treated with caution.1 Fiscal
Although  scal adjustment can help reduce excessive 
imbalances in the near term, over the longer term 

the quality of budgetary institutions underpins 
 scal 
discipline. Sound public 
 nances, in turn, can help 
to avoid excessive current account imbalances. The 

quality of 
 scal institutions in a number of EU 
countries that developed excessive de
 cits ahead 
of the global 
 nancial crisisŠ the Baltics, Bulgaria, 
Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and RomaniaŠranks 

relatively low (
 gure, 
 rst panel).
2 Raising the quality of their 
 scal institutions to the average level in the 
EU could have reduced excessive de
 cits in 2005Œ08 
by about 1 percent of GDP in Greece, Ireland, and 

Portugal, and by up to ½ percent of GDP in the 

Baltics, Bulgaria, and Romania.

FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, GROWTH, AND IMBALANCES87FinancialIn the wake of the global 
 nancial crisis, effective 
 nancial and macroprudential regulation was identi
 ed as a 
key tool for preventing credit and housing bubbles that could cause unsustainable consumption and investment 

booms. Distortions in mortgage markets are especially damaging in countries where home ownership rates are 

high. Countries with high loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) on mortgage loans and high home ownership rates include 

Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, and Spain, all of which ran excessive current account de
 cits ahead of the 
global  nancial crisis (
 gure, second panel).
2 This suggests that measures to keep LTVs in such countries at more 
reasonable levels could help prevent excessive de
 cits in the future. Bringing the combination of maximum LTVs 
on mortgage loans and home ownership rates to the EU average could have reduced excessive de
 cits in 2005Œ08 
by 1Œ1½ percent of GDP in Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, and Spain. 
Structural

Although the link between structural policies in labor and product markets and growth is well established, the 
evidence on the role of these policies in relation to current account imbalances remains relatively limited (see, for 

example, Berger and Nitsch, 2010; and Kerdrain, Koske, and Wanner, 2010). The lack of evidence may re
 ect 
potentially opposing effects of these policies on imbalances and resulting ambiguities in their overall effects, 

which make some of the recommendations in this area particularly tenuous.
4A high tax wedge on labor raises costs and lowers corporate pro
 tability, thereby reducing investment and 
pushing the current account balance toward surplus. It could also increase unemployment, raising the need 

for precautionary saving on the part of households, which would also push the current account into surplus. 

Reducing the average tax wedge could help lessen excessive surpluses in Austria, Germany, and Sweden (
 gure, 
third panel). Bringing it to the EU average could have reduced excessive surpluses in 2005Œ08 by about ½ percent 

of GDP in these countries.
The link between the strictness of employment protection legislation (EPL) and the extent of product market 
regulation (PMR) to current account imbalances is less clear. Although stricter EPL gives workers more job security, 

it also leads to longer unemployment spells and reduces productivity, with ambiguous overall effects on precautionary 

saving and the current account. Similarly, more extensive PMR tends to lower productivity, hurting the working 

population that has a high propensity to save, but it also tends to raise costs and lower corporate pro
 tability, thereby 
reducing investment, so that the overall effect on the current account is unclear. On the whole, there is no strong 

evidence suggesting that reducing EPL or PMR would lessen or prevent excessive imbalances in the EU.
5In addition, certain labor market practices not directly considered hereŠfor example, collective bargaining systems that 

lead to excessive wage demandsŠhave likely contributed to the widening of the imbalances. Structural policies that 

improve wage 
 exibility could facilitate current account adjustment and help to prevent a resurgence of imbalances 
in the future. Similarly, further liberalization in nontradable sectors would help in surplus countries by stimulating 

domestic demand and in de cit countries by moderating prices and improving competitiveness in tradable sectors.
3 Maximum LTVs refer to the highest observed LTVs in the mid- to late 2000s. Home ownership rates re
 ect census data 
from the early to mid-2000s. See Crowe and others (2011; forthcoming); and IMF (2011). 
4 Indicators of structural policies in labor and product markets come from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) and Kerdrain, Koske, and Wanner (2010). 
5 In the literature, the evidence on the effects of EPL and PMR on current accounts is mixed. For example, Kerdrain, Koske, 
and Wanner (2010) do not 
 nd any signi
 cant effects of EPL on saving rates, a somewhat surprising positive effect on 
investment rates (possibly re
 ecting increased substitution of capital for labor), and a negative effect on current accounts in 
OECD countries; they  nd no lasting effects of PMR on investment rates and no signi
 cant effects on current accounts. 
In contrast, Berger and Nitsch (2010) 
 nd that European countries with higher EPL and PMR exhibit systematically lower 
trade surpluses or higher trade de
 cits than do their peers with more 
 exible labor and product markets.

caution and leave little margin for countries 

to escape in-depth analysis, especially because 

the intent of the alert system is to identify 

potential imbalances in a timely manner.

ConclusionsIn the run-up to the crisis, countries in the euro 

area periphery, and countries in emerging Europe 

with  xed exchange rates, built up large current 
account imbalances. Although the causes of the 

imbalances varied across countries, the pattern was 

similar: strong capital 
 ows into the nontradable 
sector drove up nontradable prices and wages and 

eroded competitiveness. Because capital 
 ows 
boosted demand rather than supply, and imports 

rather than exports, they contributed to large and 

ultimately unsustainable changes in net external 

asset positions. 
Financial integration played a critical role in 
permitting the 
 nancing of imbalances, but lack 
of institutions and a ﬁnationalﬂ approach to 

crisis resolution prevented the private sector and 

markets from playing a larger role. With banking 

problems addressed at the national level, banking 

and sovereign problems in euro area periphery 

countries exacerbated each other; and as

strong platform for discussing imbalances at the 
EU level and for handling them at the national 

level. The EIP will mimic the SGP in that it will 

have both a preventive and a corrective arm. To be 

most effective, the procedure should be designed 

such that it avoids deadlocks in all intermediate 

steps between diagnostics and sanctions and 

ensures prompt action to address severe 

vulnerabilities. The mechanism would encompass 

all EU27 countries, but more demanding 

enforcement rules should apply to euro area 

member states.
Several elements of the proposed EIP could 
be strengthened to make the process more 

effective:

Board is a welcome step and should facilitate

Barnes, Lawson, and Radziwill, 2010; and Jaumotte 

and Sodsriwiboon, 2010). Speci cally, current

on their fundamental determinants using an

variation in current account balances.  
This model was used to estimate equilibrium 
current account balances, or norms, based on 

the values of the fundamentals in the past and 

on their projections for the future. Demographic 

projections were taken from the United Nations 

and macroeconomic projections came from 
the IMF™s World Economic Outlook, with two 

exceptions: (i) in place of actual 
 scal balances, 
targets from the latest Stability and Convergence 

Programs (SCPs) were used and (ii) the European 

Commission™s projections for potential growth were 

used instead of those for actual growth. Given 

some variation in the estimates depending on 

sample composition, the model was run on eight 

different samples: the European Union, advanced 

economies, emerging economies, and the full set 

of 64 countries, over the full period from 1973 to 

2008 and over the recent period from 2001 to 2008. 

Equilibrium current account balances for each 

country were then measured using the ranges of 

predicted values from the model estimated on the 

various samples. Finally, excessive current account 

balances, or adjustment needs, for each country 

were computed as differences between the actual 

balance and the nearest end of the equilibrium 

balance range. Adjustment needs were evaluated as 

zero if the actual balance fell within the equilibrium 

balance range.
Estimating Effects of Policies on Excessive ImbalancesTo assess the role of policies, two somewhat 
different exercises were conducted. First, potential 

effects of aligning projected 
 scal balances with 
SCP targets over 2009Œ12 were simulated by 

applying the estimated model to the gaps between 

projected and targeted 
 scal balances. Second, the

were run on small samples and the results need 

to be interpreted with caution. To avoid further 

reducing sample sizes, separate regressions were 

run for each policy area. The table summarizes the

May 2009Ł Tighten the fiscal stance in 2009Œ10: limit the 2009 
general government deficit to 1¾ percent of GDP 

and adopt further fiscal consolidation in 2010. The 

tightening involves strict income policies for containing 
public sector wage and pension growth and a 
streamlining of non-priority recurrent spending, which 
helps create fiscal space to expand infrastructure 
investment.
Ł Strengthen the inflation-targeting framework while 
maintaining a managed floating exchange rate regime.Since the original program was designed in late 2008, Serbia™s external and financial 

environment deteriorated substantially. In 

response, the authorities (1) raised fiscal deficit 
targets for 2009Œ10 while taking additional fiscal 
measures, (2) received commitments from main 
foreign parent banks that they would roll over 
their commitments to Serbia and keep their 
subsidiaries capitalized, and (3) requested

lending tools to help provide effective crisis prevention.  

This is the first IMF™s commitment under PCL. The 

access to the credit line in the first year is up to $533 
million.In March 2011, changed circumstances brought 
by the early elections, including a delay in

The PCL arrangement includes indicative targets 

on the fiscal deficit and on net international 
reserves. The first review is scheduled in July 

2011.
