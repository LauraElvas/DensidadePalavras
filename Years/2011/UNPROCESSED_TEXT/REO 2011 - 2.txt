xiIntroduct ion and Overview
  Following a barrage of unfavorable shocks in 
the ﬁ rst half of 2011, global economic activity 
has weakened and has become more uneven. 

A devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan 

disrupted global manufacturing; the Arab spring 

drove up oil prices; ﬁ
 nancial strains in euro area 
ﬁ nancial and sovereign debt markets deepened; 
growth in the United States decelerated sharply; 

and the standoff about raising the ceiling on U.S. 

government debt sapped conﬁ
 dence in policy 
making. Against this backdrop, projections for 

global growth have been revised downward, 

especially for advanced economies. The September 

2011 World Economic Outlook
 projects real GDP growth worldwide at 4.0 percent for 2011and 

2012—about ½ percentage point lower than 

projected in the April 2011 edition.In Europe, the recovery lost steam in the second 
quarter, after a surprisingly strong ﬁ
 rst quarter, with 
growth in many countries coming to a near stand-

still. The deceleration was partly the result of global 

shocks, which affected mostly those countries in 

Europe that had beneﬁ ted so far from the strong 
global recovery. Yet it was also the result of the 

escalation of the euro area crisis, which is having 

a more wide-spread effect on domestic demand, 
as the conﬁ dence shock spreads beyond the 
periphery to core countries’ consumers, bankers, 

and investors. 
This edition of the 
Regional Economic Outlook
 hence projects growth for all of Europe to slow down 

from 2.4 percent in 2010 to 2.3 percent in 2011, and further to 1.8 percent in 2012 (Table 1). Inﬂ
 ation 
is likely to decline from 4.2 percent in 2011 to 

3.1 percent in 2012, amid remaining economic slack 

and commodity prices that retreat from their peaks 
in early 2011.Real economic activity in advanced Europe is 
projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2011 and 

1.3 percent in 2012. In the wake of the global 

crisis in 2008/09, advanced European economies 

recovered at different speeds. Some economies 

experienced tepid growth, hindered by high private 
indebtedness, a burst in asset prices, weak credit 
owing to banks’ funding difﬁ
 culties and private-
sector deleveraging, and lost competitiveness. 

Meanwhile, many others—such as Germany 

or Sweden—free from major imbalances, took 

advantage of their strong initial competitiveness 

positions to ride the global recovery wave in 2010, 

barely affected by the turmoil in the euro area 

periphery. This tiering is now fading, and the most 

recent indicators point to a general convergence 

toward low growth. Countries under market 

pressure will continue to suffer from deeper ﬁ
 scal 
austerity measures, sharper private-sector balance 

sheet deleveraging, and more severe structural 

unemployment, with Portugal and Greece expected 

to remain in recession until mid-2012 and early 
2013, respectively. In Italy and Spain, higher interest 

costs on the sovereign debt, front-loaded ﬁ
 scal 
adjustment, and increased tensions surrounding 

banks will constitute additional drags on already 
soft activity. Meanwhile, weaker global growth 

momentum will weigh on northern euro area 

countries, slowing the closing of their output 

gaps and the improvement of their labor markets. 

Germany, for instance, will see its growth pace 

halved from 2.7 percent in 2011 to 1.3 percent in 

2012.Growth in emerging Europe is projected to remain 
unchanged from last year—at 4.4 percent in 2011—

and then to decline to 3.4 percent in 2012, as 
rebounds run their course and the global slowdown 

makes itself felt. Growth differentials within 

emerging Europe, which had been large in 2009 

and 2010, are set to diminish. This reﬂ
 ects both 
a pickup in the Baltic countries and southeastern 

Europe—regions that had been most severely 

affected by the global crisis of 2008/09—and a 

slowdown of domestic demand growth in countries 

that hitherto expanded the fastest, such as Turkey 

and the European CIS countries. Nonetheless, 

signiﬁ cant differences remain in countries’ cyclical 
positions—output gaps in Poland and Turkey are 

closed or positive, while activity of many other 

countries has yet to return to precrisis levels.

markets and global weaknesses, downside risks 

remain particularly acute. Renewed concerns 

about policy slippages in program countries or 

lack of commitment to continued support of 

program countries at the euro area level could 

amplify the shockwaves seen during the 2011 

summer throughout the euro area with adverse 

repercussions regionally and globally. Although 

substantial amounts of capital were raised ahead 

of this summer’s stress tests, capital buffers remain 

low in a signiﬁ
 cant number of euro area ﬁ
 nancial 
institutions, which reduces their ability to cope with 

shocks. Funding could dry up, jeopardizing the 

functioning of the ﬁ
 nancial system, at a time when 
banks and sovereigns are facing major rollover 

requirements. Compounding the intra-euro area 

stresses, a further setback in global growth would 

also generate negative spillovers.
With growth momentum waning and ﬁ
 nancial 
tensions rising, policy adjustments are called 
for. The withdrawal of monetary support, or 

monetary tightening in the cyclically more advanced 

economies, will need to be paused or even reversed 

in cases where downside risks to inﬂ
 ation and 
growth persist. While the deteriorated state of 

public ﬁ nances, and renewed market concerns over 
sovereign debt, leave no option but to strengthen 

ﬁ scal positions, the slowdown in growth is calling 
for caution. Where pressures are most severe, 

the consolidation should continue to be front-

loaded—intensifying market pressures is hardly an 

option. In other countries, where medium-term 

ﬁ scal consolidation plans are credible or have been 
front-loaded, there may be room to allow automatic 

stabilizers to work fully to deal with growth 

surprises. 
Crisis management in the euro area needs to go 
beyond its current approach to secure success. 

Euro area leaders need to spell out and recommit to 
a common vision of how the euro area is expected 

to function in the future. This is essential to anchor 

market expectations and dispel the prevailing 

uncertainty. Overall, a deﬁ
 nite strengthening of 
ﬁ scal and economic governance of the monetary 
union is needed. While strengthening national 
budgetary rules, countries will need to cede some 
control over their ﬁ
 scal position to a central euro 
area body. Increased ex-ante ﬁ
 scal risk sharing is 
likely to be necessary together with a common 

approach and backstop to the ﬁ
 nancial system of 
the euro area. A number of actions to deal with the crisis 
should be undertaken urgently. Implementation 

of the July 21 EU summit decisions should be 

accelerated. More comprehensive actions toward 

restructuring and front-loaded strengthening 

of banks’ capital buffers are also needed, as 

uncertainties surrounding bank balance sheets 

continue to rattle investors. Ideally, capital should 

be raised through private solutions including cross-

border consolidations. In the absence of these 

measures, supervisors will have to make the case 

either for injecting public funds into weak banks—

which will be difﬁ
 cult in an environment of ﬁ
 scal 
consolidation—or closing them down. Ending the 

intertwining of sovereign and bank balance sheets 

stresses ultimately requires a European Resolution 

Authority, backed by a common deposit guarantee 

and resolution fund.An escalation of the strains in euro area debt 
markets also poses risks for emerging Europe, 

considering its tight economic and ﬁ nancial linkages 
with advanced Europe together with fragilities 

stemming from the 2008/09 crisis. Policy makers 

will need to make headway with repairing public 

ﬁ nances, including through strengthening ﬁ
 scal 
frameworks to underwrite lasting ﬁ
 scal discipline. 
Addressing high ratios of non-performing bank 

loans is another priority to improve conditions 

for new lending and reduce economic drag from 
overextended borrowers more generally.
Raising growth rates in slow growing countries 
would help address many of Europe’s pressing 

problems, not least lingering concerns about the 

longer-term sustainability of public ﬁ
 nances. 
In the past decade, growth rates in GDP per capita 

have differed markedly among European countries, 

from zero in Italy and Portugal to more than 

4 percent in the best performers. To a large extent, 

growth differentials reﬂ
 ect convergence. However, 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
xiva number of countries have grown less than their 
potential because of poor macroeconomic policies 

and barriers to growth. Heavily regulated goods 

and labor markets and inadequate institutions 

and macroeconomic policies have kept some 

countries less ﬂ exible, less competitive, and less 
integrated into the global economy than their 

better-performing peers, and this explains much of 

their inferior growth performance. Escaping low-

growth traps is not easy, but the experience of the 

Netherlands and Sweden in the 1980s and 1990s 

demonstrates that it can be done. Reforms should 

be comprehensive, addressing both macroeconomic 

imbalances and structural problems, not only 

because both matter but also because reforms can 

be mutually reinforcing. Implementing reforms 

takes time and the rewards become visible only 

with some delay, but the long-term impact can be 

substantial.The successful integration of emerging Europe 
has led to increasing spillovers between advanced 

and emerging Europe. Emerging Europe is now 

one of the most dynamic markets for advanced 
Europe’s exports; production chains have 
become highly integrated across borders; and 

western European banks have come to dominate 

emerging Europe’s banking systems. The growing 

interaction has beneﬁ ted both regions, but it has 
also meant that shocks in one region increasingly 

affect the other, with spillovers progressively 

traveling both ways. Financial and trade spillovers 

interact, as shocks to ﬁ
 nancial ﬂ
 ows from west 
to east are soon felt in trade ﬂ ows. Spillovers 
may complicate economic policy making, but 

such challenges should not detract from the 

fundamental beneﬁ ts of economic and ﬁ
 nancial 
integration. 
The remainder of this edition of the 
Regional 
Economic Outlook discusses in more detail the outlook and policy priorities for advanced Europe 

in Chapter 1 and for emerging Europe in Chapter 2. 
Growth differentials in Europe are analyzed in 

Chapter 3, and linkages between advanced and 

emerging Europe are discussed in Chapter 4. 
The Appendix lists current IMF arrangements 

with European countries.
11. Advanced  Europe: Reversing the Slide
The euro area crisis has entered into a new stage in the 
context of a marked global slowdown. Tensions have 

moved from the euro area periphery to some core economies, 

prompting new policy interventions, but a deﬁ nite solution 

remains elusive. As a result, conﬁ dence has eroded more 

widely and downside risks have intensiﬁ ed again throughout 

the advanced economies of Europe. Both conventional 

and unconventional policy stances will need to be adapted 

to reﬂ ect the weakening and tense outlook and a durable 

resolution to the euro area’s sovereign debt problems needs to 

be found. Fiscal and monetary policies will have to be as 

supportive as possible within credible medium-term 

frameworks; ﬁ nancial systems need to be strengthened 

further; and a consistent, cohesive, and cooperative approach 

to monetary union needs to be adopted by all euro area 

stakeholders.  
 Divergent Recoveries, but a Synchronized Slowdown?Idiosyncratic vulnerabilities mattered a great deal…In the wake of the global ﬁ
 nancial crisis, advanced 
European economies have recovered at very 

different speeds. Some experienced tepid growth, 

hindered by high private indebtedness (Figure 1.1), 

a burst in asset prices, weak credit owing to banks’ 

funding difﬁ culties and private-sector deleveraging, 
and lost competitiveness. Meanwhile, many 

others—such as Germany and Sweden—free 

from major imbalances, took advantage of their 

strong initial competitiveness positions to ride the 

global recovery wave in 2010, barely affected by 

the turmoil in the euro area periphery (Figure 1.2) 

(Jaumotte and others, forthcoming).
This tiering is now fading. Sweden, Switzerland, 
and many northern euro area countries, powered 

by Germany, continued cruising in the ﬁ
 rst quarter, 
with investment particularly buoyant (Figure 1.3). 

By contrast, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom

2were barely exiting from recession on the back of 
large front-loaded ﬁ
 scal adjustments. The most 
recent indicators, however, point to a general 

convergence toward low growth, as evidenced by the 

acute loss in momentum in the second quarter, even 

after taking into account some exceptional factors 

that dampened growth (Figure 1.4). The deceleration 
of activity at the global level, combined with lagged 
effects of higher commodity prices and the supply 

disruptions that followed the Japanese earthquake, 

have affected mostly those countries that had 

beneﬁ tted so far from the strong global recovery. 
Yet the escalation of the euro area crisis is having a 

more wide-spread effect on domestic demand, as the 

conﬁ dence shock has spread beyond the periphery 
to core countries’ consumers, bankers and investors.
One consequence has been that external imbalanc-
es, especially within the euro area, have declined, al-

though questions remain about the sustainability of 

that trend. Apart from Italy, all euro area countries 

that had a negative external balance exceeding 

2½ percent of GDP in 2010 have seen their 

current-account deﬁ
 cit decline since the crisis; yet, 
with the exception of Spain, this correction has not 

come as a result of particularly buoyant exports, 

but mainly as a result of cyclically weak domes-

tic demand (Figure 1.5). As further elaborated in 

the September 2011 
World  Economic Outlook
 (IMF, 
2011g), the signiﬁ cant efforts currently under way 
to strengthen public ﬁ nances in the peripheral 
countries will also contribute to reducing external 

imbalances, but given the absence of the nominal 

exchange rate tool, the adjustment is likely to be 

protracted.Figure 1.3Selected Advanced European Countries: Real GDP, 2007:Q1–2011:Q2(2008:Q1 = 100) Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook.¹Rest of euro area: excludes Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. 8688909294

both inside and outside the euro area. In the wake 

of the crisis, the general poor state of public

 scal stimulus packages boosted 
public debt by up to 15–20 percentage points of 

GDP in the largest euro area countries and by 

as much as 40 percentage points of GDP in the 

United Kingdom (Figure 1.6). Countries with 
relatively better starting positions pursued ﬁ
 scal 
consolidation strategies spread over several years, 

to minimize the short-term contractionary effect 

on activity. In contrast, countries under severe 

market pressures, including the three program 

countries, but also Spain and more recently Italy, 

had no choice but to front-load their efforts to 

avoid conﬁ

4to the sovereign debt of program countries and 
continuous low proﬁ
 tability—on the back of 
rising non-performing loans in some countries—

call into question their ability to rely on retained 

earnings to build capital buffers in the future. By 

contrast, with core tier 1 ratios above 10 percent, 

major U.K. banks are taking a proactive approach 

in their transition to Basel III rules. Similarly, 

Swedish banks have raised capital to well above 

the minimum regulatory requirements and their 

loan losses in the Baltic countries—their main 

foreign exposure—have fallen.
Regulatory approaches to tackling banking 
sectors that still remain large (Figure 1.10) have 

also differed. Having suffered severely from the 

crisis through ﬁ nancial channels, regulators in the 
United Kingdom, Sweden, and Switzerland have all 

expressed their preference for going further than 

the Basel III minimum requirements to reinforce 

capital as a way to strengthen their banking system 

and reduce associated ﬁ scal risks. Similarly, in 
Ireland, in the context of the adjustment program, 

institutions are unwinding noncore assets while 
nonviable banks are being resolved—ultimately 

leading to a much leaner banking sector. Meanwhile, 

other euro area regulators are pushing to soften 
somewhat the capital quality standards and see no 
need to go beyond Basel III.
appreciation of the Swiss franc, with a dampening 
effect on prices. The European Central Bank 

(ECB) increased its interest rates by 50 basis 

points between April 2011 and July 2011, 

reﬂ ecting rising headline inﬂ
 ation following the 
rally in commodity prices and the prospect of a 

steadily closing output gap (Figure 1.8). By contrast, 

the Bank of England kept the scale of monetary 

stimulus unchanged, on account of the strong 

ﬁ scal consolidation, greater slack in the economy 
(which has kept wage growth subdued) and an 

inﬂ ation overshoot that is largely seen as driven by 
temporary factors, including indirect tax increases.
Uneven approaches to ﬁ nancial system reform
Progress toward putting banks on a sounder 

footing has been uneven. Having been among 

the institutions most heavily reliant on wholesale 

funding before the crisis, euro area banks 

have also been slower than their Anglo-Saxon 

counterparts to reduce this reliance since then 

(Figure 1.9). While substantial efforts were made 

to raise capital ahead of this summer’s stress tests, 

buffers remain thin in a signiﬁ cant number of 
ﬁ nancial institutions. In addition, large exposures

(for instance, in France) and entry barriers in some 
services (for example, in Germany and Italy) are still 
holding growth and employment back, although 
here again countries under adjustment programs are 
starting to address these issues. In addition, uneven 
positions on the structural map are also at the root 
of some of the persistent inﬂ ation differentials 
within the euro area, with detrimental consequences 
for the efﬁ ciency of the common monetary policy 
(Box 1.1).These divergent paths threaten to reverse past successes at cross-border integration, especially 
within the euro area, with banks and policymakers 
alike turning more inward. Capital markets are 
being segmented, with the periphery relying 
on ECB and ofﬁ cial ﬁ
 nancing. Cross-border 
banking mergers and acquisitions within the euro 
area, which were already lackluster, have further 
diminished in the wake of the crisis—although 
preliminary signs suggest a modest revival (Figure 
1.12). And needed progress on euro area crisis 
management and burden sharing arrangement has Insufﬁ cient structural reforms
Countries that suffered the most from the global crisis as the result of past imbalances have also 
been most prone to embark on needed structural 
reforms. As the sharp decline in the nontradable 
sector led to dramatic increases in unemployment 
rates in a number of countries, authorities were 
confronted with long preexisting weaknesses in 
their labor market, which the boom years had 
somehow masked (Figure 1.11). Greece, Portugal, 
and Spain have started overhauling their dismissal 
and employment protection regulations as well as 
their wage bargaining systems to tackle dual labor 
markets and facilitate job reallocation. Meanwhile, 
countries that had done so prior to the crisis, such 
as Germany through the mid-2000 Hartz reforms, 
reaped the beneﬁ ts in the form of fewer job losses 
during the recession, and are already enjoying 
unemployment rates lower than their pre-crisis 
levels. Where recoveries have been stronger, however, there has also been less urgency to tackle 
impediments to growth, despite the risk that 
higher unemployment inherited from the crisis 
could become entrenched. In many countries, Figure 1.10Selected European Countries: Financial Sector Assets Relative to Size of Economy, 2010¹(Percent of GDP)Source: European Central Bank.

6Box 1.1Labor Reforms in the Euro Area: Still Too Little?1Efﬁ cient labor market institutions and policies are key to raise employment growth and reduce inequities. 
Employment rates are higher and unemployment lower in economies with lower labor taxes, moderate 

unemployment beneﬁ
 ts, and collective bargaining systems that are more favorable to employment than wage 
increases (typically full coordination or full decentralization as opposed to intermediate coordination of collective 

bargaining) (Bassanini and Duval, 2006; Annett, 2007). Lower employment protection legislation (EPL) facilitates 

entry into the labor market of groups that tend to be marginalized in dual markets, such as women and youth, 

and reduces the incentives to resort to ﬂ
 exible but precarious temporary contracts (Jaumotte, 2011). It also 
increases labor productivity by fostering reallocation to the most productive sectors. Pension reforms that 

increase the legal retirement age, curb early retirement schemes, and reduce the implicit tax on continued work at 

old-age can boost the employment of older workers.
Adequate institutions are even more essential to the good functioning of the euro area. In the pre-crisis 
period, wage indexation practices, high employment protection and to some extent intermediate structures 

of collective bargaining contributed substantially to large and persistent intra-euro inﬂ
 ation differentials, the 
deterioration in competitiveness and the emergence of imbalances in many peripheral countries (Jaumotte and 

Morsy, forthcoming). Indeed, these institutions give workers more market power to negotiate wage increases to 

compensate for high inﬂ ation and therefore tend to increase inﬂ
 ation persistence.
2 This feature is harmful in 
a monetary union, where the individual real effective exchange rate can be adjusted only through relative price 

changes (Jaumotte and others, forthcoming).
Labor market institutions and policies still have room to improve substantially in advanced Europe, with different 
priorities across countries (Allard and Everaert, 2010). Lower labor utilization in the euro area accounts for a 

GDP per capita differential with the United States of about 15 percentage points.
3 Although this may in part 
reﬂ ect different preferences for labor and leisure, cross-country indicators of labor market institutions point to 
less efﬁ cient set-ups in euro area countries, relative not only to the US but also to the OECD average. The largest 
sources of inefﬁ
 ciencies differ across countries, with a (not fully clear-cut) divide between northern and southern 
euro area countries (see ﬁ gure). In southern euro area countries, the intermediate coordination of collective 
bargaining (Greece, Portugal, and Spain) and high EPL (Greece, Portugal, and Spain before recent reforms) 

constitute the main impediments. But these features are not unique to the southern euro area, as France also has 

an intermediate collective bargaining system and high EPL. In northern euro area countries, labor tax wedges are 

particularly high (France and Germany, but also Greece and Italy) and unemployment beneﬁ
 ts generous (Germany 
and Ireland). Disincentives to labor market participation of older workers are a problem in most countries.
Crisis countries have been under more pressure to reform their labor markets for various reasons. First, with 
the Great Recession and the euro area sovereign debt crisis, their unemployment rates have increased drastically,

2 The relationship with the coordination in bargaining is non-linear, in the sense that both low and high coordination would 
lead to less inﬂ ation persistence than intermediate coordination. In the case of low coordination, workers have little market 
power, whereas in the case of very high coordination, the unions recognize their market power and take into account the 

effect of their wage demands on inﬂ
 ation and unemployment (Calmfors and Drifﬁ
 ll, 1988).

Spain). To a large extent, this reﬂ
 ected the collapse in output and the difﬁ
 culty in reallocating resources from 
non-tradable to tradable sectors. However, wage rigidities resulting from inefﬁ
 cient labor market set-ups and, 
in some cases, the high share of temporary workers, have strongly ampliﬁ
 ed the unemployment increase and 
hindered the needed process of internal devaluation. Second, as mentioned above, the signiﬁ
 cant deterioration 
in competitiveness in the run-up to the crisis also resulted in part from those ﬂ
 awed institutions. Finally, over the 
longer term, they contribute to higher structural unemployment and lower potential growth—all features that 

need to be remedied for these countries to grow out of the crisis. 
Although labor market reforms are thus progressing in countries under market pressure, little is being done in 
countries with stronger recoveries. Some crisis countries are doing so in the context of EU/IMF programs; others, 

such as Spain and to a lesser extent Italy, are doing so independently—in all, reforms seem appropriately targeted, 

although in some cases they should be bolder. Greece and Portugal have begun to reduce 
EPL signiﬁ cantly, 
including by reducing the protection of regular contracts and further steps are in the ofﬁ
 ng; Spain has also made 
some progress in this direction. Greece passed a law to introduce more 
wage ﬂ exibility

8with a similar debate about the pace of adjustment 
in the United Kingdom, and recent rating action on 
Japan and the United States.
The euro area sovereign debt crisis took another 
turn for the worse in the summer of 2011. 

Initially, it was the continued lack of cohesion 

among European policymakers—especially in 

the debate on private sector involvement—which 

unnerved markets. Negative sentiment was further 

exacerbated when growth outturns disappointed, 

triggering a general reassessment of world growth 

expectations. In the euro area, the spiral of credit 

agencies’ downgrades on sovereign ratings carried 

on, reﬂ ecting the general perception that lack 
of action would inevitably lead to a disorderly 

debt default. Contagion engulfed other exposed 
sovereign markets, which until then had been very 
ﬁ rm level to reduce wages below sectoral minimums;
4 Spain facilitated opt-outs from collective agreements and 
more recently adopted legislation to allow ﬁ
 rm-level agreements; in Italy, rules were modiﬁ
 ed to allow greater use 
of ﬁ
 rm-level agreements. Other measures taken to stimulate employment include limiting increases in minimum 
wages (France, Portugal), and introducing special work contracts for youth (with sub-minimum wages and/or 

lower social security contributions). 
Unemployment beneﬁ ts
 will be reformed in Portugal (to reduce overly generous 
beneﬁ ts but increase coverage), and Ireland is reducing the generosity of its unemployment beneﬁ
 ts, especially for 
young unemployed and where activation measures are refused, to generate a labor supply response. Finally, efforts 

at restoring long-term ﬁ
 scal sustainability through 
pension reforms
 will have a positive impact on labor utilization, 
by increasing old-age workers’ participation. France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain have reformed their pension 

systems.
The relatively good unemployment performance of countries with stronger recoveries should not lead to a let-up 
in their reform momentum. Unemployment rates have performed much better during the crisis in these countries, 

and in some cases they are already below pre-crisis levels (for example, Germany). Although this performance 

could be interpreted as a beneﬁ
 t from earlier labor market reforms (for instance, the Hartz reforms in 
Germany in the mid-2000s), labor market set-ups remain relatively inefﬁ
 cient in these countries by international 
comparisons. Given the large potential beneﬁ
 ts for employment and living standards, there can thus be no let up 
in the reform momentum of these countries. In Germany, the tax wedge should be reduced in a manner targeted 

at groups that are at the margin of the labor market and whose labor participation is more sensitive to taxes 

(married women, elderly workers, and low-income workers). This would help increase labor force participation 

and offset population aging, while reducing further the unemployment rate. Unemployment beneﬁ
 ts could also 
be revisited to increase work-incentives. In France, the priority is to tackle the dualism of the labor market, easing 

further the hiring and ﬁ
 ring process, while improving prospects for ﬁ
 nding jobs through a strengthening of the 
activation policies and job placement agencies. It is also necessary to address the high unemployment rate of low-

skilled and young workers, including by letting the minimum wage fall further relative to the median wage, and to 

continue improving work-incentives for seniors.

 rms have resorted to individual and part-time and irregular contracts instead.
been protracted—on the back of strong domestic opposition in some countries.New Headwinds from an Escalating Euro Area Sovereign CrisisNo reprieve from ﬁ nancial markets
Repeated bouts of storms in euro area sovereign 
debt markets since May 2010 have formed a rip 

current of doubt about debt sustainability. These 

doubts are fed by concerns that excessive demand 

compression in program countries will undermine 

their adjustment efforts and that high debt coun-

tries face poor long-term growth prospects. These 

concerns have also surfaced outside the euro area, 
Box 1.1 (concluded)1. ADVANCED EUROPE: REVERSING THE SLIDE9stock markets plummeting in August. The debate 
about side deals on collateral for lending to Greece 

by some euro area countries did not help. Some 

sense of order was restored after the ECB stepped 

up its Securities Market Program (SMP), purchasing 

signiﬁ cant amounts of sovereign bonds, including 
of Italy and Spain. From €74 billion in early August, 

the stock of accumulated securities under the SMP 

stood at €143 billion a month later. Markets also 

began to differentiate more between the three 

program countries, with conditions in the market 

for Irish sovereign bonds improving the most. To 

stem renewed tensions in ﬁ
 nancial markets, the ECB 
extended its reﬁ nancing operations as ﬁ
 xed-rate 
tender procedures with full allotment until the end 

of the year, and in August re-introduced a six-month 

operation. Still, markets have generally remained on 

tenterhooks (Figure 1.13).Moderating growth ahead…In this context, any baseline scenario is subject to 

considerable uncertainty. What is clear is that growth 

momentum will be tempered by a combination 

of factors, ranging from a less supportive global 

environment—especially in the United States, where 

a weak recovery is now foreseen—to heightened 
liquid (such as Belgium, Italy, and Spain), also 
affecting stock valuations and interbank markets.
As a response, European leaders took important 
steps to strengthen their crisis management 

framework at their July summit. In particular, to 

stem contagion, they agreed to make the European 

Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) more ﬂ
 exible, 
by allowing precautionary credit lines, funding 

to strengthen banks’ capital buffers even in non-

program countries, and secondary market bond 

purchases. In addition, the terms of EFSF support 

were softened, by lengthening loan maturities and 

lowering lending rates (close to funding rates) 

to support debt sustainability. European leaders 

also agreed to design and support a new program 

for Greece, involving voluntary private sector 

involvement. In that context, the EFSF will provide 

credit enhancement to underpin the quality of 

collateral if and when credit agencies downgrade 

Greek sovereign bonds to selected default status, to 

allow continued access to ECB liquidity, lifting a key 

hurdle to the debt restructuring operation. 
While markets took reassurance in the renewed 
commitment to secure debt sustainability in the 

program countries, they remained concerned that 

some countries might eventually have to follow 

through with sovereign debt restructuring. After 

a short lull, market tensions ﬂ
 ared up again, with 
sovereign spreads back to their record highs and

surrounding banks will constitute additional drags 

on already soft activity. Meanwhile, weaker global 

growth momentum will weigh on northern euro 

area countries, slowing the closing of their output 

gaps and the improvement in their labor markets. 

Solid corporate proﬁ
 tability will not be much of 
a mitigating factor as long as conﬁ
 dence remains 
depressed. Germany, for instance, will see its 

growth pace halved from 2.7 percent in 2011 to 

1.3 percent in 2012.A similar pattern will be at play outside the euro 
area. Sweden will continue to beneﬁ
 t from robust 
domestic demand, supported by low unemployment 
global risk aversion, and ﬁ
 scal consolidation (Table 1 
in the Introduction and Overview). The escalation 

of the ﬁ
 nancial turmoil in the euro area will also 
continue to take its toll on conﬁ
 dence (Figure 1.14).
Within the euro area, real GDP growth is therefore 
projected to slow from 1.6 percent in 2011 to 
1.1 percent in 2012. Countries under market 
pressure will continue to suffer from deeper ﬁ
 scal 
austerity measures, sharper private-sector balance

unemployment—with Portugal and Greece 

expected to remain in recession until mid-2012 
and early 2013, respectively. In Italy and Spain,

1. ADVANCED EUROPE: REVERSING THE SLIDE11permanent for many euro area countries, unless 
the institutional setup of the monetary union 

is modiﬁ ed. Reversing the strong movement of 
interest rate convergence that occurred at the 

creation of the euro, markets now no longer 

consider sovereign debt as a risk-free asset. The 

blow-out in spreads has taken place since mid-

2009—ﬁ rst touching Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, 
then Cyprus, and most recently Italy, Spain, and, 

to a lesser extent, Belgium. An analysis of the 

fundamentals driving these spreads suggests that 

higher yield differentials than over the last decade 

are here to stay in the countries currently under 

severe market pressure (Figure 1.15). And they 

might still increase from their current level in other 

countries with less severe but still substantial ﬁ
 scal 
vulnerabilities. As this reassessment proceeds, 

higher spreads will also be passed on to corporate 

funding, with detrimental consequences for 
credit, investment, and conﬁ
 dence in the affected 
countries (Harjes, 2011).
…contingent on no further escalationGiven persistent tensions on euro area sovereign 

markets and global weaknesses, downside risks 

remain particularly acute. Any disappointment 

regarding the implementation of mitigating 

measures either in one of the program countries or 

at the euro area level could amplify the shockwaves 

witnessed during the summer throughout the euro 
area with adverse repercussions regionally and 

globally. Funding could dry up, jeopardizing the 

functioning of the ﬁ
 nancial system, at a time when 
banks and sovereigns are facing major rollover 

requirements. Moreover, despite some reduction 

since the onset of the crisis, cross-country ﬁ
 nancial 
exposures remain substantial (Figure 1.16). 
Compounding the intra-euro area stresses, a further 

setback in global growth would generate negative 

spillovers.
Policies to Stop the SlideWith growth momentum waning and ﬁ
 nancial 
tensions rising, policy adjustments are called for. 
and buoyant asset markets. Yet, its growth is expected 
to moderate slightly from 4.4 percent in 2011 to 

3.8 percent in 2012, as balance sheets and ﬁ scal 
retrenchment in advanced countries dent demand 

for Swedish consumer durables and capital goods. 

Similarly, with little slack left, the Swiss economy will 

decelerate from 2.1 percent growth in 2011 to 

1.4 percent in 2012, as renewed currency appreciation 

and a weaker external environment will challenge export 

resilience. By contrast, with serious headwinds on the 

domestic front from depressed real disposable income, 

negative wealth effects, and ﬁ
 scal consolidation, 
growth in the United Kingdom will remain sluggish in 

2011 at 1.1 percent, before rebalancing to 1.6 percent 

as past depreciation of the pound starts translating 

into stronger net export growth.
Over the medium term, growth prospects are likely 
to remain subdued. As is well documented, this is 

typical following severe ﬁ
 nancial crises, and likely 
even more so in the current context where much 

of the world has been affected and rebalancing 

is proceeding only gingerly. For the euro area, 

one additional hurdle is that the widening of 

interest rates on sovereign bonds is likely to be

12Adjusting the policy-mixWhile the deteriorated state of public ﬁ
 nances—
and renewed market concerns over sovereign debt—
leave no option but to strengthen ﬁ scal positions, 
the slowdown in growth is calling for caution. 

From a long-term perspective, and unlike in some 

other advanced economies, ﬁ
 scal consolidation is 
proceeding appropriately in Europe and should 
broadly continue as planned (Table 1.1 and 
Figure 1.17). The effort should remain broad-based, 

as contingent ﬁ
 scal liabilities related to aging loom 
large everywhere. Where pressures are most severe, 

the consolidation should continue to be front-

loaded. Italy’s decision to bring forward some of 

the ﬁ scal consolidation measures initially planned 
for 2013–14 and the additional measures taken by 

France and Spain should help relieve some of the 

recent pressure on sovereign bonds. While ﬁ
 scal 
consolidation will undeniably have a negative impact 

on activity in the short term, the alternative scenario 

of intensifying market pressures is hardly an option.
Nonetheless, a narrow focus on nominal targets 
is unwarranted. In many countries, medium-

term ﬁ
 scal consolidation plans are credible or 
Fiscal consolidation remains necessary, but the 
pursuit of nominal deﬁ
 cit targets should not 
come at the expense of risking a widespread 

contraction in economic activity. Countries that 

have credible medium-term adjustment plans 

or front-loaded consolidation efforts should 

consider allowing automatic stabilizers to work 

fully. And countries that have access to funding 

at historically low yields should consider delaying 

some of their ﬁ
 scal consolidation if downside 
risks to growth materialize. The withdrawal of 

monetary support or the monetary tightening 

in the cyclically more advanced economies will 

need to be paused or even reversed in cases 

where downside risks to inﬂ
 ation and growth 
persist. Finding a durable solution to the euro 

area sovereign crisis has become more than 

overdue, while much work remains to be done 

on the structural front—to strengthen ﬁ
 nancial 
systems and support growth. The former will 

require some difﬁ cult decisions to improve crisis 
management and a demonstration of 

unity behind the project of economic and 

monetary union (EMU) that will convince 

markets.

14and hence inﬂ ation prospects, should dominate 
monetary policy decisions, and pockets of excessive 

risk taking that might arise with policy rates kept 

very low for a long time should be addressed 

through macro-prudential or ﬁ
 scal measures. 
Countries that have fully regained  pre-crisis 

output levels or are already operating above potential 

(such as Israel, Norway, and Sweden) are in a slightly 

more comfortable position, but they may still need 

to consider a pause in their tightening cycles.
Further breakthroughs in crisis management still neededCrisis management in the euro area needs to go 
beyond its current approach to ensure success. 

Repeatedly, ﬁ
 nancial markets have signaled pressure 
points, the ECB has correctly stepped in to prevent 

ﬁ nancial instability, and policymakers have stated 
their commitment to do whatever it takes to preserve 

euro area stability. Measures actually adopted 

have been steps in the right direction, but political 

constraints have led to an incremental approach that 

subsequently proved to remain behind the curve. 

Implementation of the July 2011 summit measures 

is proving to be protracted, with parliamentary 

approval stretching into the autumn, and negotiations 

on collateral for ﬁ nancial assistance to Greece have 
weakened the earlier display of unity. 
Euro area leaders need to spell out and recommit to a common vision of how the euro area is expected 

to function in the future. This is essential to anchor 

market expectations and dispel the prevailing 

uncertainty. Overall, a deﬁ
 nite strengthening of 
ﬁ scal and economic governance of the monetary 
union is needed. While strengthening national 

budgetary rules, countries will need to cede some 

control over their ﬁ
 scal position to a central euro 
area body. Increased ex-ante ﬁ
 scal risk sharing, 
through a euro area bond or revenue sharing, is 

likely to be necessary together with a common 

approach and backstop to the ﬁ
 nancial system of 
the euro area. Policies that remain national will need 

to be subject to stronger discipline.
In terms of current crisis management, stronger 
support to countries seeking to overcome debt 
have been front-loaded, providing room to allow 
automatic stabilizers to work fully to deal with 

growth surprises. Furthermore, if activity were to 

undershoot current expectations and risk a period 

of stagnation or contraction, countries that face 

historically low yields (for example, Germany and 

the United Kingdom) should also consider delaying 

some of their planned consolidation. 
Pursuing the withdrawal of monetary stimulus needs 
to be reconsidered. While this approach would still 

be appropriate where output gaps are in the process 

of closing, the revised outlook sees much lower 

inﬂ ationary pressures with, in some cases, growth 
falling below potential rates. In the euro area, the 

recent ﬁ nancial turmoil and downgraded outlook 
point in this direction, calling on the ECB to 

maintain a very a
ccommodative stance. In addition, 
it should lower its policy rate if downside risks to 

growth and inﬂ
 ation persist. Similarly, in the United 
Kingdom, where the recovery is tepid, and ﬁ
 scal 
tightening stronger, the accommodative stance will 

need to be maintained for some time, and the Bank 

of England should further loosen its monetary 

stance if the recent weakening of the growth and 

inﬂ ation outlook continues. The risk to growth,

many banks, Europe’s ﬁ
 nancial sector needs to be 
restored to health. The July 2011 stress tests coordinated by the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) and their 

follow-up are unlikely to achieve this outcome. On 

the positive side, bank equity issuance was stepped 

up in the run-up to the tests, which were conducted 

more rigorously than in the previous year, and 

led to a welcome improvement in transparency. 

However, the test scenarios for ﬁ
 nancial shocks, 
especially on the sovereign front, were mild 

compared to the most recent market developments. 

The banks that failed or barely passed the stress 

tests now have until mid-October 2011 to submit 

remedial action plans, but not all weak banks were 

identiﬁ ed by the tests, in part because the EBA 
sample was limited. They will continue to cast a 

shadow over the entire banking system, until more 

comprehensive actions toward restructuring and 

front-loaded strengthening of banks’ capital buffers 

are undertaken. 
Ideally, capital should be raised through private, 
preferably cross-border, solutions (IMF, 2011b). 

In some countries, national authorities are already 

doing so, for example, by fostering injection of 

private capital into banks (as in the recent initial 

public offerings [IPOs] conducted by some 

Spanish saving banks) or cross-border investment 

(as recently in Ireland, where private equity 

participation included non-resident investors taking 

a minority stake). Absent this, supervisors will 

either have to make the case for injecting public 

funds into weak banks—which will be difﬁ
 cult 
in an environment of ﬁ
 scal consolidation—or 
close them down. Where public resources are not 

available, EFSF resources should be tapped to 

strengthen viable banks’ capital buffers, addressing 

in that manner both bank weaknesses and related 

tensions on national sovereigns.
Meanwhile, extraordinary liquidity provision measures 
should stay in place in the euro area until ﬁ
 nancial 
market tension abates. They have helped and continue 

to support bank proﬁ
 tability during times of acute 
market stresses (Box 1.2). Reﬁ
 nancing at a ﬁ
 xed rate 
with full allotment, now in place until at least January 
sustainability problems may well be crucial. 
Alternatively, a signiﬁ
 cant increase in crisis 
management resources, with a full range of 

intervention tools, including guarantees and the 

possibility to backstop the ﬁ
 nancial system directly, 
would send a signal of renewed commitment. Of 

course, none of these tools can absolve countries 

from taking the necessary adjustment measures 

to regain competitiveness and secure ﬁ
 scal 
sustainability. Hence, increased support will need to 

be accompanied with strong conditionality.
While these changes are being put in place, a 
number of actions to deal with the crisis should be 

undertaken urgently. Implementation of the July 

21 summit decisions should be accelerated. Now 

that the legislative package of governance reforms 

at the EU level is proceeding, the focus should 

switch to ensuring that the strengthened Stability 

and Growth Pact (SGP) and the newly introduced 

Excessive Imbalance Procedure effectively support 

a more integrated economic and monetary union. 

Strengthening the banking system remains essential, 
and full use should be made of the expanded 

mandate of the EFSF to assist countries in doing 

so. Equally important to maintain orderly sovereign 

debt markets is a continued involvement of the ECB 

via its SMP. An explicit commitment to do so for 

as long as necessary, within a strong conditionality 

framework and backed by a restatement from euro 

area member states of their readiness to indemnify the 

ECB for any incurred losses would be very helpful. 

Strengthening of ﬁ
 scal institutions is essential. 
Put the ﬁ nancial sector 
on a sounder footingIn the meantime, uncertainties prevailing 
over bank balance sheets, the high degree of 

interconnectedness across the EU, and the lack 

of effective resolution frameworks for large and 

cross-border banks all continue to rattle investors. 

Yet, deleveraging achieved by shrinking assets risks 

undermining the recovery in continental Europe, 

where bank-based ﬁ nancing still dominates.

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
16Box 1.2Monetary Policy and Bank Performance in Advanced EuropeThe global ﬁ
 nancial crisis caused a deep recession 
in advanced Europe and led to elevated levels of 

systemic risk. GDP growth in advanced Europe 

(deﬁ ned in this box as the euro area, United 
Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland) fell between 

4.5 and 10 percent on a quarterly basis in late 

2008–early 2009. Since then, the economic recovery 

has proceeded, although cautiously and unevenly. 

Bank systemic risk remained elevated in the aftermath 

of the Lehman crisis and has risen again—notably 

in the euro area—since late 2009, after revelations 

of the actual size of Greece’s ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cit (see ﬁ
 rst 
ﬁ gure). More recently, tensions ﬂ
 ared up again in 
euro area ﬁ nancial markets, as the sovereign crisis 
spread to markets that so far have remained fairly 

liquid, leading to new highs in bank systemic risk.After some accommodation at the time of the global 
ﬁ nancial crisis, ﬁ
 scal and monetary support was being 
gradually withdrawn, until new tensions erupted in 

the summer of 2011. 
• Fiscal policy was loosened substantially in 2008 
and 2009 to support activity during the global 

recession, and in some cases, to recapitalize banks, 

guarantee bank debt, and purchase or guarantee 

bank assets; ﬁ scal support is now being withdrawn 
everywhere—and in some cases in a more front-loaded way, in response to market pressures.
• Monetary policy has been supportive through conventional measures, with central banks lowering interest rates 
to very low levels between mid-2008 and early 2009. In some countries, they remain at this lower bound, while 

in others—including the euro area—they have since been raised (see left panel, second ﬁ
 gure). Nevertheless, 
the general stance remains fairly accommodative.
• Unconventional monetary policy measures were also implemented, in the form of interventions in securities 
markets and increased reliance by banks on central bank funding. They led to a rapid expansion of central 

banks’ balance sheets and helped banks in need of liquidity (see right panel, second ﬁ
 gure). Over the past year, 
these unconventional measures were scaled back gradually as the situation in the interbank market improved. 

In the summer of 2011, however, tensions re-emerged in European banking markets and some unconventional 

policies have been reactivated: the ECB relaunched a 6-month reﬁ
 nancing operation in August and its sovereign 
bond purchase program was resumed.
IMF staff analysis shows that monetary policy has been supportive in restoring bank proﬁ
 tability. The effects of 
monetary policy measures on bank proﬁ
 tability are inferred from quarterly and semi-annual panel regressions 
with proxies for conventional and unconventional policy measures as explanatory variables, separately for banks 

in the euro area, Sweden and United Kingdom, to account for differences in monetary regimes and policies across

1 These monetary policy measures are interacted with bank-speciﬁ
 c variables that reﬂ
 ect key weaknesses, 
such as low capital buffers, low liquidity, and high reliance on wholesale or high loan-deposit ratios. The estimates 

show that the differences across banks are particularly important, as weak banks—those with low capital and low 

liquidity—have beneﬁ
 tted more from lower policy interest rates.
The results also suggest that withdrawal of unconventional measures should happen only gradually, once 
tensions abate and frictions on monetary policy transmission channels recede; proﬁ
 tability would then be on 
safer ground. Bank proﬁ
 tability suffered particularly 
strongly during periods of increased systemic risk, 

as the result of malfunctioning markets, which 

necessitated unconventional policy measures. This 

is reﬂ ected in the panel regressions, which show 
a signiﬁ cant impact of unconventional policies 
(both individually and through interaction with 

indicators of bank strength) on proﬁ
 tability, while 
also controlling for bank systemic risk through bank 
systemic risk indicators.
In addition, the withdrawal of monetary policy 
measures should be embedded in a comprehensive 

approach to tackle the crisis. Based on the results of 

the panel regression, a scenario where policy rates are 

raised and central banks’ balance sheets reduced is used 

to illustrate the effect of monetary policy measures on 

bank proﬁ tability. Altogether, the results indicate that a 
comprehensive approach to solve the crisis, including 

recapitalization, is needed for (weak) banks, as is

Moreover, sufﬁ

 exibility should be allowed for 
macro-prudential measures to address country-speciﬁ
 c 
risks, governed by a common macro-prudential policy 

toolkit, to be developed under the leadership of the 

ESRB (Box 1.3).
Finally, a uniﬁ
 ed European ﬁ
 nancial architecture 
will not be complete without a common resolution 
and stability framework, especially for the euro area. 

To end the intertwining of sovereign and banks’ 

balance sheets once and for all requires setting up 
mechanisms for rapidly ﬁ
 nancing resolution efforts, 
especially for banks operating cross-border or with 
cross-border implications. The new mandate of the 

EFSF, which allows funds to be used to strengthen 

banks’ capital buffers, is a step in that direction, 

but a bolder long-term vision is needed. Ultimately, 

a European Resolution Authority, backed by 

common deposit guarantee and resolution funds, 

would provide a permanent instrument to do so, 

while also improving ex-post burden sharing and 

providing an EU-centered backstop.
Growing out of the crisisSustainable growth will remain the best ingredient 

for securing long-lasting ﬁ scal and political 
stability and safeguarding Europe’s cohesion. 
2012, continues to be critical for banks with limited 
access to wholesale or interbank funding. Moreover, 

the ECB might need to reinstate some of its 

longer-term liquidity provision operations—as it 

did in August—if stresses on interbank markets 

intensify further. Yet, these unconventional support 

measures should not be a substitute for tackling the 

underlying problems in the ﬁ nancial sector.
Strengthening the ﬁ nancial sector will also entail a 
larger role for EU-wide regulatory and supervisory 

institutions. The European Systemic Risk Board 

(ESRB) and the European Supervisory Authorities 

(ESAs) started operating at the beginning of 2011, but 

their credibility still needs to be established. Some gaps 

in the framework will need to be ﬁ
 lled, in particular in 
formalizing the collaboration among EU institutions 

and the relationship between these new institutions 

and national authorities. For example, the EBA should 

rapidly rise to its role as the guardian of high standards 

of supervision for banks operating across euro area 

and EU borders. Beyond, moving decisively in the 

direction of a uniﬁ
 ed European ﬁ
 nancial market will 
require adopting a single rulebook common to all EU 

banks, in the spirit of the Single Market, as currently 

envisaged. Harmonized standards set at the EU level 

under the CRD4 directive will be important, but 

the current Commission proposal should be further 

strengthened by focusing on capital of the highest 

standards and setting capital requirements that exceed 
incorporated in current EU/IMF programs. Weak(er) banks should also raise capital in preparation for the withdrawal 
of standard measures. More speciﬁ
 cally: 
• Conventional policies. When rates are raised by 50 basis points, weaker banks (with low TCE ratio) would suffer, 
while others would be affected less (see third ﬁ
 gure). In the euro area, banks in program countries would see 
their ROA improve but would remain loss-making, whereas the effect on banks in other euro area countries 

would be minor. These outcomes reﬂ
 ect differences across banks as regards their balance sheet structure, with 
weaker banks having more short-term liabilities subject to sharper repricing as interest rates change.
• Unconventional policies. High systemic risk has usually coincided with the need for reinforced unconventional 
policies. This also explains the result that the improvement in banks’ performance would coincide with central 

banks’ decision to gradually reduce the size of their balance sheets to pre-crisis levels. As systemic risk recedes 

and the economic outlook improves, a withdrawal of unconventional measures would see banks capable of 

raising their proﬁ tability, as this would allow for a steepening of the yield curve and an improvement of banks’ 
(net) interest margin. Box 1.2 (concluded)1. ADVANCED EUROPE: REVERSING THE SLIDE19Box 1.3 Macro-prudential Reforms in the EU: Objectives and ProgressThe new institutions underpinning the EU ﬁ
 nancial sector architecture are now in place, but their credibility and 
effectiveness remains to be established. Since January 1, 2011, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), in 

charge of macro-prudential oversight at the EU level, and the new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)—

endowed with enhanced supervisory and regulatory powers—have become operational and are expected to 

become the core of an integrated European ﬁ
 nancial stability framework. On the macro-prudential front, this 
framework will require appropriate collaboration among EU institutions to be effective, including sharing of 

information and adequate access to data. In addition, a set of macro-prudential instruments common to all EU 

Member States will have to be designed. Because of the deep interconnection of EU ﬁ
 nancial systems and the 
scope for externalities, the ESRB will have to play a forceful role in developing and establishing this EU macro-

prudential policy toolkit, in collaboration with other EU institutions and national authorities. It should also 

coordinate national policies and ensure reciprocity to minimize regulatory arbitrage.
To be effective, the EU macro-prudential framework also requires adequate national macro-prudential 
frameworks.
1 Identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks will require a “bottom-up” element (information and analysis 
coming from the national level) to complete the analysis and decision-making of the ESRB. The national 

dimension will be essential to implement on the ground the ESRB “top-down” recommendations too. Because 

the ESRB’s risk warnings and recommendations are not binding on EU Member States, it is essential that 

strong macro-prudential mandates—including an EU dimension—and powers are established at the national 

level to overcome likely biases for inaction from policy makers. But to ensure a timely follow-up on ESRB 

recommendations, it is likewise essential that an 
adequate and common macro-prudential toolkit be established at 
the national level. Since the ESRB has no binding power, the EU Commission is the only institution that can 

set mandatory standards for macro-prudential frameworks that are common to all EU countries.
Institutional arrangements for macro-prudential oversight are indeed being strengthened at national levels. 

• The United Kingdom, as part of the major overhaul of its ﬁ
 nancial regulatory structure, is taking the lead in 
establishing a strong macro-prudential framework. A Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in charge of macro-

prudential oversight of the United Kingdom’s ﬁ
 nancial system is being established within the Bank of England, 
alongside the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
2 In particular, the FPC will be given power over speciﬁ
 c 
macro-prudential instruments by Parliament and will have the power to require regulatory agencies to take 

speciﬁ c policy actions in response to growing systemic risks. 
• France established in 2010 a Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk Council (FRSRC),
3 headed by the Finance 
Minister, to coordinate macro-prudential analysis by the Banque de France and the regulatory agencies, and 

advise policy-makers on how to prevent and manage systemic risk in the ﬁ
 nancial sector, taking into account 
ESRB risk warnings and recommendations.
• In several other countries, macro-prudential oversight (with varying mandates and powers) has been given to 
the central bank (Hungary and Ireland), or such a move is being considered (Belgium, Germany, and the 

Netherlands).

2 An interim FPC has been established, and met in June 2011. It foreshadows the role of the future statutory FPC and is

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
20• Finally, ﬁ
 nancial stability councils tasked with the monitoring and coordination of work on ﬁ
 nancial stability are 
in place in a number of countries (for example, Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain), with an 

explicit macro-prudential mandate in some cases (Greece).
Many EU countries, notably the “New EU Member States,” have already relied upon macro-prudential policies 
to stem house price appreciation or to limit capital inﬂ ows. Even before the ﬁ
 nancial crisis, macro-prudential 
policies had been applied in New EU Member States to try and contain credit booms, mostly fueled by capital 

inﬂ ows, with ambiguous results. Measures taken by authorities included enhanced reserve requirements (often 
differentiated by currency or origin of funds), marginal reserve requirements in excess of an allowed ceiling, 

higher capital requirements or capital conservation measures, tighter asset classiﬁ
 cation and provisioning, or 
limits on loan-to-value-ratios (LTVs) or debt-to-income ratios.
4 More recently, advanced EU countries have 
introduced measures aimed at containing house price appreciation. In 2007, Italy introduced constraints on 
LTVs to discourage mortgages with less than 20 percent down-payments. In October 2010, Sweden imposed an 

85 percent limit on LTVs. In Spain, the decade-old dynamic provisioning was complemented in 2008 by more 

stringent treatment for commercial and residential real estate exposures.
However, key elements of an effective EU macro-prudential framework are often still missing. While macro-
prudential instruments remain to be established in most EU countries, national agencies or committees often 

lack the legal power to use, direct to use, or calibrate regulatory tools for macro-prudential purposes. This might 

be particularly costly when swift and timely response to systemic risks is crucial. In several countries, such as 

Romania and Sweden, the regulatory agency has strong independent powers to modify ﬁ
 nancial regulations. But 
the rule-making power of the regulatory agency is generally constrained and often requires consultation with 

and approval of the Treasury (as in Finland, France, Germany, and the Netherlands), or in some cases even a 

parliamentary act.
In that context, a proposal for a macro-prudential toolkit common to all EU countries is being developed 
under the aegis of the ESRB. The Instrument Working Group of the ESRB is developing key principles that 

will provide a framework for an EU macro-prudential toolkit. The aim is to address two broad risk dimensions 

highlighted in international forums: a cyclical dimension associated with credit booms and asset markets, and 

a time dimension resulting from common exposures and interconnectedness. The ESRB and EU Member 

States are also of the view that the approach should link instruments to intermediate targets and objectives, but 

underlying causes of ﬁ
 nancial instability should be carefully analyzed. Although this approach is appropriate, a 
common, carefully selected toolkit should not be too restrictive to ensure that proper tools are in place to address 

future country-speciﬁ
 c or sub-regional systemic risks. 
As part of the broader implementation of the Basel III standards, the EU Commission is proposing steps to 
harmonize and coordinate EU macro-prudential policies, but the proposal lacks some ﬂ
 exibility at the national 
level. The draft Capital Requirement Directive IV (CRD4) released in July 2011 to design the roadmap toward 

Basel III implementation in the EU proposes to grant power to the Commission to tighten capital requirements 

temporarily across all EU institutions for speciﬁ c activities or exposures, under a speciﬁ
 c urgency procedure 
triggered by macro-prudential developments. The draft CRD4 provides some ﬂ
 exibility at the national level 
for macro-prudential purposes by allowing national authorities to set the countercyclical capital buffer (agreed 

upon in Basel III) under the guidance and monitoring of the ESRB, and by allowing higher capital requirements 

and limits on LTV ratios for loans secured by real estate. To prevent regulatory arbitrage, measures
 taken by 
national authorities would appropriately apply to all European institutions doing business in or exposed to the 
4 May 2010 Regional Economic Outlook: Europe—Fostering Sustainability
; and “Macro-prudential Policy: What Instruments and How 
to Use Them? Lessons from Country Experiences” (MCM Board Paper).
Box 1.3 (continued)1. ADVANCED EUROPE: REVERSING THE SLIDE21country considered.
5 While these steps go in the right direction, more ﬂ
 exibility will be needed to allow national 
authorities to introduce macro-prudential tools within the common framework, including adjusting capital and 

liquidity requirements, or varying risk weights to address emerging systemic risks.
5 An exception is made for the countercyclical capital buffer for which reciprocity will be mandated only up to 2.5 percent of 
risk weighted assets, as in the Basel III agreement.
VAT—and smooth the required decline in labor 
costs where downward rigidity to wages exists.
With ﬁ scal consolidation ahead, an additional 
concern is that public investment in research, 

education, and infrastructures will be curtailed, 

harming future growth performance. This should be 

avoided through appropriate prioritization of 

spending. Unleashing EU structural funds for the 

crisis-affected countries could also help to some 

extent (Marzinotto, 2011). The recent proposal 

by the European Commission to reduce national 

co-payments for some of the EU funds directed to 

program countries goes in that direction, although 

care should be taken that such funds are properly 

channeled to growth-enhancing sectors, in particular 

the tradable sectors, and that bottlenecks are tackled 

in those countries that have experienced low 

absorption in the past (Allard and others, 2008).
As further elaborated in Chapter 3, the reform 
agenda spans a wide range of sectors; if 

implemented thoroughly, it stands ready to 

unleash Europe’s growth potential, in particular 

its chronically underutilized labor force. 

Reforms should focus on deepening ﬁ
 nancial 
integration—as explained above—and reducing 

public ownership and involvement in the 

banking sector, lowering remaining barriers to 

competition in network industries, retail trade and 

regulated professions—as foreshadowed in the 

Services Directives—and addressing labor market 

segmentation, informal economy and inadequate 

wage ﬂ
 exibility. In program countries suffering 
from competitiveness problems, in particular 

Portugal, a ﬁ
 scally neutral shift in taxes from labor 
to consumption (e.g., value added tax—VAT) 

is being considered to rebalance the economy 

in favor of exports—which are not subject to

to Prevent Financial Turmoil
Emerging Europe’s recovery from the deep crisis of 2008/09 
continued in the ﬁ rst half of 2011, and growth also picked 

up in the Baltic countries and Southeastern Europe—the 

regions most affected by the crisis. But the region is now 

caught in the downward trend of advanced countries, and 

the euro area turbulence creates signiﬁ cant risks. Growth 

is likely to remain stronger than in advanced Europe, but 

policymakers will need to make headway with addressing 

the legacies of the 2008/09 crisis, which include large ﬁ scal 

deﬁ cits and high nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios.
Developments in the First Half of 2011The recovery in emerging Europe strengthened 
further in late 2010 and early 2011. Year-over-year 

growth reached 5.4 percent in the ﬁ
 rst quarter of 
2011—the highest growth rate since the 2008/09 
crisis. The high regional growth rate was in part 

driven by double-digit growth in Turkey, but other 

countries saw strong expansions as well (Figure 2.1). 

Particularly encouraging was the recovery in countries 

that had been most affected by the crisis. Romania 

saw positive year-over-year growth for the ﬁ
 rst time 
since end-2008, while growth in the Baltic countries 

came to almost 6 percent. The only country where 

year-over-year growth remained negative was Croatia.
The recovery also broadened in terms of demand 
components, with domestic demand playing an 

increasingly important role. Domestic demand 

grew by 16 percent year over year in Turkey, 

reﬂ ecting a credit boom fueled by capital inﬂ
 ows. 
Domestic demand also remained strong in Russia 

and Ukraine, buoyed by favorable prices for their 

energy and metals exports, respectively, and in 

Poland (Figure 2.2). It recovered strongly in the 

Baltic countries, even in the absence of a recovery 

in credit, and remained weak only in Southeastern 
Europe (Figure 2.3). Signiﬁ cant differences 
remained in cyclical positions, and while in some 

countries output is now at or above potential, 

many other countries still have large output gaps. 

The output gap has closed in Poland, the only 

EU country that managed to avoid a recession in 

2008–09, and turned positive in Turkey, 

where signiﬁ cant demand pressures have led to a 
sharp widening of the current account deﬁ
 cit. 
Excess demand came to a head in Belarus

negative in many other countries, including the 

Baltic countries, which had suffered very deep

recovery is less advanced. Most countries have not 

yet reached their precrisis output levels and growth 
rates often remain lower than those prior to 2008,

in some Middle Eastern oil-producing countries, 

further driving up oil prices; and the euro area ran 

into major ﬁ nancial turbulence.
By mid-2011, clear signs of a slowdown had 
surfaced. The ﬁ
 nancial turmoil intensiﬁ
 ed in July 
and August, when the euro area crisis started to 

affect spreads in Spain and Italy, and Standard 

& Poor’s stripped the United States of its AAA 

sovereign credit rating. The turmoil was stirred 

further by concern over new GDP growth 

ﬁ gures, which showed that the U.S. economy had 
been much weaker in the ﬁ
 rst half of 2011 than 
previously recognized.High frequency indicators for emerging Europe 
started to reﬂ
 ect the worsening external environment 
by mid-2011. In August, the manufacturing 

Purchasing Managers Index for Russia and Turkey 

was in contractionary territory and declined in 

Hungary and Poland. Industrial production growth 

also weakened in a number of countries, including 

Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania (Figure 2.6), 
strong domestic demand added to inﬂ ationary 
pressures in Russia and Ukraine.

26in the ﬁ rst quarter to 3.4 percent in the second 
quarter in the countries for which data have been 

released.Outlook for the Remainder of 2011 and 2012Emerging Europe’s outlook is for a slowdown 
of growth with heightened downside risks. 

Developments through mid-2011 attest to a 

lack of vigor in the global economic recovery 

and continued fragilities of real developments 

to ﬁ nancial market turmoil. On a positive note, 
though, adverse effects from some of the shocks 

that held back growth in many advanced countries 

in the second quarter of 2011 should gradually ease 

(IMF, 2011i). Global manufacturing should rebound 

as the disruptions to the supply chains emanating 

from Japan’s earthquake and tsunami dissipate, and 

the headwinds from higher oil prices fade now that 

prices have receded from their peaks.
Despite the clouded global economic outlook, this Regional Economic Outlook
 revises emerging Europe’s full-year growth projections for 2011 

slightly upward, to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent 

projected in the previous edition, owing to strong 

growth in the ﬁ
 rst quarter (Table 2.1). Growth 
has been revised upward most markedly in Turkey 

(from 4.6 percent to 6.6 percent), and also in 
Lithuania and Moldova. By contrast, growth 

projections have been marked downward in some 

countries in Southeastern Europe, as well as in 

Belarus, reﬂ
 ecting its ongoing exchange rate crisis. 
The upward revisions reﬂ
 ect both higher export 
growth (from 5.4 percent to 7.1 percent) and higher 

domestic demand (from 5.6 percent to 6.3 percent). 
Domestic demand is fairly strong for the year as a 
whole everywhere, except for Southeastern Europe 

(Figure 2.8).22 Household consumption has made a strong recovery 
in the European CIS countries, Poland, and Turkey; 

but recently, consumption growth in Lithuania has also 

improved markedly. At the same time, fixed investment 

has grown strongly in Poland, Russia, Turkey, and the 

Baltic countries.
and consumer conﬁ dence worsened in Central 
Europe, while remaining depressed in Southeastern 

Europe (Figure 2.7). GDP releases for the second 

quarter conﬁ
 rmed the decline in economic 
momentum. Year-over-year growth generally 

softened for an average decline from 3.9 percent

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
28remain vigilant, especially in countries where central bank credibility is less ﬁ rmly entrenched, 
or exchange rates have recently depreciated.
Despite some widening, the region’s current 
account deﬁ cit remains small. It is projected 
to widen from 0.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to 

0.8 percent of GDP in 2011 and 1.2 percent of 

GDP in 2012. In 2011, strong domestic demand 
continues to deteriorate the current accounts, 

especially in Turkey (to around 10 percent of 

GDP), but also in Ukraine and the Baltic countries. 

In Russia, the current account effect of strong 

import demand is counterbalanced by export prices 

for oil and gas that are on average higher in 2011 

than in 2010. External debt ratios are projected 

to be above 80 percent in 2011–12 in Bulgaria, 

Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, and Montenegro.
Risks to the OutlookDownside risks to the outlook are signiﬁ
 cant and 
larger than at the time of the previous edition 

of the 
Regional Economic Outlook
. Although more sluggish global economic growth has always been 

a possibility, quelling the tensions in euro area 

debt markets has proved increasingly challenging 

(Chapter 1). If tensions were to escalate further, the 

economic and ﬁ nancial outlook for the euro area 
would darken considerably and the repercussions 

for emerging Europe would be dire. Exports and 

cross-border production chains with emerging 

Europe’s premier partners would suffer.
More importantly, much of emerging Europe’s 
ﬁ nancial sector would likely come under pressure. 
Strained banks in advanced Europe would likely 

scale back exposure to subsidiaries, nonafﬁ
 liated 
banks, and nonbanks in emerging Europe. A large 

and sudden disengagement from subsidiaries, 

though, is unlikely even in a highly adverse scenario. 

Western banks would ﬁ
 rst turn to domestic support 
mechanisms, including liquidity from the European 

Central Bank (ECB) as collateral allows, lending-

of-last-resort from their central banks, and any 

government schemes that would be put in place in 

the circumstances. Scope for recourse to funding 

from subsidiaries would be rather limited as host 
adjustment proceeds. Downward revisions are more 
modest for other countries.
Growth differentials within emerging Europe will 
likely narrow further in 2012. The fortunes of 

the economies in emerging Europe had diverged 

strongly during 2009 and 2010, but growth 

differentials are set to diminish in 2011 and 2012. 
This reﬂ
 ects a slowdown of domestic demand 
growth in the countries that used to expand the 

fastest, such as Turkey and the European CIS 

countries, combined with a pickup in the hitherto 

slow-growing countries in Southeastern Europe.
Inﬂ ation is projected to decline gradually from 
current levels. The regional average peaked at 

8½ percent earlier in 2011 but has since started to 

come down. This trend is projected to continue 

with inﬂ ation rates averaging 7.9 percent and 
6.8 percent in 2011 and 2012, respectively 

(Table 2.2). Retreating commodity prices from 

recent highs are important factors as is the general 

economic slowdown. Monetary policy tightening 

in a number of countries, such as Moldova and 

Poland, was also important in guarding against any 

unhinging of inﬂ
 ation expectations. The slowing 
of economic activity tempers inﬂ
 ation risks in the 
future, although monetary policymakers need to

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
30emerging Europe. While spreads in the euro area 
periphery were on an upward trend, spreads in 

emerging Europe did not follow suit. Flare-ups of 

turmoil in the euro area often led to increases in 

spreads in emerging Europe, but those episodes 

largely reﬂ
 ected increases in global risk aversion 
rather than increased concerns vis-à-vis the region.
3In mid-2011, there are some indications that this 
may have started to change. Sovereign spreads 

in some countries have responded to the sharply 

widening spreads in the euro area (Figures 2.9 
and 2.10). Croatia and Hungary were particularly 

affected, with spread increases during July and 

August matching those in Italy and Spain. Spreads 

in the rest of emerging Europe were out by about 

half as much. The risk that ﬁ
 nancial tensions 
will spread to emerging Europe is heightened by 

a number of legacies left by the 2008/09 crisis: 

ﬁ scal vulnerabilities that were low before the crisis 
have increased sharply, and nonperforming loans 

(NPLs) have shot up. And western European banks 

continue to play a key role in emerging Europe’s 

ﬁ nancial sectors. In addition, the strong Swiss franc 
remains a challenge for households and banking 

sectors in Croatia, Poland, and especially Hungary, 

where a large share of mortgages are denominated

In a global environment where risk aversion toward 
individual countries can suddenly rise, emerging 

Europe should aim to reduce its vulnerabilities by 

addressing the remaining legacies of the 2008/09 

crisis. Policymakers will need to make headway in 

repairing public ﬁ
 nances, including through the 
strengthening of ﬁ
 scal frameworks to underwrite 
lasting ﬁ scal discipline and lower the high ratios of 
banks’ NPLs to improve conditions for lending. 

Good policies matter not only because they will 

reduce vulnerabilities, but also because they will 

boost convergence. Given the still large income 

differences between emerging and advanced 

Europe, there remains signiﬁ
 cant scope for further 
catching-up with advanced Europe, but it will not 

be automatic. It is contingent on a combination 

of sound macroeconomic policies and structural

The most likely impact would therefore be a 
renewed credit crunch. Subsidiaries would see 

a measured but persistent funding drain from 
their parents, and nonafﬁ
 liated banks that rely on 
wholesale funding would have to struggle even 

more. Both would have little choice but to curtail 

their own lending activities. A reduction of cross-

border lending to nonbanks in emerging Europe 
would compound the credit crunch further.

For Albania, the non-converted 2010 fiscal balance is –3.7 percent of GDP. 
For Montenegro, the equivalent values in 2009 and 2010 are –5.3 and –3.9 percent of GDP, respectively. 2. EMERGING EUROPE: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL TURMOIL33Other countries are seeing less improvement, if 
any at all. Albania and Croatia are experiencing 

deteriorations (Figure 2.11). In Turkey, the headline 

ﬁ scal balance has improved, reﬂ
 ecting transient 
revenues from the import and domestic demand 

boom, while spending has grown rapidly. In Russia, 

the non-oil ﬁ scal deﬁ
 cit—which is the relevant 
measure of the ﬁ
 scal stance in oil-producing 
countries, given the volatility of oil prices and the 

nonrenewable nature of oil reserves—will remain 

substantially higher than its precrisis levels, despite 

consolidation measures. In addition, the composition 

of ﬁ
 scal consolidation is not supportive of growth, 
as it relies heavily on increased payroll taxes and cuts 

to public investment.
Despite ﬁ scal consolidation in emerging Europe, 
ﬁ scal vulnerabilities remain high in a number of 
countries (Figure 2.12). Fiscal deﬁ cits in 2011 
are above 4 percent of GDP in Croatia, Kosovo, 

Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Serbia. 

Public debt exceeds 50 percent of GDP in Albania, 

Hungary, and Poland. Albania and Hungary 

have relatively high shares of short-term debt 

that account for more than 10 percent of GDP. 

Furthermore, a signiﬁ
 cant share of public debt in 
a number of countries is denominated in foreign 

currency, exposing public ﬁ
 nances to currency risk.
It is imperative that these vulnerabilities be reduced 
further. Countries should not take solace in the fact 

that spreads have remained relatively low so far. 

Past experience in countries with signiﬁ
 cant public 
ﬁ nance problems shows that spreads can remain 
low until a very late stage.
One of the lessons from the crisis in 2008/09 is 
that ﬁ scal policy should be more prudent in good 
times to build adequate buffers to be used when 
the cycle turns. In the run-up to the crisis, ﬁ
 scal 
balances were inﬂ
 ated by high cyclical revenues 
related to demand booms. These ﬁ
 scal revenues 
were primarily used to increase government 

spending. Consequently, many countries barely 

had any ﬁ scal surplus on the eve of the crisis 
despite strong GDP growth. When revenues 

collapsed during the crisis, this led to large ﬁ
 scal 
deﬁ cits, forcing a procyclical ﬁ
 scal tightening that 
compounded the contraction in domestic demand.This should reduce its deﬁ
 cit by about 4 percentage 
points of GDP in two years, although further 

consolidation will be needed to put public debt 
ﬁ rmly on a downward path in the medium term. 
Fiscal deﬁ cits are also declining rapidly in Romania, 
Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. Given that 

Ukraine’s ﬁ
 scal adjustment in 2010 was kept modest 
because of concerns about the ﬂ
 edgling recovery, 
the currently envisaged structural tightening 

is both necessary and timely, considering the 

rebound in private sector activity and the need to 

build credibility. Likewise, Romania is continuing 

ﬁ scal consolidation under the IMF-supported 
program, and recently saw encouraging tax revenue 

performance. Nonetheless, improvements in 

revenue collection, optimization of expenditures, 

and further discretionary measures remain critical 

to underwrite the projected budget deﬁ
 cit of less 
than 3 percent of GDP in 2012.

34Among various ﬁ
 scal rules, an expenditure rule can 
be particularly useful in reducing the tendency to 

increase public spending during good times (Box 

2.1). An expenditure rule can limit the growth of 

expenditures to potential growth or to a prudent 

level of medium-term output growth. If such a 

rule is adequately designed, the expenditure-to-

GDP ratio would fall during good times, rise during 

bad times, and be constant over the entire cycle. 

Empirical evidence suggests that rules can also be 

effective in ensuring strong ﬁ
 scal consolidation 
(Box 2.2).
Fiscal rules originated in advanced countries, but 
increasingly they are also applied in emerging market 

countries. Eighty countries now have ﬁ
 scal rules in 
place, up from just seven in 1990 (IMF, 2010b). In 

Latvia and Lithuania, ﬁ scal responsibility laws and 
new deﬁ cit rules are being planned. In Poland, the 
revised Public Finance Act (effective since January 

2010) has deﬁ ned corrective measures to be taken 
if the thresholds under the debt rule are breached.

2007Fiscal rules can help…Fiscal rules can help ensure that this mistake is 
not repeated in future upswings. Fiscal rules can 

enhance the credibility of consolidation plans and 

entrench ﬁ
 scal discipline (Debrun and Kumar, 
2007a). Empirical studies for EU countries suggest 
that national ﬁ scal rules have been generally 
associated with improved ﬁ
 scal performance.
4 Setting up nonpartisan ﬁ
 scal agencies (that is, 
ﬁ scal councils) that provide macroeconomic 
forecasts for budget preparation can reduce further 

the optimistic biases that are found in ofﬁ cial 
government forecasts and contribute to greater 

transparency (Debrun and Kumar, 2007b; Council 

of the European Union, 2010).
4 Fiscal rules have also been identified as a factor for 
successful fiscal consolidation. An IMF study shows 

that 24 episodes of large fiscal adjustments since 1980 

benefited from formal budgetary constraints (IMF, 

forthcoming). 
2. EMERGING EUROPE: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL TURMOIL35Box 2.1The Appeal of Fiscal Expenditure Rules in Countries of CESEEThis box seeks to illustrate the beneﬁ
 ts that rules-based ﬁ
 scal expenditure policy would have in countries of 
central, eastern, and southeastern Europe (CESEE). The numerical simulations use a basic rule to bring out the 

effects on public ﬁ nances in broad terms. In practice, one would want to apply more reﬁ
 ned expenditure rules, 
supplement them with other ﬁ scal reforms, and take into account country idiosyncrasies to achieve optimal ﬁ
 scal 
outcomes. For example, in oil-producing countries, a permanent income oil model rule may be the best way to 

ensure long-term ﬁ
 scal sustainability and equitable intergenerational use of the oil wealth (Medas and Zakharova, 
2009).The simulations suggest that expenditure rules could help make ﬁ
 scal policy less procyclical and lower 
public debt in CESEE countries (ﬁ rst ﬁ
 gure).
1 Had the real growth rate of primary expenditure been limited 
to a prudent estimate of medium-term real GDP growth, ﬁ
 scal policy would have been signiﬁ
 cantly less 
expansionary in good times. Larger ﬁ
 scal buffers would have been accumulated when economic growth was 
above trend, thereby reducing the need for strong ﬁ
 scal tightening during downturns. Moreover, thanks to the 
large ﬁ
 scal surpluses achieved during good times, public ﬁ
 nances would in general have remained in better 
shape than the actual outcomes, despite much higher real expenditure growth induced by the rule in bad 

times. Setting the rule in nominal or real terms does not affect the results much as long as inﬂ
 ation remains 
reasonably predictable. A nominal rule tends to deliver stronger countercyclical policies if inﬂ
 ation surprises 
on the upside in booms and on the downside in bad times. This could usefully reinforce the countercyclical 

character of the rule. However, nominal rules do not perform well in the rare circumstances in which 

unexpectedly high inﬂ ation coincides with cyclical downturns. Latvia is a point in case—expenditure growth is 
much lower under a nominal rule than under a real one.
The expenditure-smoothing feature of the rule is particularly apparent in countries that experienced a 
pronounced boom-bust cycle, such as the Baltics or Romania, and in countries where ﬁ
 scal revenues were inﬂ
 ated 
by surging oil prices (second ﬁ
 gure). Most notably in these countries, ﬁ
 scal rule-based expenditures would have 
been signiﬁ cantly below actual expenditures in good times. And the ﬁ
 scal buffers accumulated in boom periods 
would have permitted maintaining high expenditure growth without leading to excessive ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cits in bad 
times. Interestingly, the rule would have been much less binding in countries that had an expenditure-type ﬁ
 scal 
rule already in place (for example, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland) or in countries with more 

restrained expenditure growth in the boom period (for example, Czech Republic and Slovenia).
Past experience, however, shows that an expenditure rule, like other ﬁ
 scal rules, only works if there is a genuine 
political commitment to ﬁ scal discipline. Without that commitment, the expenditure rule risks leading to creative 
accounting and to off-budget operations, reducing transparency while failing to genuinely improve ﬁ
 scal policy. 
Only superﬁ cial commitment to the expenditure rule could also undermine the quality of public spending, as 
easy-to-cut expenditures are targeted regardless of the implications for long-term growth.
Note: The main author of this box is Géraldine Mahieu.
1 The expenditure rules considered in the numerical examples limit the growth rate of general government primary 
expenditure to a prudent estimate of medium-term real GDP growth. It is calculated as the moving average of real GDP 

growth since 2000 rather than potential growth, which is difficult to estimate reliably in real time. Computing average real 

GDP growth from 2000 excludes the transition years, where growth was arguably less representative of future economic 

performance. The simulations consider two variations of the expenditure rule. In the first version, real spending is targeted 

using the actual CPI to translate real expenditure ceilings into nominal ones. In the second version, nominal spending is 

targeted using the targeted inflation rate to derive nominal expenditure ceilings. For expositional clarity, any feedbacks from
 expenditure on real GDP growth and public revenues are assumed away. The simulations generally apply the expenditure rule 

from 2004. However, later starting points are used in a number of cases to ensure that public finances are reasonably sound at 

the outset (2005 for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, and 2006 in Albania, Croatia, and Turkey).
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
36Expenditure rules should be supplemented by a long-term ﬁ
 scal anchor for the budget balance. Expenditure 
rules by themselves do not ensure ﬁ
 scal sustainability as they do not take the revenue side into account.
2 A long-term ﬁ
 scal anchor, in terms of budget balance, is therefore essential, either by linking the path of 
expenditures to the desired ﬁ scal balance or by combining the expenditure rule with a budget balance rule or a 
deﬁ cit ceiling, to avoid excessive ﬁ
 scal slippages in case of severe economic crises. The case of Latvia illustrates 
this point in the numerical simulations (third ﬁ
 gure): despite Latvia’s large ﬁ
 scal buffers induced by the expenditure 
rule during the boom years (peaking at 9.5 percent of GDP in 2007 with a real rule), maintaining an expenditure 

growth rate in line with past average GDP growth (about 7 percent in real terms) when GDP collapsed by about 

22 percent in the following three years would have led to excessive ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cits (–9.5 percent in 2010).
2 However, some expenditure rules provide for compensatory cuts in spending in case of discretionary cuts in revenues.

Impact of Expenditure Rule in Latvia This also implies that ﬁ
 scal expenditure rules are not 
a good instrument for ﬁ
 scal consolidation, especially 
in times when GDP growth is still below potential. 

The example of Hungary in the illustrative simulations 

shows that if the ﬁ
 scal rule started being applied in 
a year with a large ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cit (6.4 percent of GDP 
in Hungary in 2004), it worsens the ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cit 
(fourth ﬁ
 gure). Given that many emerging European 
economies are currently facing large ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cits, 
major ﬁ scal consolidation plans should precede 
the introduction of an expenditure rule. However, 

considering a wider set of rules, ﬁ
 scal rules may be a 
factor of success for ﬁ
 scal consolidation (IMF, 2009). 
However, preparatory work on the design of an 
expenditure rule should commence earlier. The design 

of the rule and the process of reaching the necessary 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
38consensus on its parameters are likely to take time. In addition, because the global ﬁ
 nancial crisis has generally 
increased the population’s awareness of the importance of stable and sustainable public ﬁ
 nances, this could raise 
the political support for an expenditure rule. Past experience shows that the introduction of expenditure rules was 

indeed preceded by severe ﬁ
 scal difﬁ
 culties in several countries, although it came after consolidation efforts had 
been completed and therefore served primarily to lock in ﬁ
 scal adjustment. This suggests that preparations for an 
expenditure rule should accompany ﬁ
 scal consolidation plans so that it is ready for implementation once the repair 
of public ﬁ
 nances has sufﬁ
 ciently advanced.
Box 2.2Institutions That Facilitate Fiscal ConsolidationBudgetary institutions shape ﬁ
 scal outcomes and notably facilitate ﬁ
 scal consolidation. This has been shown 
by several theoretical and empirical analyses. Budgetary institutions support ﬁ
 scal consolidation efforts at three 
stages of the policymaking process: (i) by providing policymakers and the public with a credible and transparent 

assessment of the scale and scope of the necessary consolidation; (ii) by helping develop a credible consolidation 

strategy; and (iii) by supporting the implementation of the consolidation strategy with strong institutional 

arrangements for the preparation, approval, and execution of the budget. This box reviews the institutions that 

seem to have contributed the most to ﬁ
 scal consolidation.
1 Comprehensive and rigorous reporting of government ﬁ
 nances is needed to provide an effective basis for 
consolidation planning. This is supported by both the literature and past country experience. Government 

statistics should cover both central and local government ﬁ
 nances and be produced by an independent statistical 
ofﬁ ce, in line with harmonized standards.
2 Experience shows that contingent liabilities and tax expenditures 
(that is, deviations from established tax norms or benchmarks intended to provide a beneﬁ
 t for a speciﬁ
 c activity 
or class of taxpayer) should be subjected to stricter monitoring and control arrangements, because these two 

items have been a major source of ﬁ
 scal leakages in previous consolidation efforts. 
Medium-term ﬁ
 scal objectives can provide a stable anchor for ﬁ
 scal consolidation. When precisely deﬁ
 ned in terms 
of nominal values and timeframe, medium-term ﬁ
 scal objectives have been shown to provide a stable anchor for 
ﬁ scal consolidation and to raise the costs of deviating from the consolidation path. Formalizing these medium-
term objectives as numerical ﬁ
 scal rules can contribute to the consolidation efforts, although empirical studies 
tend to show that they have been more important in sustaining the pace of consolidation than in generating it. For 

example, some empirical evidence (see EC, 2007b) suggests that the presence of numerical rules for the deﬁ
 cit and 
debt is associated with successful consolidation episodes, but expenditure rules are not (see Box 2.1). Numerical 

rules for deﬁ
 cit and debt were introduced in Italy and Spain during their successful ﬁ
 scal consolidations, which 
started in the 1990s. The enactment of subnational borrowing rules and limits also appears to have supported 

the major ﬁ scal consolidation efforts in Canada (started in 1993) and Russia (started in 1995). Under the U.S. 
Budget Enforcement Act (1990–2002), stringent caps on discretionary spending and “pay-as-you-go” ﬁ
 nancing on 
entitlement outlays helped lock in the revenue surprise of the late 1990s until passage of the tax cut in 2001.

Commission (2007b), Tsibouris and others (2006), Gupta and others (2005), Debrun and others (2009), Price (2010), and von 

Hagen and others (2001).
2 Dabla-Norris and others (2010) shows that the comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget process particularly 
promote fiscal discipline in low-income countries.

Box 2.1 (concluded)2. EMERGING EUROPE: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL TURMOIL39A credible medium-term budget framework, if adequately designed, is also crucial to meet aggregate ﬁ
 scal 
objectives and achieve consolidation success, as it encourages long-term planning and reinforces multi-year 

discipline. A medium-term framework consists of arrangements for formulating and presenting projections 

of individual revenue and expenditure items; ﬁ
 xing binding multi-year restrictions on expenditure aggregates; 
and providing clear indications of policy priorities. While the empirical support for the effectiveness of 

medium-term frameworks in promoting ﬁ
 scal discipline is somewhat mixed, medium-term frameworks were 
implemented in several countries that have achieved large ﬁ
 scal consolidation, such as in Brazil (1999–2003), 
Canada (1993–2000), Finland (1992–2000), Lithuania (1999–2003), New Zealand (1983–88), and South Africa 

(1993–2001).4Independent ﬁ
 scal agencies have been shown to be particularly helpful in developing credible ﬁ
 scal consolidation. 
The role given to these agencies differs across countries. They can be tasked to do the following:
• Provide independent forecasts regarding both budgetary variables and other relevant macroeconomic variables, 
including GDP growth and inﬂ
 ation, thereby injecting more realism into budget plans, and/or 
• Provide objective analysis of ﬁ
 scal developments, long-term sustainability considerations, and cost of 
budgetary initiatives, thereby increasing the transparency and supporting the credibility of the consolidation 

process, and/or
• Provide normative assessments regarding the consistency of the government’s budgetary policies with its own 
objectives (including recommendations of a particular ﬁ
 scal measure), thereby raising the reputational cost to 
the government of deviating from its ﬁ
 scal consolidation path. 
Evidence suggests that ﬁ
 scal councils have contributed to ﬁ
 scal discipline, with those providing normative 
assessment generally being more effective than those limited to pure analysis (see, for instance, Debrun 

and others, 2009), although their effectiveness also crucially depends on the degree of the government’s 

commitment to ﬁ scal soundness. Examples of ﬁ
 scal councils with a mandate to issue normative judgments 
include Belgium’s High Council of Finance, Denmark’s Economic Council, and Sweden’s Fiscal Policy council. 

The recommendations of these agencies seem to have been taken seriously, contributing to constructive debates 

on budgetary policy issues and helping to implement difﬁ
 cult consolidation measures. The Netherlands’ Central 
Planning Bureau, which provides the economic assumptions for the budget, as well as independent analyses and 

research on a broad range of economic issues, is also widely regarded as fully independent and as a model for an 

effective ﬁ
 scal council.
Finally, strong institutions for the preparation, approval, and execution of budgets prevent consolidation 
plans from derailing when confronted with the realities of the annual budget process. A comprehensive top-

down approach to budgeting—meaning that a binding decision on budget aggregates including all central 

government ﬁ
 nances is taken before an allocation of expenditure is made within those aggregates—has been 
shown to improve ﬁ
 scal discipline.
5 Similarly, restrictions on parliamentary powers to amend the government’s 
draft budget and hand a stronger role to the prime minister or ﬁ
 nance minister have proven to help enhance 
ﬁ scal discipline.
6 4 The EC (2007b) finds that medium-term frameworks have a positive effect on fiscal performance in the EU as do Beetsma 
and others (2009), while Ylaoutinen (2004) finds less evidence of such a link in Central and Eastern European countries.
5 Von Hagen (2005) and de Haan and others (1999) find support for the hypothesis that the comprehensiveness of the budget 
process improves fiscal discipline.
6 Alesina and others (1999), Wehner (2009), and von Hagen and Harden (1994) notably demonstrate that limits on 
parliamentary amendment powers are positively associated with fiscal outcomes. Mulas-Granados and others (2009) shows 

that institutional designs that allow the finance minister to veto parliament’s proposals for modifying the budget have been 

crucial to foster fiscal consolidation in the new EU Member States.

But even when an expenditure rule is not fully 

followed, having one can help limit expenditure 

growth by setting a clear benchmark for reasonable 

expenditure growth in good times. In emerging 

Europe, the crisis in 2008/09 has generally 

increased the popular awareness of the importance 

of sustainable public ﬁ

build support for introducing an expenditure rule.
Cleaning up NPLsThe crisis of 2008/09 and the boom that preceded 

it have left a large share of banks’ loan portfolios 

impaired. NPL ratios are high, often at levels 

comparable with those seen in earlier ﬁ nancial 
crises around the world (Figure 2.13). According 

to the latest data available, several countries, 

including Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Serbia, 

and Ukraine, report NPL ratios in excess of 

15 percent (Table 2.4). NPL ratios are particularly 

high in countries that went through a pronounced 

boom-bust cycle, with rapid credit growth and 

housing price appreciation fueling the upswing and 
deep recessions and housing price slumps when 

the credit cycle turned (Figure 2.14). NPL ratios

as the ﬁ nancial turmoil in euro area debt markets 
evolves and further local surprises cannot be ruled 

out, such as the need for a bailout of the ﬁ

largest Russian bank this July.
...but they may hold back the recoveryHigh levels of unresolved NPLs over prolonged 

periods of time are likely to hold back economic 

recovery and structural change for the following 

reasons.
• Impaired debtors have little incentive and ability 
to step up economic activity as any incremental 

income would accrue in its entirety to creditors. 
5 The recent European stress tests found that most 
major banks operating in the region would be resilient 

to an adverse scenario: only two banks (Volksbank and 

Eurobank) failed the tests and two other banks (Piraeus 

and Banco Commercial Portugues) were found to be 

vulnerable to shocks (Figure 2.17).
of 2011—with ratios declining in some countries, 
such as Poland, Russia, and the Baltics, while edging 

up elsewhere, such as in Bulgaria, Hungary, and 

Romania (Figure 2.15). This reﬂ
 ects differences in 
the strength of the economic recovery. Exchange 

rate movements also play a role when loans are 

denominated in foreign currency. For example, in 

Hungary, many mortgages are denominated in Swiss 

francs and the franc’s strong appreciation against 

the forint makes it more onerous for homeowners 

to keep up with rising debt-service requirements.
High NPLs in emerging Europe are currently not a threat to ﬁ nancial stability… 
Financial soundness indicators suggest that 
banking systems are generally well capitalized and 
that provisioning levels are generally substantial 
(Table 2.4). Capital adequacy ratios are in the 

double digits, comfortably above the minimum 
regulatory requirement. Loan-loss provisions 
cover about two-thirds of NPLs on average; 
but provisioning levels vary signiﬁ
 cantly across

44that involve mergers or acquisitions, and the 
transfer of assets to third parties or dedicated 

workout units should not be subject to value-

added tax (VAT). Regulations prohibiting banks 

from owning and operating businesses or 

requiring compulsory takeover bids should not 

apply in the context of debt restructuring or 

collateral execution.
• Strengthen credit enforcement.
 Effective credit 
enforcement requires not only adequate 
insolvency and foreclosure legislation, but 

also the institutional capacity and integrity for 

implementation. • Foster voluntary out-of-court restructurings
. This 
could be done by drawing up a code of 

conduct for voluntary restructuring that is 

endorsed by the authorities and industry 

associations. It could be supported further 

by expedited legal proceedings that make 

agreements reached by a qualiﬁ
 ed majority 
of creditors legally binding, including for 

dissenting creditors.
• Avoid coercive debt restructuring and government 
subsidies. Coercion would give rise to legal 
challenge and do lasting damage to the credit 

culture. Government subsidies could increase 

moral hazard and could redistribute to creditors 
who would otherwise be able to absorb losses. 

These measures should be used when debt 

overhang is widespread and severe; the capacity 

of the banking system to restructure is limited; 

and there are important concerns about 

ﬁ nancial stability (Laeven and Laryea, 2009)—
none of which is currently the case in emerging 

Europe.
Toward Sustainable Convergence with Advanced EuropeThe still large income differentials between 
advanced and emerging Europe suggest that 

emerging Europe has signiﬁ cant scope for further 
catching-up. At the same time, as discussed in 

Chapter 3, Europe is the only continent where At the same time, lack of ﬁ
 nancing hinders 
investment, as well as the conduct of normal 

business operations. Moreover, unresolved 

NPLs also mean that assets of unviable 

debtors are not reallocated to potentially more 
productive uses.
• Banks with highly impaired loan portfolios are 
likely to engage less in new lending. First, banks 

with high NPLs are likely to charge higher 

interest rates, and therefore attract less credit 

demand, as they raise spreads to recoup NPL-
related losses or as they pass on higher funding 
costs associated with uncertainties about their 

true ﬁ
 nancial health. Second, high NPLs can 
reduce banks’ capacity to ﬁ nance new loans, 
as foregone debt service on NPLs is no longer 

available for new lending or as losses from 

provisioning erode capital. Third, high NPLs 

might unduly distract bank management from 

seeking out new lending opportunities.
A cross-country panel regression analysis of 
individual banks in emerging Europe shows that 

banks with high NPLs exhibit systematically lower 

lending growth (Box 2.3). As the regressions 

compare individual banks, they allow supply factors 

(higher NPLs) to be distinguished from demand 
factors (low GDP growth), which affect all banks in 

a country equally.
Resolving NPLs should be done by the private sectorLowering NPL levels will support economic activity. 
With economic conditions sufﬁ ciently settled for a 
proper assessment of debtors’ repayment capacity 

and banking systems resilient enough to absorb 
potential further losses, the time has come to push 

ahead with NPL resolution. There are a number of 

steps governments can take to foster market-based 

solutions.
• Remove debt restructuring obstacles in tax codes and 
regulations.
 A reduction of debt through debt 
write-downs should not be considered taxable 

income of troubled borrowers. Loss carry-

forward should be ensured in restructurings 
2. EMERGING EUROPE: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL TURMOIL45Box 2.3Nonperforming Loans (NPLs) and Credit Growth in Emerging EuropeCredit growth remains subdued in much of emerging Europe while NPLs are high (Figures 2.3 and 2.15). 
Almost three years after the peak phase of the global ﬁ
 nancial crisis, real credit growth is still negative in half 
the countries of emerging Europe. Elsewhere, it also often remains rather low. While this likely reﬂ
 ects a variety 
of factors, including better risk awareness at the bank level, and is welcome to some extent, the rapid increase 

of NPLs on banks’ books and the large number of overextended borrowers that it reﬂ
 ects may also play a role. 
Resolving these NPLs would likely not only spur credit growth, but also increase credit churning and unleash the 

economic potential of overextended but viable borrowers. Economic recovery would beneﬁ
 t through all three 
channels.
Empirical analysis of individual bank data suggests that high NPLs are indeed holding back credit growth 
in emerging Europe (table). Speciﬁ cally, the logarithm of NPL ratios is regressed on real loan growth using 
2010 data for over 900 banks in 21 countries of the region. Country-speciﬁ
 c effects and cross-country growth 
differentials are controlled for, as they are potentially the most important other drivers of credit growth. 

The coefﬁ
 cient for NPLs is found to be negative and highly signiﬁ
 cant. Results are reported with and without 
banks’ capital adequacy as additional control. A doubling of the NPL ratio tends to reduce real credit growth by 

between 7 percentage points and 10 percentage points. Working with individual bank data and controlling for 

GDP growth has the advantage of stripping out the effects that cross-country idiosyncrasies, such as the strength 

of credit demand, have on lending growth. Hence, the estimated coefﬁ
 cient for NPLs should predominantly 
capture the effects of NPLs on credit supply.

46growth in the longer term. Another reason 
for the difference may be that in countries that 

remain less integrated, much of the growth 

tends to occur in the context of demand booms 

ﬁ nanced by capital inﬂ
 ows. While the countries 
that saw large capital inﬂ
 ows experienced 
rapid growth during the boom years, much of 

this overperformance was undone during the 

subsequent bust. 
As discussed in Chapter 3, the interaction of sound 
macroeconomic policies and growth-enhancing 

structural reforms can, over time, make a 

signiﬁ cant difference in raising a country’s growth 
potential by fostering balanced growth and raising 

TFP growth. Good macroeconomic policies help 

prevent unbalanced growth, and structural reforms 

further help raise TFP growth, which in the longer 

term is the key contributor to growth.
strong convergence is visibly occurring, no doubt 
helped by strong linkages between advanced 

and emerging Europe (Chapter 4). However, 

convergence is not automatic, as is evident from 

countries where convergence has stalled, and some 

growth patterns are more conducive to sustain 

catching-up than others. 
The experience of the past decade suggests that 
countries with sound macroeconomic policies and 

rapid trade integration with advanced Europe have 

seen faster catching-up than countries that have 

remained relatively closed. One reason for this 

may be that adopting foreign technology is easier 

for countries that trade heavily than for countries 

that are less integrated with the global economy. 

Indeed, countries with more economic activity 

in manufacturing and less in nontradable sectors 

tend to have higher total factor productivity (TFP) 
473. Long-Term Growth Differentials within Europe
  In the past decade, growth rates in GDP per capita have 
differed markedly among European countries, from zero 

in Italy and Portugal to more than 4 percent in the best 

performers. To a large extent, the growth differentials reﬂ ect 

convergence. However, a number of countries have grown less 

than their potential because of poor macroeconomic policies 

and barriers to growth. The experience of earlier reformers 

provides useful lessons for current poor performers. Reforms 

do make a difference, but their implementation takes time, 

and their impact is felt only with a lag. Reforms would not 

only speed up convergence within Europe, but also help close 

the productivity and innovation gaps with the United States.
Growth Differentials in Europe Across Europe, countries have experienced a 

wide variation in per capita GDP growth over 

the past decade (Figure 3.1).6 Growth rates have 
ranged from close to zero in Italy and Portugal to 

more than 4 percent in Albania, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. 
Convergence explains a large part of these differences…Poorer European countries have generally grown 
faster than richer countries, a process called 

“convergence.” While there is no clear evidence 

of 
absolute convergence in the world, convergence 
is usually observed within more homogeneous 

groups of economies—a phenomenon called 
6 The chapter focuses on the period since the 
introduction of the euro. The limited number of 

observations and the impact of the global crisis in 

the latter part of the decade make it difficult to apply 

advanced econometric methods. Nevertheless, the 

findings in this chapter are similar to those found in the 

economics literature.
conditional convergence.
7,8 It is noteworthy that 
convergence in Europe has been stronger than in 

Latin America or Asia—regions that are not as 
economically integrated (Figure 3.2). Much of the 

convergence in Europe is due to rapid growth of 

emerging European countries, as they have adopted 

institutions similar to those in advanced Europe and 

beneﬁ ted from higher investment rates, ﬁ
 nanced 
with intra-European capital ﬂ ows.
9Growth theory identiﬁ
 es two factors that 
drive convergence: diminishing returns in the 

accumulation of capital and cross-country 

knowledge spillovers. Poorer countries usually 

have a lower capital stock and therefore, a higher 
7 See, for instance, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) and 
Aghion and Howitt (2009).
8 Conditional convergence predicts that countries 
converge to their own steady state where growth rates 

are only determined by technological progress. If 

countries share the same technology and fundamentals, 

they share the same steady state, so differences in

capital accumulation and higher TFP growth. 

Higher returns on investment attracted strong 

capital ﬂ ows, which ﬁ
 nanced higher investment 
rates and a more rapid accumulation of capital 

stock than in richer countries (Figure 3.3). 

In addition, poorer countries, facilitated by the 

EU enlargement process, achieved higher TFP 
marginal productivity of capital:  increases in capital stock 
will thus have a large impact on output. Poorer countries 

can also boost output by imitating technologies already 

developed in richer and more advanced countries—a 

process that will raise total factor productivity (TFP).

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE49growth by adopting new technologies and better 
institutions (Figure 3.4). By contrast, the contribution of employment and 
human capital to average GDP growth has been 

lower in emerging Europe than in advanced Europe 

(Figures 3.5 and 3.6).10 The lower contribution of 
employment growth in emerging Europe during the 

period was most likely related to the slower growth 

of its working-age population, which, in turn, 

was exacerbated by the emigration of workers to 

advanced Europe.
…but institutions and policies are equally important Growth differentials have been more variable than 
convergence alone can account for. Figure 3.7 

shows “adjusted” growth rates—the difference 

between each country’s actual growth rate and the 

growth rate that would have been expected given 

initial income levels. While the precise ﬁ
 gures are 
sensitive to the shape of the expected convergence 

line, it is clear that considerable differences exist 

and that some countries have done much better 

(and others much worse) than what would be 

expected on the basis of income differentials alone. 

For instance, Italy and Portugal have grown much

was partly compensated for by longer hours worked.
slower than expected, while the Slovak Republic 
and Sweden have grown faster.
These growth gaps are associated with key 
differences in factors such as market structures, 

human capital stocks, institutions, and 

macroeconomic policies. The economic literature 

has identiﬁ ed a large number of factors likely 
to inﬂ uence economic growth (Box 3.1). Select 
factors, discussed below, seem particularly relevant 

in differentiating fast-growing from slow-growing 

countries in Europe.
The importance of these factors differs across 
countries. The growth bottlenecks in countries 

that are catching up differ from those in 

countries that are at the technology frontier. For 

instance, policies promoting macroeconomic 

stability, ﬂ
 exible labor markets, and a well-
educated workforce help growth in both sets of 

countries. Policies strengthening product market 

competition, better protection of property rights 

and legal security, and more innovation appear 

particularly growth enhancing for countries 

closer to the technology frontier (Aghion 

and Howitt, 2009). Finally, early economic 

liberalization policies during the transition 

process seem more important for imitating
 countries.
11 Good macroeconomic policies matterThe economic literature suggests that 

macroeconomic volatility is not good for growth. 

Empirical studies have shown that countries with 

higher macroeconomic volatility have lower average 

growth (Ramey and Ramey, 1995). This may be 

because higher volatility discourages long-term 

investments that bring substantial returns only over 

the long term (such as investments in research and 
11 Catching-up countries will typically not focus on 
innovations and inventing new technologies, and instead, 

rely on the adoption and imitation of techniques 

developed outside.

50development [R&D]), especially among credit-
constrained ﬁ rms.
12 Macroeconomic policies that prevent boom-bust 
cycles may therefore help raise long-term growth. 

Some of the countries in emerging Europe saw 

rapid growth in the run-up to the global crisis, as 

large capital inﬂ
 ows fueled a credit-driven domestic 
demand boom. That boom was followed by very 

deep recessions and generally resulted in slower 

convergence. For instance, if Estonia and Latvia 

had avoided the boom-bust cycle and maintained 

the average growth rates they achieved during 

the 1993–2005 period, their real GDP per capita 
in 2010 would have been 40 percent higher.
12 The literature also suggests that less-developed 
economies tend to go through a period of low and highly 

variable growth in the early stages of development. This 

is because the inability to diversify risks causes agents 

to invest in safer but inferior technologies in order to 

reduce risk. As a result, growth tends to be low and more 

dependent on the random outcome of a few existing 

activities (Acemoglu and Zilibotti, 1997).
More generally, excessive growth in domestic 
demand may be detrimental to long-term growth 

(Figure 3.8). This is because it encourages a transfer 

of resources from the tradable to the less productive 

nontradable sector. In slow-growing countries, 

excessive domestic demand growth led to a surge in 

unit labor costs, notably in the manufacturing sector, 

and to less investment in the tradable sector. The 

loss in competitiveness increased further the current-

account deﬁ cit, which was already boosted by higher 
imports that, in turn, were reducing GDP growth.
13Fiscal policy also matters. For instance, countries 

with high public debt have seen lower growth 
13 Empirical growth literature also finds a strong negative 
correlation between inflation, inflation volatility (even 

after controlling for the level of inflation), excessive 

credit growth, and growth. For our sample, we find a 

relatively weak negative relationship of these variables 

with growth (after adjusting for convergence). The weak 

correlation between growth and inflation could partly be 

due to the low variability of inflation among European 

countries, many of which share a common monetary 

policy.

LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE51(Figure 3.9), although the causality may run both 
ways. In addition, it is likely that higher corporate 

tax rates discourage investment by making it less 

proﬁ table, causing corporations to shift investment 
to other countries with lower tax rates.
14 It is noteworthy that countries with lower corporate 

tax rates had higher investment-to-GDP ratios and 

attracted larger capital inﬂ
 ows (Figure 3.10).
14 Higher tax rates also reduce retained earnings—a 
major source of financing for investment, particularly in 

smaller firms.
Labor market ﬂ exibility matters…
Higher labor market ﬂ
 exibility boosts growth by 
increasing labor participation and employment and 

better matching wage and productivity growth.
 In countries such as Italy, Portugal, and Spain, more 

rigid employment regulations (regarding dismissal 

of employees, collective dismissals, and temporary 

contracts) and hiring and ﬁ ring practices may have 
contributed to lower participation and employment 

rates, particularly among women (Figure 3.11). In 

addition, they have likely hindered improvements in

 with productivity growth, preventing undue losses in 

competitiveness and slower growth.
…as does a better-educated workforceInvestment in human capital promotes growth 

in both innovating and imitating countries 

(Figure 3.12). The economic growth literature 
shows that both growth and stock of human 

capital matter for GDP growth. Higher 
growth
 in human capital contributes to higher output 
growth, and higher 
stock
 of human capital increases 
the ability of a country to innovate or catch up 

with more advanced countries by imitation.
16 The type of education that matters for growth 

depends on the country’s state of technological 

development. Investment in tertiary education is 

more growth-enhancing for countries closer to 

the technology frontier, because it increases their 

ability to innovate, whereas primary and secondary 

education are likely to yield relatively more beneﬁ
 ts 
among countries that are technology imitators.
17 Evidence for Europe shows that underperforming 

countries—both those closer to the technology 

frontier and those further from it—produce 

relatively fewer tertiary graduates and have a higher 

share of population with only a primary or lower 

secondary school degree. Italy and Portugal are 

performing particularly badly on this front. 

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that 

the ﬁ rst stage of tertiary education programs 
(outside PhD or doctorate programs, level 5 of the 

International Standard Classiﬁ
 cation of Education 
[ISCED]) is particularly important for countries 

that are technology imitators.

(1994), and Krueger and Lindhal (2001).

ﬂ exible wage determination and better relationships 
between employers and employees, wage increases 
15 See Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn (2009). As suggested 
in Aghion and Howitt (2009), high labor market flexibility 

could be particularly beneficial for innovation activities, 

which often require initiative, risk taking, the selection of 

good projects and talents, and weeding out projects that 

are not expected to be profitable or operational. However, 

a more rigid labor market may favor the accumulation 

of firm-specific human capital, which could be more 

important in imitation activities.

Stylized Facts from the Economic Growth LiteratureThe economic growth literature has developed four leading growth model paradigms. In all models, the 
level 
of economic output depends on the stock of capital and labor and the state of technological progress. More 

accumulation of capital and labor will not in itself lead to a permanent increase of the 
growth rate
: technological 
progress is needed to offset diminishing returns to capital and labor. The models, which differ concerning what 

determines technological progress, are as follows (Aghion and Howitt, 2009):
• The neoclassical paradigm, in which technological progress is exogenous. Higher investment increases 
the level
 of output but does not affect the 
growth rate
, which is determined by the exogenously determined 
rate of technological progress. Consequently, the paradigm does not provide long-term growth policy 

recommendations.
• The AK paradigm, which endogenizes technological progress by considering it part of capital accumulation.
1 This yields constant returns to scale in capital accumulation. Hence, growth can now be boosted by higher 

investment—in either physical or human capital.
• The product-variety paradigm, which endogenizes innovation by linking it to product variety. More product 
variety raises an economy’s production potential, which offsets the negative impact of diminishing returns. 

Sustained growth is possible only if new varieties, resulting from R&D investments, are created. 
• The Schumpeterian paradigm, which endogenizes innovation by linking it to ﬁ
 rm turnover and “creative 
destruction.” In this paradigm, a higher rate of ﬁ
 rm turnover generates faster growth, as “creative destruction” 
generates the entry of new innovators and the obsolescence of old products. In this model, growth 

performance will vary with proximity to the technology frontier, and imitators will converge to the frontier at a 

higher speed until they need to switch to more innovation. Failure to operate the switch can prevent a country 

from catching up.
These paradigms have been used to explain different factors that account for the growth process.

Financial sector development promotes growth. A large body of evidence suggests that countries with more 
developed ﬁ
 nancial systems tend to grow faster—although causality can go both ways. Better functioning 
ﬁ nancial systems (i) ease real sector external ﬁ
 nancing constraints, especially in innovative sectors with 
fewer collateralizable assets and in countries that lie further away from the technology frontier; (ii) provide 

ex-ante information on viable projects; (iii) provide ex-post monitoring of investment performance and 

strengthen corporate governance; (iv) facilitate the trading, diversiﬁ
 cation, and management of risk (including 
macroeconomic volatility); (v) mobilize and pool savings; and (vi) ease the exchange of goods and services. 

Policies aimed at developing ﬁ
 nancial markets would then be indirectly promoting growth. These policies 
fall under six categories of purpose: (i) to strengthen political and macroeconomic stability; (ii) to strengthen 

the operation of the legal and information infrastructure; (iii) to strengthen ﬁ
 nancial system regulatory and 
supervisory framework; (iv) to promote market contestability and efﬁ
 ciency; (v) to reduce government ownership 
of ﬁ
 nancial institutions and promote public investment in infrastructure that facilitates access to ﬁ
 nance; and 
(vi) to promote ﬁ nancial liberalization and sound institutional development.
Competition has a non-linear impact on growth. Both too much and too little competition can inhibit innovation. 
In addition, market contestability has a more positive impact on growth in countries closer to the technology 

frontier but a less positive impact on sectors or countries that lie further away from the frontier. 
1 The name “AK model” originates from the mathematical representation of the production function in the model 
Y = AK, where Y represents the total production in an economy, 
A represents total factor productivity, and 
K is capital.Note: The main author of this box is Gregorio Impavido.
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
54These ﬁ
 ndings have important policy implications, including the following: (i) the promotion of national 
“champions” inhibits growth in countries closer to the technology frontier; (ii) countries closer to the technology 

frontier should promote entry (also with public funding) of innovative ﬁ
 rms; and (iii) domestic competition 
policy should be complemented by policies aimed at facilitating the reallocation of capital and labor from laggard 

to innovative sectors.
Investment in human capital promotes growth in innovator and imitator countries alike. On the one hand, 
countries closer to the technology frontier should invest in secondary and tertiary education, since this facilitates 

the shift from imitation to innovation and avoids low-growth traps. In particular, funding and autonomous 

universities are strategically complementary; that is, although funding education is not growth enhancing, it 

enhances growth when universities are autonomous, because this autonomy better aligns research with market 

needs. On the other hand, countries further away from the technology frontier should invest in primary and 

secondary education, because this facilitates the adoption of technologies developed by innovating countries. 
Macroeconomic volatility has a non-linear impact on growth. Volatility can promote aggregate savings and, 
therefore, growth when individuals have a strong preference for future, rather than current, consumption. More 

commonly, volatility hampers growth especially in less ﬁ
 nancially developed countries, which are less able to 
diversify macroeconomic shocks, causing lower investment in long-term R&D. In addition, the procyclical nature 

of R&D expenditures ampliﬁ
 es further the impact of macroeconomic volatility. Consequently, countries further 
below the technology frontier should prioritize ﬁ
 nancial sector development, especially in terms of low-end 
specialized intermediaries such as microﬁ
 nance institutions. Countries closer to the technology frontier should 
prioritize access to external ﬁ
 nance through capital market institutions such as private equity and venture capital. 
All countries would beneﬁ
 t from good macroeconomic policies to avoid short-term booms and busts that lower 
long-term growth rates.
Based on these theories, the empirical literature on growth has identiﬁ
 ed a number of macroeconomic, 
microeconomic, and institutional variables that are linked to long-term growth. Key growth determinants 

(of variable statistical relevance)
2include (i) macroeconomic variables such as indicators of ﬁ
 nancial 
development, exchange rate evolution/variability/distortions, current account balance, money growth, 

government consumption and/or ﬁ
 scal balance and/or government taxation, investment rate, human capital, 
trade openness, and volatility of shocks; (ii) institutional variables such as the rule of law, institutional quality and 

regulatory environment, expenditures and output of R&D, inequality, and political institutions; and 

(iii) demographic variables such as population growth or dependency ratio. The statistical relevance of these 

determinants varies widely and depends on many factors including, but not necessarily limited to, differences in 

country samples, other variables included in the regressions, and the econometric technique used.  
2  See, for instance, Chapter 8 of Aghion and Durlauf (2005).
3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE55For countries far from the technology frontier, economic liberalization is 
key…For countries that are still far from reaching 
the technology frontier, economic liberalization 
reforms conducted during the transition process 
appear to be strongly growth enhancing. 

Countries that liberalized and reformed 

their economies earlier—including through 

privatizations; enterprise restructuring; 

liberalization of price, trade, foreign exchange, 

banking, and interest rates; and infrastructure 

reforms—have generally grown faster. Such 

reforms have helped them catch up more 

rapidly by fostering capital accumulation and the 

adoption or imitation of existing technologies

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
56product market competition appears to enhance 
growth in technologically advanced countries. As can 

be seen in Figure 3.14, good performers in advanced 

countries (such as Germany, the Netherlands, and 

Sweden) generally score better in terms of aggregate 

indicators of efﬁ
 ciency in the goods market and 
barriers to competition than slow-growing countries 
in advanced Europe (notably, Italy and Portugal).
18  This is in line with theoretical and empirical ﬁ
 ndings 
that show how competition encourages growth 

through two channels: by facilitating the entry of 

ﬁ rms with quality-improving innovations and by 
encouraging incumbent ﬁ rms in industries close 
to the technology frontier to innovate as the only 

available avenue to retain market share (Aghion and 

Howitt, 2009). Productivity and output will therefore 

be higher the more intense the competition in 

countries and sectors close to the technology frontier.
Quality of institutions is particularly important 
for growth in richer countries (Figure 3.15). Good

dominance, effectiveness of antimonopoly policy, tax 

and trade tariffs, restrictive rules on FDI, and so on.

legal security are associated with higher growth, 

in line with theoretical predictions and empirical

through R&D expenditures, which beneﬁ

good legal systems and tend to boost growth by 

fostering innovation. There is also a strong positive 

association between the quality of institutions more 

generally and growth performance, but only for

58investment and innovation, and a more educated 
labor force. Innovation capacity matters a great 

deal in advanced Europe, which is closer to the 

technology frontier and therefore needs to grow via 

further innovation. Poor performers in advanced 

Europe manage badly on this front when measured 

by the number of patents granted, by an index of 

technological readiness (which measures capacity 

to develop and absorb new technologies), or by 

innovation capacity (which includes, in addition to 

R&D spending, the availability of scientists and 

engineers, university-industry collaboration, and 

government procurement of advanced technology).
Trade integration: A critical transmission channel from institutions 
to growth The relative degree of trade integration seems to 
strongly differentiate countries with high growth 

from those with slow growth. It is striking how 

many of the strong performers have enjoyed high 
and increasing levels of trade, both in exports and 
in imports, and how many of the poor performers 

have had much lower and stagnating levels, with 

growth driven more by the nontradable sectors. In 

Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, 

the share of export and import in GDP rose 

by about 15 percent to more than 20 percent 

between 1995 and 2010. The same was true for 

the Czech and Slovak Republics, and, to a lesser 

extent, Poland. At the other end of the spectrum, 

the export-to-GDP and import-to-GDP ratios of 

Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain stagnated over 

those years (Figure 3.17). Differences in the degree of trade integration likely 
have little to do with trade policies as such. Generally, 

trade liberalization is a key driver of growth and in 

Europe, it has certainly played an important role 

in the increase of trade shares over time as the EU 

expanded, deepened, and developed closer ties with 

non-members in Europe and beyond. However, trade 

policy is identical for all EU countries and therefore 

cannot explain growth differentials among them.

 ects both better 
institutions and market competitiveness and 

ampliﬁ es their impact on growth. As previously 
mentioned, a more competitive and ﬂ
 exible labor 
market, as well as better institutions, encourages 

ﬁ rms to imitate and innovate, resulting in higher 
TFP growth and external competitiveness. Countries 

with these advantages are likely to display higher 

export growth (Figure 3.18). At the same time, trade 

integration enhances growth since competition 

diverts resources from the nontradable to the 
more productive tradable sectors. Conversely, poor 
institutions that pose barriers to competition distort 

resources toward the protected nontradable sectors, 

such as real estate and construction, which are 

weaker sources of productivity growth. As can be 

seen in Figure 3.19, more manufacturing and less 

real estate and construction activity are associated 

with higher labor productivity and TFP growth. 
Twenty to thirty years ago, Italy, Portugal, and 
Spain managed to grow relatively quickly, not only 

because they were beneﬁ
 ting from the catching-up 
effect but probably also because their institutions at 
the time were more appropriate for their stage of 

economic development, which was then based on 

technology imitation. However, as these countries 

moved closer to the world technology frontier, they 

needed to switch toward institutions more suited 

to innovation-based growth. That did not occur, 

and their ability to innovate and move up into new 

industries and technologies suffered. Consequently, 

their growth was hurt by low-cost competition from 

emerging Europe and China in their traditional 
labor-intensive manufacturing sectors.
19Low Growth Traps and How to Get Out of Them Heavily regulated goods and labor markets, poor 
institutions, and macroeconomic policies can 

interact to pull countries into low growth traps 

(Figure 3.20). Countries with inadequate institutions and less competitive markets are likely to see lower 

rates of innovation and stronger growth in the 

nontradable than in the tradable sector, leading 

to slower TFP growth. This, in turn, discourages 

investment in human capital, thereby reducing 

innovative capacities. The uncompetitive ﬁ
 rms in 
these countries are apt to lobby the government 

to maintain barriers to competition to thwart new 

entrants. A vicious circle results with economies 

bound to grow less over the long term. Overly 

stimulative macroeconomic policies can further 

encourage investment in protected sectors by 

inﬂ ating domestic asset prices; this can lead to 
19 Chen, Milesi-Ferretti, and Tressel (forthcoming).

for learning-by-doing externalities and knowledge 

spillovers. In addition, ﬁ
 rms not only are forced 
to innovate by global competition, they also are 

more inclined to invest in R&D because of bigger 

ex-post rents that accrue to successful innovators 

in a larger external market. A vibrant, skill-intensive 

sector that offers employment opportunity will 
encourage investment in human capital, which 
will contribute further to the innovative capacity 

of the economy. Stronger growth in turn allows 

government to reduce expenditures (for example, on 

unemployment beneﬁ
 ts) and opens the opportunity 
to lower taxes and stimulate investment. 
Escaping low growth traps: Experience and lessonsThe problem of slow growing countries in Europe 
is not new. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, 

many countries in Europe suffered from “euro 
sclerosis”—with high unemployment and low 

growth. These earlier periods provide important 

lessons, as they show that a change in policy can 

turn an economy around.
The experiences of the Netherlands and Sweden 
in particular show that it is possible to turn poor 

economic performance around.
 In the 1980s 
and 1990s, these two countries undertook 

sweeping reforms to boost GDP growth after 

prolonged periods of poor economic performance

62(Boxes 3.2 and 3.3). Their experiences provide 
useful insights into how reforms could help other 
countries signiﬁ cantly reverse their economic 
fortunes.
Both countries undertook reforms only after a 
protracted economic malaise that culminated in 
a crisis. Income per capita was falling relative to 

that of Germany for about a decade (Figure 3.21). 

In addition, public ﬁ nances were deteriorating: 
spending increased (Figures 3.22), and ﬁ scal 
deﬁ cits were growing. Wage growth was also high 
in both countries, contributing to a decline in 

employment in the Netherlands (Figures 3.23 and 
3.24). In Sweden, growth was also held back by 
reliance on relatively low value-added industries, 

the banking crisis in the early 1990s, and a stiﬂ
 ing 
tax system. Finally, the erosion of competitiveness 

also contributed to deterioration in current account 

balances. 
While each country’s reform package differed in 
details, both included the same mix: measures 

to correct macroeconomic imbalances and 

measures to achieve comprehensive structural 

reforms.
 Both sets of measures were needed:

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE63Box 3.2 Labor Market Reform: The Experience of the Netherlands in the 1980s–1990s1Triggered by poor economic performance in the 1970s and early 1980s, the Netherlands undertook a series of 
labor market reforms that resulted in strikingly rapid employment growth. Excessive wage growth in the 1970s 

and early 1980s had led to a decline in private sector employment, as investment and job growth slowed. When 

unemployment shot up sharply from 1979 onward, in a recession that was much deeper than elsewhere, 

a consensus for reform gradually emerged.
Labor market reforms started in earnest in late 1982 with an agreement between unions and employers to pursue 
wage moderation in exchange for employment creation (the “Wassenaar agreement”). The agreement abolished 

automatic price indexation—not only in new wage agreements but also in existing wage agreements.
Subsequent governments implemented a series of labor market and ﬁ
 scal reforms that complemented and 
reinforced each other.
• The level of the real minimum wage was reduced sharply. It was ﬁ
 rst cut by 3 percent and subsequently frozen 
in nominal terms for many years. As a result, by 1997, the real minimum wage had declined by 22 percent from 

its 1979 peak. The youth minimum wage was reduced even more sharply.
• Civil servants’ salaries were subject to the same cuts and freezes as the minimum wage and declined in real 
terms by about the same percentage.
• The social security beneﬁ
 ts replacement rate was cut signiﬁ
 cantly. Wage-related unemployment, sickness, and 
disability beneﬁ ts were cut from 80 percent of wages to 70 percent; and the duration of unemployment and 
disability beneﬁ ts was shortened. The minimum beneﬁ
 t, which is linked to the minimum wage, fell substantially 
in real terms.
• To support wage moderation, taxes and social security contributions paid by employees were cut substantially. 
As a result, disposable incomes rose substantially even in the absence of real wage increases.
• To ﬁ
 nance the tax cuts, the government cut primary public expenditures by 14 percentage points of GDP. 
As a result, the government managed to reduce taxes and the budget deﬁ
 cit at the same time. The budget 
balance changed from a deﬁ
 cit of 6.2 percent of GDP in 1982 to a surplus of 2.2 percent in 2000.
The reforms contributed to a rapid increase in employment. Employment grew from 1984 onward, initially at 
a moderate rate, and accelerated further with the strong economic performance in the 1990s, helped as well by 

substantial ﬁ nancial sector and product market reforms. Employment growth largely beneﬁ
 ted new entrants to 
the labor market, including recent graduates and women. The youth unemployment rate dropped sharply, from 

a peak of 25 percent in 1985 to 6¼ percent in 2008—the lowest rate in the European Union. The labor force 

participation of women rose sharply. Although most women worked part-time, this phenomenon seems to reﬂ
 ect 
cultural preferences rather than government policies. 
Further reforms were undertaken in the last decade that reduced the generosity of the unemployment insurance 
and disability insurance programs. Also, tax rules were changed to stimulate working for second earners, and 

the tax advantages for early retirement were abandoned. During this period of reforms, the number of beneﬁ
 t 
recipients was reduced substantially and labor force participation rates increased.

64Box 3.3 Sweden: Structural Reforms in the 1990sThe banking and ﬁ
 nancial crisis of the 1990s in Sweden triggered far-reaching macroeconomic and structural 
reforms that set the stage for Sweden’s higher output growth in the late 1990s and 2000s. The reforms involved 

restoring a credible macroeconomic policy framework, and included a battery of structural reforms in the 

product and labor markets. 
The ﬁ
 rst step in the aftermath of the crisis was to restore a credible, rule-based macroeconomic policy 
framework. This included: (i) the establishment of an inﬂ
 ation target in 1993 resulting in a drop in inﬂ
 ation (from 
an average of 7.5 percent in 1980–1990 to about 1.5 percent in 1993–2000); (ii) an impressive and successful ﬁ
 scal 
consolidation, with the general government debt-to-GDP ratio falling from 72.5 percent in 1994 to 53 percent in 

2000, the government expenditures-to-GDP ratio falling by about 16 percentage points between 1993 and 2000, 

and the budget balance turning into a surplus in 1998 from a double-digit deﬁ
 cit in 1993; (iii) the introduction of 
a detailed ﬁ scal framework, including a nominal expenditure ceiling for the central government, a structural 
budgetary surplus target for the general government, and a balanced budget requirement for local governments, 

which helped the government to run a budget surplus every year between 1998 and 2008, except for 2002 and 

2003; and (iv) a comprehensive pension reform put into effect in 1999. The new and more stable macroeconomic 

framework greatly improved policy credibility, thereby contributing to more moderate wage agreements. 

Moreover, the stronger public ﬁ
 nances enabled some reduction in the high tax burden. 
Successive reforms were implemented to improve labor market outcomes. 

• In 1991, a comprehensive tax reform was implemented to mitigate the negative effects of the growing welfare 
state on labor supply. The reforms aimed at shifting the tax burden from labor income to consumption and 

capital income. The measures included lowering the marginal tax rates on earned income, widening the tax base, 

eliminating tax shelters, and introducing a more uniform taxation of capital. It is estimated that the tax reform 

led to an increase in labor supply of about 2 percent.
1• In 1997, a new agreement was reached by industrial labor unions to restrain wage increases. The consensus 
followed an unprecedented increase in the unemployment rate after the crisis (from 1.7 percent in 1990 to 

9.4 percent in 1994). The agreement established explicit rules concerning the regulation of negotiations and the 

resolution of disputes; reintroduced more coordination in wage bargaining; and re-established the pacesetting 

role of the sectors exposed to international competition. 
• Other complementary reforms targeted training, work incentive, employment protection, and education. These 
included a reorientation of active labor market policies toward training programs and/or practical insertion 

courses; relaxing employment security provisions; and to some extent, reducing the replacement rate in social 

insurance, and raising the qualiﬁ
 cation period for unemployment beneﬁ
 ts.
2Extensive reforms in the education 
system (primary to tertiary) were also conducted in the 1990s. 
Building on the successes of early deregulations, additional product market reforms further promoted 
competition and restructuring. Early deregulation and the promotion of competition in the late 1980s 

fostered rapid restructuring and large productivity gains in the export sector. In particular, deregulation in the 

telecommunication sector (Sweden being the ﬁ
 rst country in Europe to deregulate its telecommunications market) 
1 Agell and others (1998).
2 The generosity of the social security system, however, remained elevated compared with other European countries, whereas 
the level of employment protection was relatively low, in line with the concept of “flexicurity” also introduced in Denmark.

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE65painfully clear by the crises experienced in these 
two countries before their reforms.
From the start, structural reforms in these 
countries focused on clearing up the worst 

bottlenecks to growth. These bottlenecks 

manifested differently in different countries, so 

the initial priorities of reform also differed. In 

the Netherlands, a strong initial objective was 

to contain excessive wage growth and boost 
policies without structural reforms would only 
deliver low, albeit stable, growth—as Italy has 

experienced in recent decades (Box 3.4); on the 

other hand, structural reforms without good 

macroeconomic policies could lead to large 

swings in economic growth and make sustained 

high growth all but impossible.
20 This was made

stabilization attempt, because it reduces fiscal space.
helped to spur competition and establish mobile phone access throughout the country.
3Building on these early reforms, a new Competition Act and a new enforcement agency were created in 1993. After the EU accession 

in 1995, Sweden rapidly implemented all major directives of the internal market program and by 1998 was far 

ahead of many other EU countries.
4These rapid product market reforms led to efﬁ
 ciency gains and helped the 
manufacturing industry transform from traditional industries in the 1980s to more knowledge-intensive and less 

labor-intensive production in the 1990s, leading to higher productivity gains.
5 The restored macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, coupled with a strong IT sector, paved the way for 
growth, which averaged close to 3.5 percent between 1994 and 2007. With a more ﬂ
 exible labor market, a more 
competitive product market, and a strong IT sector, which Sweden was well positioned to capitalize on, it was 

able to emerge rapidly from the crisis when the international outlook improved. Wage growth restraint, improved 

macroeconomic stability, and higher productivity growth led to rapid growth in the export sector (notably the IT 

sector), which in turn became the main engine of growth. The real growth rate of export and labor productivity 

both doubled from the 1980s to the 1994–2008 period, rising from about 4 percent to 8 percent and from 
3 percent to 6 percent, respectively (see ﬁ
 gure). 
3 Other factors, such as early investment by Ericson and the public telecommunications monopoly in establishing a mobile 
network, a high level of expenditures in R&D, a highly skilled labor force, and several public incentives to the adoption of 

ICT, also contributed to the emergence of a strong high-tech sector in Sweden.
4 OECD (1998).5 In the 1980s, traditional industries such as steel, iron, and paper represented close to 20 percent of exports, whereas 
chemicals and telecom accounted for less than 9 percent. By the 1990s, the share of traditional industries had fallen to 

13 percent whereas chemicals and telecom represented more than 20 percent.

reform package was a wage agreement between 

employers and unions.
21 Sweden addressed 
its core problems through a combination of 

fiscal consolidation, tax reform, financial 

sector clean-up, and an overhaul of the wage 

bargaining system.  In addition, further 

liberalization of network industries and reduced 

barriers to competition provided room for 
21 In the Netherlands, labor market reforms were 
accompanied by efforts to privatize government stakes 

in high-profile enterprises (steel and airlines) and to 

allow the bankruptcy of a major loss-making shipbuilder 

(which had received substantial government support). 

Both of these efforts signaled a change in industrial 

policy. Additional product market reforms, such as 

liberalizing licensing requirements and introducing new 
competition laws that included anticartel measures, 

were introduced a few years later. In Sweden, the wage 

bargaining system was reformed by reintroducing more 

coordination in the wage bargaining process and by 

using wages in the tradable sector (exposed to global 

competition) as a benchmark for wage negotiations. The 

reform of the wage bargaining system was accompanied 

by other labor market reforms in 1997 and by a 

deregulation of product markets.

earlier reforms in the telecom sector, which 

had already contributed to the emergence of 

a strong telecom industry. Structural reforms 

were generally implemented in both the product 

and labor markets. Coordinated reforms helped 

countries reap complementary gains—although 

the exact sequencing reflected different 

priorities and political constraints.
22 Although reforms spanned more than a decade 
and took time to yield their full beneﬁ ts, they 
were successful, as per capita income in both the 

Netherlands and Sweden is now signiﬁ
 cantly higher 
22 It has been well documented that there are 
complementary gains from these reforms. For example, 

based on an OECD country panel from 1990–2004, 

Berger and Danninger (2005) find that lower levels of 

product and labor market regulation foster employment 

growth, including through sizable interaction effects, and 

note that unless deregulation costs are asymmetric across 
markets, optimal deregulation requires some form of 

coordination. There is also theoretical support for some 

sequencing of these reforms; for example, see Blanchard 

and Giavazzi (2003).
than in Germany (Figure 3.21), driven by strong 
growth in employment and higher productivity 

(Figures 3.24 and 3.25). In addition, there is a 
vibrant tradable sector, with exports increasing by 

17 percentage points and 19½ percentage points of 

GDP, respectively, in the Netherlands and Sweden 

(Figure 3.26).The United Kingdom provides another example 
of a country that
 undertook major reforms, which 
began in the late 1970s (Box 3.5). Those reforms 

helped reverse its relative decline in economic 

performance and set in motion a sustained 

improvement in income relative to Germany 

until 2005. The reforms contained many elements 

that were later adopted in the Netherlands and 

Sweden. In fact, reforms in the United Kingdom 

preceded most of the structural reform efforts in 

Europe since the 1980s. The United Kingdom’s 

macroeconomic policy, however, has been less 

countercyclical, and that has contributed to severe 

boom-bust cycles. Denmark also undertook very

 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
68Box 3.4 Why Has Italy Grown So Poorly in the Last 20 Years?In the last two decades, Italy’s growth has been disappointing (IMF, 2011d). By the late 1980s, Italy’s GDP was no 
longer catching up with the U.S. GDP. More recently, Italy suffered one of the largest output contractions in the 

euro area during the global ﬁ nancial crisis and is now experiencing one of the slowest recoveries. Per capita GDP, 
as well as productivity, was lower in 2010 than in 2000 (Figure 3.1).
Although Italy undertook various structural reforms during the period, they were not comprehensive enough to 
lift growth. During the period, manufacturing, banking, and public utilities were all either privatized or liberalized. 

These reforms contributed to higher productivity and proﬁ
 tability in the banking and manufacturing sector, but 
they were less successful in the public utilities sector, where reforms were either incomplete or failed to address 

additional bottlenecks.
1Labor market reforms eliminated full wage indexation, reduced central bargaining, 
promoted the use of temporary employment, and increased ﬂ
 exibility for new hires. However, failure to eliminate 
protections granted to workers with permanent contracts created a dual labor market. Successive pension reforms 

reduced entitlement and ﬁ scal outlays for the future. Recent regulatory reforms have attempted to re-organize 
public administration to increase its efﬁ ciency and transparency, but they are largely experimental and constrained 
by ﬁ
 scal cuts. 
Largely the result of underlying structural constraints, several interconnected and often endogenous factors 
explain why Italy’s growth performance lags by international comparison:
2• Inefﬁ
 cient public expenditure and a complex tax system hinder ﬁ
 scal consolidation and growth. Italy scores 
poorly in terms of the quality and efﬁ
 ciency of public expenditure, and it stands out among countries 
with the highest tax burden and lowest tax compliance (EC, 2009). Overall, progress on improving public 

expenditure has been limited, although some steps have been taken to improve the budget classiﬁ
 cation, 
institutionalize spending reviews, and reorganize public administration. Further ﬁ
 scal consolidation is 
constrained by the size of transfers to subnational governments, large entitlement programs, and the sizable 

interest expenditure. Finally, the tax system is unduly complex and prone to abuse. This limits labor utilization 

(see below), promotes evasion, and limits the ability to reduce the debt relative to GDP and attract FDI into 

the country.
• Labor productivity is low and falling. Limited labor market reforms have not prevented real wage growth 
from outpacing the modest productivity gains, causing unit labor costs to increase. Wage bargaining remains 

excessively centralized so that in effect, real wages in all sectors cannot fall and the ability to align them with 

productivity at the plant level is severely constrained.
3Increasingly, ﬁ
 rms are unable to compete with low-cost 
producers in the global market as Italy’s pattern of export specialization in low-skill labor-intensive goods has 

contributed to weak productivity growth.
4In addition, the ability to reabsorb the capital and labor released remain constrained by a poor regulatory and business environment. Finally, while low-skill immigrant workers 

have partly offset the negative impact of low labor participation (see below) and a rapidly aging society, it may 

also have contributed to a decrease in average productivity.
1 For instance, corporate governance practices imply that despite privatization, the government maintained de facto control of 
privatized companies though minority shares.
2 See IMF (2011f) for a detailed analysis on the product and labor market’s inefficiencies hampering growth.
3 The 2011 reform introduces flexibility in wage negotiations with unions at the plant level. In addition, it allows firms to go 
outside the national framework. In the future, this should help better align wages and productivity.
4 For such a specialization pattern, the power to pass prices to international markets is low, and international market shares ar
e lost in response to a wage growth that has outpaced productivity gains, hence, accelerating the loss of competitiveness.

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE69• Labor participation is low. For instance, the labor participation of women is constrained by the lack of a family 
policy and formal child care structures. In addition, old age participation is reduced by a pension system that 

until recently favored early retirement. In general, demand for labor is constrained owing to (i) skill mismatches 

between what the education system produces and the labor market demands (see below); (ii) a high tax wedge, 

especially for low-skilled workers; (iii) complex rules stemming from the aforementioned labor market reforms 

protecting insiders with permanent contracts at the expense of part-time and younger workers (and in turn 

encouraging a brain drain among young talent); (iv) lack of competition in the product market; and 

(v) stagnant growth.
• Innovation in new dynamic ﬁ
 rms is low. A series of factors hinder innovation by Italian SMEs (see ﬁ
 gure). 
Until recently, the barriers to business creation were signiﬁ
 cant, and the experience with “one-stop shops” 
(introduced in 2005) to reduce these barriers has been varied (OECD, 2009). In addition, until 2006, 

bankruptcy legislation also hindered exits, as entrepreneurs were exposed to risky criminal proceedings, putting 

personal wealth at risk. At present, the equity market is underused and venture capital market is slow to 

develop. This is partly due to a still embryonic market of institutional investors, lack of regulations encouraging 

investment in SMEs (Bongini and Impavido, forthcoming), and weak corporate governance practices, despite 

adopted regulations that follow OECD best-corporate governance practices (OECD, 2009). Indeed, the 

widespread use of pyramidal and cross-ownership structures gives insiders control that signiﬁ
 cantly exceeds 
their share in ownership and limits the effective rights of minority shareholders. In general, the high levels of 

public ownership, especially at the local level; regulatory barriers to competition; high administrative burden on 

ﬁ rms; and constraining regulations for professional services have all been factors contributing to Italy’s inability 
to attract FDI and limiting access to ﬁ nance innovation. These, in turn, have hindered the growth of ﬁ
 rms 
beyond the family-control threshold.
• Civil courts remain inefﬁ
 cient (OECD, 2009). Regulations aimed at protecting the privileges of judges and 
lawyers (in terms of pay and status) imply that the average duration of cases is the highest in Europe, although 

with important regional variations. Claims are usually settled out of court through private negotiations. The 

inefﬁ ciency of the civil justice system ampliﬁ
 es the problems caused by the aforementioned underdeveloped

• It is critical to correct macroeconomic imbalances.
 This is particularly crucial for those countries 

that are facing increasing market pressures to 

secure ﬁ scal sustainability (such as Hungary 
and Italy). A credible consolidation plan 
would reduce vulnerabilities. For Hungary, 

where government spending accounts for 

about half of GDP (a much larger share than 

in any of its regional peers) (Figure 3.27) 

and where government debt is high, a 

durable reduction in expenditures is needed unemployment, in part owing to its fairly liberal

23 See Gaard and Kieler (2005).24 Governments in Scandinavian countries (including 
Denmark and Sweden) promoted the “flexicurity” 

concept that combines high labor market flexibility 

in a dynamic economy with high social security for 

workers. This integrated strategy is becoming widely 

acknowledged as a way to preserve the European 

social model. The European Council of June 2009 

concluded that flexicurity is an important means to 

“increase adaptability, employment and social cohesion” 

(European Council, 2009).capital markets and weak corporate governance, and it represents another bottleneck keeping ﬁ
 rms from 
growing beyond the threshold below which family control is still an effective organizational form for enforcing 

contracts.
• Attainments in education are low (OECD, 2009, 2011). Although there are important regional variations, 
Italy ranked among the ﬁ
 ve worst OECD performers in the 2006 PISA tests, possibly because of the absence 
of a national standard test for secondary schools. The share of tertiary graduates in the labor force is just 

14 percent, only half the OECD average. Drop-out rates are high with only 45 percent of students entering 

tertiary education actually completing their studies, well below the 65 percent OECD average. Duration of 

studies at the university level is signiﬁ
 cantly higher than the OECD average as well (66 percent of students 
remain at the university beyond the normal duration of courses). This low performance is partly explained 

by the fact that universities are generally not allowed to select students; they are not autonomous in deﬁ
 ning 
curricula and hiring faculty; they are poorly governed with inadequate funding; and they lack accountability. In 

addition, they have poor human resources owing to the lack of performance-based careers and remuneration, 

and a system of nationwide public competition for academic positions that favors insiders (OECD, 2011; 

Perotti, 2008). As a result of these shortcomings, Italian universities often generate skill mismatches relative 

to what is demanded by the market; have a low contribution to human capital formation in general, thereby 

reducing labor utilization (see above); and worse, contribute little to R&D expenditure, hindering innovation. 

The new University Reform Act (Law 240/2010) aims to address many of the aforementioned shortcomings, 

but the reforms are still in their infancy.
• Finally, regulations at the regional and local levels reduce further the ﬂ
 exibility of domestic markets. In 
some sectors, such as commercial distribution, pharmaceuticals, and the transport sectors, regional and even 

municipal regulations add further complexity. For instance, (i) the proliferation of regional statutes creates 

inefﬁ ciencies; (ii) the process through which measures are enacted lacks transparency and statutes are not 
subject to evaluation to determine their costs to ﬁ
 rms, consumers, and the public administrations involved; 
(iii) commercial distribution is overregulated; and (iv) restrictions on market entry, both general and sectoral, are 

still rife.
55 However, recent reforms introducing tender requirements for a number of local public services should increase transparency 
and accountability and thereby encourage entry of qualified service providers.
Box 3.4 (concluded)3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE71(IMF, 2011c).
25 For Italy, reforms may include 
improving the efﬁ
 ciency of ﬁ
 scal expenditures 
and rationalizing the tax system to boost 
compliance and reduce the tax burden.• Initial reforms should focus on clearing the most 
restrictive bottlenecks.
 Reducing duality in the labor 
market by lowering preferential protections for 

those with permanent contracts is a priority for 

Italy and Spain. Another priority, particularly 

for Italy, is to overhaul the regulatory 

framework to uproot a deeply antimeritocratic 

system that hinders competition by protecting 

insiders in industry, education, and the services 

sector.
• Complementary ﬁ scal reforms boost the success of other 
structural reforms.
 Fiscal reforms could include 
reductions of the tax burden for labor, civil 

servant wage restraint, simpliﬁ
 cations of the 
tax system, and widening of the tax base, all 
25 This would include a rationalization of the public wage 
bill and social benefits as well as a restructuring of public 

transportation companies. The government has recently 

started a major program to achieve this objective.
of which would improve popular buy-in and 
chances of success of other reforms. 
• Implementing structural reforms is a long process.
 It is hard to get the right reforms in place 

in one stroke. Sometimes reform agendas 

develop gradually, in part because political 

economy considerations may suggest tackling 

problems sequentially. Reforms also take time 

to implement; for example, the privatization 

process in the United Kingdom took several 

years to complete. And reforms may need to be 

reﬁ ned in the course of their implementation 
as constraints change.
26• It takes time before reforms reap their full beneﬁ ts, 
and initially conditions can worsen.
 The Dutch 
reforms of the early 1980s took 10 years to 

come to full fruition. In Sweden, it was not 

until a decade after the reforms of the 1990s 

that a new peak performance was reached. 

In the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the 

labor market reform efforts, unemployment 

only began to fall sharply in the mid-1990s. 

Germany began serious wage moderation 

in 1995, but German GDP growth remained 

low for 10 years before export growth 

pulled the country out of its slump in 2005. 
26 In the Netherlands, for example, an initial wage 
agreement led to a rapid increase in employment, 

primarily reflecting the absorption of new entrants, 

including women. However, the percentage of the 

working-age population receiving benefits had remained 

high, because the stock of inactive workers had changed 

little, and this prompted the need for further reforms, 

such as tightening of eligibility criteria.

72Box 3.5 United Kingdom: Structural Reforms during the 1980s1In the late 1970s, poor economic performance in the United Kingdom made the environment conducive to 
far-reaching reforms. Decades of relative decline had been exacerbated by a major recession after the ﬁ
 rst oil 
shock in 1973, high inﬂ
 ation partly owing to wage pressures and increasing government spending, and further 
deterioration in the economic situation. A severe balance of payments crisis in 1976 exposed further the 

weaknesses in the existing economic structure and made it clear that something needed to change.
The Thatcher government, which took ofﬁ
 ce in 1979, and the following governments undertook sweeping 
structural reforms, including the following key elements:
• Reducing the state’s role in the economy. The state’s role was reduced through large-scale privatization of state-
owned enterprises and public housing, cuts in civil service employment, and pension reforms that reduced the 

relative value of state pension beneﬁ
 ts but created incentives to enroll in private pension schemes.
• Improving work incentives in beneﬁ
 t programs. Net unemployment beneﬁ
 ts were reduced by abolishing the 
earnings-related supplement, suspending beneﬁ
 ts’ statutory indexation, and making their taxation less favorable. 
Eligibility criteria for receiving unemployment and other beneﬁ
 ts were tightened. Job-seeking efforts were 
monitored via the 1986 “Restart Program,” which required biannual counseling for all unemployed.
• Reforming the tax system. The number of bands for marginal rates of personal income tax was reduced, while 
rates themselves were lowered. Exemptions were reduced or eliminated and the taxation of capital income was 

streamlined. The share of indirect taxes was increased, and corporate proﬁ
 t taxes were lowered while their base 
was broadened.
• Reforming trade unions to make participation more voluntary. Reforms included extending the grounds for 
refusing to join a union, introducing limits on picketing, prohibiting actions that force contracts with union 

employers, and weakening the closed-shop and union immunities.
• Liberalizing ﬁ
 nancial markets. Administrative measures curbing bank lending and lending by building societies 
were removed, and pricing for ﬁ
 nancial services was liberalized.
• Promoting entrepreneurship and self-employment. The government introduced measures to foster self-
employment, such as offering tax relief, facilitating bank borrowing for small companies, and establishing local 

agencies to counsel small businesses on planning, marketing, and design.
Unemployment was initially high, but growth and inﬂ
 ation began to improve in the early to mid-1980s, enabling 
the reforms to continue. Privatization also contributed to the rise in equity and home ownership, which may have 

created additional support for the reforms.
Although the impact of the reforms on economic performance remains subject to debate and some of the 
reforms remain controversial, there is consensus that the reforms contributed to halting the previous trend of 

relative decline in GDP levels per capita (for example, Card and Freeman, 2002; IMF, 2003), as the overall labor 

market and growth performance improved in the 1980s and 1990s. Microeconomic evidence—examining the 

impact of speciﬁ
 c reform efforts on ﬁ
 rm-level productivity—also suggests that structural reforms of the 1980s 
contributed to the United Kingdom’s improved relative productivity performance (Card and Freeman, 2002).

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE73Research on a wider set of reform cases 
suggests that the cumulative gains in growth 

achieved from structural reforms in the 

trade, product market, and labor market areas 

are positive. However, they predominantly 

materialize only over the long term because 

they involve costly and painful reallocations 

of resources.
27• Reforms need to adapt as constraints evolve. 
As constraints are relaxed gradually and 

sequentially, new bottlenecks to growth 

may emerge in complicated and sometimes 

unpredictable ways. Countries therefore need 

to be prepared to shift and adapt the focus of 

their reforms.
The current reform agenda in Greece and Portugal 
largely follows the strategies of the early reformers. 

The response to the global ﬁ
 nancial crisis has 
been a consensus on the need for comprehensive 

reforms in a short timeframe. Under the 

EU-IMF-supported programs, Greece and 

Portugal have adopted ﬁ
 scal consolidation and 
structural reforms in product, services, and labor 

markets. In Greece, for example, the ﬁ
 scal deﬁ
 cit 
was targeted to shrink by 12¾ percentage points 

of GDP between 2009 and 2014 through cuts in 

wages and other spending and overarching tax 

reforms. Greece has begun to undertake strong 

labor market reforms; pension reforms; reforms 

to open up closed professions; reforms to simplify 

procedures for start-up and licensing; reforms in 

the approval processes for large investments; and 

reform of the education system. It also has plans 

for ambitious privatizations and judicial reforms. 

Its ﬁ scal reform includes plans to reduce the high 
tax wedge on labor. In Portugal, growth and job 

creation take center stage. Portugal’s reforms 

address the country’s fundamental problem—low 

growth—with a policy mix based on restoring 

competitiveness through structural reforms, a 

balanced ﬁ scal consolidation path, and ﬁ
 nancial 
stabilization. In addition to ﬁ scal consolidation, 
reforms include a ﬁ
 scally neutral reduction in 
labor taxes.
27 See IMF (2004).Extending the European Growth Frontier  Implementing reforms would both bring more 
countries closer to the European technology 

frontier and bring the European frontier itself 

closer to the United States. In 2010, average 

GDP per capita (purchasing power parity—

PPP) in the EU was only 64 percent of the 

U.S. level, and only 85 percent for the three 

richest EU countries (Austria, the Netherlands, 

and Sweden) (Figure 3.28). The higher income 

in the United States is largely explained by its 

higher labor productivity—particularly in the 

information and communications technology 

(ICT) sector and services. In 2010, the level of 

employment of the United States was similar to 

that of Europe, although the number of hours 

worked per employee is still higher in the United 

States (Table 3.1).
28,29 Part of the difference in 
productivity levels can be attributed to lower 

human capital in ICT-related sectors and 

services (Figure 3.30). The large productivity 

gap in services also reﬂ
 ects a generally more 
regulated service sector in Europe 

(Figure 3.31).3028  Although Europe is catching up with the United States 
with slightly higher growth (for the period 1995–2010, 

EU15 average annual growth was 1.8 percent compared 

with 1.4 percent in the United States), its TFP growth 

is still below that of the United States. Compared with 

the United States, advanced EU economies have higher 

productivity growth in manufacturing, but lag behind in 

the ICT and services sectors (Figure 3.29).
 29  Gordon (2011) suggests that lower hours worked 
in Europe are due to high labor taxes, high minimum 

wages, and tight product market regulations. 
30  Gordon (2007) notably suggests that regulatory 
barriers and land-use regulations inhibiting the 

development of large retailers (such as Wal-Mart) as 

well as corporatist institutions designed to protect 

incumbent producers partly explain the lower labor 

productivity level in Europe compared with that of 

the United States.

outcomes, the United States also far exceeds 

Europe in patents granted per capita.

Centre on Innovation and Technology (2011). 
32 As suggested by Gordon (2007), the environment 
is more favorable for innovation in the United States 

than in Europe, notably owing to an openly competitive 

system of private and public universities, government 

subsidies to universities based on peer-reviewed research 

grants rather than unconditional subsidies for free 

undergraduate tuition, strong patent protection, and a 

flexible financial infrastructure making available venture 

capital finance to promising innovations.

 innovation processes.

78Box 3.6 EU State Aid Policy and Industrial PolicyA key objective of EU industrial policy is to alleviate market failures. The policy is motivated by the need to 
correct market failures, such as (i) externalities in R&D investments; (ii) asymmetries of information in SME 

development; and (iii) agglomeration and network externalities as well as strategic trade considerations justifying 

sector-speciﬁ
 c, cluster-speciﬁ
 c, or “national champion”-speciﬁ
 c support.
Current EU industrial policy is largely focused on horizontal measures—measures that target the economy as 
a whole—rather than on measures that support individual industries or ﬁ
 rms. Aid is delivered mainly through 
horizontal measures for upstream R&D, such as support for R&D, SME development, education, environmental 

protection, and energy saving. 
State aid to individual sectors or ﬁ
 rms (“vertical support”) has been decreasing in the EU27 countries, falling 
from 1.1 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent of GDP between 1992 and 2007.
1These trends are the result of 
explicit policies limiting state aid in general, which is perceived as a threat to internal competition and integration, 

and policies limiting vertical support measures in particular, which are more prone to risk of capture by vested 

interests and rent-seeking, resulting in support to nonproductive “national champions.”
2A recent study (Aghion, Boulanger, and Cohen, 2011) suggests that capital market imperfections and credit 

constraints limiting the reallocation of ﬁ
 rms to new and more productive sectors justify a more active 
government intervention, with more direct support for sectors. Vertical support measures would have a stronger 

impact in countries and/or sectors closer to the technology frontier, but where bank credit is still the primary 

channel for company ﬁ
 nancing. Vertical measures are particularly effective when subsidies are targeted to highly 
contestable markets, as they force incumbent ﬁ
 rms to innovate to keep up with competition of new entrants. 
Sectoral aid also works better when it is not concentrated. In other words, aid that enhances competition within a 

sector by not focusing on single ﬁ
 rms or “champions” is more likely to be growth enhancing. 
1 It then increased to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2009 as a consequence of the support provided to the financial sector during the 
financial crisis.
2 In practice, however, horizontal support measures have not stopped vertical, sector-specific, state aid. On average, 70 percent
 of aid classified by the EU as horizontal is in fact awarded to the manufacturing sector (EIB, 2006), although a large variatio
n exists among member states. Indeed, there are numerous cases of state aid where the primary objective is horizontal but the 

aid is limited to a certain industry, subsector or firms. In particular, aid is often directed to key incumbent firms, or clust
ers of firms, that have established their reputation as innovators, consequently reducing the contestability of the market and, 

therefore, incentives to innovate (Aiginger and Sieber, 2005).

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE79when they are not concentrated in single ﬁ rms 
or “champions.”
36• Develop capital markets more generally. 
The bank-
centric nature of the ﬁ
 nancial system of most 
European countries may be another factor 

that is holding back innovation and growth 

(IMF, 2006). Both supply- and demand-side 

bottlenecks hamper the development of 

capital markets in Europe. On the supply 

side, constraints on capital market ﬁ
 nancing 
include corporate governance problems.
37 In particular, problems include the weak 

enforcement of shareholder rights against 

insider trading;38 the weak protection 
of creditor rights;
39 the concentrated 
shareholder ownership structure prevalent 

in most countries;40 and the general 
36 An example of these policies is the effort recently 
undertaken by France to support innovation and 

competitiveness. The tax credit for R&D activities 

(Crédit Impôt Recherche) provides generous incentives 

for research whereas the “Grand Emprunt” aims at 

supporting a variety of university-based and other 

research efforts in strategic sectors such as green energy, 

life science, and digital society and at promoting the 

creation and the financing of innovating (small and 

medium-sized enterprises—SMEs). Agencies and 

committees have also been set up to ensure objective 

allocation and efficient management of the funds. 

However, although spurring innovation has the potential 

to increase competitiveness and growth, the cost 

effectiveness of these measures needs to be evaluated 

within an appropriate timeframe. Strict adherence to 

rigorous governance standards is needed to ensure 

efficient and productive investments. In addition, other 

obstacles to innovation should be evaluated, such as 

those possibly arising from the relative paucity of 

medium-sized firms.
37 Only Switzerland has a capital market comparable 
in relative terms to that of the United States, whereas 

the euro area capital markets tend to be smaller and on 

average comparable in size with the Japanese capital 

market.
38 In particular, in Austria, Greece, Luxembourg, and the 
Netherlands (Djankov and others, 2007, 2008).
39 In particular, in France, Greece, Ireland, Portugal,

2008).40 With the exception of Ireland, Netherlands,

others, 2007).
absence of institutional investors among 
large shareholders.
41 On the demand side, 
constraints include weak judicial systems 

in enforcing private contracts,
42 which 
discourage ﬁ
 rms from growing beyond the 
family-controlled scale.
43 Developing capital 
markets further is particularly important given 

the continued deleveraging by banks. With 

constrained access to credit for innovative 

ﬁ rms, reforms aimed at diversifying the source 
of ﬁ
 nance, especially for small start-up SMEs, 
could boost growth. Key areas of reforms 

include strengthening corporate governance 

rules and practices to encourage external 

private equity and venture capital ﬁ
 nance; 
promoting the development of institutional 

investors to increase the supply of risky 

capital; and reforming the judicial system to 

encourage growth of family-owned SMEs.
• Reduce the corporate tax burden in the context of a 
broader tax base. 
This could stimulate innovation 
in established ﬁ rms—particularly in countries 
with less-developed markets for risk capital. 

Indeed, there is empirical evidence that for 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and 

Development (OECD) countries, corporate 

tax has a disproportionately negative impact 
41 With the exception of countries such as Ireland, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom 

(Hartmann and others, 2007).
42 Especially in Greece and Italy (Box 3.4).
43 A family-owned structure does not hinder productivity 
growth and innovation. The German “Mittelstand” 

(Germany’s legion of small and medium-sized family 

firms contributing to 50 percent of GDP) is often 

seen as a good structure for innovation owing to its 

enviable distribution network, close partnerships with 

researchers at universities, highly skilled labor force, 

efficient supplier clusters around large manufacturers, 

harmonious employer-employee relationships, and high 

contribution (about 30 percent) to total exports that have 

not benefited SMEs in other countries such as France 

or Italy. However, even German SMEs find the need 

to hire foreign staff and raise new capital, perhaps via 

private equity, as a way to compete with firms abroad 

(Linneman, 2007). REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE

 rms.
44 In addition, reducing corporate taxes could also 

encourage innovation in the most dynamic and 

proﬁ table ﬁ
 rms.
45 Because more proﬁ table 
ﬁ rms are better able to ﬁ
 nance R&D—
particularly in countries with less-developed 

markets for risk capital—lowering the effective 

corporate tax rate could allow such ﬁ
 rms 
to invest more in R&D.
46 Finally, it could 
also attract more FDI, which tends to bring 
44  See Johansson and others (2008), which shows 
that investment is adversely affected by corporate 

taxation. This is likely to have depressed TFP growth or 

innovation because of less spending on R&D and less 

FDI. In addition, these authors show that (i) employer 

and employee social security contributions have a more 

negative influence on TFP in industries that are relatively 

more labor intensive; (ii) top marginal personal income 

tax rates have a more negative effect on TFP in sectors 

characterized by high firm entry rates; and (iii) TFP in 

growing firms that are in the process of catching up 

with the technological frontier is particularly affected by 

corporate taxes, as these firms have on average a larger 

tax base.
45  Molagoda and Perez (2011) found evidence that, 
in addition to human capital and the degree of 

market regulation, corporate tax rate (interacting with 

profitability) and trade openness affect TFP growth, 

based on data for EU13 and the United States for the 
period 1980–2007.46  The effect of corporate taxes is possibly negligible 
for young and small firms (which include a large share 

of start-ups), as they tend to have low or zero profits, 

even in highly profitable industries. The higher corporate 

tax rate in the United States, with the more developed 

market for risk capital, may explain why a much higher 

share of innovation is done by new firms.
more productivity gains to domestic ﬁ
 rms. 
The reduction in the tax burden should be 

combined with reforms to broaden the tax 

base and reduce loopholes.
• Reduce regulation of services. 
Relative to the United 
States, some European countries, including 

Germany, have a more heavily regulated service 

sector. In these countries, further liberalization 

could deliver quick gains in productivity 

growth.
• Improve higher education and university-industry 
collaboration. Europe’s ability to innovate 
relies on the quality of its higher education 

(for example, human capital in ICT or the 

number of engineers and scientists) and its 

scientiﬁ c research institutions. While more 
public funding may help, there should also be 

reforms in the governance of universities and 

other higher education institutions to increase 

their ability to attract funding and invest 

in R&D, as it has been recently attempted 

in Sweden (Box 3.7).
47 Finally, measures 
to encourage more university-industry 

collaboration, such as those to encourage the 

commercialization of university-held patents

3. LONG-TERM GROWTH DIFFERENTIALS WITHIN EUROPE81Box 3.7 Promoting Research and Innovation: Sweden’s Research and Innovation Bill (2008)In recent years, the Swedish government has clearly identiﬁ
 ed innovation as the key competitive factor in a 
knowledge-based economy, and has sought to maintain its position as one of the innovation leaders in Europe 

through public policy. In the 2008 Research and Innovation Bill,
1the government introduced several new features 
that attempt to improve the quality of publicly funded research. They include the following:
• Linking funding to the quality of academic and research institutions. In a departure from old practices, quality, 
as measured by publications, references to publications, and external research funding (including industry 

contracts), determines how much public funding each university or higher education institution receives. This 

has introduced an element of competition and has tied public funds to those institutions that have proven 

ability in attracting external funds—an indication of strong research relevance.
• Promoting the commercialization of research. The government presented an initiative to increase the 
commercialization of research results. Dedicated funding is allocated for this purpose. Innovation ofﬁ
 ces have 
been set up at a number of higher education institutions.
• Boosting funding for strategic research with active industry participation. The bill planned a permanent, annual 
increase in funding to research in a number of strategically important areas, such as medicine, new technology 

(IT), and environment (energy). Sectoral R&D programs are based on calls for proposals in selected areas and 

involve active industry participation.
1 Sweden’s 2008 Research and Innovation Bill sets the framework for central government-funded research for the coming four 
years.

834. East-West Economic and Financial Linkages in Europe
Trade and ﬁ nancial linkages between Western Europe and 
Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) 

have increased sharply over the past one and a half 

decades.
48 Production chains of Central Europe have 
become integrated with those of Germany, and Western 

European banks have come to dominate banking systems 

in most CESEE countries. As a result, east-west spillovers 

have become much stronger and no longer go from west to 

east only. Financial shocks and trade shocks have become 

interdependent, with shocks to credit ﬂ ows in one direction 

quickly followed by shocks to trade ﬂ ows in the other 

direction.
This chapter takes stock of the economic and 
ﬁ nancial ties between CESEE and Western Europe 
and assesses the associated spillovers. The ﬁ
 rst 
section documents stylized facts about trade, foreign 

direct investment (FDI), and banking linkages 

between the two parts of Europe. It goes on to 

quantify how shocks originating in Western Europe 

affect economic developments in CESEE and vice 

versa. A ﬁ
 nal section offers policy conclusions.
Stylized FactsThe economies of Europe are highly open 
and strongly trade-integrated with one another. 

Trade in goods is equivalent to about 60 percent of 

GDP—more than in any other region of the world, 
48 The Western Europe and CESEE regions closely 
match the regions referred to elsewhere in this report 

as advanced and emerging Europe, with important 

exceptions. Western Europe comprises Austria, Belgium, 

Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, 

Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, 

and Spain in the euro area; and Denmark, Iceland, 
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 

CESEE comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, 

Poland, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia in Central 

Europe; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in the Baltics; 
and Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, 

FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia in 

Southeastern Europe; and Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and 

Ukraine in the European CIS; and Turkey.
except for the Middle East and North Africa, 
where oil exports account for a large share of GDP 

(Figure 4.1). Three-fourths of European trade is 

trade within Europe, making its intraregional trade 

the largest of all regions in terms of GDP, as well 

as relative to total trade.
Western Europe dominates intra-European trade. 
The bulk of European trade takes place within 

Western Europe, and Western Europe is CESEE’s 

premier export market. In 2010, Western European 

nations exported goods worth 18.5 percent of 

GDP to other Western European nations—more 

than twice as much as they exported to the rest 

of the world and far more than the 3.3 percent of 

GDP that went to CESEE (Figure 4.2). Conversely, 

Western Europe is easily CESEE’s main trading 

partner, ahead of trade within CESEE, owing to its 

larger economic size.
CESEE’s importance has increased rapidly. 
Economic and ﬁ nancial ties between the countries 
of Europe have become much stronger since the 

mid-1990s. The general globalization trend was 

accentuated by the liberalization of the economies 

in CESEE, the eastward expansion of the EU, the 

deepening of integration within the EU, and closer 

ties of the EU with non-members in the region. 

Moreover, the economies of CESEE grew much

84for Western European imports has also increased 
rapidly, although it remains less important in that 

role than the Asia and Paciﬁ
 c region. CESEE 
sources a rapidly growing share of its own imports 

from the Asia and Paciﬁ
 c region, which now 
accounts for 15 percent of all CESEE imports, 

up from 6 percent in 1995.Trade interconnectedness—Europe as a whole Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands are the 
economies most tightly connected through trade 

linkages with the rest of Europe, but Hungary 

and Poland have begun to play important roles 

too. Trade interconnectedness is gauged by an 

index that takes into account trade ﬂ
 ows relative 
to economic size, import and export market 

shares relative to what would be expected on 

the basis of relative economic sizes, and trade 

ﬂ ows in absolute terms. For each country, 
it is measured by averaging that country’s 

interconnectedness with all its partner countries 

in Europe or a subregion.49 Looking at all 
49 Section (a) of the Annex describes in greater detail  
the construction of the trade interconnectedness index, 
faster than those of Western Europe, lifting their 
relative economic weight to almost 30 percent of 

Western Europe (Figure 4.3).
Western Europe’s exports to CESEE are growing 
the fastest, and CESEE has become a more 
important export destination for Western Europe 

than the Asia and Paciﬁ
 c region or the Western 
Hemisphere (Figure 4.4). CESEE’s role as a source

EAST-WEST ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL LINKAGES IN EUROPE85Western Europe are still stronger than between 
Western Europe and CESEE (Table 4.1, column 2). 

Poland and the Czech Republic are the two CESEE 

countries with the closest trade connections with 
Western Europe, although Russia is also important 

owing to its sizable energy trade. The importance 

of Central Europe, the Baltics, and Russia is also 

apparent from their relatively high trade in relation 

to their own GDP and/or that of their trading 

partners alone (Tables 4.2 and 4.3).
Among countries of Western Europe, Austria, 
Germany, and Italy are most enmeshed with 

CESEE through trade. Nevertheless, in trade with 

CESEE countries, economies from CESEE itself 

are again the most trade interconnected (Table 4.1, 

column 3), with Hungary, Russia, and Slovenia 

more involved in trade with CESEE than any 

country in Western Europe. The importance of 

Austria, Germany, and Italy is already apparent 

from their sizable trade with CESEE relative to 

their GDP. Trade between Germany and CESEE 
intraregional trade in Europe, Western European 
economies are the ones most tightly connected 

in this way with their partner countries across 

the continent. Belgium, Germany, Italy, and 

the Netherlands come out on top (Table 4.1, 

column 1). However, Hungary and Poland also 

have leading positions and, indeed, score higher 

than many Western European economies.
Trade interconnectedness—East-West Among countries of CESEE, those located in 

Central Europe and the Baltics are the most 
intertwined with Western Europe through trade. 

Focusing on trade ﬂ
 ows with Western Europe,  
other countries from Western Europe (rather than 

from CESEE) show the highest degree of trade 

interconnectedness, indicating that trade ties within

interconnectedness in IMF (2011a).Figure 4.4 CESEE and Western Europe: Import and Export Shares by Region, 1995–201016202481012Imports of Goods by Western Europe (from)

86Asia and North America, respectively, while newly 
industrialized countries and emerging markets in 
Asia, as well as Canada and Mexico, specialize in 

downstream activities.
51Germany and Central Europe hold key positions in cross-border 
production chainsProduction chains between Western Europe and 
CESEE run primarily between Central Europe and 

Germany. The extent of intermediate goods trade 

varies dramatically between the different parts of 

CESEE and Western Europe. It exceeds 10 percent 

of GDP in the case of Central Europe and is also 

substantial in the Baltics (Figure 4.7). Its role is 
more subdued for Southeastern Europe and low

Russia. However, this primarily reflects Russian 

exports of energy and raw materials rather than critical 

intermediate goods.
corresponds to 10.6 percent of CESEE’s GDP and 
12 percent of Germany’s GDP. For Austria, trade 

with CESEE is equivalent to 16.6 percent of its 

GDP.
Cross-border production chains Cross-border production chains appear to play 

an important role in Europe, but there is little 

evidence that they are being ramped up there 
as they are in Asia. The importance of cross-

border production chains can be measured by the 

size of trade in intermediate goods.
50 In intra-European trade, they account for about 7 percent 

of GDP, which is higher than in Asia or in North 

America (Figure 4.5). However, this share has 

remained largely constant over time, in contrast 

to Asia, where it has been growing rapidly as the 

international division of labor has taken off (IMF, 

2010d). This picture does not change dramatically if 

one focuses on trade between Western Europe and 

CESEE. Again, the share of intermediate goods 

trade remains rather constant over time (Figure 4.6).
Within the European cross-border production chain, Western Europe occupies an upstream 

position, that is, it contributes predominantly 

core components rather than specializing in ﬁ nal 
assembly. According to a study by Koopman 

and others (2010), the indirect exports of the 

old EU member states (the EU-15), representing 

exports used by importing countries to produce 

goods for export to third countries, are more 

important than the imported contents embodied 

in their exports. By contrast, for the EU’s new 

member states (NMS), the relative importance 

of indirect exports and imports embedded in 

exports is reversed. In other words, on balance, 

EU-15 countries take the upstream position of the 

production chain, while the NMS occupy a more 

downstream position (Table 4.4). Similarly, Japan 

and the United States hold upstream positions in 50 Intermediate goods are the sum of the following 
categories in the Comtrade statistics: processed nonfuel 

industrial supplies (BEC 22), parts and accessories for 

capital goods (BEC 42), and parts and accessories for 

transportation equipment (BEC 53).

90Europe does not act simply as an assembly 
location. Nevertheless, Germany supplies more 

intermediate inputs. This pattern of production 

chains broadly applies to electrical equipment and 

other machinery as well.
FDI of Western Europe in CESEE is 
sizable, further boosting East-West tradeFDI also binds the economies of Western Europe 
and CESEE together. While the FDI of CESEE 

countries in Western Europe is negligible, its ﬂ
 ow 
in the other direction became substantial as CESEE 

economies liberalized, state-owned enterprises were 

put up for sale, their domestic markets became 

attractive for retail activity, and cross-border 

productions chains were set up. FDI in CESEE 

comes almost exclusively from Western Europe and 

reaches a considerable size, especially in Bulgaria, the 

Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and the Slovak 

Republic (Figure 4.8). Over time, the destinations of 

this investment changed as the appeal of Southern 

Europe started to pale in comparison with that of 

CESEE. For example, German FDI ﬂ
 ows into 
CESEE were strong during 2007–10, but negative in 

Portugal (Figure 4.9).
FDI linkages tend to reinforce and cement trade 
linkages over time. FDI in the tradable sector 

boosted CESEE’s imports and exports. A sizable 

part of FDI was directed toward the tradable sector 

as ﬁ rms from Western Europe outsourced parts 
of their production processes to CESEE. 

Once production facilities in CESEE came 
onstream, they sourced inputs from their western 

parents and shipped much of their output back to 

Western European markets. FDI in the nontradable 

sector did not boost CESEE’s exports, but did lead 

to increase of imports—at least in the short term.
Banking system linkages are strong—much of CESEE’s banking system 
is owned by Western European banksFinancial linkages of Western Europe with CESEE 
increased rapidly from 2003 onward. Western 
for the European CIS countries. From Western 
Europe’s perspective, intermediate goods are much 

more prominent in Germany’s trade than in that of 

other Western European countries. The growing 

importance of cross-border production chains for 

Central Europe and Germany is also reﬂ
 ected in 
a high rate of import growth relative to domestic 

demand growth in these countries.
Cross-border production between Germany and 
Central Europe primarily involves transportation 

equipment and capital goods, which account 

for more than half of the trade between these 

countries. For automobiles, which account for 

14 percent of German exports to Central Europe 

and 18 percent of Central Europe’s exports to 

Germany, two-thirds of German exports are 

parts and components, whereas the remaining 

third is ﬁ nal vehicles. For Central Europe, the 
composition is about 50 percent each. Production 

chains are highly interwoven and Central

banking systems, their operations in the region 

make up only a small fraction of Western Europe’s 

banking systems, and their asset exposure to 

CESEE represents less than 3 percent of their 

assets on average (Figure 4.12). Only the CESEE 

operations of Austrian and Greek banks are 

considerable relative to their domestic banking 

systems, corresponding to about 30 percent 

and 15 percent of their assets, respectively. The 

funding of banks in the west from CESEE 

sources, mainly in the form of nonbank deposits, 

is also small relative to the funding provided by 

Western European banks to CESEE and especially 

relative to the size of Western Europe banking 

system assets.
The expansion of Western European banks in 
CESEE boosted Western Europe’s exports. Much 

of the ample ﬁ
 nancing that was made available 
by Western Europe’s banks to CESEE during the 

boom period of 2003–08 was spent on imports 
banks acquired subsidiaries in CESEE to which 
their head ofﬁ ces would extend ample ﬁ
 nancing for 
local credit expansion. Direct cross-border lending 
to nonbanks in CESEE also took off. As a result, 

exposure of BIS-reporting banks, most of them 

headquartered in Western Europe, became large 

relative to the size of CESEE banking systems, 

easily exceeding 50 percent of local banking system 

assets in a number of countries (Figure 4.10). 

The importance of Western Europe’s banks to 

CESEE is even greater when the locally funded 

assets of Western European-owned subsidiaries 

are also taken into account. According to that 

yardstick, Western Europe’s banks account for the 

vast majority of banking sector assets everywhere 

in CESEE, except in Turkey and the European CIS 

countries (Figure 4.11). Austrian-owned, French-

owned, and Italian-owned banks are particularly 

active in CESEE.
Reverse ﬁ
 nancial linkages from CESEE to 
Western Europe are much less pronounced.

52 Similarly, because 
buoyant ﬁ
 nancing from western banks during 
2003–08 played a pivotal role in CESEE’s economic 
boom, the sudden end of that ﬁ
 nancing from late 
2008 helped plunge the economies of CESEE into 

a deep recession (Bakker and Gulde, 2010). 
52 During 2003–08, Germany’s GDP grew by an 
annual average of 1.9 percent. In 2009, it contracted by 

5.1 percent. The quantifications of the contributions 

from exports to CESEE are meant to give a sense of 

the orders of magnitude involved. They do not take

from Western Europe. The more ﬁ
 nancing 
CESEE countries received from western banks, 

the stronger their imports from Western Europe 

grew. An estimated 57 cents per euro of western 

bank ﬁ nancing ended up being spent on imports 
from Western Europe (Figure 4.13). The boom 

period boosted trade and ﬁ nancial exposure at the 
same time, just as the slump in the wake of the 

global ﬁ nancial crisis dealt a simultaneous blow to 
both.Spillovers and Quantiﬁ cations
Economic and ﬁ nancial linkages between the two 
parts of Europe are obviously signiﬁ
 cant, but what 
can be said about the strength of spillovers from 

economic developments in Western Europe to 

CESEE and vice versa? Europe’s experience in the 

run-up to and the aftermath of the global ﬁ
 nancial 
crisis suggests that spillovers are large. For example, 

exports to CESEE lifted Germany’s annual export 

growth during 2003–08 from 6½ percent to 

8¼ percent, thereby directly adding ¾ percentage 

points to GDP growth. And in the 2009 recession, 

exports to CESEE worsened the contraction of 

Germany’s exports from 16¼ percent to 12¼ 

percent. This directly added 1¾ percentage points

Spillovers through the trade channel are 
considerable, ranging from 0.3 percent to 2.4 

percent additional growth in individual countries 

for a 1 percent growth shock in the rest of Europe. 

The quantiﬁ
 cation exercise ﬁ
 rst estimates the 
effect of an output shock on countries’ imports 

and then calculates the effect on partner countries’ 

exports using historical trade shares. Their export 

multipliers are set equal to 1—essentially assuming 

that income effects are offset by higher imports of 

ﬁ nal goods and intermediate inputs embedded in 
exports.
53 On this basis, spillovers can be quite high, 
especially for small, highly-open economies, such as 

Malta and Moldova.
54 Larger economies that have 
considerable trade relations with non-European 
countries, such as Russia and Turkey, are subject to 

much lower spillovers (Figure 4.14). Aggregation

than one-for-one.
This section offers three approaches for the 
quantiﬁ cation of spillovers. First, it quantiﬁ
 es the 
size of output spillovers through the trade channel 

based on import elasticities and the structure of 

bilateral trade relationships. Second, it employs a 

vector autoregression (VAR) framework to study 

the dynamics of growth shocks originating in 

one part of Europe on GDP in the other part of 

Europe. Third, it uses a dynamic panel regression 

to quantify the effects of a funding shock from

94seem to be in the same order of magnitude, 
although the effect on Central Europe has higher 
statistical signiﬁ cance (Figure 4.15, panel 2). 
A growth shock in CESEE has no signiﬁ
 cant 
effect on growth in Western Europe (Figure 4.15, 

panel 3). However, given the closer ties between 

Central Europe and Western Europe, a shock 

emanating from the former does have a statistically 

signiﬁ cant effect on the latter. Over time, growth in 
Western Europe is lifted by about one-third of the 

increase in growth in Central Europe (Figure 4.15, 

panel 4).Funding shocks from western banks have a big impact on credit in CESEEFunding from western banks has a strong impact 
on credit and domestic demand growth in CESEE. 

The exercise ﬁ

of credit expansion to changes in the exposure of

data on 15 countries in the region during 2003–10.56 Over time, about 80 percent of any exposure 

increase is found to translate into additional credit 
56 Suitable data for the other CESEE countries are not available. Section (d) of the Annex explains the 

methodology in more detail.
CESEE suggests that a 1 percent growth shock in 
Western Europe would add 0.4 percentage point 

to growth in CESEE. Conversely, a 1 percent 

growth shock emanating from CESEE would entail 

additional growth of just 0.1 percentage point in 

Western Europe.
Western growth shocks are felt one-for-one in the CESEEThe VAR framework conﬁ
 rms strong spillovers 
from Western Europe to CESEE, but reverse 

spillovers are manifest only when they emanate 

from Central Europe. The exercise explains 

growth in Western Europe and CESEE in terms 

of past growth in the two parts of Europe while 

controlling for growth in the rest of the world. It 

then studies the dynamic response of growth in one 

part of Europe to a growth shock in the other part 

of Europe.

would not materialize easily. Pressured western banks 

would in the ﬁ
 rst instance turn to support available 
at home, such as liquidity from the ECB against 

eligible collateral, emergency liquidity assistance 

from their central banks, and any government 

support schemes that would be put in place under 

the circumstances. Scope for obtaining funding from 

their subsidiaries in CESEE would be rather limited, 

as host supervisors would step in if compliance 

with liquidity and capital ratios of subsidiaries were 

at risk. Violations would ultimately lead to a painful 

loss of managerial control by parent banks. 
An adverse scenario would, however, likely trigger 
a renewed credit crunch, as western parent banks 

would persistently scale back their exposure to 

subsidiaries, and cross-border loans to nonbanks 

would be rolled over only sparingly. Moreover, 

unafﬁ liated banks in CESEE countries that rely 
heavily on wholesale funding could come under 

pressure. In sum, the outcome would not be 

unlike the experience during the global ﬁ
 nancial 
crisis in 2008/09 when CESEE escaped ﬁ nancial 
meltdown, and banking crises occurred only in the 
(Figure 4.16, panel 1). In a second step, the 
exercise considers the association of credit growth 

with domestic demand and GDP. Over time, 

a 1 percentage point increase in real credit growth is 

associated with a 0.35 percentage point increase in 

real domestic demand and a 0.28 percentage point 

increase in real GDP (Figure 4.16, panel 2). Putting 

the two steps together suggests that the ﬁ
 nancial 
spillovers from western banks to economic activity in 

CESEE are strong. Indeed, the ﬁ
 nancing provided by 
western banks during 2003–08 added 1½ percentage 

points to CESEE’s annual GDP growth according to 

these estimations.
57Despite the pivotal role of western banks in 

CESEE’s banking systems, several factors mitigate 

concerns that ﬁ
 nancial stability in CESEE would be 
at risk in an adverse scenario where western banks 

came under intense strain at home; for example, in 

the context of a sharp escalation of the tension in 

euro area debt markets. Multiple lines of defense in

can spill over as much as unfavorable ones 

can. However, it complicates macroeconomic 

policymaking, because when economies are 
buffeted by far-away shocks, traditional policy tools 

might become less effective and business cycles are 

ampliﬁ ed. For example, the guardians of ﬁ

to monitor possible repercussions for the domestic

been mutually beneﬁ
 cial and was rightly embraced

…and policymakers need to take noteEconomic policies need to be fully attuned 
to the presence of spillovers to be effective. 

This requires three things. First, a broader range 

of economic and ﬁ
 nancial developments needs 
to be monitored and the linkages and associated 

spillovers have to be properly understood. This way, 

the domestic repercussions from seemingly far-

away developments will not come as a surprise and 

can be addressed by domestic policies in a timely 
between ﬁ

exacerbate business cycles.
…as economies advance through cross-border integration…These policy challenges should not distract 
from the fundamental beneﬁ ts of economic and 
ﬁ nancial integration between Western Europe and 
CESEE. Tight integration is the result of economic 

liberalization and reform across CESEE, as well 

as in Western Europe, together with deliberate 

integration efforts as the EU expanded eastward.

to tools that are still effective in an interlinked 

economic setting. For instance, if traditional 

monetary policy could not contain the overheating 

associated with a foreign-funded credit boom, perhaps ﬁ scal tightening and prudential measures—
possibly coordinated with home supervisors—still 

could. Third, if linkages lead to an ampliﬁ

99Annex
(a) Constructing a Trade Interconnected ness Index
The trade interconnectedness index (TII) is the 
weighted average of indicators capturing the 

importance of bilateral trade between countries 

for a group of 
N countries. The weight reﬂ
 ects the 
closeness of trade relationships.
Speciﬁ cally, the TII for country 
i is  importance
ij, where importance
ij is the average of nine indicators gauging the 

importance of bilateral trade between country 
i and j, and closenessij is the measurement of how directly 
two countries trade with each other.
The 
importance
ij  indicator is composed of nine 
different criteria, eight of which measure the 

importance of imports and exports relative to an 

individual country’s economy as well as to that of 

trading partners. These include:
1. Mij/Yi and Mji/Yj2. Xij/Yi and Xji/Yj3. (Mij/Mi)/(Yj/Y¯~i) and (Mji/Mj)/Yi/Y¯~j)4. (Xij/Xi)/(Yj/Y¯~i) and (Xji/Xj)/Yi/Y¯~j),where Mij (Xij) is imports (exports) of country 
i from (to) country 
j; Mi (Xi) is imports (exports) 
of country 
i; Yi is GDP of country 
i; and Y¯~i  is aggregate GDP of all other countries except 

country 
i.These individual indicators take the value of 1 
(otherwise 0) when the underlying measurement 
exceeds the speciﬁ
 ed threshold, which is set at the 
75th percentile for each criterion.
For the ninth criterion, the indicator is based on the 
size of bilateral trade: (
Mij + Xij) relative to trade 
of all countries. For this indicator, the threshold is 

set at the 90th percentile to capture only substantial 
bilateral trade pairs.
The 
closenessij measurement is based on the notion of how directly countries are connected through 
trade. The construction of this measurement 
consists of two steps.
The ﬁ
 rst step is to specify what could be considered 
an important trade linkage. The analysis takes the 

view that a bilateral trade linkage between country 
i and country 
j is important if the 
importance
ij indicator takes the values of at least 
 (that is, 
four criteria speciﬁ ed above must be met). Then, 
two countries may be connected directly, or their 

connection may occur through third countries.
The second step is to count the distance between 
country 
i and country 
j, which in turn provides the 
value of 
closenessij, being deﬁ ned as the inverse of 
the shortest distance. For example, if two countries 

share an important bilateral trade linkage and are 

thus connected directly, the shortest distance is 1 

and the closeness is also 1. In contrast, if two 

countries are connected only through another 
country that has important trade linkages to both, 

the shortest distance is 2 and the closeness is ½.
Once both importance
ij and closenessij are constructed, 
the TII can be computed. This can be done for any 

speciﬁ c group of countries. For instance, when the 
degree of trade interconnectedness of Europe as 

a whole is of interest, the TII is calculated based 

on all European countries. On the other hand, 

when the degree of trade interconnectedness with 

Central Europe is of interest, the TII is calculated 

with respect to countries in Central Europe (that 
is, computing the weighted average of

ij where j represents all countries in Central Europe).
(b) Quantifying Output Spillovers through the Trade ChannelThe analysis aims at quantifying the magnitude of 
output spillovers through the trade channel based 

on the structure of bilateral trade relationships 

within the region.The analysis relies on two key assumptions. One is 
that the export multiplier (that is, the magnitude of 

output change due to export change) is equal to 1; 

thus, the analysis does not account for additional 
 REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: EUROPE
100major countries outside Europe are included in 
the VAR model to make sure that the estimated 

impulse responses purely reﬂ ect the spillovers 
between Western Europe and CESEE rather than 

reﬂ ecting similar responses to common global 
shocks.
For the purposes of this analysis, ROW includes 
the United States, emerging Asia (China, Hong 

Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, 

Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China, 

and Thailand), Japan and all other economies in the 

IMF’s global projection model (Argentina, Australia, 

Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Mexico, 

New Zealand, Peru, South Africa, and Venezuela). 

PPP-based weights are used to construct the 

aggregate growth rates of ROW. 
The following VAR models are estimated:

VAR-I: [
ROW
, WE, CESEE], andVAR-II: [
ROW
, WE, CE, CESEE excluding 
CE].The VAR-I system is estimated to study the 
spillovers between Western Europe and CESEE 

(Figure 4.15, left panels). The VAR-II model 

serves to examine the growth linkages between 

Western Europe and Central Europe (CE) on 

the one hand, and Western Europe and rest of 

CESEE, on the other hand (Figure 4.15, right 

panels).The identiﬁ
 cation of the estimated shocks is 
achieved using Cholesky decompositions (that is, 

standard recursive ordering), and results presented 

in the text used the ordering of the countries 
indicated above. Robustness analysis for the result 

employing the methodology proposed by Bayoumi 

and Swiston (2008) was also carried out. More 

speciﬁ cally, alternative orderings among countries 
were considered, and “averaged” impulse responses 

were calculated. The results are not affected by 

alternative orderings.
The model is estimated with ﬁ
 ve lags to ensure 
absence of autocorrelation in the estimated 

residuals. The results with four lags, which are more 

standard in the literature using quarterly data in 

the estimation of VAR models, yield quantitatively 

similar results. 
output spillovers within the economy, leakages of 
domestic demand to imports, and intermediate 

imports essential for production. Another is that 

additional output spillovers across countries are not 

considered.The analysis estimates the percentage change in 
output in country 
i owing to a 1 percent change in 
output in country 
j, which is denoted by 
si|j , where Yi and Yj are output in country 
i and j, respectively.
Based on the assumption of unitary export 
multiplier, the change in output in country 
i results 
from the change in exports from country 
i to 
country 
j (owing to a change in output in country 
j), 
which is, in fact, imports from country 
i by country 
j.Then, 
, where  is country 
j’s share of imports from 
country 
i and Mj  is imports of country 
j.Hence, 
si|j , where M is the output elasticity of imports, that is, 
. The value of 
si|j can be computed 
based on the structure of bilateral trade relationships 
reﬂ ected by 
, the relative output ratio 
Yj/Yi, the 
import to GDP ratio 
Mj/Yj, and the estimate for the 
output elasticity of imports 
M. This is simply the 
regression coefﬁ
 cient of the percentage change in real 
imports on the percentage change in real GDP.
The analysis calculates the values of 
si|j for countries in Europe as well as in the Asia and 

Paciﬁ
 c region. Figure 4.14 presents the magnitude 
of output spillovers as a result of a 1 percent 

increase in output in all other countries in each 

region. This is simply the sum of 
si|j over all 
countries j.(c) Growth Spillovers in a VAR FrameworkThe growth spillovers between Western Europe 
(WE) and CESEE are examined using a standard 

VAR framework containing quarterly real GDP 

growth for the sample period of 1997:Q2–

2011:Q1, controlling for growth shocks that 

originated in the rest of the world (ROW). All 
ANNEX101expansion in CESEE. The ﬁ
 rst stage Panel VAR 
model, estimated with country-speciﬁ
 c dummies 
using two lags, is as follows (for 
i = country index 
and t = 2003:Q1–2010:Q4):,where CYi,t is the quarterly change in private credit 
relative to GDP, and 
FYi,t  is the quarterly change 
of BIS-reporting banks’ exposure to CESEE banks 

relative to GDP.
PANEL VAR-II:

The second step of the analysis studies the 
relationship between real credit growth and real 

economic activity.
The second stage Panel VAR model, estimated 
with country-speciﬁ
 c dummies using two lags, is as 
follows (for 
i = country index and 
t = 2003:Q1–2010:Q4):,where Zi,t  is quarterly growth of real economic 
activity, and 
Ci,t  is quarterly growth of real private 
credit.(d) Credit SpilloversThe role of western bank lending to CESEE in 

the credit boom-bust cycles (Panel VAR-I) and the 

relationship between real credit growth and real 

economic activity growth (real GDP growth, real 

domestic demand growth, and real import growth) 

in CESEE (Panel VAR-II) are studied using a Panel 

VAR approach.
The baseline scenario considers 15 CESEE 
countries (Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech 

Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 

Poland, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, 

Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine) and estimates the 

Panel VAR model using the least square dummy 

variable (LSDV) method between the 2003:Q1–

2010:Q4 periods.

Achieving fiscal stabilization, while accommodating large infrastructure investments, and safeguarding 
financial sector stability:
• Limit the overall budget deficits in 2010 to 3.4 
percent of GDP by raising select excise taxes and by 

restraining current primary spending.
• Bolster the government’s bank balances held with 

the Central Bank of Kosovo (CBK) to provide scope for emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), and provide the CBK with a mandate for ELA, and further strengthen 
the banking system.
• Improve the financial position of the energy sector to limit its costs to the budget.• Create a track record of sound fiscal management that could pave the way to a program endorsed by the 
IMF Executive Board in 2012.
• Take important steps toward restoring fiscal 

sustainability by:• Implementing a fiscal adjustment of ¾ percent 
of GDP in 2011 by increasing excise taxes and 

restraining current spending, notably the wage bill.
• Adopting a 2012 budget containing another ¾ 

percent of GDP of fiscal adjustment, partly from the 

wage bill.
• Strengthen budget planning and execution, 
including by assessing the fiscal impact of envisaged 
benefits and pensions to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Kosovo became the 186th member of the IMF on June 29, 2009.
The March 2011 mission found that the review

36 months• Restoring confidence and fiscal sustainability: substantial front-loaded fiscal effort reinforced by 

fiscal institutional reforms to bolster confidence, regain 
market access, and put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a 

declining path.
• Restoring competitiveness and growth: nominal wage 
and benefit cuts and structural reforms to reduce costs 
and improve price competitiveness. An ambitious 

privatization agenda to boost investment and growth, 
which will also help reduce public debt.
• Safeguarding financial sector stability: establishment 
of a Financial Stability Fund (FSF) to deal with possible 
solvency pressures; extension of government banking 
liquidity support facilities and ECB’s nonstandard 

monetary policy measures.IMF financial assistance of €30 billion is in parallel with bilateral financial support of €80 
billion available from euro area partners. The 

total amount of €110 billion over three years will 

cover the expected public financing gap during 
the program’s period.

The fourth review was completed in July 2011.

On July 21, 2011, the leaders of the 17 

euro area countries agreed to provide an 
estimated €109 billion in fresh financing to 
Greece. Together with voluntary private sector 

contributions and continued IMF support, it 
would close a financing gap in Greece’s budget,
