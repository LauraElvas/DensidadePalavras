   vii
 The global economy is in danger zone again. This time, the euro are
a is the focus of concern. In spring, it 
looked as if Europe's sovereign
-debt troubles remained contained. Moreover, there were signs of 
domestic demand taking over as the engine of a moderate recovery of the European economy, despite 

fiscal tightening and
 weakening global economic conditions. These hopes were dashed. Uncertainty has 
increased, and doubts about the future path of growth in the advanced economies have grown. Stress in 

the banking sector 
Œ simmering since the collapse of Lehman Brothers 
Œ esc
alated, and investors and 
consumers switched back into precautionary modus. Increased public debt concerns are weighing on bank 

balance sheets with negative repercussions on credit and real growth going forward, further clouding the 

outlook for public fina
nces. Compared to our 2011 spring forecast, we revised down our growth 
projections for 2012, for both the EU, euro area and the world economy, and remain cautious in our 
outlook for 2013. We do not expect a recession in our baseline scenario. But the proba
bility of a more 
protracted period of stagnation is high. And, given the unusually high uncertainty around key policy 
decisions, a deep and prolonged recession complemented by continued market turmoil cannot be 

excluded. 
 Hard to measure for economists, co
nfidence is fundamental for the functioning of modern economies. Its 
nature is systemic. In normal times, savers (as well as governments and economists) have confidence in 
the banks' capacity to turn savings into productive investment; consumers have confi
dence in their future 
income to finance big
-ticket purchases; investors have confidence in the economic conditions to bring 
their projects to fruition; and so on. The confidence of economic actors is based on the record of their 
collective experience. This
 includes, for instance, the evolution of returns on investment, the stability of 
growth, inflation, and disposable income, but also (discounted) failures of the past. It reflects both, an 

assessment of individual risk as well as some consensus on the leve
l of systemic risk. In the years running 
up to the crisis, systemic risks were (ill
-)perceived to be minimal for most advanced economies. In the 
wake of the global financial crisis, however, many of the basic parameters that determine our assessment 
of ris
k have started shifting. It will take time before they settle, and collective consensus on a new more 
stable risk map will emerge. In this world of high uncertainty it is not surprising that market sentiment is 

volatile and confidence is fickle. 
 There is 
no silver bullet to restore confidence at this juncture. What is needed is a bold and encompassing 
strategy that is implemented with a steady hand over the long haul. Policy surprises or ambiguity in 
ambition are not helpful. For Europe, such a strategy is
 being pursued with vigour. As set out in the recent 
Commission Communication "A roadmap to stability and growth", key elements include the restoration 

of fiscal sustainability in Greece; the rigorous implementation of the adjustment measures agreed with 

countries implementing support programmes; the strengthening of financial backstops for sovereigns; the 
harnessing of banks; the determined but differentiated consolidation of public finances coupled with 
structural reforms to boost growth and productivity;
 but also the strengthening of economic governance. 
The package agreed by the euro
-area Heads of State and Government on 26 October confirms that Europe 
will do what it takes to safeguard financial stability and restore confidence in Europe. This strategy 
has to 
be spelled out and completed, where necessary, as a matter of urgency. At the global level, we must 
withstand the temptations of protectionism and re
-energise our collaborative efforts, as confirmed at the 
Cannes G20 Summit, to steer out of the dang
er zone again.

  OVERVIEW
   1 The outlook for the European economy has taken a turn for the worse. 
Sha
rply deteriorating confidence and intensified financial turmoil is affecting 
investment and consumption, while urgent fiscal consolidation is weighing 

on domestic demand and weakening global economic conditions are holding 
back exports. Real GDP growth in 
the EU is now expected to come to a 

standstill around the end of this year, turning negative in some Member 

States. Only after some quarters of zero or close
-to-zero GDP growth, a 
gradual and feeble return of growth is projected in the second half of 2012.
 The uncertainty related to the sovereign
-debt crisis is expected to gradually 
fade over the forecast horizon, provided the necessary policy measures are 
implemented. Nevertheless, growth is likely to be held back by more difficult 
financing conditions, on
going deleveraging and sectoral adjustment. Growth 
will be insufficient to deliver an overall reduction of unemployment within 

the forecast period. 
 Uncertainty has increased since the summer and is now extremely high. 
Accordingly, the downside risks have 
become very strong. If left unchecked, 
negative interactions between debt concerns, weak banks and slowing growth 

are likely to lead to a relapse of the EU economy into recession. 
 At the time of the s
pring 2011 forecast, there were signs of a pick
-up of 
domestic demand offering the prospect of a self
-sustained recovery, even 
though a soft patch was expected for the second half of 2011. However, 

already in the second quarter, domestic demand shrivelled 
and net exports 
took again over as the remaining driver of growth. Over the summer, the 

outlook worsened abruptly. Concerns about the sovereign
-debt crisis in euro
-area Member States intensified and broadened, debt sustainability in 

advanced economies outs
ide the EU also moved into investors' focus, and the 
global economy lost steam.
 The aggravation of the sovereign
-debt crisis and the deteriorating outlook for 
the global economy
 triggered global 
financial
-market turmoil amid a 
generalised re
-assessment of risk. Equities tumbled worldwide, but most 
strongly in Europe. While bond yields of the euro
-area Member States with 
vulnerable fiscal positions increased, the yields of bonds considered as safe 

havens fell to record lows. Uncertainty about the exposure of banks to euro
-
area sovereigns resulted in a freeze
-up of inter
-bank lending and a sharp 
deterioration of the banking sector's funding conditions. While the 

predicaments of banks differ, banks ar
e now expected to accelerate the 
strengthening of their capital buffers. Although banks can refinance at the 

Eurosystem with lengthened maturities and full allotment, the latest bank 

lending survey suggests tightening credit supply conditions going forward
. 
By now, 
the weakening real economy, fragile public finances and the 
vulnerable financial sector appear to be mutually affecting each other in a 

vicious circle. 
 While global financial mark
ets are 
affected by spillovers from the sovereign
-debt crisis
, the global economy is 
also subject to events located outside 
Europe. Over the summer, the recovery in the US lost steam. Going forward, 
high unemployment, ongoing deleveraging and fiscal policy
 tightening are 
set to weigh on US growth. Emerging market economies have moved to a 
more moderate growth path, but are 
expected
 to hold up quite well. Growth 
Growth in the EU has 
stalled 
and 
it will take 
time to pick up again
.  EU growth slowed 

down after a strong 
first quarter... 
 – as financial market 
conditions have 
deteriorated sharply–
  – and the global 
economy has moved 

to a lower growth 
trajectory. 
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   2 in Japan is projected to experience a rebound in 2012. Meanwhile, world 
trade has slowed down str
ongly and
 is 
projected 
to go through
 a soft patch in 
2012 before picking up again in 2013. 
 As a result of the domestic and external weaknesses, GDP in the EU is 

projected to stagnate towards the end of 2011. This deterioration of the 

outlook is supported by the accelerated decrease of leading indicators in 

recent months. GDP is expected to recover very gradually from the spring of 
2012 onward, returning to modest 
growth later in the forecast period. 
This 
outlook for a gradual recovery is in line with an assumption of declining 
uncertainty and financial market stress, which is, however, conditional on 
appropriate policy action. To the extent it materialises, it will
 allow a return 
of domestic demand, while net exports benefit from fading impediments to 

the global recovery.
 However, the need for ongoing balance
-sheet 
adjustment, both in the private and the public sector, the legacy of high 
unemployment and the negativ
e impact of the crisis on potential growth will 
continue to weigh on the speed of growth going forward. 
 While at the time of the spring forecast a broadening of the recovery on the 

back
 of more robust domestic demand appeared to be in the cards, domestic 
demand turned out to be disappointing in the second quarter of 2011. Private 
consumption, which has made a moderate contribution to GDP growth since 
the 2008
-09 recession, is set to be h
eld back by the increase in uncertainty 
and the worsening outlook for employment. The projected further decrease of 

inflation and moderate wage growth will underpin disposable income, which 

should support a modest pick
-up of private consumption along with 
the 
expected dissipation of uncertainty from the second half of 2012 on. 

However, deleveraging of household debt takes time and is expected to 
restrain consumption over the forecast horizon. The contribution of 
government consumption to growth has been van
ishing in 2011, and further 
consolidation needs point to a moderately negative impact in 2012. 
 The outlook for investment has darkened rapidly following the strong 

rebound until the first quarter of 2011. Increased uncertainty accompanied by 

the perspecti
ve of a slowdown is expected to lead to stalling investment. As 
firms adopt a wait
-and
-see attitude, their generally strong financial position 
and still good conditions for external financing will not prevent a strong 

slowdown in investment. Only in the la
ter half of the forecast horizon, 
investment is expected to pick up again, in line with the assumption of 

improved confidence and strengthening export demand. 
 Expected GDP growth is revi
sed down for the second half of this year as well 
as for 2012; for 2013, a return of modest growth is projected. Mostly due to 

the strong GDP growth in the first quarter of this year, annual GDP growth 

for 2011 remains close to the values projected in the 
spring forecast, at 1.6% 
in the EU and 1.5% in the euro area. Growth for 2012 is revised down 
substantially, by 1¼ percentage points to ½% in both the EU the euro area. 

For 2013, annual growth is projected at 1.5% in the EU and 1.4% in the euro 
area. In te
rms of quarterly profile, growth is expected to be nil in the fourth 
quarter of 2011. On account of a gradual return of confidence and abating 

external drag, quarterly GDP growth is then expected to slowly increase to 

around 0.4% in both the EU and the eur
o area by the fourth quarter of 2012. 
This modest level of quarterly growth is forecast to be maintained throughout 

2013. 
 The EU economy is set 
to sta
gnate for some 
quarters before 

anaemic growth 
gradually returns
.  As uncertainty will 
weigh on domestic 

demand in the 
coming quarters –
 – the growth forecast 
for 2012 has been 
revised down 
substantially. 
 Overview
   3 No group of Member States will escape the expected slowdown, but growth 
differe
nces will persist. Growth in the Member States that displayed the 
strongest growth performance in 2010
-11 is forecast to decelerate faster than 
the EU average. Some of the drivers of recent growth differentials are fading, 
as countries that had been hit by
 banking and/or housing market crises are 
gradually advancing in their adjustment. 
However, the aggravation of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
 has led to more differentiated financing costs across 
Member States for governments as well as the private sector. Memb
er States' 
fiscal consolidation needs continue to differ.
 As a result, growth differentials 
across Member States are likely to persist in 2012
-13. 
 While the confidence shock related to the sovereign
-debt crisis a
ffects 
Member States in a broadly similar way, differences in their growth 
performance are mainly related to the legacy of the credit and housing boom 
as well as different openness to, and orientation of, international trade. In 
Germany
, investment, consum
ption and exports are all set to weaken strongly 
in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, only a temporary interruption of 
growth dynamics is expected until uncertainty dissipates and a robust growth 

momentum is resumed. In 
France
, weakening corporate inves
tment and to 
lesser extent softening private consumption are set to cause a marked 

slowdown to slightly negative GDP growth at the end of 2011. A moderate 
return of growth is projected in the second half of 2012. 
Italy
 is set to 
experience two quarters of 
slightly negative GDP growth around the turn of 
the year and frail growth thereafter, as domestic demand remains very 

subdued. The 
Spanish 
economy is projected to go through some quarters of 
stagnation in late 2011 and early 2012 before growth very gradual
ly returns. 
This projection is largely driven by the technical assumption of no change in 

fiscal policy reflecting the absence of a 2012 budget. However, further fiscal 
consolidation measures are very likely after the general elections. GDP in 
the 
Netherla
nds is forecast to stagnate in the current and coming quarters as 
domestic demand and exports simultaneously weaken. Modest growth in the 

second half of 2012 and into 2013 is set to mainly rely on net exports. 
 Among the largest Member States outside the e
uro area, the 
UK economy is 
set to stagnate in late 2011 and the first half of 2012, mainly on account of 
continued weakness of household consumption, before returning to growth 

around potential in the later part of the forecast horizon. 
Poland
 is expected
 to experience a comparably benign slowdown around the end of 2011, mainly 

on account of weaker foreign demand. Domestic demand is set to remain 

fairly resilient, though growth is projected to be more moderate than 

projected in spring. 
 Concerning Member States' current accounts, remarkable progress has been 

made in reducing imbalances in many Member States, in particular in the 

euro area. Many of those countries with a current
-account deficit in 2010 are 
projected to r
educe their external deficit over the forecast period. In some of 
the surplus countries, more balanced positions are also expected 
 The recovery in the past two years has entailed only s
low employment 
growth. While this partly reflects labour hoarding during the recession, 

employment growth has not been strong enough to reduce persistently high 

unemployment markedly. With the expected slowdown ahead, firms are set

 With meagre 
employment growth, 
high unemployment is 
set to persist, –
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   4 half of next year is too moderate to produce any strong labour market 
performance within the forecast horizon. Employment growth in 2013 is 

therefore expected to remain meagre. As a result, unemployment is not 

expected to fall over
 the forecast horizon. However, cross
-country 
differences in labour market performance are expected to remain large.
 Chapter 2 of this forecast examines the labour market developments since the 

end 
of the recession in 2009 and the forces likely to shape employment and 
joblessness going forward. Employment started to increase in late 2010, but 

the overall performance of the matching process in the labour market appears 
to have deteriorated. As job
-fin
ding rates have remained rather low, the 
unemployment rate remains persistently high, average unemployment spells 

have lengthened and youth unemployment has surged in many countries. 

Related to the adjustment of the pre
-crisis imbalances, the skills of tho
se laid 
off do not match the skills sought for new employment creation well, so firms 
find it harder to fill their vacancies than the headline unemployment figure 
would suggest. The increase of structural unemployment has negative 

repercussions on growth p
otential. On the positive side, labour market 
participation has remained high despite the increase in unemployment. If this 

resilience of participation continues it will contribute to potential growth 

going forward. 
 Headline HICP inflation accelerated in the first half of 2011, mainly driven 

by the pass
-though of high energy and food commodity prices. As 
commodity prices have peaked in the first half of 2011, and oil futures prices 
point to a gradual further de
crease going forward, headline inflation is 
expected to gradually abate, falling back below 2% in the course of 2012. 

Deferred pass
-through can, however, still produce some volatility in the 
headline figure, as evidenced by the acceleration of inflation in
 September 
2011. Increases in indirect taxes in Member States with fiscal consolidation 

needs can also temporarily affect headline inflation. As for the underlying 

price pressures, persistent output gaps, which are expected to widen slightly 

in most Member
 States in 2012, will continue to hold back inflation, while 
wages are expected to grow only moderately in view of high unemployment. 
 Fiscal 
deficit outcomes for 
2011 are now projected at 
4.7% of GDP in the EU 
and 4.1% in the euro area. The slight improvement compared to the spring 

forecast for the euro area is mainly due to additional fiscal measures in some 

Member States. 
Deficits are 
forecas
t to decrease further, albeit at a slowing 
pace
, due to both reduced expenditure and higher revenues
. For 2012, deficits 
are projected at 3.9% in the EU and 3.4% in the euro area. 
The EU's gross 
debt ratio is forecast to reach a peak of about 85% of GDP in
 2012 and to 
stabilise in 2013. In the euro area, gross public debt is projected to rise over 

the whole forecast horizon, albeit at decreasing pace compared to the 2008
-10 period, breaching 90% already in 2012. 
 The present forecast heavily relies on the assumption that policy measures to 

combat the sovereign
-debt crisis will eventually prove effective. It is assumed 
that the uncertainty related to the sovereign
-debt and financial
-market 
crisis 
will dissipate gradually towards mid
-2012, and that this will lead to a 
reduction of financial
-market volatility and gradually release deferred 
investment and consumption. Indeed, many important decisions have already 

been taken, not least in late O
ctober 2011. They cover a large spectrum of 
measures to ensure or restore debt sustainability, repair the financial sector 
and strengthen the policy rules within EMU. 
 – and the risk
 of labour market sclerosis 
has increased. 
 Inflation is expected 
to stabilise belo
w 2%. 
 2011 marks the switch 
from fiscal stabilisation 

to consolidation; yet, 
debt
-to
-GDP ratios 
take time to stabilise.
 The projected 
turnaround strongly 
depends on
 the 
appropriate policy.
  Overview
   5 Against the backdro
p of the high level of uncertainty, the overall balance of 
risks to the growth outlook is strongly tilted to the downside. Some of the 
risks that were identified earlier on have materialised. Since the spring 

forecast, the global financial market situation
 has deteriorated against the 
backdrop of a deeper and longer sovereign
-debt crisis with contagion, while 
global demand has weakened, in turn also contributing to the weakness of 
financial markets. This is now reflected in the present forecast's baseline 
scenario. Nonetheless, serious downside risks remain. In view of the frail 
GDP growth expected under the main scenario, the risk of a recession is not 

negligible. 
 The main downside r
isks 
of the GDP forecast stem from fiscal sustainability, 
the financial in
dustry and world trade. Ensuring fiscal sustainability remains 

a challenge across Europe, but also in major advanced economies outside the 

EU. Lack of credible progress with in addressing the sustainability challenges 
could lead to even stronger financial 
stress. The banking sector, rather than 
increasing capital to improve balance sheets, might resort to divestment and 

lending restrictions, potentially producing a credit crunch as of early 2012, 

which would obviously depress domestic demand. The contractio
n of world 

trade in the second quarter of 2011 
Œ though apparently influenced by supply 
chain disruptions in the wake of the earthquake in Japan 
Œ is also a reminder 
that trade is very sensitive to global growth dynamics. A further softening of 

global dema
nd could affect net exports quite substantially. Moreover, there 
are worrying signs of mounting protectionist pressure. Finally, there is a 

potential for negative dynamic interactions (feedback loops), which could 

alter the growth dynamics more substantial
ly. Slower growth already affects 

the 
sovereign debtors, whose weakness weighs on the health of the financial 
industry. If the latter were to restrict lending more strongly than currently 
projected, this would depress GDP growth and fiscal revenues further
.  On the upside, confidence might return faster than currently assumed, 
releasing the potential for an earlier
-than
-expected recovery of investment 
and private consumption. Global growth could prove more resilient than 

projected in the baseline scenario, 
due e.g. to inherent growth dynamics in 
emerging market economies, and provide support to EU net exports. Finally, 

a larger decline in commodity prices could enhance real disposable incomes 

and consumption. 
 Risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly ba
lanced. On the one hand, a 
stronger
-than
-expected slowdown of GDP growth or a more rapid fall of 
commodity prices could dampen price developments further. On the other 
hand, a stronger rebound in the global economy or renewed unrest in oil 
exporting countr
ies could exert upward pressure on prices. Finally, the 
exceptionally large liquidity creation by central banks in advanced economies 

over the past years could yet be transmitted into inflation pressures. 
 The risks to the main 
scenario are strongly 
tilted to the downside.

   1. THE EU ECONOMY: A RE
COVERY IN DISTRESS
    9 1.1. OVERVIEW
 In autumn 2011 the European economic recovery 
has come to a standstill, the near
-term outlook is 
less favourable than forese
en in spring, and only in 

the second half of 2012 a return to subdued 
economic growth is expected (for an overview see 
Table 
I.1.1
, for underlying assumptions Box 
I.1.4
). 
 Despite short
-term indicator
s pointing to an 
ongoing slowing of economic activity in the EU, 

the overall growth performance for this year is still 
relatively strong, owing to a good start in the first 
quarter. The outlook for 2012 and 2013 is 

considerably less favourable (see Graph

 The EU 
economy 
is moving in dangerous territory. The recovery has already come to a standstill
 and a 
host
 of 
forward looking 
indicators 
paint a rather gloomy picture. F
inanc
ial market turmoil
 is 
intensifying as s
overeign
-debt and 
banking
-sector concerns are
 becoming increasingly interrelated
. Pulled down by elevated uncertainty, b
usiness and consumer confidence is plummeting, 
delaying 
spending decisions, thereby weighing on d
omestic demand
 and economic growth
. Interactions between 
developments in the financial sector and in confidence are impacting negatively on economic activity. 
Furthermore, the weaker
-than
-expected global recovery limits the prospects for relief from the ex
ternal 
side, while the broadening of economic growth towards domestic demand is not materialising. 
Sluggish 
economic growth 
contributes to
 market 
volatility
 that 
harms
 confidence
, worsens the creditworthiness of 
sovereigns and erodes the value of assets he
ld by financial institutions. At the current juncture, a
ny 
further bad news could amplify adverse feedback loops pushing the EU economy back into recession.
 The deterioration 
of the economic situation in the EU is
 associated with developments that had 
feat
ured 
as downside risks in
 the spring forecast
 but were not incorporated into the
 central scenario. They 
include 
mainly 
substantially worse development
s in financial markets, including 
sovereign
-debt 
concerns and banking sector issues, and a weaker
-than
-exp
ected global recovery. 
As these 
developments ripple through the EU economy, 
significant
 revisions to the spring forecast 
are inevitable. 
The
ir size 
depends crucially on assumptions about responses to the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
 and contagion 
effects. 
Despite
 progress made at European summits, r
ecent developments suggest that it will take more 
than a few 
months 
to cope successfully with the formidable policy challenges. 
A realistic time
frame for 
turmoil to recede
 and confidence 
to return
 would span well into n
ext year
, based on neither particularly 
optimistic nor pessimistic assumptions
. This timeline underpins the central scenario of the forecast. 
 The 
ongoing loss of growth momentum pulls 
parts of 
the EU economy into periods with contracting 
economic activity
. The 
return to the recovery path is only expected for late 2012, but economic growth 
will remain subdued
. Real GDP
 in the
 EU and the euro area 
is 
expected to grow at annual rates of 1½% 
this year, to slow next year to ½%, before 
slightly 
regaining momentu
m in 2013 (
1¼-1½%). 
The 
deterioration in the growth outlook 
keeps unemployment rates close to mid
-2011 levels (9½
-10%), while 
it should help
 to contain
 inflationary pressures. 
In 2011
 sharp increases in commodity prices in the first 
half of the yea
r will k
eep inflation 
elevated
 (2½% in the euro area, 3
% in the EU). But in 2012 and 2013 
inflation rates should be 
around one
 percentage point lower in both areas.
 The central scenario comes with 
substantial 
risks to the growth outlook 
that are considerably 
skewe
d to 
the downside, even more than before. By contrast, the risks to the inflation outlook appear now to be
 balanced.

5.03.73.53.64.04.1::::::   At the current juncture there is evidence that the 
economic recovery has come to a standstill, and in 

some Member States will turn into stagnation or 

even a contraction of real G

modest traction from late 2012 onwards, but will

 HICP inflation has so far been mostly driven by 

increases in commodity prices, although increases

   11 1.2. PUTTING THE FORECAST
 INTO 
PERSPECTIVE
 In 2011 the economic and financial crisis has 
entered a new phase as increased turmoil in 
financial markets, including sovereign
-bond 
markets in some Member States, is not only 
impacting negatively on the real e
conomy, but is 
also creating the substantial risk of stronger and 
more adverse feedback loops in the coming 
months. This development comes on top of the 

consequences of the crisis that 
are still 
reverberating through the economy. 
Empirical 
studies
 of previ
ous recoveries 
following deep 
financial crise
s suggested that
 such
 recovery would 
inevitably
 be more 
subdued
 than 
ordinary
 one
s.(1)  This time, economies recovered from the downturn 

at different speeds, which pointed to a 
multi
-speed
 recovery with substant
ial differences across 
countries. 
 As the recovery progressed, the impact of the 

initial banking crisis on public finances became 

stronger and intensified the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
 that had been rather limited in early stages of the 

recovery. With linkages
 between the banking and 
the sovereign
-debt crisis intensifying, the impact 
on the real economy is now increasing and some 

feedback effects
 between the financial and the real 
sector have already occurred.
(2) Against the 
background of increased uncertainty 
and ongoing 

market turmoil, the risk of stronger 
adverse 

feedback loops 
threatening the EU economy is 
substantial. This accentuates the downside risks to 
the growth outlook. The present section looks at 

some already observed or imminent feedback 

effects an
d at those posing substantial threats for 
the months ahead.
 Strong linkages between the banking and the 
sovereign
-debt crises ...  
 The
 observation that banking (financial) crises are 
often followed by sovereign
-debt crisis
 had already 
been made in previou
s crises.

the literature. See for instance IMF,

debt crisis, 
American Economic Review

-1706. In a recent study, government debt 
debt rising during the crisis, one initial question 
related to whether public debt thresholds exist 

beyond which GDP growth would be adversely 

affected.
(4) But recent developments showed that 
the impact of rising debt on the su
stainability of 
public finances and their knock
-on effect on 
sovereign
-debt markets are the fundamental 
challenge. These linkages received additional 

attention amid 
growing concerns about fiscal 
sustainability in EU
-IMF programme countries and 
countries af
fected by contagion.
 In the 
financial sector
 a particular sharp increase in 
uncertainty was observed since mid
-July 2011. 
The exceptional change is visible in market 
indicators such as the 
iTraxx (see Graph 
I.1.3

liquid investment grade credit default swap
 (CDS)

suggests that inve

attention to banks financing their national

 Developments in 
sovereign
-bond markets
 entered 
a new phase in July 
2011, when
 benchmark yields 
hit
 new
 lows as greater risk aversion increased 
demand for save haven assets. In parallel, yields in 
several other Member States rose (see Graph 
I.1.5
). The widening of the spreads was 
particularly strong in Greece, Portugal, Italy and 

Spain, whereas the Irish spread followed a steady 

downward trend, reflecting positive results under 

the Irish programme. The increase in Spanish and
 Italian yields was dampened by the ECB's 
sovereign
-bond purchases in the secondary market, 
which were conducted with the aim to restore a 
better transmission of monetary policy decisions.

 Linkages between financial market segments
 are 
clearly visible. The worsening in the sovereign
-bond market, exemplified by sharp bond price falls 

in some programme countries, is impacting 

negatively on banks' portfolios that typically 

comprise sovereign debt. Thus, a sovereign
-credit 
strain directly impacts on banks,
(5) with the size of 
                                                           (5) In September, the IMF has estimated an impact of 
sovereign bond dev
elopments in high
-spread countries of 
the impact depending on exposures,
 currently most 
notably to Greek bonds.
(6) Moreover, the impact is 
amplified by interconnected and highly leveraged 
fin
ancial institutions in the respective countries. In 
turn, weakness in the banking sector affects 
investors' expectations about measures to be taken 
by sovereigns to support the banking sector and the 
impact on the sustainability of public debt. This 
argume
nt is particularly relevant in cases where 
credit risks are transferred onto public
-sector 
balance sheets, and where sovereigns provide the 

function of guarantor of last resort.

detailed look at financial markets provides 

additional evidence of t
he interaction of financial 
market segments (see Section I.1.4).
 ...are impacting negatively on the real 
economy...
 Financial market turmoil has already harmed the 
confidence of consumers and businesses. There are 

signs of an impact on financing conditions
 in the 
EU, both via financing costs and access to 
financing. Additional channels through which 
financial market turmoil affects the real economy 

are directly through wealth (e.g. net worth of 

portfolios) and indirectly via greater needs for 

fiscal retrenc
hment.
  An important channel through which financial 

sector woes impact on the real economy is via 

confidenc
e effects
. A weakening of business 
and consumer confidence typically leads to 

lower private consumption and investment and 
to higher saving rates. Bo
th effects tend to slow 
economic growth irrespective of whether the 
loss of confidence is driven by banking sector 

weakness or concerns about sovereign
-debt 
sustainability. Widespread risk aversion tends 

to lead to the postponement of investment 

projects.

the Commission's Economic Sentiment 

Indicator has shown a strong decline (see

   Worsening financing conditions
 resulting from 
financial market strains form another threat t
o economic growth (see also Box 
I.1.1
). Banking 
sector problems weigh on banks' costs of
 Œ and 
access to
 Œ funding. Such f
unding stress
 is 
affect
ing
 the real economy through financial 
intermediation
, i.e. from 
banks lending of 
to the private sector s
pending.
 A decline in banks' 
capital could prevent banks from taking on 

credit risk. More generally, substantial 
deleveraging by banks, for instance to meet 
certain capital ratios, could imply a credit 

contraction ("credit crunch").
 Its impact 
would 
then 
depend on how banks
 recover
 their (Tier 
I) capital ratio by 
either raising fresh capital, 
retaining earnings or cutting
 bank lending, i.e. 
their risk
y assets. The 
faster 
they attempt to 
rebuild their capital ratio, the bigger the impac
t on the real economy
 could be
.  Since mid
-2011 most of the typical hallmarks 
of credit contractions are present in the euro 

area.
 The deterioration of bank funding via 
interbank lending is visible in the increasing 

Euribor
-OIS (overnight index swaps) sprea
ds 
(see Graph 
I.1.8
), which reached the highest 
level since spring 2009. The increase since July 
points to financial market strains and suggests 
that the intensification of the crisis has already 

impacted unfavourably on overall
 financing 
conditions. Moreover, in the euro area there are 

extraordinary developments with regard to 

banks' recourse to the marginal lending facility 

of the Eurosystem, which has markedly 
increased since the summer, and surrounding 
the use of the deposit 
facility, which banks 
would usually avoid by lending to counterparts 

in the banking sector.
 At the current juncture, 
funding stress has been aggravated by U.S. 

money market funds reducing their lending to 

EU banks, which raised dollar funding costs 

and tri
ggered supportive action from the ECB.

 The

that recent 

developments might complicate private sector 

financing. The observation that respondents

standards for loans to companies in the fourth 

quarter provides further evidence that the inter

  Wealth effects
 incurred by falling equity and/or 
sovere
ign
-bond prices can be expected to affect 
private sector spending. As regards households, 
this effect will be stronger in economies where 
households are more involved in equity 

markets and where lower stock prices reduce 

household wealth, with a negative i
mpact on 
private consumption.
 Households might also 
aim at restoring the ratio of income to wealth, 
which would require higher savings. The same 

effect would be observed if households entered 

a phase of precautionary savings due to 

increased uncertainty an
d unemployment fears. 
As regards companies, lower equity prices 
make refinancing via stock markets more 
difficult and, in conjunction with downward 

revised demand expectations, impact 

negatively on investment.
(8) There is clear 
evidence from demand compone
nts that some 

of these effects are already materialising in the 

EU economy (see Section I.1.5).
  Additional 
stress on sovereigns
 constitute
s a third way through which financial market 

developments may impact on the real 

economy.
(9) Increased doubts about th
e sustainability of public finances make 

sovereign
-debt
 issuance more exp
ensive. To 
address these doubts and to lower the debt 

burden, governments could speed up fiscal 

consolidation (e.g. more frontloading), which 

would, at least in the short run, 
lower
 economic 
growth directly
.  A further indirect impact
 on 
spending decisions in the private sector
 cannot 
be excluded
, although t
he size of these effects 
will
 depend on the composition of the measures 
taken.
(10) At the current juncture, these negative interact

between the financial sector and the real economy 
weigh increasingly on the economic outlook (see

latest downward revisions for growth.

 Additional feedback loops could aggravate the 
impact of financial markets on the real economy. 

The worsened outlook for the EU economy 

exacerbates tensions in financial markets, in 
particular in sovereign

of some 
countries. A weakening of the real economy 
reduces the tax base and darkens the outlook for

 different 
in many respects. Back then t
he collapse 
brought operations of wholesa
le funding markets 
to a sudden stop, making it harder for banks to 
continue financing credit
-driven economic growth. 
With credit 
having 
dried up, in several Member 
States 
more fundamental 
obstacles to growth 
were 
laid bare 
(e.g. l
osses 
of competitiveness).
 At the 
same time
, weaker economic 
growth 
led to a fiscal 
deterioration 
and shifted attention to the 
sustainability of public finances. As investors 

focused
 on deteriorating balance sheets, several 
commercial banks in Member States came under 

scrutiny and 
needed support from EU 
governments, which translated the financial crisis 

in the private sector into a 
sovereign
-debt crisis
.  In 2011, by contrast, central banks are providing as 

much liquidity as needed against a widened list of 

eligible collateral and m
ore backstops have been 
introduced. 
Moreover, 
while the collapse of 
Lehman
 Brothers represented a shock, current 
developments have been evolving more gradually, 

leaving market participants time to take 

precautionary measures. But a decisive difference 

comp
ared to 2008 is that sovereign
-debt concerns 
are now at the heart of the crisis, and not just 

liquidity and solvency concerns in the banking 

sector. Risks are not limited to vulnerable euro
-area economies and could affect countries 

elsewhere, for instance 
via balance sheet exposure 

to foreign assets, via capital flow reversals
,(14) and 
via the international correlation of asset returns 

that translates into a correlation of credit spreads 

across economies.
(15) These elements amplify the 
risk of strong adverse 
feedback loops. If 
materialising, it would inflict substantial economic 

losses on the EU economy and would invalidate 
the baseline scenario of this forecast.

   16    Box I.1.1:
 Bank balance
-sheet adjustment and credit supply
Pressure on E
U banks to accelerate balance sheet 
adjustment has 
recently 
increased. Since the 
summer, European banks have been confronted 
with significant funding pressures
 triggered by 
markets' la
ck of trust in banks' assets valuation 
(especially for sovereign risk). Furthermore, banks
 have reasons to expect a further deterioration in 
funding conditions as 
tougher 
capital and liquidity 
requirements 
become effective
.  Confronted with pressures, bank
s can adjust their 
balance sheets by raising additional capital, which 
may not be straightforward in a situation of market 
stress. Alternatively, they can recourse to 
downsizing of 
their balance sheets
 through 
divestment of activities, 
sale of securities
 or the 
reduction of loan supply. 
 This box discusses sources of pressure on 
EU banks' liquidity and solvency
 and their likely 
reaction
. So far, 
the flow of credit to 
non
-financial 
institutions and households appears to be 
only little
 affected
 Œ also because
 cre
dit demand is
 subdued.
 But 
going forward, 
bank balance
-sheet adjustment 
can be expected
 to impact negatively on economic 
activity
, either in terms of pricing
 of credit
 (lending 
rates) or 
via a tightening of 
credit conditions 
(access to credit)
, in part
icular if bank funding 
conditions were to remain difficult. 
  The driving forces of 
balance
-sheet adjustment
 Current p
ressure on banks to adjust their balance 
sheets stems 
firstly 
from liquidity and funding 
risks
, secondly from
 solvency issues
, and thirdly
 from the restructuring 
requirements imposed on 
banks that 
received
 state aid. 
 Firstly
, the 
deterioration in sovereign 
creditworthiness
 has made it 
more 
difficult for 
banks to access fund
s. This 
situation has been 
part
ly mitigated by the ECB™s provision o
f liquidity 
to the full amount 
of collateralised bids. 
However, 
should 
term
-funding 
markets 
remain severely 
impaired into 
early 2012
, this
 would pose a serious 
threat to banks
™ ability to
 maintain the desired 
balance between the maturity of their commitmen
ts 
and 
the 
maturity of their resources.
 In the face of 
declining access to longer
-term 
funds
, banks 
could 
re-establish that balance by reducing 
the duration 
of their assets
 through the sale of longer
-term
 tradable assets
 (including sovereign bonds)
 as well
 as 
short
ening
 the maturity
 or limit
ing
 the 
supply of 
new loans. 
Divesting branches or business lines 
could also reduce the duration of 
banks' 
investments. 
Given that this usually takes some 
time for preparation and implementation, banks 
would typically gi
ve low priority to th
is option and 
thus the 
direct impact on the real economy
 would 
be limited
.  Banks also 
have to 
anticipate higher funding 
pressures due to new 
planned or proposed 
regulatory liquidity requirements.
 The new 
liquidity ratios proposed by 
Capital Requirements 
Directive 4 and Capital Requirements Regulation 1 
in line with the proposal of the 
Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision would 
oblige
 banks 
to 
hold 
more liquid assets
, which could happen at the 
expense of 
the share of loans
. Secondly
, banks
 seek to enhance their solvency 
ratios in order to respond to higher prudential 
capital requirements, supervisory initiatives
, as 
well as market pressures.
  In 
December 
2010, the European Banking 
Authority 
(EBA) 
estimated that 
the implementation 
of pl
anned capital requirements would 
substantially 
increase 
the capital needs of EU banks
 in relatioin 
to their 
Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). 
Instead of 
raising additional capital or scaling back balance 
sheets, t
o a certain extent, banks can reduce their 
RWA
 technically, 
e.g. through 
risk 
modelling 
approaches 
or centrali
sed management
 of 
capital
 and 
liquidity. 
 Supervisory initiatives have also contributed to 
pressures
 to increase capital
. In anticipation of the 
2011 EU
-wide stress
 tests 
European banks in the 
EB
A's sample raised 
about 
EUR 
50 bn 
new 
capital. 
This was done through the issuance of common 
equity in the private market, conversion of lower
-quality capital instruments 
into better loss
-absorbing capital,
 government injections of capital 
or provision of o
ther public facilities, and fully 
committed restructuring plans. Following the 
publication of the stress tests
 in 
July
, banks pledged 
to implement additional 
solvency
-improving 
measures
 including 
divestments
 amount
ing
 to 
EUR 
11 bn.  Moreover, 
competition f
or funds
 is 
pushing banks 
to demonstrate the soundness of their balance 
sheets by anticipating on the future tighter capital 
requirements.
  Thirdly
, banks under 
state aid had to commit to 
restructuring. State
-aid measures 
typically
 involve 
divestments of n
on-core assets and are scheduled to 
take place on a time span of between 2 and 5 years.

  So far, 
evidence of 
a reduction of 
credit supply 
is limited –

, bank balance

significant
 negative 
impact o

 and increas

, thereby
 const
raining economic growth. 
 According to 
the 
ECB's Bank Lending Survey 
of 
October 2011
, conditions to access financing have
 slightly
 tightened
 for banks
 in the euro ar
ea in the 
third quarter of 2011
. Another 
possible indication 
of credit constraints is the i
ncrease of bank
s' intention to tighten credit standards to households 
and firms in the fourth quarter
 of 2011
 (see
 also
 Section 
I.1.2
), which
 is the first noticeable 
hardening of credit standards in more than a year. 
Furthermore, new issuance of debt by EU
 banks 
has been mostly negative, suggesting that 
deleveraging is 
indeed 
under way.
 As t
he evolution goes hand in hand with a general 
decline in the demand
 for credit
, it 
is not possible 
to conclude from recent
ly weak 
credit growth 
dynamics whether credit s
upply constraints are 
currently binding. 
Survey data
 suggest that non

hampered by difficulties in accessing finance.

momentum
 in the EU economy
. An outright 
"credit 
crunch
" appears to be un
likely but cannot be 
completely ruled out. 
 Historical 
evidence
 indicates a strong correlation 
between the growth rates of bank lending to the
 private sector an
d real GDP in the euro area. The 
credit cycle usually picks up with a lag 
to the 
business cycle
, but then facilitates the broadening 
of growth to domestic investment and 
private 
consumption. Th
is does not appear to be happening 
at the current juncture. 
 Evidence from 2008
-09 suggests that when 
confronted with scarce liquidity and pressure on 
their solvency ratios
, banks 
are likely to 
reduce 
their 
loan 
supply,
 not only 
with respect 
to 
their 
risk
ier 
counterparties, but to clients
 across the 
board thereby
 creating contagion in all economic 
sectors.
  In view of 
subdued
 credit demand, c
redit supply 
constraints 
do not appear to be binding at this point 
in time. T
o become 
a limiting factor, 
either credi
t supply would have to contract more sharply, or 
credit demand would have to pick up. 
Banks
' efforts to 
improve their capital standing
 are
 thus 
expected to 
affect 
the economy once 
credit demand 
accelerates as 
private investment and consumption 
recover 
in l
ine with this
 forecast. 
 The perspective of an outright credit crunch 
appears unlikely in view of the availability of 
liquidity from the ECB and the re
-introduction of 
the covered bonds programme, which mitigates 
commercial banks
' difficulty of accessing l
onger
-term funding. However, should the risk of much 
sharper financial market stress (
as 
discussed in 
Section 
I.1.6) materialise, bank balance sheets 
would be hit harder, and their access to finance 
would become even more difficult
 making
 a credit 
crunch m
ore likely.

    18 1.3. THE EXTERNAL ENVIRON
MENT
 Economic growth at the global level has lost 
momentum in recent months. Worsening US and 

EU economic prospects and the knock
-on effects 
on other advanced and emerging economies are the
 main drivers of the deterioration of the global 

outlook. In addition, a number of temporary 
factors underlie this deterioration, which results in 
downward revisions of the forecast for output 

growth outside the EU in both 2011 and 2012 

(each by about ½ pp
. to around 4¼%) but leaves 
expected growth in 2013 unchanged (see Table 

I.1.2
). Less support from the external environment...
 The financial turmoil and deteriorating growth 

prospects in advanced economies have triggered 

renewed
 concerns about the global recovery, even 
if emerging market economies remain robust. In 

the first half of 2011, g
lobal growth has slowed, 
partly reflecting a return to more normal growth 
patterns following last year's rather strong rebound 
in industrial p
roduction and world trade. Apart 
from this technical factor and a number of 

exceptional drags (disasters in Japan, geopolitical 

tensions in the Middle East and North Africa 

(MENA), and commodity price increases), the 
slowdown reflects the impact of stimuli
 being 
withdrawn in 2010/2011 and ongoing financial 
sector problems in several advanced economies. In 

regional terms, the deceleration can be linked to 
weaker
-than
-expected economic activity in the US, 
which reinforced the policy
-induced deceleration 
in th
e emerging market economies. Nevertheless, 

inflationary pressures are yet to be contained in 

some emerging market economies, despite 
tightening policies that had been undertaken in 
many cases until very recently.

World trade volume, CPB data (lhs)
Global PMI manufacturing output (rhs)
y-o-y%
3-month moving average
 As regards the near term outlook for 
global output
, leading indicators 
of global manufacturing growth 

have been pointing to a loss of momentum for 

several months. 
The
 Global Purchasing Managers' 
Index (PMI) stood at 52.0 in September (output), 

slightly higher than in August (51.5), which was 
the lowest reading in two years (see Graph 
I.1.12
). 
The index thus remains in expansionary territory
. As the focus is on the direction of change, 
however, the information content regarding the 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   19 size of the change could be rather limited at the 
current juncture, in particular as the disruptions in 

the aftermath of natural disasters in Japan had a 

non
-negli
gible impact on underlying national 
PMIs.
 Further out, several 
growth drags in 2011 will 

exert only a temporary impact, provided economic 

growth in emerging market economies remains 

relatively robust. World output growth (including 
the EU) is expected to s
low to 3¾% in 2011 and 
3½% in 2012 before accelerating marginally in 
2013. Overall, weak growth prospects, high debt levels 

in advanced economies, and lingering policy 

challenges weigh on global risk sentiment. 
Adverse feedback loops between the sovereign,
 financial, and real sectors cannot be excluded. In 
addition, the geopolitical situation remains tense in 

the MENA region, resulting in still elevated 

commodity prices and volatile commodity prices.
 ... as world trade growth is easing...
 The rebound in 
wor
ld trade
 had been one of the 
key drivers of the recovery from the downturn in 

2008 and 2009.
 World trade volumes grew by 13% 
in 2010 and have already returned to pre
-crisis 
levels, though not to the pre
-crisis growth path. 
While the trade collapse in 2008
-09 took just about 
one year to lower trade volumes by about 20%, 

driven also by changes in the costs and availability 

of trade financing, the return to the pre
-crisis level 
took more than two years (see Graph 
I.1.13
). As 
the re
bound progresses, world trade growth is 
easing. 
The moderation in the first half of 2011 
also reflects slowing global growth and the 

deteriorating global outlook. According to the 

latest estimates of the Centraal Planbureau (CBP), 

world trade lost momentum
 in the first half of 
2011 and shrank in the second quarter (by ½%). 

Available data for July and August and leading 
indicators such as the Global PMI indicators 
suggest a continuation of this weak trend in the 

second half of this year.
 The experience of th
e initial phase of the crisis suggests that tighter credit 

conditions, as currently observed, may further 

weigh on trade. 
The forecast for global trade 
growth is revised down to about 6½% in 2011, 

slightly above 5% in 2012 and to 6% thereafter.
 ... global financial markets are becoming a 
drag to growth, ...
 Global 
financial markets
 went through a sharp 
correction in Augu
st and September. The sell
-off 
in equity markets, and in particular the negative 
wealth effects it entails especially in the US, 
reflects a marked reassessment of risks and may 
weigh on economic growth. Going forward, these 

developments potentially increas
e the risk of 
recession. Exchange rate volatility has remained 

high since the spring forecast. It is most notably 

driven by uncertainties over the sovereign
-debt 
crisis in the euro area, the political gridlock in the 

US about the increase of the debt ceili
ng, 
downgrades by credit rating agencies, and data 

suggesting a deeper
-than
-expected slowdown of 
activity in the second half of the year. Over the 

summer, foreign exchange markets were 

characterised by a flight to safe havens. The 
Japanese and Swiss centra
l banks intervened in the 
foreign exchange markets to stem rapid 

appreciation of the currencies. More recently, 

sharp depreciations of emerging market currencies 

against the US dollar have again triggered 

nervousness and interventions in some cases.

 markedly increased in the first

I.1.14
). Most 
commodity price indices peaked in 
the second 

quarter and slightly eased during the summer on 

the back of a worsening global outlook. Compared 
to pre
-crisis levels, however, many prices stay at 
elevated, reflecting large and sustained demand 
increases from emerging market economies. These 

structural features imply that cyclical conditions 
are not likely to lower commodity prices to pre

 On the back of geopolitical tensions in the Middle 
East and North Africa and signs 
of an improving 

economic outlook, 
oil prices
 increased 
substantially in the first months of the year and 

peaked in April at an average price of 123 USD 

per barrel (Brent). Expectations of easing tensions 
in the region and a more subdued global outlook 
have
 since eased oil price pressures. In the second 
half of October Brent stood at around 110 USD per 

barrel, which is almost 10% lower than assumed in 

spring. Based on oil futures, this forecast makes 

the technical assumption that oil prices 
fall from an 
aver
age of 111 USD/barrel this year (about 6% 
lower than assumed in spring), to 104 USD (11% 
lower) next year and 100 USD in 2013.
 Non
-energy commodity prices
 continued their 
upward trend in the first and second quarter of 
2011 (18.2% and 10.4% quarter
-on-quar
ter from 
an annual increase of 25.9% in 2010).
 This 
movement came to an end in mid
-2011. Metal 
prices and agricultural non
-food prices that had 
both surged in late 2010 and early 2011 fell 
already in the second quarter. In the third quarter, 

food prices de
parted from the upward trend they 
had followed since late 2008 on the back of 

adverse short
-term supply
-side factors (weather
-related supply shocks, exports bans and rising oil 

prices) and rising global demand
. Strong 
population and income growth in emergi
ng market 
economies and its impact on dietary preferences 

keep food prices at high levels (see Graph 
I.1.15
).

 The 
price declines observed in autumn for 
commo
dities remained much smaller than the 
increases seen before. This also supports the view 

that scarcity has become a structural feature to 

which supply is only responding gradually. At the 

current juncture, slightly moderating growth in 
emerging market econ
omies is expected to exert 
some downward pressure on prices. 
Correspondingly, the forecast at hand assumes a 

decline in non
-energy commodity prices over the 
forecast horizon. But these declines will be rather 

small and insufficient to ensure a return to th
e 
price levels recorded in the last quarter of 2010.
 Marked differences between advanced and 
emerging market economies ...
 A closer look at key regions shows that a
dvanced 
economies continue growing more sluggishly than 
emerging market economies (see Graph
 I.1.16
), 
which 
continue to display relatively robust growth. 
The 
fastest expansion
 has been achieved in 
economies that were almost unaffected by housing 

and real
-estate bubbles, had few links to the 
financial sectors of the mo
st affected countries and 
were mainly hit via trade links. This group of 

countries includes emerging market economies 
such as China and India. The
se managed to 
recover 
briskly,
 with industrial output and real 
GDP 
returning 
to their pre
-crisis growth trajec
tory.
 A much lower speed of recovery is found in 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   21 advanced economies that were in general harder
-hit by the crisis.

 The outlook for the 
US economy
 has worsened 
compared to the spring forecast, reflecting a weak 
housing market, worsened prospects for 

consumption, and fiscal policy turning 
contractionary. Moreover,
 a substantial revision of 
national account data in July 2011 brought a very 
large downward revision of the trough of the 

recession, implying that a full recovery is further 

off. By mid
-2011, US GDP had not returned to its 
pre
-crisis level. GDP growth in t
he first two 
quarters of 2011 has slowed to quarter
-on-quarter 
rates of 0.1% and 0.3%. Private consumption 

growth lost momentum in the first half of the year, 

reflecting higher oil prices, an uncertain 

employment situation, and, more generally, 

ongoing del
everaging processes and falling 
business and consumer confidence. In addition, 

supply
-chain disruptions from the disasters in 
Japan, most notably in the automobile sector, 

stifled production. Further out, the economy is 

expected to rebound only slightly, w
ith an 
unfavourable labour market outlook and high 
private debt levels constraining consumption and 

financial market developments depressing 

household confidence. Residential investment will 

therefore remain sluggish, with house prices 

falling.
 Fiscal poli
cy is set to remain a drag on economic 

growth and represents a key source of uncertainty 
for the markets. The preliminary debt
-ceiling 
agreement set fiscal consolidation objectives that 
were deemed both not credible and insufficient by 

financial markets. I
n principle the tax cuts and 
infrastructure expenditure summarised in the 

American Jobs Act could ease the fiscal restraint. 
Assuming an extension of the current payroll tax 
cuts and some additional corporate tax reductions, 

the fiscal stance will continue
 to provide a negative 
contribution to growth in 2011 and 2012. Overall, 

the forecast for GDP growth has been revised 

down for 2011 (from 2.6% to 1.6%) and 2012 

(from 2.7% to 1.5%) and a deceleration is expected 

in 2013 (1.3%).
 The outlook for 
Japan
 is str
ongly
 affected by the 


tsunami it caused on March 11, 2011. As a result 

the economy went through three quarters of 

negative growth with GDP still remaining below 

its pre
-crisis peak of 2008. Particular investment 
(20%
 lower) and exports (13% lower) have not yet 
recovered. Recently better
-than
-expected data 
outturns and supportive labour market conditions, 

constitute a glimmer of hope. Looking forward, 

purchases of energy
-saving appliances are 
expected to support consum
ption growth as 
electricity prices are set to rise. GDP growth is 
expected to gain momentum in 2012 (1.8%) 
mainly thanks to the boost provided by 
public 

investment. This is linked to the third 

supplementary budget, which aims to repair the 

damage caused by
 the earthquake. As these 
impulses will have disappeared by 2013, private 

consumption and net exports are expected to 

contribute moderately to economic growth of 

about 1%. The downside risks to this outlook are 

related to the sustainability of the debt sit
uation, 

the impact of a stronger
-than
-expected yen and to 
the tight energy supply. On the upside, 
reconstruction might be finished earlier than 
expected, Japanese exports may be less affected by 

the global slowdown than envisaged in the 

forecast, and priva
te consumption may rebound 

stronger than expected due to sound household 

balance sheets.
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   22 Economic growth is moderating in 
EFTA 
countries
, which were subject to special 
circumstances. In Norway, the substantial 

sovereign oil wealth continued to provide a bu
ffer 
cushioning the economy in times of distress 

without creating an external payment imbalance or 
public finance concerns. Economic growth is 
expected to pick up over the forecast horizon, 

though to less than in the pre
-crisis period. The 
Swiss economy
 continued its rebound in 2011, 
though slower than in the year before, being 

increasingly weakened by the impact of the 

appreciation of the Swiss franc. In early 
September, the Swiss central bank stopped the 
appreciation by announcing unlimited intervention 

to let the exchange rate not fall below a floor of 
1.20 CHF/EUR.
 Across the five 
EU candidate countries
 macroeconomic developments 
remain diverse
. Turkey continued its strong recovery (
around 
9% 
GDP growth in 2010) into 2011, but recent 

indicators point to 
a marked slow
down of 
economic growth
 in 2012 (to about 3%) and in 
2013 (about 4%)
. Croatia
, Montenegro
 and Iceland 
have 
yet 
to return to pre
-crisis output levels
. The
 Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
is 

expected to grow at rates around 3% this year an
d 2½% in 2012, reflecting the expected deceleration 

of global demand.
 Overall, economic growth in the 
group of Candidate Countries is expected to slow 

from last year's 
8% to around 
7% in 2011 and 3% 
in 2012.
  ... and a modest loss of momentum in 
emerging m
arket countries.
 The growth performance of emerging market 
economies in 2011 broadly confirmed the spring 

forecast. Over the forecast horizon these countries 
are expected to grow much stronger than advanced 
economies (see Graph 
I.1.17
). But developments 
have been uneven among them, partially reflecting 

linkages with advanced economies. Over the 

forecast horizon the slowdown in the EU economy 

will also be felt there. Moreover, countries 
exporting commodities performed relatively 
well 
(e.g. CIS, Latin America), while economic 
momentum in several countries in Asia has slightly 

weakened.
 Emerging 
Asia
 continues to be the most dynamic 
region of the global economy. Economic growth is 
expected to continue at annual rates of around 7% 
over the forecast horizon amid more general 
concerns about the sustainability of high growth 

rates in emerging market economies. Downward 

revisions for economic growth in 2011 and 2012, 

as compared to the forecast in spring, reflect the 
impact of slowing eco
nomic activity elsewhere and 
of some policy tightening in Asia, an attempt to 

address inflationary pressures. Easing pressure in 
commodity markets is expected to contain inflation 

over the forecast horizon.

 In 
China
, economic growth moderated slightly in 
the first three quarters of 2011 to 9.4% on average 

from 10.3% on average in 2010. 
Economic growth 

is expected to ease gradually in 
2011, representing 

a soft landing rather th
an a sharp decline. Forecasts 
for 2011 and 2012 have been revised down slightly 
compared to spring on the back of softer external 
demand and tighter domestic policies. Growth 

remains investment
-led over the forecast horizon 
without major rebalancing toward
s consumption. 
China™s economy will continue to slow slightly 

next year and efforts to spur growth may be 

constrained by inflation and local government debt 
burdens. Overall, China is expected to enjoy a 
period of substantial though decelerating economic 

growth in 2011 (9.2%), 2012 (8.6%) and 2013 
(8.2%).
 Strong domestic demand has driven economic 
growth in 
India
, but with inflation running high 
and being broad
-based, the challenge is to marry 
growth and price stability objectives. As the 

overall policy mix
 is expected to turn more 
restrictive, a slight moderation of economic growth 

to annual rates of about 7½
-8% is expected over 
the forecast horizon.
 In 
Latin America
 growth has continued to surpass 
expectations in the first quarter of 2011, driven by 

a surg
e in domestic demand, capital inflows and 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   23 sustained high demand for and high prices of raw 
materials. A surge in private consumption is 

supported by high growth of loans to households. 

Increased inflationary pressures have prompted the 
region's central ban
ks to raise policy interest rates 
and, in some cases, to take measures to curb 

capital inflows. Against this background, growth is 
expected to moderate in 2011 (from 6% to 4½%) 

and over the forecast horizon (to around 4% each 

year), but to continue coming 
in slightly higher 

than expected in spring.
 In the 
MENA region
, economic growth has 
resumed at differentiated pace. In 2011, many oil 

and gas exporting countries are benefitting from 

higher commodity prices, whereas others are 

facing the economic impact of
 political 
transformation, embargoes or military action. 

Further political turmoil cannot be ruled out and 

constitutes downside risks to the growth outlook. 

Overall, the area is expected to grow over the 
forecast horizon by about 3½%.
 In the 
CIS region
, th
e moderation in oil prices and 
a more difficult access to international capital 
markets is weighing on the growth prospects of 

Russia. In line with the deterioration of the global 

outlook, the growth forecast for 2011 has been 
revised down by ½ pp. to abou
t 4%. Further out, 
slowing growth in the EU worsens the outlook for 
Russia's oil and gas exports. The other countries in 

the region are expected to grow slightly stronger 

than Russia, resulting in a growth forecast for the 

region of about 4% over the forec
ast horizon.
 1.4. FINANCIAL MARKETS IN
 EUROPE
 Financial markets 
are at the
 centre of the current 
growth
 slowdown
 in the EU. Turmoil in 
sovereign
-bond markets and financial disruptions such as 
inadequate
 credit supply and sharp declines in 
asset prices, not
ably in stock markets, have 
become key determinants

  A deteriorating situation in selected 
sovereign

 and 
falling equity prices
 are
 undermining the quality of assets held in the 
banking sector
 and thereby adversely affect the 
funding costs and market access of banks. Lower 
market prices of sovereign bonds weaken the 

banks' balance sheet and reduce the value of the 

collateral available for
 wholesale funding. 
Therefore markets remained concerned about the

credit supply.

behaviour.
 Especially banks relying on short
-term 
wholesale funding may face funding 
vulnerabilities.
 A number of ECB safety valves are 
addressing 
funding needs of euro
-area banks
, including 
unlimited prov
ision of liquidity against a wide set 
of collateral. 
Data on ECB liquidity operations 

point to high demand for liquidity
, with reliance on 
the central bank's liquidity provision remaining at 

elevated levels.
 Besides, the reduction in exposure 
to EU banks b
y US money market funds and the 
shortening of 
their lending 
maturit
ies
 have become 
a source of concern. 
To address US dollar funding 

stress in the euro
-area banking system, the ECB 
has also announced that it will conduct liquidity

S dollars.
 On the 
money markets
, European banks
' funding 
came under severe pressure 
since the summer
. As 
banks appear to be reluctant to lend to each other
, the amount of liquidity banks deposit at the ECB 

remains relatively high.
 The 3

spread 
betwee
n unsecured money market rates such as the 
Euribor and overnight index swaps (OIS)
, which is 
widely seen as a measure of counterparty risk on 
wholesale banking markets, picked up strongly 
over the summer (
see Graph 
I.1.22
), but
 remained 
at a lower level than after the collapse of Lehman 

in 2008. 
Persisting fiscal sustainability worries in 
some countries have

 Overall, in recent months t
he growing difficulty of 
EU banks to attract funding 
from 
outside the ECB 
at 
a sustainable cost has become a major concern.
 Responses to ad
-hoc questions about the impact of 
financial turmoil in the ECB Bank Lending Survey 

of October 2011 suggest that euro
-area banks are 
experiencing a substantial deterioration of their 

access to m
oney markets and in their issuance of 
debt securities, which could also affect banks' 

activities outside the euro area (see Box 
I.1.2
). ... and thereby lending to the private sector.
  As for lending activity, bank credit provisi
on to the 
economy has slowed in mid
-2011. After having 
recovered further in early 2011, reflecting the 

current slowing of economic activity,
 in August 
2011 lending to the private sector
 (see
 Graph
 I.1.24
) expanded at an annual 
rate of 2.5% (not 
adjusted for sales and securitisation). L
oans to 
households 
increased by 3.0% and 
lending for 
house purchase, the most important component of 

household loans,
 recorded growth of 3.9%, all 
unchanged from July but lower than in June. 

Consum
er credit dropped at an annual rate of 1.6% 
in August (2.0% in July), reflecting the weakening 

of private consumption, particularly with regard to 

major purchases (see also Section I.1.5). 
The 
annual growth rate of loans to non
-financial 
corporations stood
 at 1.6% in July and August.

   26    Box I.1.2:
 Are capital flows to Central
- and Eastern European Member States at risk?
The persistent tensions in the sovereign
-debt 
markets 
have led to increased stress in the euro
-area banking sector. Consequently, 
also the 
banking sector of the 
New Member
 States of 
Central and Eastern Europe
 could be affected as it 
is largely owned by the euro
-area banks. This box 
examines the risk of unfavourable
 credit market 
developments in the
se countries in light of the 
latest forecast
.  Evolution of capital flows 
 All non
-euro
-area EU Member States from Central 
and Eastern Europe (CEE7 
- BG, CZ, LV, LT, HU, 

PL and RO) were in a net external borrower 
position vis
-à-vis the rest of the world during the 
whole period from 1999 until 2008. The 
intensification of the global
 financial crisis in late 
2008 led to a sharp contraction (and in some cases 
reversal) of foreign capital inflows into the region 
in the context of a substantial correction of external 
imbalances. The (un
-weighted) average annual 
external balance of the CE
E7 increased from a 
deficit of almost 10% of GDP in 2008 to a surplus 

of about 1% of GDP in 2009 with countries 
running the highest deficits experiencing 
the 
largest 
contractions. Although the external funding 

situation seems to have stabilised recently, n
o clear 
trend towards a significant deterioration in external 
balances has arisen yet, apart from the gradual 
correction of temporarily high surpluses 
(overshooting) in Latvia and Lithuania. The (un
-weighted) average annual external balance of the 
CEE7 is 
expected to remain in small surplus in 
2011 and then to decline gradually over 2012
-13 
with only the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania 
recording external deficits over the forecast 
horizon. Economic activity in the region (and 
investment levels in particu
lar) thus currently 
seems less dependent on foreign funding inflows 
than in mid
-2008.

 However, while their balance of payments position 
has in general improved, the CEE7 countries still 
have a substantial stock of gross foreign liabilities. 

Although the
ir size and composition differ widely 
among the CEE7 countries, the region as a whole 
(un
-weighted average) actually increased its 
reliance on more volatile types of foreign funding, 
such as portfolio, financial derivate and other 
investment flows between 
Q2-2008 and Q2
-2011
 despite also recording growth of foreign direct 
investment liabilities. 
In addition, over this time 
span, the stock of short
-term external debt (in terms 
of annual GDP) declined only in Bulgaria and 
Lithuania.
 As a result, macro
-financi
al stability 
across the CEE7 region remains, albeit to a varying 
degree, dependent on the continued involvement of 
foreign investors.

 The role of foreign banks 
 A particular channel of external funding in the 
CEE7 is through the largely foreign
-owned ba
nking 
sectors. 
Over the last decade, euro area parent 
banks have been key players in the foreign
-owned 
banking sectors of these countries. The subsidiaries 
of euro area parent banks dominate the local 
banking sectors of all New Member States, with a 
share 
of total assets of the banking sector ranging 
between 
65% and 95%.
 The resurfacing weaknesses in the euro area 
banking sectors coupled with the persistent tensions 
in the sovereign
-debt markets 
therefore 
constitute 
downside risks to credit market developme
nts in 
the New Member States of Central and Eastern 

Europe.

 A subdued recovery...
 Up to
 mid
-2011, t
he pattern of 
the EU economic
 recovery 
has been in line with the features 
expected for a recovery following a downturn with 

a financial crisis at its origin.
(18) It has been more 
subdued and sluggish than other recoveries 
(see 

Graph 
I.1.26
), held back by weak private demand 
and tight credit conditions.
 The most recent 
evidence even points to a standstill
 and confounds 
the view that the recovery will catch up with 

previous recoveries.

patch had already been observed in 2010 with the

 ... with GDP growth momentum waning...
 In the first quarter of 2011 real GDP grew at the 
relatively high rate of 0.7% (quarter
-on-quarter) in 
the EU and 0.8% in the euro area, clearly 

exceeding the average growth rates recorded since 
the start of the recove
ry in 2009. This reflected a 
catching up from a more modest fourth quarter of 

2010, when adverse weather conditions in a 

number of countries held back growth. This is 

particularly visible in developments in 

construction output, which had declined until the
 end of 2010 and recorded relatively strong growth. 

In the second quarter the economy did not 

maintain its momentum, with GDP growing at the 

rate of 0.2% (quarter
-on-quarter) in the EU and the 
euro area, i.e. 
0.2 pp. and 0.1 pp. respectively 

lower than pro
jected in the spring forecast.
 In principle, the loss of momentum might be 

consistent with normal cyclical patterns ("mid
-cycle slowdown"). On the demand side, the 

relatively strong momentum at the beginning of a 

recovery is typically associated with pent
-up 
private consumption spending following the 
downturn and the replenishing of inventories as 
companies rebuild their stocks. As these drivers 

lose power, the growth momentum fades. In 

addition, the supply side may constrain the upturn 

as capacity utilisat
ion rebounds but new equipment

    29 has not yet been installed. In mid
-2011, the 
slowing of private consumption growth and the 
only marginal contribution of inventories would be 

in line with the end of such a "bounce back" effect, 
but there are no signs that su
pply side constraints 
have mattered for the slowdown in economic 

activity. This confirms that the recovery has been 
atypical and speaks against the hypothesis of a 

mid
-cycle slowdown.
 Instead, special factors appear to have caused the 

loss of momentum. The
 deceleration of growth 
could be related to strong increases in the first 
quarter ("payback"). For instance, the strong 
growth in construction activity observed in the first 

quarter was not sustained. The impact of sharp 

increases in commodity prices and t
he global 
economic impact of the natural disasters in Japan 

in March weighed on economic activity in the EU. 

Finally, the ongoing process of withdrawal of 

fiscal stimulus measures (e.g. the phasing out of 
the car
-scrapping schemes in France) may have 
exert
ed a negative impact as well. 
 ... and a disappointing short
-term outlook, ...
 A slew of economic data released over the summer 
months as well as recent short
-term indicators 
point to a further moderation of growth 

momentum. The slowing growth of global ou
tput 
and less dynamic world trade developments signal 

a weakening of external support to the European 

recovery. Increased financial market turmoil and 

heightened uncertainty about the handling of wider 
European policy challenges, in particular in the 

wake 
of decisive actions by monetary and fiscal 
policymakers this year, are factors that have pulled 

down business and consumer confidence that had 

already been on a declining trend since spring.

 Several indicators that lead industrial production

industrial new orders in the EU manufacturing

production in the EU had only increased at an

supports expectations for a 
further slowdown in
 industrial production 
and thus does not bode well 

for economic growth.

    30 Survey indicators point to a slowing of economic 
activity in all Member States and across almost al
l sectors. 
The Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) 
followed a downward trend in the EU and the euro 
area since April 2011, starting from a very high 
level and remaining above the long
-term average 
until July, but declining thereafter (
see Graph
 I.1.29
). Both the low level and the speed of the 
decline suggest, in line with past experience, a 

marked GDP growth slowdown ahead.

 This development is
 common
 to most components, 
including manufacturing, services, retail, 

households, but not construction (see Graph 

I.1.30
). The Commission's Industrial 
Confidence 
Indicator has been declining 
in the EU 
since 
peak
ing
 in March 20
11 (since 
February 2011 in the 
euro area)
, and in October stood close to its long
-term average in both the EU and the euro area. In 
particular, managers' assessment of the level of 

order books and of their expected production for 

the next months has declin
ed strongly over the past 
months
, while
 the percentage of managers 
assessing their stocks 
as being
 too large increased. 
Not included in the Industrial 
Confidence 
Indicator
 are
 managers' assessment of production trends 
observed during recent months and of e
xport order 
books
, which
 has also worsened strongly over the 
last five/six months. Manufacturers are therefore 

likely to reduce their production further in the 

short
 term to meet the lower demand implied by 
continuous decreases in order books.

 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   31 The 
Service
s Confidence 
Indicator 
fell 
between 
March and September (
-14½ in the EU and 
-11 in 
the euro area), followed b
y a small increase in 
October (1¼ and ¼ respectively), which overall 
continues pointing to a further moderation in 
growth. The drop result
ed from a general 
worsening of all three 
constituent 
components 
of the 
Service
s Confidence 
Indicator
, although 
service
s are usually less sensitive to cyclical 

developments than manufacturing
. Managers' 

assessment of 
the 
past business situation and 
the 
past evolution of demand declined since the spring, 

while their demand expectation
s followed a more 
irregular path over th
e past months.
 These results are confirmed by the Purchasing 

Managers' Index (PMI). 
Up to the second quarter 
of 2011, the readings of the euro
-area and EU PMI 
Composite Output Index were close to their 

highest levels since mid
-2006 (see Graph 
I.1.29
). Since then, t
he euro
-area PMI composite output 
index has dropped from its peak of 58.2 in 

February 2011 to 47.2 in October (Flash PMI), 

which signalled for the first time since mid
-2009 a 
slight contraction
 in economic activity. Th
e decline is also reflected in quarterly averages, 

which fell from 57.6 in the first and 55.6 in the 

second to 50.3 in the third quarter. This is almost 
in the middle of the average EU PMI composite 
output scores of 45.2 during the downturn (second 

quarter
 of 2008 to third quarter of 2009) and 55.3 
during recovery (up to mid
-2011). The decline in 
the PMI included manufacturing and services, with 

the former already signalling shrinking activity in 
August. As in the ESI, the decline is observed 
across all cou
ntries covered by the survey, with the 
PMI recording the highest scores in Ireland, 

Germany and France.
 Other survey indicators for the EU and the euro 
area have corroborated the aforementioned 
negative survey signals. The latest OECD 

composite leading ind
icators (August 2011) 

continued to point to a slowdown in economic 

activity in the euro area, but also in other 

countries, including the UK, the US and the 
BRICS economies. National leading indicators 
also deteriorated during the summer months but 

are stil
l at rather higher levels, 
with some being 
consistent with moderate growth in the near term. 

For instance, the Ifo business climate indicator for 

Germany has declined from its peak in February 

(114.4 points) to 106.4 in October, which is still 
above the lo
ng-term average. By now the overall 
index has declined for four consecutive months, 
whereas the manufacturing component has already 
declined in eight consecutive months. In 

September, the NBB Index for Belgium, which has 

in the past anticipated euro
-area d
evelopments 
rather well, weakened for the sixth time in a row 

and is now at level last seen in 2009.
 Against this background, GDP growth in the 
EU is 

expected to come to a standstill in
 the fourth 
quarter this year
. As some euro
-area Member 
States fall bac
k into contraction, the euro area will 

even marginally contract (
-0.1% q
-o-q). 
For 2011 
as a whole, the strong first half and the weak 
second half almost offset each other in their impact 
on the annual GDP growth forecast, which stands 

at 1.6% for the EU a
nd 1.5% for the euro area (see

 Current indicator readings still seem to be 

consistent with a temporary standstill of economic 

growth without the EU economy falli
ng back into 
recession, notwithstanding single quarters of 

contraction in a few Member States. 
 ...with only modest improvements expected for 
2012-13... The period of weak economic activity is expected 
to continue into 2012, with almost no growth in the 

first quarter in the EU (0.1% q
-o-q) and the euro 
area (0.0%). In line 
with the 
assumption that 
strains from the European financial market crisis 

will successively disappear in 2012
, business and 
consumer confidence 
is expected to return, 
lifting 
the EU econ
omy back 
onto a subdued recovery 
path.
 This limits growth prospects for the f
irst half 
of 2012 to only modestly
 positive
 rates
. The 
economic situation is projected to improve slightly 

in the second half of 2012 as some of the 

headwinds of 2011 subside or t
urn into tailwinds. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   32 Commodity prices have already moderated since 
mid
-2011 (see Section I.1.3). This will 
remove one 
source of cost pressures on European producers 

and will help consumers' purchasing power, and 
should thus be supportive of an economic rebo
und.
 The recovery in Japan is progressing and the repair 

of global supply chains will be completed so that 
the global impact will revert to a positive impulse 

as reconstruction efforts intensify.
 Further out, based on the assumption of a 

successful resolut
ion to sovereign
-debt problems 
and the return of confidence in late 2012, a certain 
normalisation is expected in the course of 2013.
 Greater confidence among consumers should 
lower their saving rates 
Œ at least where there is no 
need for further balance sh
eet adjustments
 Œ and 
raise consumption. This might also have a positive 

impact on the need for investment (capacity 

expansion), with gross fixed capital formation 

benefitting additionally from favourable financing 
conditions.
 ... and the broadening of GDP
 growth across 
domestic components on hold.
 Signs of a broadening of economic growth across 
domestic components
 Œ a condition for growth 
becoming self
-sustained
 Œ have been visible for 
some time. While the first quarters of the recovery 
followed the standa
rd patterns of an export
-led 
upturn, in 2010 the contribution of domestic 
demand to GDP growth in the EU (0.7 pp.) and in 

the euro area (0.5 pp.) increased substantially, 

almost catching up with the strongest single 

contributors (see Tables 
I.1.5
 and 
I.1.6
), which 
were inventories (0.8 pp.) in the EU and net 

exports in the euro area (0.8 pp.). Overall, 

domestic demand (especially private consumption 

and investment) delivered some moderate 

contributions
, but its profile created the premature 
expectation of a sustained broadening of growth 
during the recovery. The latest national account 
data do not support this hope.
 In the second quarter of 2011, n
et exports have 
again taken over as the main contributor
 to growth. 
The contribution of domestic demand (excluding 
inventories) was flat, with all demand components 
sharply decelerating compared to the first quarter.
 By contrast, exports expanded by 1.0% q
-o-q, 
down from 2.0% in the first quarter, reflecting th
e weakening of global demand and world trade, 

while imports grew by 0.5%, leading to a positive 
contribution of net trade to growth of 0.2 pp. (see

 Looking ahead, the slowing in private 

consumption and gross fixed capital formation will 
reduce the growth contribution of domestic 
demand components in the EU and the euro area 

(0.3 pp. in 2012), thus putting the anticipated 

broadening on hold. However, 
economic growth 
moderately accelerates towards the end of 2011; 
domestic components are again projected to 

become the strongest contributor to economic 

growth (1.2 pps. in both the EU and the euro area).
 Key factors of the multi
-speed recovery in the 
EU ar
e losing importance...
 Substantial growth differences across Member 

States have been one of the key features of the 

recovery. 
A number of reasons have been 
identified, such as diverse starting positions in 
terms of private indebtedness, bursting asset pric
es 
(housing market), banking sector health, and the 
solidity of public finances. Competitiveness and 

export structures (product composition, export 

destination) provided additional explanations. Last 

but not least, the strong rebound in world trade 
(see Se
ction I.1.3) impacted differently on 
countries, allowing those with export
-oriented 
economies and strong competitiveness to grow 

faster than others. 
Only the fastest
-growing 
countries, such as Sweden, Poland and Germany, 

were able to reach output levels ab
ove those in 
pre
-crisis periods.
(20) For instance, in the group of 
the seven largest 
EU 
economies, only Poland has 
clearly exceeded its pre
-crisis level of output of the 
fourth quarter of 2007
, whereas Germany 
matched 
its pre
-crisis level in the first quart
er of 2011 (see 
                                                           (20) See also the analysis in chapter I.1 in European

 Due to the multi
-speed recovery the contributions 
countries made to economic growth in the EU 
differed markedly, both directly via nat
ional GDP 
growth and indirectly via positive spillovers to 

other Member States.
 In terms of direct 
contributions 
(see Graph 
I.1.34
), the highest 
contributions in 2011 come from France and 

Germany, whereas Sweden and Poland are 
the 

non
-euro
-area Member States with the largest 
contributions.
 As regards the indirect contribution, 
several Member States are benefitting from strong 
growth in Germany. Since impulses for economic 

activity in Germany stemmed to a large extent 

from non
-EU
 demand, the country's strong growth 
performance has created positive spillovers for 
other Member States, most notably via higher 
demand for imported inputs, but also via imports 

of consumer goods and services.

 Further out, almost all Member States are exp
ected 
to experience a slowdown of economic growth or 
even periods of contraction. In 2012, all but six 

Member States are expected to grow slower than 

this year. Real GDP growth rates range from 

significant contractions in Greece and Portugal to 
still consi
derable growth rates in some new 
Member States. In most of the countries the 

deteriorated economic outlook will further delay 

full recovery. 
Cyclical 
indicators 
such as the 
output gap confirm the delayed return to pre
-crisis 
levels
 and 
continue to signal a
n extended period of 
low resource utilisation
 in many Member States.
 The growth outlook suggests that Member States' 

economies have entered a period of increased 

convergence towards low levels of economic 

growth ("re
-coupling"). Indeed, some of the factors
 behind the multi
-speed recovery have disappeared 
or lost importance, while common shocks have 

begun hitting Member States. World trade growth 
has been normalising and the importance of 
different starting positions has diminished.
 Instead, 
common shocks su
ch as financial turmoil and the 
slowdown in global output are affecting economies 
in broadly similar ways.
 ...but some heterogeneity might persist for 
different reasons.
  New arguments have been advanced that suggested 
growth differences across Member Stat
es might 
persist for some time ("de
-coupling").
 These 
include relatively low costs of sovereign 
refinancing due to the decline in sovereign
-bond 
yields in some countries, which would allow them 
to spread fiscal consolidation, if needed, over a 

longer perio
d. Against the 
general observation that 
austerity measures tend to have contractionary 

effects
 in the 
short to medium run
,(21) such 
differences in the size or profile of 
fiscal 
retrenchment
 would impact on economic growth. 
Further reasons may be found in di
fferent labour 
market conditions (see Chapter I.2) and their 
                                                           (21) See for instance J. Guajardo, D. Leigh and A. Pescatori,

 A comparison of the growth outlook for fast

tion of persisting differences in growth

should diminish in a low

regards the additional narrowing in 2013, the no

ken into 
account. In particular, some of the slow

measures which could widen the growth

 In addition, the differentiation that markets have

differently from what had been experienced in the 

first years of monetary union. Now th

 Private consumption growth has been 
moderate ... 
 Private consumption, the largest GDP component, 
contributed positively to GDP growth from the 

outset of the current recovery in mid
-2009 until the 
first quarter of 2011. In 2010
, the annual rate of 
growth stood at 0.8% in both the EU and the euro 
area (see Graph 
I.1.37
). Among the key reasons for 
moderate consumption growth have been weak 

increases in real disposable incomes. Real 

compensation per emp
loyee fell during the crisis 
and only moderately recovered in 2010. In the first 
half of 2011 increased inflation from
 higher food 
and energy prices more than offset increases in 
nominal compensation, as wages remained 
subdued on the back of only slowly im
proving 
labour market conditions. Non
-labour incomes 
grew since the start of the recovery, but not 

strongly enough to lift real disposable incomes. 

Other potential drivers of private consumption did 

not kick in, as private wealth was constrained by 

weak fi
nancial and housing market developments. 
Furthermore, in the wake of the sharp downturn 
households moderately lowered their saving rates, 
which had risen due to precautionary motives.

 In the second quarter the weak upward trend of 

private consumption stopped as declines were 

recorded in the EU and in the euro area (
-0.3% 
q-o-q). 
The contraction can be mainly attributed to 
developments in Germany and France, where real 
priv
ate consumption declined. A fall in real 
disposable income in Germany and the end of car
-scrapping schemes in France can explain to some 
extent these developments.
 ...and is expected to slow in 2012... 
 Looking ahead, economic indicators 
signal a 

continuat
ion of weak consumption growth in the 
near term. 
Hard data covering about one half of 

private consumption showed weak readings in the 
third quarter. 
Retail sales volumes (see Graph 
I.1.38
), which reflect about 45% of private 
consumption in the euro area, declined in the 
second quarter in the EU (

and August) point to a standstill in the euro area

 New passenger car registrations declined markedly 
in the second quarter in the E
U and in the euro 
area after increasing in the first quarter. On the one 

hand, f
ollowing the sharp increases in purchases of 
new cars in 2009
-10 caused by the car
-scrapping 
schemes in a number of Member States, the level 
of registrations was expected to de
cline. On the 
other hand, anecdotal evidence from European car 
producers points to a relatively solid sales 

situation, at least for the rest of 2011. With c
ar 
purchases accounting for about 5% of euro area 

private consumption, however, positive news from 

this indicator would not provide a big push to the 
consumption aggregate.
 Survey
-based 
indicators tracking overall private 
consumption have signalled weak growth 

momentum throughout the year and weaker private 

consumption in the near term. 
According to the 
Commission's surveys, s
entiment in Europe has 

shifted markedly since spring as consumers 

incorporated news about the worsened outlook and 

financial market turmoil. 
The Consumer 

Confidence Indicator (see Graph 
I.1.37
) deteriorat
ed markedly over the summer, with a 
very pronounced drop in August 2011 and further 

declines in September and October. This has 

brought confidence back to the level observed late 

2009/early 2010. The recent deterioration is 

mainly due to very pessimistic e
xpectations about 
the general economic situation and to higher 
unemployment fears. Consumers' views on their 
expected savings have worsened too. 
Households' 
plans for major purchases (a question not included 

in the confidence indicator) have remained at a 
low 

level throughout the year and have not declined 

any further. The responses have remained at low 

levels since 2010 and below long
-term averages in 
the EU and the euro area (see Graph 
I.1.39
). 
Uncertainty appears to keep hous
eholds in a wait

purchases, which is also reflected in declining 
volumes of consumer credit in the euro area.

 ... before accelerating slightly in late 2012 and 
2013.  Looking further ahead, a return to moderate 
growth in private consumption relies on the 

disappearance of some of this year's drags on 

consumer spending and on a more positive outlook 
for households'
 disposable incomes.
 Non
-labour 
income, which account for about one
-third of 
disposable income, is expected to grow between 
2011 and 2013 at annual rates of 3
-4% in both the 
EU and the euro area, the larger component of 

compensation of employees will only 
increase at 
annual rates of 2
-3%. Rises in real disposable 
incomes will significantly depend on inflation 
moderating and thereby helping to lift households' 

purchasing power.
 To what extent higher real disposable incomes will 

translate into a strengthening
 of private 
consumption growth depends also on the spending 

patterns of households engaged in deleveraging 

processes. Overall, the saving rate is expected to 

remain almost unchanged in the EU and the euro 

area in 2012. This being said, the stimulus to 

spen
ding would mainly come from a moderation 
of consumer price inflation and its impact on real 

incomes. Losses in equity prices are also likely to 

affect private consumption through lower 

confidence and negative wealth effects. The 

importance of these is, how
ever, difficult to assess 
and will vary across economies.
 Among the largest Member States, Germany, 

Spain, France and Poland are expected to record 

above
-average growth rates in 2012, whereas in 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   37 other countries private consumption will shrink 
(the Netherla
nds and the UK) or expand modestly 
(Italy). In 2013, private consumption growth is 

expected to accelerate in all Member States except 
Germany.
 Public consumption has already been on a 
downward trend for some time ...
 While public consumption was a strong d
river of 
economic activity in the initial phase of the 

recovery, the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus has 

made the growth contribution of this GDP 
component almost disappear. Given that several of 
the measures were still in place in the first half of 

2010, la
st year's annual growth rate of government 
consumption was in some sense still flattered at 

0.7% in the EU and 0.5% in the euro area. But the 

growth contribution already declined in 2010 to 

0.2 pp. in the EU and 0.1 pp. in the euro area.
 This year, against
 the background of greater fiscal 
consolidation efforts, government consumption 

growth decelerated further. This reflects 

developments in public employment, both in terms 

of employees and compensation, and expenditure
-based consolidation measures such as c
uts in 
government transfers. After expanding in the first 
quarter (0.6% quarter
-on-quarter in both the EU 
and the euro area), the rather volatile quarterly 
series recorded a fall in the second quarter in both 

the EU (to 0.1%) and in the euro area (to 
-0.1%
). 
In the second quarter of 2011 government 

consumption declined in the larger euro
-area 
Member States, except in Germany were it 

remained stable and in the Netherlands where it 

even increased somewhat. 
In 2011 as a whole, a 

moderate expansion of governmen
t consumption is 

expected in the EU (0.3%) and in the euro area 

(0.1%). In the euro area the three 
programme 
countries as well as Spain, Slovakia and Slovenia 
are projected to record declines. Outside the euro 

area, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania 

are the only countries reducing government 

expenditure in 2011.
 ... with more to come as fiscal consolidation 
progresses.
 Looking ahead, ongoing consolidation efforts are 
expected to continue 
to 
lower public consumption 
growth during
 2011 and further in 20
12 amid a 
weaker
 economic performance, which in the past 
has often been accompanied by higher government 

spending, for instance due to increased social 
transfers o
r stimulus measures.
 In 2012, shrinking 
government consumption is expected in the EU 

and the 
euro area (
-0.1% in the EU, 
-0.2% in the 
euro area). Declines are expected in the three 
programme 
countries and three additional euro
-area economies (Spain, Italy and the Netherlands) 

and three non
-euro
-area countries (Lithuania, 
Hungary, the UK). 
Further 
out, government 
consumption is expected to increase slightly in 
2013 (0.1% in the EU and 0.3% in the euro area). 

But this
 small expansion should be seen against the 
background of the no
-policy
-change assumption, 
which could imply that a number of consolida
tion 
measures are not yet 
factored into this forecast
 as 
they do not meet the conditions for being fully 

accounted for 
(see also Box 
I.1.3
). Gross fixed capital formation contributed 
strongly in early 2011...
 During the downturn
 in 2008 and 2009, gross fixed 
capital formation
 Œ a typically volatile component 
of GDP
 Œ fell sharply as firms streamlined their 
operations and reduced debt. During the first 
quarters of the recovery, investment continued 
shrinking
. This resulted in nega
tive growth rates in 
2010 in both the EU (
-0.3%) and the euro area 
(-0.5%) as positive growth in private sector 
investment was insufficient to compensate for 

shrinking general government investment (
-7.1% 
and 
-8.3%). As the recovery gained momentum 
tentati
ve signs appeared suggesting that the 
impetus from an export
-led rebound to investment 
demand was materialising.
 In the first quarter of 2011, g
ross fixed capital 
formation was the main driver of growth (1.0% 
q-o-q in the EU, 1.6% in the euro area), but gr
owth 
slowed in the second quarter (0.4% q
-o-q in the 
EU, 0.0% in the euro area). This deceleration was 
broad
-based across countries, particularly strong in 
Germany and the Netherlands. Overall, investment 
in the euro area is still well below pre
-crisis lev
els

 ... but the outlook is deteriorating ... 
 Over the summer, however, the outlook for 
equipment investment has worsene
d as companies 
re-assessed their 
expected production
. Quarterly 
results published in October 2011 show that 

capacity utilisation 
already 
declined in both the EU 
and the euro area, interrupting 
a two
-year upward 
trend since the trough in July 2009. At aroun
d 80, 

capacity utilisation stands below long
-term 
averages in the EU (by 1.1 pts.) and in the euro 

area (by 1.9 pts.).
 In addition, increased 
uncertainty in the EU can be expected to act as 

substantial drag to firms' investment decisions, 

which are not onl
y guided by the net present value 
of future profits of a
 project, but also by the 
riskiness of the profit stream. The higher the level 
of uncertainty, the larger is the probability of 
'expensive mistakes'. When investment returns 

become highly uncertain, a
s at the current juncture, 

firms may find it optimal to 
delay investment 

decisions until new information becomes 

available.
(22) Thus, c
hanges in uncertainty have 
large quantitative effects on optimal leverage and 

investment dynamics. 
Lower investment volume
s 
imply 
deleveraging, as entrepreneurs reduce their 
demand for external financing to be able to 
better 

absorb
 shocks. Increased uncertainty 
in the short 
run 
thus 
tends to lower gross fixed capital 
formation. 
The initial deleveraging leads to a drop 
in over
all investment.
 In such a situation neither healthy corporate 

financial balances in some countries nor relatively 
                                                           (22) See e.g. N. Bloom, S. Bond and J. Van Reenen, 
Uncertainty and investment dynamics, 
Review of Economic 
Studies
, April 2007, Vol. 74, No. 2, 391
-415. Results of 
empirical studies point towards a significantly negative and 
quantitatively relevant relationship between uncertainty 
and the investment share of the capital stock (see also the 
overview in the spring 2010 forecast document).
 moderate financing costs can be expected to 
provide strong support for investment. Further out, 

the tightening of credit standards could even 

become an additional drag for many companies. In 
addition, fiscal tightening is expected to further 
dampen the willingness to consume and invest 
contributing to a downward adjustment in 
companies' demand expectations.
 Gross 
fixed capital formation 
now migh
t not need 
to build up as much capacity as expected in spring. 

Slowing activity may also put pressure on profits 

and lower margins, as for instance indicated by 
changes in the ratio of the GDP deflator and unit 
labour costs in both the EU and the euro area
. Looking ahead, and taking into account new 

downside factors, the current forecast is for a 

modest expansion of gross fixed capital formation. 

As general government investment is expected to 

remain constrained by consolidation efforts and 
shrink further, 
growth rests on investment activity 
in other domestic sectors. The softening of 

economic activity lowers demand expectations, 

which, in connection with deteriorating profits, 

does not bode well for capacity
-enhancing 
investment. Therefore, a markedly lower
 growth 
rate of gross fixed capital formation is forecast in 
2012 (down to 1.0% in the EU and 0.5% in the 
euro area). This overall figure includes a relatively 

weak outlook for government investment, but a 

more positive (though still moderate) one for othe
r sectors' investment in construction, driven by 

returning business confidence. The continued 
overall growth in 2012 is mostly explained by 
increases in EU Member States outside the euro 

area (1.7% in 2012). As the EU economy is overall 

losing investment s
trength, one of the sizeable 
pillars of support to the recovery will be falling 

away. Further out, the return of confidence in late 
2012 and 2013 is expected to raise gross fixed 
capital formation, including the realisation of 

investment projects postponed
 during the current 
slowdown. 
 ... as equipment investment weakens, ...
 A weaker export outlook will translate into weaker 

support for equipment investment. In addition to 

this, downward pressures stemming from corporate 

balance sheet adjustment, declining
 order inflows, 
increasing level of stocks, decreasing capacity 

utilisation (see Graph 
I.1.41
), as well as the 
expected net tightening of lending to enterprises 

are likely to weigh on equipment investment. On 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   39 the positive side,
 equipment investment could 
benefit from strong corporate profits as long as 
firms do not hold back on investment due to the 

uncertain outlook.

 Should the sovereign

outlook for equipment investment, whereas the 

resulting ne
gative impact on economic activity 
would lower the profitability of investment 
projects and lower the need for capacity expansion. 
A worse profit situation could also erode the basis 

for other types of financing, for instance by 
harming the still reasonabl
y solid profit situation 
(see Graph 
I.1.42
). ... construction investment is remaining 
relatively subdued ...
 The construction sector was at the centre of the 
downturn in 2008 and 2009, with output falling by 

more than a quarter
 in the EU. Since spring 2010, 
however, the declines have almost levelled off and 
over the past year construction output has been 
broadly unchanged. Starting from low levels, the 

production index in the construction sector 

recorded positive quarter
-on-quar
ter growth rates 
in the EU and in the euro area for the first two 

quarters and the monthly figures for July and 

August seem to point to a continuation of this 

development in the third quarter of 2011. This is in 
line with leading supply indicators such as 
building permits gaining ground up until mid
-2011, although in several Member States the stock 

of unsold housing is set to continue acting as a 

drag on investment activity for some time to come. 

There may be some undershooting following the 

pre
-crisis cons
truction bubble.
 Looking ahead, the Commission's Construction 

Confidence Indicator has weakened moderately in 

2011, in October standing close to the levels seen 

at the beginning of the year and well below long
-term averages in both the EU and the euro area
. The readings differ substantially across Member 
States with the fastest
-growing countries such as 
Germany, Sweden and Austria reporting strong 

confidence well above the long
-term average.
 Housing investment is expected to rise in 2011 
(1.2% in the EU, 0.
7% in the euro area) after a 
period of contraction (see Graph 
I.1.43
). Thanks to 
flow interest rates moderate growth is expected 
over the forecast horizon for both the EU and the 

euro area (about 1% in 2012, about 2% in 2013). 

As for non
-residential construction, prospects 
appear weaker than in the spring given the onset of 

fiscal consolidation, which is likely to weigh on 

public investment. Therefore, overall construction 

investment will be muted.

conditions tightened. During the first quarters of 

the recovery, the increase in domestic demand was 

driven in part by a
 temporary boost from an 
end of 
de-stocking, with firms raising production to 
replenish inventories. Inventories made 

a contribution of 0.8 pp. to GDP growth in 2010 in 
the EU (0.6 pp. in the euro area). Although 

inventories were the largest contributor to GDP 

growth in the EU, co
mpared with historical 
patterns, the overall contribution was modest. An 
explanation could be that during the recession, 
according to the Commission's surveys, the link 

between inventories and production expectations 

diverged from its historical path. Inve
ntory 
management became more responsive to short
-term fluctuations and managers showed increased 
risk aversion keeping inventories low.
(23) Recent survey indicators suggest that stock levels 
in manufacturing are perceived as increasing. 
According to the Com
mission's survey data, since 
March manufacturers in the EU and in the euro 
saw stocks of finished goods rise. This result is 

confirmed by the stock
-related component in the 
PMI index, which has also been on an upward 

trend in the euro area in recent months
. Increased 
funding costs could lead companies to cut back on 

inventories. In terms of national account data, 

however, the contribution of changes in 

inventories has recently been rather small. Given 
                                                           (23) See European Commission (DG ECFIN),

 the residual nature of the series it is not easy to 
prov
ide a robust explanation. Over the forecast 
horizon no substantial contribution is expected at 

the EU or the euro
-area level.
 Export
s lose steam as world trade slows, ...
 The rebound in world trade made the export 

recovery the initial driver of the recover
y and 
strongly contributed to economic growth in the 

EU. The ongoing normalisation in world trade 
patterns also impacted on the export performance 
of the EU (see Graph 
I.1.44
). Following another 
strong quarter at the start of 2
011, export growth in 
the second quarter already reflected partially the 

slowing in world trade growth and economic 

activity. In the EU the growth of export volumes 
(goods and services) slowed from 2.2% (quarter
-on-quarter) in the first quarter to 0.6% (fr
om 2.2% 
to 0.7% in the euro area).

3-month moving average
 In the second half of 2011, the slowing of world 
trade growth is expected to lower euro
-area export 
growth. Short
-term indicators such 
as data on 
export orders from the Commission's surveys have 

recently declined. This suggests a further 
weakening of export growth in the coming months. 
This outlook is supported by the PMI component 

for new export orders in the manufacturing sector, 

which 
has been declining since February 2011 in 
both the EU and the euro area and fell below the 

no-change threshold in July. At around 45 in 
October, it signals a dearth of foreign demand and 
thus a contraction in exports.
 Looking further ahead, downside factor
s appear to 
dominate. The ongoing financial market turmoil 
puts the trade finance at risk as the increased 

uncertainty could delay spending and investment 
decisions, which would then affect EU exports. 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   41 The deterioration in the global outlook does also 
not 
bode well for global trade developments. 
Against this background a further moderation of 

exports is expected for 2012. In 2013 an improved 
global outlook should help EU exporters achieve 
greater export growth and make a more substantial 
contribution to eco
nomic growth.
 All in all, the deteriorated global outlook does not 
bode well for EU exports in the period ahead. The 

extent to which individual Member States can be 

expected to suffer from the global slowing will 

differ depending on their geographical and 
product 
specialisation, as well as on their competitive 
position. For Member States whose exports are 

directed in a large part towards emerging markets 

(e.g. Germany and Finland), the impact could be 

less negative given the relatively strong GDP 

growth exp
ected for emerging economies over the 
forecast horizon. A distinct disadvantage applies to 

countries whose exports are more heavily weighted 
towards capital goods, as trade in these goods 
usually declines more strongly during a slowdown. 

For euro
-area coun
tries, some relief might arise via 
the exchange
-rate channel, owing to the 
depreciation of the euro in the third quarter that is 

reflected in the downward revision of the exchange 

rate assumption.
 ... and import growth falls below pre
-crisis 
levels ...  On the import side, the slowing economic growth 
is expected to result in a deceleration in the growth 

of import volumes (goods and services) in the EU 

(from 10% in 2010 to 4½% this year and 3% in 
2012) and in the euro area (from 9½% to 5% and 
3% respectively
). European imports are closely 
related to the level and composition of domestic 

demand as well as to the terms of trade.
 In the first half of 2011, the strong increases in 

import prices have partially limited households' 

and companies' imports and this im
pact is expected 
to persist in the near term. Moreover, in Member 

States experiencing a rebalancing of production 

towards tradable goods (versus non
-tradable 
goods), households' demand for domestically 
produced tradable goods increased, lowering the 
import
 demand for final goods. Following strong 
growth in the first quarter, import growth was 

weakened in the second quarter by the slowing of 

economic growth in general and domestic demand 

in particular.
 Looking ahead, the ongoing slowing of economic 

growth is
 expected to lower demand for imported 
inputs in 2012. With increasing growth momentum 

in 2013, domestic demand components should gain 

ground again and both the increase in gross fixed 
capital formation and private investment are 
expected to induce additio
nal imports, thus raising 
the growth rate of import volumes in the EU and 
the euro area to 5%.
 ... while current
-account balances point to 
ongoing adjustments.
 The first two quarters of 2011 saw world trade as 
well as EU and euro
-area exports and imports 
return to more normal growth patterns after the 
exceptional rebound in 2010 after the trade 
collapse in 2008 and 2009 (see also Section I.1.3). 
In 2010, the recovery in world trade had affected 

EU exports and imports of goods similarly, raising 

them in nomi
nal terms by about 18% (slightly less 
in the euro area), which almost offset the declines 

in the year before. Services exports and imports 

also increased in parallel, but at a lower rate of 

about 7% 
-8% in the EU and the euro area. In 2011 
the slowing of w
orld trade and economic growth 
add to the aforementioned normalisation. As a 

result, exports and imports of goods will only grow 

by about 11%
-13% in the EU and the euro area. As 
regards services, import growth in the EU is 

expected to slow significantly mo
re than exports 
(declines by about 4½ pps. for imports and 1 pp. 
for exports).
  In 2012 the growth of goods exports and imports is 
expected to fall markedly to less than a half of the 

previous year's growth rate. Services exports are 

expected to decline mo
re moderately, whereas 
imports grow slightly more. Towards the end of 

the forecast horizon, trade growth is expected to 

accelerate on the back of increased economic 

activity in the EU. 
 The moderate developments in the EU and euro
-area aggregates mask diff
erences across EU 
Member States. While strong growth in export 

markets
 has boosted exports in the past, 
particularly in emerging and developing 

economies, the subdued and fading growth of 

domestic demand in most Member States has 
limited import growth. Thu
s, some of the slower
-growing European economies were able to reap the 
benefits of the strong global rebound in terms of 

improvements in their external balances. It is too 

early to assess whether the important role of 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   42 domestic demand weakness poses substan
tial risks 
to the sustainability of the adjustment.
 Over the forecast horizon, commensurate 
developments on the export and the import side 
result in a moderate worsening of the trade balance 
in 2011 in the EU and the euro area, which is in 
deficit in the f
ormer and balanced in the latter. The 
current account is almost balanced in both areas 

(see Graph 
I.1.45
). Changes in the trade and 
current account balances are expected to remain 

marginal over the forecast horizon.

 At the Member State level, many of those 

countries in deficit in 2010 are expected to reduce 

their external deficit in both 2011 and 2012 
Œ in 
the euro area this holds for seven of the n
ine deficit 
countries, including Spain and Portugal. The 

adjustment is most marked in countries where 
deficits were very large at the start of the crisis.
(24) At that point the rapidly worsening financing 
conditions as well as the negative confidence 

shock 
led to a significant decline in domestic 
demand. Both of these factors are regaining 

importance as the EU economy slows. Over the 

same period in some of the surplus countries a 

downward adjustment towards more balanced 

positions is expected (e.g. Germany, 
Belgium, and 

Finland). A
 comparison with the pre
-crisis 
situation points to progress in reducing imbalances 

in many Member States, particularly in the euro 

area. A strengthening of competitiveness in deficit 

countries supports this process. In terms of rel
ative 
unit labour costs, Spain, Ireland and Greece have 

improved in 2010 and are expected to advance 
                                                           (24) These observations are in line with results obtained for a

forecast
 The labour market situation has stabilised ...
 Due to the resilience of European labour markets 
during the downturn in 2008
-09, labour market 
improvements have been modest in the 
early 

stages of the recovery. Since companies adjusted 
their labour input by reducing the number of hours 
worked per employee rather than cutting 

headcounts, the expansion saw first a 

normalisation in terms of working hours but no or 

only marginal employme
nt growth (see also 
Chapter I.2). This implies a deviation from the 
standard relationship between changes in 
economic growth and unemployment, often 

referred to as Okun's Law. As a consequence, 

more economic growth than usual is needed to 

lower the unemplo
yment rate. Thus, current labour 
market developments in the EU can, to some 

extent, still be seen as a reflection of labour 
hoarding during the downturn and the various 
labour
-market support schemes put in place by 
governments in Member States.

some countries (e.g. Germany and Italy) between 2½ and 
5% of the labour force participated in short
-time work. See

    43 Up to mi
d-2011, labour market conditions in the 
EU and the euro area stabilised and signs of a 
recovery in labour markets became visible (see 

Table 
I.1.7
). 
  More hours have been worked since mid
-2009, 
but the number of workers has only 
slowly 
moved up since autumn 2010. In the euro area, 

hours worked per person employed increased 
by 0.8% in 2010 (annual), but the annualised 
rate fell to negative territory in the second 

quarter of 2011 (
-0.3%). Latest quarterly 
figures indicate that the a
djustment in hours 

worked is levelling off, still driven by a growth 

in working hours in industry, whereas all other 
industrial (non
-public) sectors recorded 
declines in the second quarter. 
  During the second quarter of 2011, the number 
of persons employed
 increased in the euro area 
and in the EU compared with the previous 
quarter (see Graph 
I.1.47
). At the euro area 
level, employment rose on a quarterly basis by 
0.3% (0.2% in EU), compared with 0.1% in the 
previous quarter (als
o 0.1% in the EU). The 
annual rate of employment growth stood at 

0.4% in the euro area and 0.3% in the EU in the 

second quarter of 2011 compared with the 

same quarter of the previous year.
  During the recovery, the unemployment rate 
has been relatively stab
le in the EU (about 
9½%) and the euro area (around 10%), which 
means that about 22½ million persons are 

unemployed in the EU (slightly less than 16 
million in the euro area). Only a small amount 
of unemployment has receded since the trough 

of the recession

  Substantial differences persist across Member 
States, both in terms of job creation and 
unemployment rates. Be
tween August 2010 
and 2011, Spain recorded the highest increase 

in unemployment rates among the largest 

economies (up to 21.2% from 20.4%), whereas 

Germany experienced a substantial drop in the 

unemployment rate (down by 0.9 pp. to 6.0%). 

Not only Germany,
(26) but also Poland, 
Belgium and Austria have come out of the 

downturn with lower unemployment rates (see 

Map 
I.1.1
). Recently increasing unemployment 
in some peripheral countries is increasing the 

dispersion of labour market in
dicators across 
the EU and makes lacklustre labour market 

performance a concern.

   44 ... but improvements are grinding to a halt as 
the recovery is flagging ...
 The deteriorated economic outlook does not bode 
well for a continuation of labour market 

improveme
nts. Forward
-looking labour market 
indicators have deteriorated in recent months. 

According to Commission surveys 
employment 
expectations in the EU industry and services 
sectors have declined over the past months, 
whereas consumers' unemployment fears have
 increased and now exceed long
-term averages (see 
Graph 
I.1.48
). The euro
-area PMI employment 
index confirms this picture. Overall, indicators 

suggest that the near
-term outlook for the labour 
market is deteriorating.
(27) But gi
ven the 
stabilisation observed earlier in 2011, the gradual 

deterioration that is expected for the remainder of 

the year does not result in any significant revision 

of the annual forecasts.

 ... and the situation worsens in 2012
-13 ... Further out, the deterioration of the economic 

outlook results in downward revisions to the 

labour market forecasts for 2012. Employment is 
now expected to remain almost unchanged in the 
EU (0
.1%) and the euro area (0.0%), while the 
unemployment rate is expected to increase slightly 

in both areas (each by 0.1 pp. to 9.8% in the EU 

and 10.1% in the euro area). This forecast takes 

into account that, 
as already observed during the 
downturn of 2008
-09, firms could adjust labour 
costs through the adjustment of hours worked. The 
availability of short
-time working schemes may 
also contribute to ease the effects, but in contrast to 

earlier periods the room for supportive policy 
                                                           (27) On the information content of the Commission's survey 
data on employment expectations see

Cycle Indicators

-11. 
 measures appears to be li
mited. Moreover, the 
increase in financing costs may impinge on 
employment in different sectors, depending on 

their exposure to external funding. In addition, 
shortages of highly
-skilled workers may raise 
labour adjustment costs in some Member States, 

part
icularly in those with ageing societies, and 
create incentives for a renewal of labour hoarding. 
Another issue emerging in this respect is the extent 

to which fiscal consolidation will translate into 

public sector job cuts.
 ... while substantial cross
-country differences 
persist.
 Labour markets in the EU are exhibiting a high 

degree of diversity, which does not only reflect the 

asymmetric effects of the crisis and different 

constraints for the financial sector and fiscal 

policy, but also cross
-country diffe
rences in the 
sectoral composition of past employment losses 
and different institutional settings.
 In general, the 
countries hit by the bursting of housing bubbles 
and/or that are constrained in their policy 

manoeuvre by external and fiscal imbalances are 

those where job losses were the most severe. The 

deterioration in labour market conditions caused 
by the recession was particularly severe in the 
Baltic countries, Spain and Ireland. In 2009, 

substantial job losses were also recorded in several 

other Membe
r States. In particular, unemployment 

is persisting in countries that are facing large 

structural adjustments associated with downward 

revisions of activity in nontradable sectors, such as 
construction, real estate and the financial sector.
 Until mid
-2011 the economic rebound has helped 
to reduce labour market problems, but due to 
different recovery speeds 
there have been 

substantial differences in unemployment rate fall
s since the recession. In many countries the labour
 market impact of the recession remai
ns visible (see 
Map 
I.1.1
). The recovery has not been vigorous 
enough for a full rebound in employment i
n the 
EU or the euro area. Employment growth has been 

most dynamic and delivered new jobs in Member 
States that had already 
implemented reforms, such 
as the Hartz reforms in Germany. Migration flows 

across countries were insufficient to reduce cross
-country differences.
 As expected in spring, the end 
of restrictions on labour mobility in the EU as of 1 

May 2011 (except for citi
zens of Bulgaria and 
Romania) has not had significant short
-term effects 
on European labour markets, since most old 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   45 Member States had already opened their labour 
markets in previous years.
 In 2012 weak economic performance is expected 
to slow employment growt
h in all Member States 
that had recorded expansion in 2011 except 

Hungary and Romania, where employment growth 

is expected to accelerate. In nearly half of the 

Member States the unemployment rate is forecast 

to increase in 2012, with only three Member Stat
es 
recording an increase by more than ½ pp. 

Unemployment rates are forecast to vary between 

about 4% in Austria and about 20% in Spain.
 The dispersion of unemployment rates across 

Member States makes it difficult to assess the 
impact of increasing unemploy
ment on large 
groups of euro
-area citizens. This perspective can 
be added by looking at shares in the euro
-area 
population that face the highest and the lowest 
unemployment rates and by analysing how labour 

market data differ between them. The situation of
 the 50% of the population living in economies with 

the highest unemployment had before the crisis 

rates that were about 3 pps. higher than those of 
the 50% of the population living in economies with 

the lowest unemployment (see Graph 
I.1.49
). 

During the crisis that gap between both groups has 

widened to more than 5 pps. The increase in the 
gap is even more pronounced for the top and 
bottom quintiles of the euro
-area population.

    46 Inflationary pressures are declining as import 
prices ease, ...
 Inflation developments in 2011 have been 
dominated by the impact of sharp increases in 

commodity prices in 2010 (about 30%) and the 
first months of 2011. They have 
pushed 
import 
prices
 in the EU and the euro area to high levels. 
In 2010, import prices (as measured by the deflator 

of imports of goods and services) increased at an 
annual rate of about 6% in the EU (5% in the euro 

area), which includes in the euro area 
the 

dampening effects of the appreciation of the euro. 

On the back of moderating commodity prices, 

energy import price inflation has slowed. The 

moderation in the second half is expected to limit 
the annual rate of import price inflation in 2011 (to 
5½% in
 the EU and 6% in the euro area). Over the 
forecast horizon, a marked moderation of import 

price inflation is expected (to annual rates of 1½
-2% in the EU and the euro area), re
flecting less 
buoyant growth outside the EU
 and the end of 
sharp commodity pric
e increases.
 ... labour costs increases remain moderate ...
 Wages
 have only increased moderately during the 
recovery, partly still reflecting the labour market 

response during the crisis. Most recent information 

on developments in negotiated wages in the e
uro 
area (annual increases of 1½
-2% in the first two 
quarters of 2011) confirms this assessment. 

Against the background of slowing growth and a 

deteriorated economic outlook for 2012, wage 

growth is expected to remain relatively stable. 

Compensation per em
ployee is expected to grow at 
annual rates of about 2¼% in the EU in 2012 and 

2013 (about 2% in the euro area). With non
-wage 
labour costs growing at almost the same rate, 

labour cost pressures should remain well contained 
over the forecast horizon.
 After 
having increased 
by about 2½% last year (after falling by 2¼% in 
2009), l
abour productivity
 is expected to grow 
more moderately this year (1¼%) and in 2012 
(about 1/2 %) in the EU and the euro area. The 
deceleration is mainly reflecting a loss of growth 

momentum and an only slightly deteriorating 
labour market situation. This implies that over the 

forecast horizon nominal unit labour costs will 
follow a rather smooth profile in the EU with 
increases of between 1¼ 
-1¾% (1
-1½% in the euro 
area), whereas real 
unit labour costs will decline 
between 2011 and 2013, with the magnitude of the 
decline depending on the degree of persistence of 

slow productivity growth once economic growth 

gains traction.

 ... and producer prices grow less strongly.
 Between mid
-2009 and the first quarter of 2011 
industrial 
producer prices
 had been on an upward 
trend (see Graph 
I.1.50
), which appears to have 
come to an end after the summer. Up to the latest 
available data point (August 2011), annual 
producer price inflation was mainly driven by the 

energy price component, which accounts for about 

one quarter in the price index. T
he acceleration in 
the energy price component (up to 15.2% in the 

EU and 13.2% in the euro area in March 2011) has 
exceeded that in the other components by far. 
Excluding energy and construction the annual rate 

peaked at 4.8% in the EU and 4.6% in the euro
 area in March 2011. Most recent information 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   47 points to declining price pressures, with 
industrial 
producer price inflation (excluding construction) 

easing in August to 6.7% in the EU (5.9% in the 

euro area). Against the background of easing 
import prices, 
moderating energy prices and well
-contained labour cost development, prices pressure 

appear to be limited over the forecast horizon.
 Whether producers will pass on price pressures 
down the supply chain and finally to consumer 

prices will depend on the pric
ing power of 
manufacturers, which is closely associated with the 

amount of spare capacity. According to the latest 
Commission surveys, capacity utilisation rates 
declined slightly in October to just below long
-term averages in both the EU (down to 80.7% 

versus a long
-term average of 81.1%) and the euro 
area (80.9% versus 81.6%). This backward
-
looking analysis of hard data is in line with 

forward
-looking signals from surveys that point to 
a fall in selling
-price expectations. According to 
data from Commissio
n surveys, 
selling price 
expectations in the EU and the euro
-area industry 
have been declining since they peaked in March 

and fell below their long
-term averages
 for the first 
time since the start of the recovery.

 Across EU economies selling price expectations 

exceed historical averages only in five Member 

States, among them euro
-area economies that had 
in the past recorded relatively strong economic 

growth (Germany, France
 and Austria). The 
decline in price expectations is confirmed by PMI 
surveys (see Graph 
I.1.51
). In further view of the 
outlook for weaker economic activity, the ability 
of producers to widen margins and to raise prices 

seems l
imited in the near term. Instead, they may 
even consider using discounts to maintain market 

shares in weakening demand context. 
 Consumer prices are still affected by past 
commodity price increases ...
 In the 
first three quarters of 2011
 consumer prices
 were strongly affected by volatile but overall rising 
global commodity prices and, in some Member 
States, increases in indirect taxes and administered 
prices. These factors pushed HICP inflation rates 

above the levels seen in 2010 (see Graphs 
I.1.2
 (EU) and 
I.1.52
 (euro area)). In the third quarter 
HICP inflation stood at 3.0% in the EU and 2.7% 

in the euro area, despite the deteriorated economic 

environment exactly as forecast in spring. Within 

the qua
rter an uptick was recorded in September 
2011 in both the EU (from 2.9% in August to 

3.3%) and the euro area (from 2.5% to 3.0%).

 The central role of commodity prices (including 

oil) is reflected in the substa
ntial contribution of 
energy prices to headline inflation (see Graphs 

I.1.53
 and 
I.1.56
), which was about 1¼ pps. in the 
first three quarters of 2011. Changes in tax rates 

added about ¼ pp. to EU he
adline inflation in 
recent months. In particular in the UK the rise in 

VAT to 20% (standard rate) is estimated to have 

added 1 pp. to headline inflation. In August (latest 

available data) the constant
-tax HICP inflation rate 
stood at 2.6% in the EU (2.4% i
n the euro area), 
thus 0.3 pp. (0.1 pp.) below the headline rate. The 

uptick in September is related to the delayed 
impact of energy price increases and a 
methodological change in the treatment of items 

subject to end
-of-season sales (e.g. clothing, 
footwe
ar).
 The assumption of no changes for items 
that are no longer available in post
-sale months can 
now be replaced by imputed price changes based 
on similar products. For instance, in July and 
August 2011, the usual months of summer sales, 

clothing prices in
 the euro area declined strongly 
(at annual rates of about 3%), but then increased 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   48 again in September (at an annual rate of about 
2%), while in 2010 the rate of change was the 

same in August and September.
 Indirect taxation and methodological changes 

impac
ted on both 
headline
 and 
core inflation
, (see 
Graph 
I.1.53
), i.e. all items excluding unprocessed 
food and energy. The uptick in September became 

also visible in core inflation, which increased to 

the highest rates since Decemb
er 2008 in the EU 
(2.3%) and in the euro area (2.0%), whereas non
-core components recorded substantially higher 

annual rates of increase (7.4% in the EU, 7.8%. in 
the euro area). If energy inflation is mainly driven 
by structural factors, the inflation in 
non
-core 
items may not signal transitory price changes that 

will be reversed quickly, but might rather be 

symptomatic of more persistent developments that 

could also impact on core inflation as the pass
-through progresses. But experiences from past oil 

pri
ce increases suggest that the impact on core 
inflation has become smaller over time.

 Looking ahead, i

I.1.8
). This would be consistent with data from 
surveys

point to easing consumer price inflat

 But in terms of annual rates co
nsumer price 
inflation is expected to stay fairly high in the 
fourth quarter of 2011, with only a gradual easing 

towards the end of the year. In the EU the headline 
rate is expected to pick up to an average of about 
3% this year (2½% in the euro area). On 
a 
quarterly basis, the outlook is for the highest rates 

in headline inflation in the second and third quarter 

of 2011 at about 3% in the EU (2¾% in the euro 

area) and a gradual decrease in the fourth quarter. 

This profile reflects the diminishing pass
-thro
ugh 
from both the surge in commodity prices at the 

turn of the year and statistical base effects exerting 

a downward pressure on inflation for most of 

2011. Further out, the ongoing weakening of economic 
activity is likely to increase the slack in the 
econ
omy, constrain wage increases and lower the 
price
-setting power of producers, while the 
weakness of private consumption will limit the 

price
-setting power of retailers. Against this 
background the risk of second
-round effects 
appears to be rather limited. 
Globally determined 
energy
 prices will help to reduce inflationary 
pressures further. 
With the peak in oil prices 
already observed in the first half of the year and 

some tax
-related increases already passed through 
earlier this year, two key inflation driv
ers will be 
levelling off in 2012.
 The futures
-based 
assumptions on commodity prices do not signal 

any further hike over the forecast horizon.
 Overall, 
the slack in the economy and weak labour market 

conditions are expected to keep inflation in check 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   49 in 20
12. The annual rate of HICP inflation is 
expected to ease to 2.0% in the EU in 2012 (1.7% 
in the euro area), particularly on account of a sharp 

fall in the UK (from 4.3% to 2.9%). 
The forecast 
of inflation rates returning to levels of 1½
-2% is in 
line with
 break
-even inflation rates derived from 
inflation
-indexed sovereign bonds (see Graph 
I.1.54
) and 
longer
-term inflation expectations, for 
instance in the ECB's Survey of Professional 

Forecasters.
 Against the background of a slu
ggish recovery in 
2013, HICP inflation rates are expected to remain 
almost unchanged (1¾% in the EU, 1½% in the 
euro area). These figures, however, are based on 

the no
-policy
-change assumption that is applied 
where measures are not sufficiently specified f
or 
being taken into account. This could imply 

ignoring all increases in indirect taxes and 

administered prices that might exert temporary 

effects on headline HICP inflation, which could 
then result in higher rates than currently forecast 
for 2013
. ... with
 shrinking inflation dispersion across 
Member States.
 The HICP 
aggregates hide 
large
 infl
ation 
differentials across 
EU 
Member States. This year, 
HICP inflation rates
 in the Member States
 are 
expected to range from 1.1% in Ireland to 5.2% in 
Estonia and 5.9
% in Romania. As regards the euro 
area (see Graph 
I.1.55
), the differential is wider 

than expected in the 
spring forecast
. Inflation rates 
in the five largest euro
-area economies are in a 
much narrower band between 2.2% and 3.0
%. The 

two largest economies outside the euro area are 
expected to record higher inflation rates of 3.7% 
(Poland) and 4.3% (
the 
UK). -4-20

Inflation dispersion of

 Among the determinants of th
ese differentials are 

differences in the impact of higher oil prices and 

the pass
-through of increases in indirect taxes, 
whereas differences in wage growth have been of 
minor importance. In the first three quarters of 
2011 the contributions of energy pric
e increases to 
HICP inflation in the Member States varied 

between ¾ pp. in Sweden and 2¼ pps. in Latvia. In 

all Member States they exceeded the contribution 

that would have been expected according to the 

weight of energy in the HICP (see Graph 
I.1.56
). 
For instance, in the euro area, which showed 

average headline inflation in the first three quarters 
of 2.8% and an item weight of energy of 10.4%, 
the "regular" contribution would have been 0.29 

pp., but it was 1.25 pp. and thus 0

relatively small countries with exceptional

useful to extend the analyses by including

 This supplementary analysis of inflation rates 
across euro
-area population indicates that 
overall 
the inflation rates were broadly similar for 

population shares with the highest and lowest 
inflation rates. Moreover, differences between 

these groups appear to have become 
even 
smaller 
during the crisis years
.  Fiscal consolidation continues yet at a slowing 
pace–.
 The slowdown of economic 
growth
 cou
pled 
with 
the sharp deterioration of financial market 
conditions on the back of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
 are likely to weigh on 
public finance
s in the euro 
area and in the EU. 
Although 
the economic 
situation has deteriorated since the spring and high 

unce
rtainty still prevails 
at the current juncture, 
available data confirm that 2011 marks the switch 

from fiscal stabilisation to fiscal consolidation in 

the euro area and in the EU as a whole (see also 
Box 
I.1.3
). 
 In 2011, the ge
neral government deficit in the EU 
is projected to decline by about 2 pps., 
to 4.7% of 
GDP, broadly in line with the 
spring 
forecast. In 
the euro area the 
decline in the 
deficit is 
of the 

same magnitude, reaching 4.1% of GDP in 2011,
 better
 than projected
 in the spring forecast.
 Th
is relative 
improvement compared to the spring 
forecast is 
mainly
 due to additional

response to financial market pressure

the back of 
downward revisions

growth outlook.

 Budget balances are set to improve broadly across 

Member States even though increasing deficits are 

expected in some countries in one or two of the 

forecast years. 
In 2011, the budget
-balance
-to-GDP r
atio is expected to deteriorate 
markedly
 in 
Cyprus and 
Denmark
. In Denmark, it is mainly due 
to the absence of windfall revenues compared to 

2010, while in Cyprus
 the deterioration 
can be 
explained by lower
-than
-expected revenues 
and 
higher public expendit
ure
. In Hungary, the budget 
balance posts a large surplus this year 
due to a 

temporary
 effect 
of the reversal of a previous 
pension reform. In 2012, the budget 
for Hungary 
is 
forecast to return to 
deficit.

 –while debt growth moderates but from a
 higher level 
 In spite of the expected improvement in 
the 
budgetary situation of most Member States over 

the forecast period, 
government debt ratios have 
been revised slightly upwards compared to the 
spring forecast on account of the impact of interest 
expenditure on accumulated debt, of real GDP 
growth and
 inflation
 on the debt ratio as well as
 due to 
changes in the stock
-flow adjustment
. In 
2011 and 2012, the upward revision of the debt 

ratio in the euro area is mainly 
caused by
 a decrease in expected GD
P growth, both due to a 
worsening of prospects for real growth and lower 

expected inflation.
 More specifically, in the EU the gross debt ratio is 

now forecast to reach a peak of about 85% of GDP 

in 2012 and to stabilise in 2013. In the euro area, 
gross pub
lic debt is projected to rise over the 
whole forecast horizon, albeit at decreasing pace 
compared to the 2008
-10 period, breaching
 90% of 
GDP in 2012
 (see Table 
I.1.10
).  European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   52    Box I.1.3:
 Fiscal consolidation, confidence and the economic outlook.
Enduring stress on public finances and the financial 
system ha
s been a strain on the outlook
 for growth
 since spring. Fiscal consolidation is 
required
 to 
confront the sovereign debt cris
is in the euro area. 
Several countries started consolidating already in 
2010, and the majority of member countries have 
introduced sizable measures in 2011. The rise of 
sovereign borrowing rates since spring 2011 has 
reinforced the demand for fiscal auster
ity.
 Against this background, the box compares three 
scenarios in the context of high sovereign 
borrowing costs and illustrates the
ir implications
 on 
the real economy 
over the forecast horizon.
 The 
technical baseline against which the three scenarios 
are c
ompared is the spring 2011 forecast, where 
neither the rise of sovereign risk since spring 2011 
nor resulting additional consolidation measures had 
been anticipated.
 The 
three 
scenarios compare 
the implications of 
delayed versus immediate 
consolidation 
for
 output, 
private domestic demand and stock prices under 
alternative assumptions about associated 
confidence effects. The setup includes 
partial 
spillover from
 sovereign to 
private
-sector 
borrowing
 costs
, which mainly affects investment 
demand, and subdued 
consumer confidence
.(1) The exercise uses a 3
-region version of DG 
ECFIN's QUEST III model.
(2) The regions are: an 
average EMU member country, the rest of the euro 
area, and the rest of the world. The risk and 
consolidation scenarios apply to the entire eu
ro 
area, i.e. the "average EMU member" and the "rest 
of the euro area" blocks of the model.
                                                              (1) Private consumption and investment responses to fiscal 
consolidation also depend on the design of the fiscal 
measures. Private dem
and responds more positively to 
reductions in non
-productive public expenditure and 
more negatively to increases in distortionary taxes, 
which reduce labour and capital supply, potential output 
and income in the medium and longer term. For in
-depth 
analysi
s of the differentiated impact of individual 
measures see 
Chapter I.2 ("The impact of fiscal 
consolidation on Europe's economic outlook") in 
European Commission

 (2) Details on Q
UEST III and applications to policy 
analysis are available at:
 http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/research/macroeco
nomic_models_en.htm
. The three scenarios are:
 1. Delayed consolidation
 (S1):
 Consolidation of 
ex ante
 1% of GDP is announced, but its 
implementation is delayed until year 3.
(3) The 
annou
nced fiscal package includes lower 
government purchases and higher labour 
taxation, each accounting for half of the 
intended volume of consolidation. Given that 
consolidation is only announced, the sovereign
-risk premium starts at 400 basis points (bps), a
 number in the range of current risk premia for 
EMU member states, but rises in subsequent 
years by 
¼ annually. The premium declines 
gradually after the consolidation has been 
finally put in place. It is assumed that 25% of 
the sovereign premium spill over
 to private
-sector financing costs, i.e. initially 100 bps.
(4) 2. Immediate 
consolidation 
without confidence 
gain
 (S2):
 This scenario assumes an immediate 
and permanent consolidation of 
ex ante
 1% of 
GDP (50% coming from lower government 
purchases and 50% fro
m higher labour taxes) in 
year 1. There are no confidence gains in this 
scenario. Instead, risk premia remain at their 
initial level (400 bps sovereign and 100 bps 
private sector) over the forecast horizon.
 Immediate 
consolidation 
with confidence gain
 (S3): Fiscal consolidation is identical to S2 in 
structure and timing. Scenario S3, however, 
assumes consolidation to improve investor and 
consumer confidence. Sovereign
-risk premia 
start declining with the implementation of the 
package in year 1 and also redu
ce financing 
                                                           (3) Ex ante
 (planned) and 
ex post
 (effective) volumes of 
fiscal consolidation in GDP terms can (in most cases: 
do) differ due to the general
-equilibrium effects of fiscal 
measures, namely their impact on output and the tax 
bases.
 The fiscal measures in all three scenarios are 
permanen
t. (4) The shock size of 400 basis points (bp
s) in year 1 
and 
the factor ¼ for spillover to the private sector are 
illustrative. However, the 400 bp
s. are in the range of 
risk premia currently faced by several EMU countries; 
¼ risk spillover to the private
 sector has also been 
assumed in the detailed analysis of fiscal consolidation 
in the European Commission's European Economic 
Forecast in autumn 2010 and is in the range of estimates 
for (non
-EMU) economies by

  costs in the private sector. The confidence gain 
reduces the government's cost of debt servicing 
and investment costs in the private sector.
(5)
 The Graphs 1a
-d illustrate the economic impact of 
the three scenarios in an average euro
-area count
ry. 
The demand and output effects include both the 
effects from domestic consolidation and borrowing 
costs as well as the spillover from other parts of the 
euro area.
 (1) The results show that confidence gains can 
substantially reduce the contractionary i
mpact of 
fiscal consolidation, a result that stresses the 
importance of the credibility of fiscal adjustment. 
Comparing the consolidation packages without 
(S2) and with (S3) confidence improvement shows 
that the recovery of investor and consumer 
confidence
 in S3 reduces the GDP loss by more 
than one half.
 (5) The size and profile of sovereign risk and its spillover 
to the private sector in 
scenarios 
S1-S3 are introduced 
as exogenous shock to the model. They are not model
-endogenous responses to public and p
rivate 
indebtedness. In principal, QUEST has an endogenous 
channel from debt to risk, where the risk premium 
depends on the distance between actual and target debt 
levels. The calibration of this endogenous mechanism 
builds on empirical evidence from pre
-crisis periods, 
however, and does not match the size of currently 
observed sovereign spreads.
  The recovery of investment demand in S3 also has 
positive implications for output in the medium and 
longer term. Debt reduction and declining 
sovereign borrowing 
rates reduce future tax 
liabilities which also strengthens private demand.
 (2) Postponing consolidation (S1) at the expense of 
further increasing borrowing costs would postpone 
part of the output loss associated with reducing 
government purchases and incre
asing taxation, but 
deteriorating confidence would in the meanwhile 
amplify the drop in private demand. Contractionary 
effects of consolidation in S3 materialise in year 3 
and add to depressed private demand. Postponing 
consolidation will, in addition, fur
ther increase 
government debt (here by 2% of GDP compared to 
S2 in year 3), requiring stronger subsequent 
tightening.

 1.6. RISKS
 Uncertainty at the current juncture is high and 

downside risk
s to the EU outlook remain 

particularly acute. While the balance of risks to the 

growth outlook is predominantly on the downside, 
the risks to the inflation outlook appear to be 
balanced.
 Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the 

downside.
 Some downsid
e risks from earlier 
forecasts 
Œ such as financial turmoil and a lower 
momentum of global growth
 Œ have materialised 
and are now included in the central scenario. 

However, new risks have emerged, and the risk 

balance for the EU 
growth outlook 
remains now 

tilted to the downside. 
 On the downside, further financial turmoil may 

have more substantial spill
-over effects to other 
market segments and the real economy. It may 
ignite stronger and more harmful adverse feedback 
loops than currently expected. The forec
ast 

depends crucially on the assumption on current 

challenges being successfully addressed. Should 

the response to the challenges lack timeliness, 

focus or ambition, a more negative development 
and a relapse into recession cannot be excluded. 
Moreover, sig
nificant fiscal sustainability 
challenges are yet to be tackled not only within the 

EU but also in key countries outside. The resulting 

fiscal consolidation efforts, in particular if taken at 

the same time across many countries, may weigh 

more on domestic 
demand than currently 
envisaged. And inflation concerns in some of the 
emerging market economies may trigger more 

measures than currently envisaged and make the 

EU's external environment more difficult than 

assumed in the forecast.
 On the upside, should gl
obal growth turn out more 
resilient than assumed in the baseline due to 

inherent growth dynamics in emerging market 

economies, EU exports would benefit more than 

expected. A larger decline in oil prices could 

deliver greater support to real incomes and 
con
sumption.
 The uncertainty surrounding the 
euro
-area 
growth 
outlook is visualised in the fan chart (see Graph
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   55 I.1.61
) that displays the probabilities 
associated 
with various outcomes for euro

growth over the foreca
st horizon
. While the 
darkest area indicates the most likely development, 
the shaded areas represent the different 
probabilities of future economic growth within the 
growth ranges depicted on the y
-axis. As the 
balance of risks to economic growth is assess
ed as 
clearly 
tilted to the downside, the fan chart is

Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
 The risks to the outlook for inflation have become 

more balanc
ed in recent months.
 Overall, the risks 
to the inflation outlook appear balanced.
 On the downside, economic activity may shrink 

and constrain price increases more than currently 
envisaged. Any attempt of competitive 

devaluations outside the EU, e.g. by set
ting 
minimum exchange rates vis
-à-vis the euro, could 
reduce import prices and, if passed through via 
production and retail chains, lower consumer 
prices in the EU.
 On the upside, a stronger
-than
-expected rebound in 
global growth or continued unrest in oil
-exporting 
countries could result in stronger inflationary 

pressures. Moreover, the long
-time build up of 
liquidity and exceptional liquidity
-creating 
measures could eventually result in stronger
-than
-expected consumer price increases. Past periods of 

cons
umer price inflation above 2% could trigger 
currently not foreseen second
-round effects.
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   56    Box I.1.4: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut
-off date for taking new information into 
account in this 
European Economic Forecast 
was 
24 October
. The forecast incorporates validated 
public finance data from
 Eurostat's 
New
s Release 
153/2011
, dated
 21 October 
2011. External assumptions
 This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 
day, averages fro
m a 10
-day reference period 
(between 1
0 and 2
1 October
) were
 used for 
exchange
 and interest rates, and for oil prices. 
 Exchange and interest rates
 The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for a
ll currencies. This technical assumption 
leads to implied average USD/
EUR rates of 1.
40 in 
2011, 1.3
7 in 2012 and 2013. The average 
JPY/EUR rates are 11
1.2 in 2011, 1
05.6 in 2012 
and 2013.
 Interest
-rate assumptions are market
-based. 
Short
-term interest rat
es for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts. 
Long
-term interest 
rates for the euro area, as well as short
- and 
long
-term interest rates for other Member States are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread b
etween the 
interest rate and swap 
rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, the fixed spread 
vis
-à-vis the euro
-area interest rate is taken for both 
short
- and long
-term rates. As a result, short
-term 
interest rates are expected to be 1.
4% on
 average in 
2011, 1.
2% in 2012 and 
1.5% in 2013 in the euro 
area. Long
-term euro
-area interest rates are 
assumed to be 
2.7% on average in 2011, 
2.2% in 
2012 and 
2.5% in 2013.
 Commodity prices
 Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as 
possible, based 
on market conditions. According to 
futures 
markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to 
be on 
average 
111.1
 USD/bl. in 2011, 
103.8
 USD/bl. in 2012 and 
99.7
 USD/bl. in 2013. This 
would correspond to an oil price of 
79.4 EUR/bl. in 
2011, 
75.8 EUR/bl. in 20
12 and 
72.
8 EUR/bl. in 
2013.
 Budgetary data 
 Data up to 20
10 are based on data notified by 
Member States 
to the European Commission on 
1 October
 and validated by Eurostat on 2
1 October
 2011. Eurostat has 
withdrawn 
its 
reservation
s on 
the quality of the dat
a reported by Romania
 and
 the 
United Kingdom
 in the April 2011 notification
. No 
new reservations have been reported.
 In the October 2011 notification the United 
Kingdom has recorded the proceeds from the sale 
of UMTS licences of 2000 according to the 
relev
ant Eurostat decision of 14 July 2000. 
Therefore
, contrary to the past practices, 
Eurostat 
has not amended the deficit and debt data notified 
by the United Kingdom in this respect.
 For the forecast, measures in support of financial 
stability have been reco
rded in line with the 
Eurostat 
Decision of 15 July 2009
.(1) Unless 
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned, 
capital injections known in sufficient detail have 
been included in the forecast as financial 
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but n
ot the 
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 
deposits are not included as government 
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have 
been called 
on 
at the time the forecast was 
finali
sed. 
Note
, however
, that loans granted to 
banks by the g
overnment, or by other entities 
classified in the government sector, usually add to 
government debt. 
 For 201
2, budgets adopted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For 
2013, the 'no
-policy
-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 
that are known in sufficient detail. 
 The general government balances that are relevant 
for the 
Excessive 
Defic
it Procedure may be slightly 
different from those published in the national 
accounts. The difference concerns settlements 
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA). 
According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No
. 2558/2001), swap
- and FRA
-related flows a
re 
financial transactions and therefore excluded from 
the calculation of the government balance. 
However, for the purposes of the ex
cessive deficit 
procedure, such
 flows are recorded as net interest 
expenditure.

nd output 
gaps The number of working days may differ from one 
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP 
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
 However, the working
-day effect in the EU and the 
euro area i
s estimated to 
be limited over the 
forecast horizon, implying that
 adjusted and
 unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap 
does not adjust for working days. Since 
the 
working
-day effect
 is conside
red as temporary, 
it should not affect the cyclically
-adjusted balances.

KET PATTERNS I
N THE 
EU    58 2.1. INTRODUCTION
 Apart from the uncertainties about the prospects 
for the economic recovery, additional factors may 

impact the labour market at this juncture, including 

the behaviour of labour supply and the re
sponse of 
wages to the renewed economic slowdown. The 

pivotal question is the extent to which recent 

shocks emanating from the housing and banking 

sector contributed to an increasing skill
-mismatch 
in the labour market, thus impeding the efficient 

realloca
tion of labour. With job creation 
insufficient to offset the losses in employment of 
the 2008
-09 recession there are concerns about 
high unemployment becoming entrenched. The 

overall labour market outcome will thus depend on 

the shock
-related type of adjus
tment and on 
possible constraints and policy responses.
 Against this background, section 2 of this chapter 

highlights the stylised facts of the labour market 

adjustment triggered by the recession by analysing 

developments at both the aggregate and Member 

State level. Section 3 discusses the key factors 
likely to shape the labour market performance in 

the short to medium term, revealing that headcount 
employment and hours worked are subject to quite 
different dynamics. Section 4 addresses the issue 

of effici
ency of worker
-job matching
 and examines 
how the matching process has possibly evolved 

following the recession. Recent developments in 

structural unemployment are presented in section 
5, which focuses on the transition of labour from 
the shrinking construc
tion sector to expanding 
sectors. Section 6 concludes. 
 2.2. SETTING THE SCENE: E
MPLOYMENT 
PROSPECTS AND UNEMPL
OYMENT 

DEVELOPMENTS
 Headcount employment started to rise
 slowly
 in 
late 2010, 
once 
growth 
in hours 
worked began to 
level 
off. The delayed respons
e of employment to
 the recovery was the counterpart to
 labour 
hoarding during the recession and 
entailed
 a considerable rebound in labour productivity. 
Despite 
the pick
-up in economic growth in the EU, 
job creation has been weak and insufficient to 

bring a
bout a significant reduction in the 
unemployment rate (Graph 
I.2.1
). In both the euro 
area and the EU, the unemployment rate in 2010 

and 2011 
fluctuated only marginally and 
remained 

persistently high
 at 10.0
% in the euro area an
d 9.5% in the EU respectively 
(Table 
I.2.1
). Graph I.2.1:

The outlook for the EU labour market, which proved rather resilient during the 2008
-09 recession and 
began to create jobs again by the end of 2010, has markedly deteriorated and continues to exhibit 
significant cross
-country differences. The pick
-up of employment that set in during the last quarter of 
2010 has not been sufficient to bring about a significant reduction in the EU unemployment rate. With a 
waning growth momentum, country
-specific labour market weaknesses 
are further exposed and tend to 
compound already weakened employment prospects. Displaced workers may face longer periods of 
unemployment and more jobs may be cut than are created. With job creation being inadequate concerns 
are reinforced that unemploymen
t in Europe eventually may become entrenched. Furthermore, in times 
of heightened uncertainty, the downside risks to the recovery of the labour market have clearly 
increased, as suggested by the rapid worsening of hiring intentions and of consumers' unempl
oyment 
expectations during the last months.

    59 2012. Given
 the usually lagged
 impact 
of GDP 
growth 
on employment, the unemployment rate is 
expected to 
remain mainly unchanged over the 
forecast horizon
. Employment in the EU and the 
euro area 
is likely to be stuck
 below levels 
reached
 before the 2008
-09 recession. With this 
deteriorated economic outlook, the 
net
 effect o
f job 
creation and job destruction will depend on the 

capacity of firms to adjust labour costs 
either 
through wages 
or hours worked as well as on the 
reallocation 
needs 
within the economy 
and the 
prevailing 
policy 
context
. Employment growth at the sectoral level
 The overall evolu
tion of employment 
results from
 different patterns at
 the
 sectoral level. During the 
2008-09 recession the bulk of job losses was 
concentrated 
in sectors 
that
 resorted
 only to a 
limited extent 
to working 
time
 adjustment
. Yet, the 
decline
 of employment 
exce
eded
 the abrupt 
shrinking of the workforce
 in the construction 
sector 
following the
 collapse of the housing 
bubble. 
Despite
 the widespread use of short
-time 
working schemes, the recession also 
compounded
 the historical downward trend of employment in 

manuf
acturing. The significant 
shift
 in the 
employment 
structure 
brought 
about 
by the 
recession 
is possibly linked
 to the excess capacity 
in different industries 
and to employers' concerns
 that GDP losses 
incurred 
during the recession 
may 
be permanent. Looking 
forward, the uncertainties 
surrounding
 the sovereign
-debt 
crisis 
may 
result in 
tighter
 credit
 conditions, causing 
 difficulties f
or companies o
r households to obtain loan
s and 
harming
 employment. 
This especially applies to 
industries that rely on customers
 who 
finance their

% The labour market deterioration 
sparked by
 the 
recession
 proved particularly acute in the Baltic 
countries, Spain, 
and 
Ireland. Considerab
le job 
losses were also recorded in Bulgaria, Denmark, 
Portugal, Slovakia, and 
Finland
. By contrast, 
labour markets were resilient in Austria, Malta, 
Luxemburg
 and especially in Germany, where past 
reforms and more flexible working
-time 
arrangements contri
buted to a better than expected 
performance (Box 
I.2.1
). In general, countries hit 
by the burst
ing
 of housing bubbles and constrained 
in their policy manoeuvre by external and fiscal 

imbalances 
were the most affected in terms of
 job 
losses.
 In the second quarter of 2011, e
ight 
countries exhibited unemployment rates above 

12% (the three Baltic
 countrie
s, Spain, Ireland, 
Greece, Portugal and Slovakia). 
By contrast, t
he 
unemployment rate 
was
 below 7
.2%
 (i.e. below the 
EU average 
pre
vailing before the 
recession
) in 
seven
 countries. The unemployment rate is back at 
or below pre
-recession
 levels in Austria and 
Germany, Belgium and 
Poland
. As a consequence 

of these di
vergent 
developments, 
the
 large
r share 
of unemployment is now concentra
ted in relatively 
few countries. Before the 2008
-09 recession, 
Spanish
 unemploy
ment
 represented only 10% 
(20%) of total EU (euro area) unemployment, a 

proportion comparable to the country's share in 

total population. With about 4.8 million 

unemployed in 
Q2-2011, 
this proportion account
s now 
for about one fifth and one third
 of total 
unemployment in the EU and the euro area
 respectively
. An opposite evolution has been 
taking place in Germany
, where the share in total 
EU unemployment declined 
between the seco
nd 
quarter of 2007 and the same period in 2011 
from 

30% to 16%.
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   61    Box I.2.1: 
The German labour market during the recession
The resilience of the German labour market during 
the crisis has surprised many observers and raises 
questions on the reasons behind. Indeed, 
employment remained remarkably stable during the 
recessio
n and 
has been
 developing favourably in 
the subsequent recovery
. While real GDP 
contracted by 
5.1% in 2009 and expanded by 3.7% 
in 2010, changes in activity, employment and 
unemployment rates were relatively moderate 
(Graphs 1 and 2). The activity rate kep
t almost 
constant and even showed a slight increase in 2009. 
The employment rate remained at around 70%, 
after having increased significantly in the years 
previous to the 
recession
. The unemployment rate 
increased slightly to 7.8% in mid
-2009, before 
falli
ng below the pre
-recession
 level already in 
2010; it 
continued to decline
 in 2011, down to 
6.0% in August. The labour market is expected to 
improve further, albeit at a slower pace than before. 
In all, the unemployment rate decrease observed 
since early 20
08 is stronger than what Okun's law 
would have predicted.

% The impact of the 
recession
 differed across sectors, 
regions and types of employment. The 
manufacturing sector was most affected by the fall 
in exports, registering a decrease in employment 
and more notably in the number of hours worked
. Some services such as business services, 
telecommunication or transport and storage were 
also affected by the 
recession
, but overall the 
service sector remained stable and some services 
even recorded increases in employment and/or 
hours worked. While une

. First and 
foremost, j
ob losses affected temporary workers 
(temporary agency workers and fixed
-term 
contracts).
 The structural developments of the last decade and 
the reforms undertaken before the 
recession
 are 
likely to have contributed to some extent to the 
resilie
nce of the German labour market.
 The 
sectoral composition of the German economy 
has 
been
 changing, with a shift from manufacturing 
towards the service sector. The traditionally strong 
manufacturing sector 
has been
 increasingly relying 
on temporary workers 
who could be laid off during 
the 
recession
, but the core labour force in the sector 
has 
remained covered by strict dismissal protection 
legislation. The reluctance of the manufacturing 
sector to reduce employment 
probably also 
reflects 
the expectation of a
 quick recovery, the solid 
financial situation before the 
recession
 and an 
increasing tightness in certain segments of the 
labour market.
 Moreover, Germany had undertaken a number of 
reforms that resulted in higher flexibility of the

be expla
ined by divergent GDP developments 

alone. Other relevant factors include differences in 

the extent of adjustment of working hours, 
different needs of reallocating labour across 
sectors, notably away from construction, different 

economic and institutional f
rameworks and 
heterogeneous policy responses. Thus, the sizeable 

increase in unemployment in countries affected by 
the bust of housing bubbles was not only due to the 

severity of the recession. Moreover, the adjustment 

in terms of working hours and labour 
hoarding was 

far less prevalent in the shrinking construction 
sector while the share of temporary workers was 
much higher, which contributed to the large extent 

of dismissals on short notice.

  labour market. The 
Har
tz reforms introduced 
between 2003 and 2006 gave rise to 
the
 reorganisation of employment services, changes in 
the regulation of some forms of employment (e.g. 
publicly
-funded low
-wages contracts and self
-employed, temporary employment) and a far
-reaching 
reform of the unemployment and social 
benefit system. The duration of unemployment 
insurance benefits was reduced, the criteria for the 
decline of jobs offered were restricted, and the 
wage
-related assistance scheme for unemployed 
who had exhausted the une
mployment insurance 
benefits was merged with the social assistance 
scheme, leading 
in sum 
to a reduction of benefits 
for long
-term unemployed. 
The reforms are 
likely 
to have contributed to improve the functioning of 
the labour market
. Even though 
long
-term
 unemployment as a percentage of total 
unemployment has decreased in Germany over the 
last years, the ratio remains higher than in other 
countries with low unemployment rates, such as the 
Netherlands (where it decreased significantly 
after
 2006), Austria o
r Luxembourg.
 Flexibility within firms has also increased 
substantially. The traditional system of sectoral, 
multi
-employer bargaining at the regional level has 
lost ground and the use of opening clauses allowing 
firms to deviate from collective agreements
 has 
increased. In most cases opening clauses are related 
to working time arrangements, e.g. the use of 
working time accounts or variable working hours. 
Opening clauses have been used to protect 
employment in exchange of concessions on 
payment or working c
onditions (
alliances for jobs
). 
In addition, the use of non
-regular contracts has 
spread following a gradual liberalisation of fixed
-term contracts and temporary agency work, while 
the employment protection legislation of permanent 
contracts remains relati
vely strict. The 2000 
act on 
part
-time work also encouraged more frequent 
recourse to part
-time work.
 Wage increases were moderate during the last 
decade, with real wages increasing less than 
productivity (

 Finally, the government responded to the 
recession
 with a set of measures which contributed to reduce 
its impact on the labour market. In particular, t
he 
public short
-time work scheme was modified 
regarding the maximum duration, the exemptions 
from social security contributions of hours not 
worked and the administrative requirements. The

UR MARKET 
DEVELOPMENTS
 In 2010, the EU 
economy witnessed a recovery, 
although the adjustment in the labour market 
lagged behind. This section reviews the reasons for 
the delayed labour market recovery in Europe. The 

matching of vacant posts with the unemployed and 

the risk that high cyclical un
employment translates 
into high equilibrium unemployment is discussed 
in the next sections. 
 First
, the decline in hours worked per employee 
during the recession was a key factor in 

minimising the rise of unemployment in several 

countries and implies that 
firms largely responded 
to the subsequent increase in economic activity via 
an expansion of 
hours worked
.(32) This translated 
into strong productivity growth (per person 

employed) coupled with relatively muted 

employment dynamics
. The latest figures for 201
1 indicate that the 
increase in 
hours worked 
came to a 
halt 
durin
g the first quarter of the year,
 in 
line
 with 
the sharp GDP adjustment in the second quarter
. In 
turn, this fading growth momentum 
may point to 
limited employment growth over the medium term

 Second
, the bulk of job losses of the 2008
-09 
recession 
fell upon
 the young. In 2011, 
the 
labour 
market situation f
or young people
 (aged 15
-24) 
strongly deteriorated in many Member States, 

culminating in an
 increase in the
 aggregate youth 
unemployment rate of about 6 pps
. compared 
with
 2007 (Table 
I.2.1
). I
n the second quarter of 2011
, the y
outh
 unemployment rate reached nearly 21
%. The young are a vulnerable group for several 
                                                           (32) Between Q2
-2009 and Q2
-2011 the hours worked per 
capita grew by about 1%, while employment remai
ned 
mainly unchanged.
 reasons. They have 
rather 
little work experience
 and their short 
tenure usually implies limited 

access to unemployment benefits.
 Given that the 
young
 are frequently emp
loyed on the basis of 
temporary contracts,
 they 
were also 
relatively 
strongly hit by the recession in comparison to other 
age groups. 
Th
e substantial
 and persistent fall in 
job creation coupled with 
the 
shedding 
of 
temporary job
s led to a major increase in
 the youth 
unemployment rate in most EU countries, reaching 
worrisome levels in Spain, the Baltics, Greece, 

Slovakia, Italy, Ireland
 and
 Portugal (Table 
I.2.1
). Youth unemployment can also have substantial 
negative long
-term eff
ects. 
Research indicates that 
the longer the young remain unemployed
, the 
higher the probability that they 
will 
become 
disconnected from the labour market (i.e. 
withdraw 
from the labour force so as to become inactive
) or 
they 
will 
have worse labour market 
outcomes in 
the future 
Œ the so
-called scarring effects of 
unemployment (Bell and Blanchflower, 
2009).
 One underlying reason is that
 skills acquired 
during education deteriorate fast if not put to use. 
Moreover, when employers are uncertain about the 

produ
ctivity of a potential worker, they may use 
earlier 
periods of 
unemployment as a 
signalling 
device in their hiring process and recruit those with 

shorter unemployment 
spells
. Seniority rules may 
also play a role when a firm has to reduce the 

workforce (i.e
. less experienced workers have to 
leave earlier). Finally, 
being part of 
a large pool of 

unemployed reduces the stigma of unemployment 

and 
thus lessens 
the intensity of job search
.(33)  Third
, during the 2008
-09 recession the 
participation rate
 evolved
 bet
ter than expected
. In 
spite of a large fall in output, 
participation
 rates (at 
71.2% and 71.5% 
in the second quarter of 2011 in
 
the EU and the euro area
 respectively) were 
generally highly resilient
 in almost all Member 
States (Table 
I.2.1
), an unusual development 
compared to the pro
-cyclical
ity of
 participation 
rate
s during
 previous recessions. This resilience is 
a feature 
that 
distinguish
es the
 EU 
from
 the US, 
where in the second quarter of 2011 participation 

reached the lowest
 rate since 1984 (64%).
(34) The 
development
 of 
the 
labour supply in Europe was 
driven by a steep increase in 
the female 
                                                           (33) For a review of the effects of the recession on youth

. (34) In the U
S the participation rate refers to the population 
aged 16 years and over. For the EU and the euro area, the 
corresponding 
rates 
(16
-74 
years)
 are
 around 63.5%.

   64 participation

(up by 1 pp
. to 65% 
in the EU 
and the euro area
 respectively) and a decline 
in male participation
 (by 0.5 and 0.7 pp
. in the EU 
and the euro area
 respectively). While the 
participation rate of older workers kept rising 
in 
line with
 the pre
-recession
 trend
, the 
corresponding rate for 
young adults (aged between 
19 and 24) 
declined
.(35) Older workers' 
participation rose partl
y because of 
pension 
reforms 
that increased the 
retirement age and 
have 
limited the access to 
early retirement schemes
, and 
partly 
also 
because of concerns about pension 
income
s following the 
crisis
-induced 
losses of 
pension funds. 
The increasing share of 
women in 
the total workforce
, especially through
 more 
mothers entering the labour market, 
was mainly 
linked to increased income and employment risks 
of male earners (the so
-called added worker 
effect). Although the behaviour of labour supply 
may have contr
ibute
d to 
persistently
 high 
unemployment 
levels in some countries, the 
resilience of EU 
participation
 rates bodes well for 
the recovery, as 
a high participation rates 
are the 
key to restor
ing
 employment rates to pre
-recession
 levels. However, it 
remains an
 open question
 if 
participation rates w
ill prove 
resilient in a context 
of prolonged weak job prospects.
(36) Fo
urth
, a further
 element that may explain the 
belated
 and rather subdued
 response of 
employment to output growth in 2010 is 
pending 
uncertainty
 on 
the strength and
 sustainability of 
the recovery
.(37) The combined effect of weaker 
growth and heightened uncertainty may 
induce
 firms to postpone hiring, thus delaying the 

recovery of employment
. The availability of 
flexible employment practices may allow f
irms to 
adjust
 recruitment
 more 
to cyclical developments. 
The fact that employment creation in 2010 took 

place especially in terms of temporary and part
-time jobs confirms the role played by uncertainty, 
                                                           (35) In the US the participation rate of young adults has 
increased during the recession; the reduced supply of credit 
to students and the wealth losses of their parents may have 
induced the young to search for a job to finance their 
studies;

to the second

201
1,
 temporary contracts expanded 
by
 8.3%
 in the EU 
against a rate of 1.6% for total employment
. Economic developments at the aggregated level
   65 shows that the growth rate of compensation per 
employee was below the Phillips curve. This 

evidence supports the view that the variable 

component of wages adjusted faster to
 labour 
market slack than the negotiated component.
 Wage d
evelopments were very heterogeneous 
across Member States. In non

 wages 
in 2010 
grew at a robust rate in Bulgaria, 
Poland and the 
Czech Republic,
 but
 continued to 
decline
 in Latvi
a and Lithuania

slower rate
 than in 2009, as well as in Hungary
. In 
the euro area
 compensation per employee remained 
close to the 
levels
 of 2009, but varied considerably 
across 
Members
 States
. Compensation per 
employee declined in Greece,
 Ireland, and Malta 
while 
in 
Spain 
the level remained unchanged 
following strong wage growth in previous years.
 By contrast, Cyprus
, Luxembourg, 
Slovenia
, Slovakia, 
and Finland 
recorded growth rate
s in 
compensation per employee well above the euro 

area average. These uneven developments reflect 
different exposure
s to the recession, 
the 
need 
for
 rebalancing in some countries and 
institutional
 labour market
 settings
. More importantly, it 
appears that 
real wage adjustment 
set in
 in 
countries with 
higher
 unemployment only in 2010. 
In fact, Graph 
I.2.7
 shows that until 2009 
the 
upward trend of 
real wage
s was
 in fact
 stronger in 
countries with worse unemployment outcomes.
(39) The
 remarkable productivity improvement, 
coupled with wage moderation, resulted in a 
reduction in unit labour costs for the euro area and

to support
 the external rebalancing of EU

are likely to be short

working hours after labour hoarding during the 

recession
. Sixth
, displaced workers are not necessarily suit
ed to fill new 
vacancies
, which translates in
to 
longer 
spells of unemployment
. Long peri
ods of 
unemployment entail a deterioration of skills and 

ultimately an increase in structural unemployment. 

Higher structural unemployment, however, 

requires more labour market slack to keep wage 
developments under control. After having 
temporarily fallen 
in the early stages of the 

recession, long
-term unemployment (i.e. 
unemployment spells lasting for more than a year) 

has rapidly increased, due to new displaced 

workers joining the existing stock of unemployed. 
In the second quarter of 2011, the share of l
ong-term unemployment in the EU reached 43%, 
though with large differences across countries, 

ranging from less than 20% in Finland, Sweden 

and Cyprus to almost 70% in Slovakia (Table 

I.2.1
). Compared with the second quarter of 2
009, 
its share doubled or almost doubled in the Baltic 
countries, Ireland and Spain. Among countries 
with low unemployment rates, the share of long
-term unemployment declined in Belgium, 

Germany, the Czech Republic, and the 

Netherlands. The extension of un

duration might be linked to a series of factors, 
notably a persistently low rate of job creation.

schemes are also likely to determine employment 

prospects at the country level.
 Additionally, the analysis of 
job market f
lows
 (i.e. 
inflows into and outflows from unemployment) 

can also shed some light on unemployment 

prospects. In this regard, it is instructive to 

examine whether the rise in unemployment is due 

to an increase in the job destruction rate or to a 

decline in t
he job finding rate.
(40) Moreover, the 
inflow and outflow rates determine the degree of 

turnover in the unemployment pool and the 

persistence of unemployment. Graph 
I.2.8
 shows 
the development of job separation
(41) and job 
finding
 rates based on unemployment duration 
data. Before the crisis both rates were trending 

upwards, implying an increase in the degree of 

worker reallocation (the sum of the job finding and 

separation rates).
(42) With the economy entering 
recession, the unemplo
yment rate started to rise 
due to higher separation rates and lower job 

finding rates. After reaching a peak at the turning 
point quarter of GDP (Q2
-2009), the separation 
rate started to decline, while the job finding rate 
remained at a persistently low le
vel. Although the 
flow into the pool of unemployed did not increase 

further, it is mainly the low job finding rate that 

explains the persistently high unemployment rate 
and the longer spells of unemployment in the 
EU.

DETERIORATED?
 Several
 factors may have contributed to the 
increase in long
-term unemployment in the EU, 
including the preference of employers to hire 
people with short spells of unemployment, which 
became more relevant during the 
recession
; the 
difficulty of screening a large number of job 

seekers because of incomplete knowledge about 

their charac
teristics (congestion effects);
(44) the 
deterioration of wo
rkers' skills during 
unemployment; displaced workers facing financial 

constraints may have found it difficult to move to 
locations where jobs are abundant;
 and
 increased
 mismatch between labour demand and sector
-specific skills. 
Furthermore, government pol
icies 
put in place after the recession could have had an 
impact. 
Notably, the coverage and generosity of 
unemployment benefits ha
ve been raised in a 
number of EU countries.
 By reducing the costs of 
unemploy
ment
 and thus lowering 
the intensity of 
job search
, these measures may have lengthened the 
duration of unemployment.
(45) However, 
the 
increase in generosity has been accompanied by a 

tighten
ing of 
eligibility conditions
. As a 
consequence, 
the 
overall 
effect on the 
unemployed 
persons' 
intensity of job searc
h is likely to be 
lim
ited.
                                                            (44) This is also related to an imperfect adjustment of wages 
and to the lim
ited mobility of workers.
 (45) See European Com
mission
, Economic crisis in Europe: 
causes, consequences and responses
, European Economy
, 7, 2009, 
for a review of policy responses to the crisis in the 
EU Member States. For the US the effect on the 
unemployme
nt rate of extended duration of unemployment 
benefits ranges from 0.7 
pp. 
to 1.7 pps
. However, the effect 
is much lower when one takes into account the different 

eligibility to benefits of displaced workers (
see 
Daly
, M.
 et 
al., 
A Rising Natural Rate of Un
employment: Transitory or 
Permanent?, 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
Working Paper
, 2011
-05, 
2011).
 Given low job finding rates and rather large job 
separation rates the duration of unemployment is 

likely to increase in many Member States. Job 

losses may translate into longer spells of 
unemployment, which would in turn lead to 
a deterioration of human capital and eventually to a 
rising skill mismatch between available vacancies 
and job seekers. As a result, unemployment may 

become more persistent and increase the likelihood 

of a fall in labour supply.
 The Beveridge curve represe
nts the relationship 

between unemployment and job vacancy rates
(46) and conveys essential information about labour 

market tightness and the impact of shocks on the 

efficiency of labour market matching. Over the 
business cycle this relationship exhibits a ne
gative 
co-movement, with many vacancies and low 
unemployment when the economy is growing and 
vice versa when it is contracting. This leads to 

movements along the curve. Shifts of the curve 
Œ i.e. positive co
-movements between vacancies and 
unemployment 
Œ reflect changes in the 
effectiveness of the matching process, possibly 
related to skill mismatches and sectoral or regional 
immobility. 
 Until the second half of 2009, the curve did not 

exhibit a clear shift, which is consistent with weak 

demand for labour.
 However, unemployment 
hovered around 10% in 2010 and 2011 while the 
labour market became tighter, which hints at a 
possible deterioration of the matching (Graph 

I.2.11
). Shifts in the Beveridge curve might be 
temporary or coul
d rather signal structural changes 
in the labour market. The latter view is supported 

by Graph 
I.2.12
, which shows that the change in 
the unemployment rate and the evolution of 

structural unemployment
(47) move together, and 
that
 this co
-movement is particularly evident in 
recent years. The change in the unemployment rate 
is in this case due to the deterioration in matching. 
                                                             (46) The vacancy rate is defined as the number of unfilled jobs 
as a share of the labour force.
 (47) Structural unemployment is here defined as the non
-accelerating wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU), i.e. 

the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation. It is 
analysed in more detail in section 2.5.
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   68   Box I.2.2:
 The effect of skill mismatches on unemployment
The burden of the 2008
-09 recession 
was not 
evenly spread across different economic groups. 
Together with the young, t
he less qualified have 
been hit hard
est
. Between 2008 and 2010, low
-skill
ed labo
ur 
in the EU declined by 9% (7% in the 
euro area), while high
ly qualified
 employment
 grew at about 6% both in the EU and the euro area
. The 
structural adjustment 
launched
 by the recession 
has entailed
 the need for 
an extensive 
inter
-sectoral 
reallocation
 of labour. However, 
the mismatch 
between the skills of workers who exited shrinking 
sectors and the skills 
required 
in expanding ones is 
likely to 
induce longer spells of unemployment
. Following Estevao and Tsounta (2011),
(1)
 a skill 
mismatch index 
(SMI) 
is computed 
representing 
the gap between the average proportion of 
the 
low
-, medium
- and high
-skilled 
in the working age 
population 
and the corresponding proportion in 
employment
. In symbols, for country 
i the index is
 312jijtijtitmsSMI where 
ijts is the 
share of the working population 
with skill level j in country i at time t; 
ijtmis the 
equivalent share in employment.
 Graph
 1 reports the SMI by country for 2007 and 
2010; countries are ranked in decreasing order of
 the change in the index
 between the two periods
. Unsurprisingly, s
kill mismatches 
have 
increased 
after 2007 in countries hit by the bu
rst of 
a housing 
bubble. It is noteworthy, however, that also 
countries 
which did not suffer from major 
imbalances in the
 housing sector before the 
recession and thus did not register any substantial 
employment
 losses
 in construction
 afterwards, 
exhibit a rising level of skill mismatch

reduction of unemployment would require a 

stronger degree of wage adjustment. The evidence

 2.5. TREND AND DETERMINAN
TS OF 
STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYM
ENT IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF THE REC
ESSION
 The previous section has sh
own that labour market 
matching worsen
ed in the euro area and that this 
deterioration 
coincides with
 estimates of 
a higher 
NAWRU
. Looking ahead, these trends raise the 
concern that the phenomenon of ﬁunemployment 
hysteresisﬂ will 
re-emerge
 in Europe
, as 
it did 
in 
the 
1980s following 
'stagflation
' induced by oil 
price 
shocks. There is a risk that, in spite of a 
cyclical rebound, unemployment could remain 

persistently above pre
-recession
 levels. Moreover, 
higher
 long
-term unemployment 
might 
increas
e the 
numbe
r of workers 
who become
 discouraged 
or 
are 
hardly employable, 
and who 
thus exit the 
labour force
. These
 tendencies 
will 
eventually 
impinge upon the recovery of employment rates in 

the future.
 Moderate growth and macroeconomic 

uncertainties during the recov
ery phase have 

heightened those concerns, calling for a close 

monitoring of developments in structural 
unemployment. The presented econometric 
analysis of structural unemployment in EU 

countries is based on a panel data study in order to 

investigate the re
lative performance across 
countries in terms of underlying structural factors. 

In addition, Boxes 
I.2.3
 and 
I.2.4
 examine the 
impact of different types of shocks on structural 
unemployment. Box 
I.2.3
 reports simulations using 
a structural macro model that assess the impact of 
workers displacement away from the construction 

sector following the bursting of a housing bubble. 

A discussion of the magnitude and dynamics of 

such a
 shock, which is particularly relevant for 
countries like Ireland and Spain, is also presented. 

In Box 
I.2.4
, a model estimated for Spain 
illustrates the types of shocks affecting an 

economy during the recent recession, highligh
ting 

implications for its labour market.
 2.5.1.
 Recent trends in structural 
unemployment across the EU
 Structural unemployment is defined as the 'natural' 
rate of unemployment that the economy would 

settle at in the long run, i.e. in the absence of 

shocks.
 Its level is determined both by institutional 
factors and quasi
-fiscal parameters (unemployment 
benefits, tax rates) which influence the reservation 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   70 wage.
(49) The structural unemployment rate cannot 
be directly observed empirically but has to be 
estimated.
 The European Commission uses a so
-called 
unobserved component model to estimate 
structural unemployment. The method's aim is to 
remove all short
-term fluctuations based on the 
assumption that short
-term unemployment 
fluctuations (i.e. cyclical unemploymen
t) affect 
wage inflation, while trend unemployment (i.e. 

structural unemployment) does not 
Œ i.e. the trend 
component is the NAWRU.
(50)  Given that this estimation only provides an 

approximation for the structural unemployment 
rate, it cannot be excluded th
at (persistent) shocks 
bias this trend estimate. Therefore, the NAWRU 
should be interpreted a medium
-term estimate (i.e. 
still including persistent shocks effects) rather than 

a purely structural unemployment rate estimate. 

This distinction will further be
 discussed in this 
section when providing evidence on the empirical 

importance of persistent shocks to the NAWRU 
series.
 Graph 
I.2.13
 shows the evolution of the NAWRU 
over the past decades. The series depicts a steady 
increase 
up to the mid
-1990s followed by an 
improvement, which was interrupted by the recent 

recession. Table 
I.2.3
 and Graph 
I.2.14
 summarise 
the NAWRU estimates across EU countries and 

the US over the recen
t period. The estimates 
suggest that the increase in the NAWRU since the 

recession concerned both the EU and the euro area 

and confirm the relatively worse performance of 

the US. Such general tendencies point to the 
existence of common shocks across countr
ies.
                                                            (49) The concept of the reservation w
age refers to the level of 
wage below which the worker would not accept a job offer.

 Explaining recent NAWRU developments 
across the EU countries
 While it is true that recent movements in the 
NAWRU for the EU15, depicted in Graph 
I.2.15
, appear moderate in regard to their increases in 
the 
1970s and the 
1980s, it
 remains of high policy 
relevance to understand the recent rise in the 

NAWRU, especially its likely persistence. This 

section addresses the issue by analysing the 

underlying factors driving NAWRU developments.
 Explaining structura
l unemployment across 
countries requires taking into consideration labour 

markets' institutional differences.
(52) Accordingly, 
the empirical literature relies to a large part on 

panel regressions featuring structural indicators 

These include the level of un
employment 
insurance benefits, (i.e. the replacement rate), the 

level of the labour tax wedge,
(53) the degree of 
union density, the degree of employment 
                                                           (51) Note that Poland (which posts a significant decline) is not 
highlighted as 
the 
volatile unemployment rate in that 
country pose challenges for NAWRU estimation 
and 
results are 
subject to
 relatively high uncertainty.
 (52) For an extensive discussion see Blanchard O. and J. 
Wolfers
, The role of shocks and institutions in the rise of 
European unemployment: the aggregate evidence, 
The 
Economic Journal
, 110
 (462), Marc
h 2000, pp. C1
-C33
. (53) For empirical evidence on the role of the labour tax wedge 
see for instance OECD
, Employment Outlook
, chapter 7:
 Reassessing the role of policies and institutions for labour 
market performance: a quantitative analysis
, Paris 2006, 
pp. 207
-231
. protection legislation, the minimum wage level, or 
the degree of mismatch in the labour market.
(54) A cor
responding panel covering 14 EU countries 
(the subset for which data were available), is 
estimated with the NAWRU as dependent variable 
using four structural indicators as regressors. A 
trend is added to the regression to account for the 
portion of common 
shocks with similar pass
-through across countries. Table 
I.2.4
 shows 
significant and correctly signed coefficients for all 

variables, and magnitudes are broadly in line with 

similar studies.
(55) The coefficient of the 
replacement
 rate variable is relatively low, 
however. This could be due to the fact that the 

variable is not able to fully capture the degree of 
generosity of the unemployment benefit scheme, 
as it does not account for the duration of benefit 

entitlements.

s. 
Broad changes in the NAWRUs are generally well 

captured by the 
data
, suggesting that they are 
related to changes in the structural indicators 
included in the panel. The ability of the fit to 
capture the decline in the NAWRU in the 

Netherlands in the mid
-1990s is a case in point. 
The labour tax wedge and employment protection 

legislation saw significant declines in th
e country 
over that period. The panel also captures the 

flattening of the trend in Belgium since the end of 
the 
1990s, related to a 
decreasi
ng labour tax wedge 
and union density and a decline in the 
unemployment benefit replacement rate. In Finland 

and in Italy the moderation in the NAWRU since 

the mid
-1990s is matched by the fit, which reflects 
an 
improvement in all four indicators in the cas
e of 
Finland and a decline in employment protection 

legislation and union density (as well as a flattening 

of the other two indicators) in the case of Italy
.                                                            (54) For e
vidence of increased relevance of labour mismatch

. (55) The R2 for the estimation is around 0.7. Results are, for 
instance, comparable
 to 
those reported in Blanchard and 
Wolfers (2000), 
ibid.
 European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   72 As mentioned b
efore
, the fit of the panel fails to 
reflect medium
-term developments 
Œ i.e. 
the 
temporary volatility of the NAWRU. For instance, 
large swings around the fit in countries like Spain, 
Ireland, Greece and the U
nited Kingdom suggest
 that 
the NAWRU might 
also 
be affected by other
, more 
persistent
 factors. 
Another reason for the rather poor 
fit in some cases is possibly related to
 econometric 
limitations, such as data quality issues or 
specification problems (e.g. omitted structural 
indicators
). As stated, a maj
or problem of the NAWRU 
estimate is that rather persistent shocks feed into 
the results, which therefore do not solely reflect 

structural developments in the labour market. 

Supporting this view is the fact that a number of 
countries witnessing volatile NAW
RUs have also 
been those experiencing housing market boom
-bust episodes, which cause persistent shocks to the 
economy. To account more formally for the claim 

that persistent shocks such as housing boom
-busts 
can affect NAWRU estimates, a variable 

controlli
ng for the presence of such effects is 

added to the panel regression. The variable 

captures the proportion of persons 
working in the 
construction sector. Intuitively, countries with a 

large variation in the size of the construction sector 

are expected to 
be subject to
 severe housing
 boom
-bust effects. Adding this variable, which turns out 

to be significant in the panel, improves the fit for a 

number of countries.

NAWRU and fit based on a panel regression 1970-2008
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   73    Box I.2.3:
 The role of a housing market shock
This box illustrates the impact of the bursting of a 
housing bubble on sectoral and total employment 
using the Commission
's structural macro
-economic 
model QUEST. The simulations suggest that the size 
of the co
ntraction in construction investment 
observed in some euro
-area Member States can lead 
to a siz
eable reduction not only in construction but 
also in total employment. In addition, unemployment 
initiating from the downturn in the housing market is 
likely to 
remain high for a number of years, thereby 
also influencing NAWRU estimates
. A small
-open
-economy version of QUEST 
is used, 
with trade shares and expenditure ratios calibrated 
to Spain. The model features tradable and 
non-tradable goods
-production sectors 
with trade in 
final goods and intermediate inputs as well as a 
house construction sector which employs 10% of 
the total labour force in the steady state calibrated 
to match the average construction
-employment
-to-total
-employment ratio in Spain between 1980
 and 

2010. Frictions in inter
-sectoral labour mobility are 
captured by imperfect substitution between labour 
supplied to goods and house production sectors. 
The 
downturn in the housing market 
is captured 
by the 
increase in the risk premium on housing inves
tments 
which generates a drop in house construction 
investment by around 30% in the model, roughly in 
line with the drop in this indicator observed in Spain 
between 2007 and 201
1. 
 The simulation results (displayed in 
Graph 1
) show 
that a downturn in the h
ousing market of the 
observed size can directly cause a severe drop in 
construction employment by a similar magnitude, 
which tracks the evolution in Spanish construction 
employment data quite well. The housing shock 
and resulting negative demand effects le
ad to a fall 
in total employment by around 4%. This is larger 
than the reduction in employment purely accounted 
for by the fall in house
-construction employment
, which points to additional negative second
-round 

effects of the housing bust on the total econ
omy. At 
the same time, the drop in total employment in the 
model does not fully match the observed fall in 
total employment in Spain, suggesting that factors 

beyond the housing downturn also played an 
important role in the Spanish labour market.
 This negat
ive impact of the housing downturn on 
the labour market is likely to be highly persistent 
for various reasons. 
 Firstly
, both earlier housing bust episodes and data 
of the current cycle suggest that the fall in housing 
demand per se is likely to be long
-lasting and may 
not return to pre
-bust peak levels at all. Finnish and 
Swedish housing busts in the early nineties e.g. 
lasted 4 to 7 years from peak to trough in house 
construction investment
. Additional 7 years of 
recovery to pre
-bust levels 
were needed 
in Finland 
while in Sweden housing 
investment never actually 
reached its 1989 peak level ever since. Also, in 
countries most concerned by the housing bust today, 
such as Spain or Ireland, the house
-construction
-investment
-to-GDP ratio reached peak levels by 
2006 which largely exceeded the average values of 
the past three decades
, suggesting that a full recovery 
is unlikely to happen
. Secondly, (other things equal) employment is likely 
to remain subdued throughout the downturn in the 
housing market because of 
the low substitution (or 
even complementarity) between housing 
investment and other domestic demand items and 
the resulting fall in total demand. Finally, frictions 
in sectoral reallocation on the labour market itself 
can also hinder the recovery of employ
ment in 
addition to the previous factors.
 Based on the afore
-mentioned Finnish and Swedish 
episodes, we illustrate two potential scenarios in 
the simulations: one with a very persistent 
downturn (thick solid line in 
Graph 1)
 and an 
alternative one with a s
horter fall and a faster 
recovery (thin solid line) with the size of the fall in 
house construction investment kept similarly at 
30%. 
The
 simulations suggest that unemployment 
would not return to its initial low level until up to 

ten years after the start 
of the downturn even in 
case of the more optimistic less protracted 
downturn scenario. In case of the long
-lasting 
downturn, unemployment initiating from the 
housing market could remain around 3% above the 
baseline for a very long period.
 Given the length 
of these cycles and given the 
method by which the NAWRU is calculated (i.e. 
the extraction of the medium
- to long
-term 
component from the observed unemployment rate), 
labour market pressures caused by the housing 
cycle are likely to influence the NAWRU in 
the 
upcoming years.

   75    Box I.2.4:
 Demand and supply factors driving the Spanish employment rate
The Spanish employment rate showed large 
fluctuations over the last decade
 which were likely 
to be driven by both supply and demand factors
 This box present
s a historical decompositio
n of the 
Spanish employment rate into a number of more 

basic determinants ("shocks") like monetary policy, 
the situation on the housing market or wage shocks 
that act like labour demand or supply curve 
shifters. The decomposition is based on a version 
of t
he QUEST model that was estimated on 
Spanish data spanning between 1995 and 2010.
 Graph 1
 shows the evolution of the employment 

rate during the last decade (2001
-10), indicating 
which shocks in the Spanish and
 the world 
economy explain both the
 relatively 
good 
performance of the labour market in 
the 
years 
2001
-07 and the sudden drop in the Spanish 
employment rate thereafter.(
1) In the first seven 
years of the 
2000s 
employment in Spain grew at 
about 2% a year, which resulted in the employment 

rate reaching a
 peak in 2007 of about 8 
pps.
 above 
its long
-term 
average
. One important demand 
factor behind this development was a strong 
expansion in the housing sector that led to an 
increased labour demand in construction. The fact 
that favourable conditions in const
ruction 
positively contributed to the economy
-wide 
employment growth indicates that the employment 
expansion in this sector did not merely come at the 
expense of the remaining sectors, but that new jobs 
were veritably created.
 Several other demand factors 
played a non
-
negligible, if less prominent role in that period. 
Low interest rates (set at the euro area level) 
stimulated investment and consumption. In the first 
half of the decade, international trade slightly 
stimulated employment ("external factors").
 However, the increasing trade deficit contributed 
negatively to employment in the second half of the 
decade. Finally, in the years immediately preceding 
the crisis, 
high 
consumer confidence increased 
consumption, which also translated into a slightly 
high
er employment.
 On the labour supply side the positive employment 
trend was strongly reinforced by a reduced pressure 
on wage 
growth resulting from a positive labour 
supply shock (increasing participation rate and 
immigration) and possibly complemented by
                                                            (1) Zero on the scale of 
graph 1
 corresponds to the

the

-2010 period.

ups (limited labour

 from its peak. Again, both labour demand 
and labour supply factors take partial responsibility 
for this drop. O
n the labour demand side, the 
largest identified effect can be associated with the 
burst of the housing market bubble, which 
decreased the sectoral demand for labour and had a 

spillover 
effect 
on the rest of the economy. The 
contributio
n from the housing s
ector which 
according to the estimates added about 4 
pps.
 to the 
employment rate at its peak, shrank
 to about 2
 pps.
 in 2010 and ke
eps shrinking.
 Other factors also exerted a negative influence on 
the demand for labour. In particular, the external 
conditio
ns, which had contributed negatively to 
employment growth already since 2005, rapidly 
worsened during the 
recession
. Unsurprisingly, also 
the positive effect of consumer confidence faded 
during this period. The loss of confidence among 
consumers led to a h
igher saving rate, a lower 
demand for goods and services, and in turn a lower 
demand for labour. Several additional shocks 
dragged the employment rate down during the 
recession
 (category 'Others' on the 
Graph 1
), 
among which the increase in the equity risk
 premium with its negative impact on investment 
was perhaps the most prominent. On the positive 
side, monetary policy, characterized by lower 
policy rates due to the 
recession
, somewhat 
attenuated the negative impact of other factors on 
the Spanish labour 
market.
 Estimation results indicate 
also 
that a large shift of 
the labour supply curve, in QUEST identified as a 
shock to wages, occurred during the 
recession
. The 
size of the shift can be explained only by the 
specific features 
of the Spanish economy, 
cha
racterized by a combination of real wage 
rigidities and the dual labour market, which 
reinforced each other in dragging down the 
employment rate. With deteriorating economic 
conditions, facing inflexible wages on the one 
hand, and being able to shed a subs
tantial part of 
their 
workforce 
at no cost on the other, firms had 
little choice but 
to 
reduce their payroll by 
substantial 
lay
-offs
.                                                            (2) QUEST does not dis
tinguish the relative contribution 
of these individual components.

   76 The distinction between a change in the N
AWRU 
driven by a structural change and one driven by a 
persistent shock is crucial in the interpretation of 

NAWRU developments. While persistent shocks 
due to housing boom
-bust episodes can have a 
long
-lasting impact on unemployment patterns (see 
Box 
I.2.4
), they do not affect long
-term structural 
unemployment.
(56)  In that sense, structural unemployment can still be 
expected to return to a pre
-recession level once the 
effects of the shock disappear. From the above 

analysis it app
ears that in a number of countries 
the recent movements in the NAWRU feature 

substantial medium
-term variations. By contrast, 
structural features of the labour market appear to 

have been only moderately affected by the 
recession, as evidenced by the limite
d fluctuation 
of the fit based only on structural indicators. 

Following this line of reasoning, the NAWRU is 

likely to return to its long
-term level once medium
-term effects dissipate. Given that the 

aforementioned shocks might prove to be rather 
persisten
t, however, this development risks to be 
protracted.
 More generally, the limitations of such an analysis 
should be borne in mind. For instance, in the case 
                                                           (56) Similar findings are reported for the US. States that are hit 
more severely by the collapse of 
a housing bubble 
experience 
a worse deterioration in the unemployment rate 
(even after controlling fo
r cyclical a
ctivity). See Estevao 
and 
Tsounta (2011) 
ibid
. of Germany the 
approximation
 of structural 
unemployment provided by the fit of the panel is 
likely t
o underestimate the positive impact of the 
Hartz
 reform
s, because
 a key 
variable to control 
for 
the 
duration of unemployment benefit
s  
(changes to which were 
an important aspect of 
the
 reform
) could not be added to the panel due to data 
limitations. Also, 
the panel regression might not 

have been able to 
capture policies enacted recently 

in response to the 
recession
, includ
ing
 among 
others short
-time working schemes, reduction
s in 
labour tax
es (e.g. social security contribution
s), job 
search assistance progr
ams and job subsidies to 
employers.
(57)  2.6. OVERALL ASSESSMENT
 So far
, employment growth both in the EU and the 
euro area has not been able to keep pace with the 

recent output recovery when controlling for the 

usual time lags. The rather muted labour mark
et 
response to GDP expansion is a major burden on 

the recovery, especially in times of substantial 

uncertainty and weakening growth prospects. 

Given that the p

  Altogether, the results of the analysis indicate that 
both labour demand and labour supply factors 
stood behind the poo
r performance of the Spanish 
labour market during the crisis. 
In particular, the 
development and then 
the
 sudden burst of the
 housing bubble, an abrupt stop (and even reversal) 
of migration flow
s and 
the
 dual structure of the

tributed to the

   77 job creation
 was rather small
, there is substantial 
concern
 as 
to when 
unemployment 
will recede 
from currently high 
levels. 
 Even in times of solid GDP growth, labour 
resources move from declining sectors into 
expanding ones in response to wage differentials, 
but the adjustment takes time and may be 

imperfect. With fa
ding growth momentum at the 

current juncture, this process of labour reallocation 

may prove even more sluggish than usual given the 

rising skill mismatch in the labour market and the 

extent of sectoral adjustment needs in the 
economy. In fact, the increase
 in the duration of 
unemployment has been accompanied by a 
deterioration of labour market matching and the 

persistence of unemployment is primarily due to 

the low chances of finding a job, rather than to 

large waves of job losses. 
 Employment dynamics will
 not only 
depend on the 
economic outlook, but also on 
efficient
 policy 
frameworks
 that could facilitate the reallocation 
process.
 In this vein, u
nemployment benefit 
systems and activation policies 
should 
provid
e incentives for the unemployed to 
return
 to w
ork
. Policies and wage setting frameworks supporting 
wage adjustment, tax systems encouraging job 
creation, 
and targeted 
active labour market and 
training policies 
would likewise 
facilitat
e labour 
market transitions and the re
-entry of 
the long
-term 
unempl
oyed
 into the labour market
. Such policies 
have a significant impact on structural 
unemployment and the experience of countries 
such as Sweden and Finland, which experienced a 
permanent 
ratcheting
-up in structural 
unemployment rates following 
recessions in
 the 
early 1990s
, stresses the need for vigilance on the 
part of EU policy makers to ensure 
an 
adequate 
policy response to the crisis.
 Empirical ev
idence 
suggests that 
structural 
unemployment as measured by the NAWRU has 

been affected considerably by the 
recent recession 

and is likely to remain at elevated levels over the 
forecast horizon. In contrast to previous periods, 
the recent rise in structural unemployment appears 
to be driven by persistent demand shocks, whereas 
institutional factors limiting the 
efficiency of the 

labour market (e.g. tax wedge, employment 

protection) seem to be less relevant. These 

persistent demand shocks 
related to boom
-bust 
patterns in the housing and construction sector 

have contributed to 
the
 NAWRU 
decline in the 
pre
-recession
 period 
and its reversal 
at the current 
juncture
. In the long term, 
the NAWRU should 
return to a level 
determined
 by structural 
characteristics of the labour market
, and might
 finally settle at a level
 between the
 pre
-recession 
and the current level
. Howev
er, given the severity 
of the demand shock and its far
-ranging 
implications for sectoral adjustment, a significant 
decline of unemployment over the forecast horizon 
is not to be expected. 
 On the contrary, especially 
countries 
in the middle 
of a
 deleveragi
ng process and now confronted with 
a much weaker economic outlook may not see any 
major improvement in the labour market in the 
medium term. Additional downside risks such as a 
durable increase in risk premia or hysteresis effects 

might additionally impair
 employment prospects.

 Growth slowdown amidst weaker global growth and new bank 
worries
  82 The export
-led recovery is losing momentum 
 The Belgian economy started to recover from the 
crisis
 in 2010, thanks to a strong pick up in world 
trade, 
resulting in a sharp increase in net exports.
 While 
the first half of 2011 still benefitted from 
this export revival (with high quarterly GDP 

growth
 of 0.9% 
in Q1 and 0.5% in Q2
), growth 
is 
projected to flatten out by the end of the year. The 

slowdown in global activity, the ongoing 

sovereign
-debt crisis in the euro area and renewed 
concerns about the health of the banking sector 
depress consumer and 
business confidence
 and 
affect both trade and domestic demand

forecast
 Although credit provision to households and non
-financial corporations is currently not affected (the 

year
-over
-year cr
edit growth to corporations was 
5.1% in August, compared to 4.9% in July), the 
renewed tensions in financial markets since August 
are expected to weigh on investment and 
Œ to a 
lesser extent 
Œ consumption in the last quarter of 
2011 and at the start of 201
2. 
Increased uncertainty 
is expected to discourage credit demand, while the 

need for banks to increase their capital buffers 

could tighten credit supply. On
 the back of better 
prospects for international trade, as well
 as a less 
uncertain economic environm
ent, an acceleration 
of economic growth is expected for the second half 

of next year. All in all, GDP growth is projected to 

remain slightly below 
1% 
in 2012, before reaching 
potential
 by 2013.
  While this scenario for GDP growth is not overly 

bright, 
ther
e are 
still 
important downside risks
, including a more pronounced slowdown in world 

trade 
around the turn of the year 
and the risk 
of tighter financing conditions if banks need to 

deleverage more and faster than expected. 

Moreover, given the severe consoli
dation ahead,
 the implementation of the 2012 budget could also 
affect growth, depending on the type of measures 
taken
. On the upside
, a faster than expected 
recovery could materialise on the back of a rapid 

solution of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
.  Falls in 
consumer and business confidence 
depress private consumption and investment
 Private consumption pick
ed up strongly in 2010 
thanks to 
increased consumer confidence
 and 
better prospects on the labour market. With real 
disposable income dec
lining
 and inflatio
n rising, 
the 
saving rate
 dropped 
somewhat
 (from 18.4% 
in 
2009 to 16.2% in 2010). In 2011, the continued 
rise of inflation is dampening private consumption 

growth, and a further drop in the 
saving rate
 (to 
15.9%) helps sustaining consumption. 
 More recentl
y, renewed uncertainty about labour 
market performance and the impact of the financial 

crisis on both current 
and future 
household wea
lth 
is reducing
 consumer confidence. Additionally, 
the 
anticipation of the implementation of decisive 

fiscal consolidation
 measures and 
a possible 
tightening of financing conditions create incentives 
for precautionary savings. Therefore, private 
consumption is expected to somewhat decelerate in 

2012, in spite of a rise in real disposable income. 

In 2013, in the absence of fin
ancial turbulences
, renewed confidence could set the basis for a pick 
up of households' spending
.  While 
private and 
public
 investment 
rose strongly 
in the course of 2011, the latter possibly did so 
only due to the upcoming local elections next year, 

but b
oth are expected to 
decelerate in the course 
of 
2012. In the case of private investment, the 
financial sector 
Œ under stress as a result of 
the 
ongoing restructuring of banks 
and the sovereign 
crisis 
Œ exerts downward pressure from both the 
supply and dema
nd side. Credit conditions may 
tighten as banks will continue to strengthen their 

capital positions as well as further clean
 up their 
balance sheets through writedowns. 
At the same 
time
, depressed business confidence caused by the 
Member States, Belgium
   83 sovereign and financial c
risis 
may
 trigger a 
postponement of planned investment projects. In 
2013, government investment is 
project
ed to turn 
negative as the effect of the electoral cycle fades 
away, while private investment 
is likely to
 accelerate again moderately in 
the
 context 
of 
regained business confidence
.  Belgium continues to lose competitiveness  
 While the recovery in 2010 was export
-led, the 
positive contribution of net trade is fading out and 
remains weak over the forecast horizon. 
Exports 
and imports 
grew strongly in t
he first quarter of 
2011 and their growth is expected to 
remain 

relatively high 
over the year as a whole. However, 

a slowdown is 
proje
cted in 2012, due to the only 
gradual pick up in worl
d trade, expected to take off 
only
 in the second half of 
next
 year. 
 Belgium's competitiveness has been deteriorating 

in recent years. The current
-account 
surplus 
decreased
 from an average of 4.7% of GDP over 
the period 1995
-2004 to below 3% of GDP after 
2005 due to the evolution
 of the goods balance. 
While geographical (eu
ro-area
-oriented) and 
product specialisation (low to medium technology 

goods) play a role
, given
 the 
economy's
 lack
ing
 presence in the most dynamic product markets
, a more worrying trend is the loss in export market 

sha
res 
for goods. Nevertheless, as the 
deterioration
 of the goods balance and the loss of export market 

shares for goods are partly compensated by the 

better 
performance of services, this trend might 
merely 
indicate a transition towards a more 
services
-oriented economy.
 Both cost and non
-cost re
lated factors contribute to 
the 
deterioration in competitiveness
. Regarding 
price competitiveness, wages and energy prices are 

important determinants. While no real wage 
increase was foreseen in the inter
-professional 
agreement, nominal wages have been ris
ing faster 
than expected in 2011 due to high inflation (in
 combination with 
the automatic indexation 
mechanism). As indexation reacts with a lag to 

higher inflation and as a real wage increase of 
0.3% has been agreed for 2012, wage growth will 
remain subst
antial next year. Together with a
 slowdown in productivity growth in 2011 and 

2012, this implies that unit labour costs are rising
 in both years
. A more moderate wage and higher 
productivity growth are foreseen for 2013. With 

respect to the price of interm
ediary pr
oducts 
(mainly energy)
, the sharp increase in energy 
prices 
since
 the second half of 2010 
made the 
terms of trade deteriorate signific
antly in 2010 and 
2011, although
 improvement
s are
 expected from 
2012 onward. 
Regarding non
-price 
competitiveness,
 Belgium has high
-quality human 
capital, but struggles with (i)
 mismatches between 
labour demand and supply, and (ii) efficient 
translation of R&D investments into innovative 
products and processes, due to a lack of 

entrepreneurship and administrative burd
ens
.    The labour market held 
up after the crisis, but 
weakening trends are visible  
 Employment 
creation started to rise 
again in 2010, 
faster and to a higher extent than 
could
 normally 
be expected after a crisis (
by 
0.8%)
. In 2011 
employment 
growth has 
been
 further accelerating
 (by 
1.2%), 
supported by the rise in hours worked 
and the increase of part
-time work, partly 
subsidised by the government (e.g. service cheque 

jobs). This made the unemployment rate fall 

significantly (from 8.3% in 2010 to 7.
6% in 
2011). 
The positive 
trend 
in employment creation is 
expected to slow down by the end of
 2011. 
For the 
rest of the forecast horizon the unemployment rate 
is expected to slightly rise 
again
, mainly as a result 
of continued subdued job creation.   
 Optimism f
or public finances is decreasing  
 The general government deficit had declined from 
5.8% of GDP in 2009 to 4.1% in 2010, a 
substantially better outcome than the initial target 

of 4.8% of GDP. Consequently, in the latest update 
of the country's stability pr
ogramme, the Belgian 
authorities have reduced their deficit target for 
2011 from 4.1% to 3.6% of GDP. Government 

revenues have been less dynamic than last year 

(rising by about 4½% compared to 
5.7% in 2010)
 while the increase in current expenditure has als
o been more moderate than in 2010 (3.2% versus 

3.4%). In particular, revenues from excise duties, 

VAT and corporate tax were disappointingly low 

despite the rather 
favourable macroeconomic 
environment in the first half of the year
. On the 
spending side, th
e fact that the Leterme cabinet is 
acting as a care
-taker 
since its resignation in April 
2010 (Belgium has not had a fully
-fledged 
government at the federal level since 18 months), 

which limits its
 action to the so
-called "
current 
affairs"
, probably played
 a role in limiting the rise 
in public expenditure. As a result, the target for 
2011 is likely to be met as the deficit will decline 
to about 3.6% of GDP despite a large projected

forecast
 The caretaker government has reiterated Belgium™s 

commit
ment to meet the deficit target of 2.8% of 
GDP in 2012. However, the measures that will 

allow the achievement of this objective have not 

yet been decided and 
negotiations on the 2012 
budget 
were still underway 
at the cut
-off date of 
this forecast
. Therefor
e, the public finance forecast 
for 2012 and 2013 has been made under the usual 
no-policy
-change assumption. The deficit is 
projected to increase to about 4.6% of GDP in 

2012, chiefly since expenditure is expected to 
accelerate following an unusually modera
te 2011, 

but also due to the autonomous rising trend in 

spending, in particular on healthcare. On the other 

hand, revenues are expected to decelerate further 
as a result of the economic slowdown, but also due 
to incidental factors like the indexation of in
come 
tax brackets, which has a larger impact than in 

previous years due to the peak in inflation 

projected for 2011. In 2013, under the same 

unchanged
-policy assumption, the deficit is 
projected to contract somewhat due to the 

acceleration in GDP, but also
 because of some 
specific 
factors
 which will
 slow down revenues or 
push up expenditure in 2012 will no longer apply 

(like the surge in public investment). After 

increasing by 1 pp. of GDP in 2012 the structural 

deficit is likely to remain unchanged in 2013
. Public debt, which reached 96.2% of GDP in 2010, 

will continue to rise as a result of the increase in 

the deficit and exogenous factors like the take
-over 
of the Belgian subsidiary of 
Dexia
. Debt 
projections also include the impact of guarantees 

to the E
FSF, bilateral loans to Greece and the 
participation in the capital of the ESM as planned 

on the cut
-off date of the forecast.
 In total, under 
the same unchanged
-policy assumption, the debt 
will probably exceed 100% of GDP at the end of 
the period.
 2. BULGARIA
 Moderate growth amid rising uncertainty
  85 Growth slowing, inflation following suit
 The recovery in Bulgaria has been slow so far and 
is lagging behind the rebound in most EU 

emerging 
economies. 
The necessary correction of 
large 
domest
ic and external imbalances 
accumulated during the boom years 
continues
 at a 
fast pace. While
 export
s strong
ly pick
ed 
up above 
pre
-crisis level
s, domestic demand components 
have not stabilised
 yet 
and real GDP 
remains
 almost 5% down from the peak. 
Although 
average 
wages continued to outpace inflation and consumer 
confidence gradually recovered from the record 
lows in 
2010, consumer demand was constrained 

by a continued decline in employment
, rising 
consumer prices
 and building of precautionary 
savings.
 Fadin
g net FDI over the past year in a 
context of still high private
-sector indebtedness, 
conservative bank lending policies and lingering 
uncertainties 
on demand expectations 
greatly 
restrained
 the 
resumption in investment activity.
 After initially strong grow
th in Q4
-2010, 
momentum is slowing in 2011. At 2.0% 
y-o-y (0.3% q-o-q), GD
P surprised on the downside in 
Q2-2011, compared with 3.4% 
y-o-y (0.5% q-o-q) 
in Q1
-2011. On the supply side, agriculture 
and 
construction continued to contribute negatively, 
but the
 decline of the latter narrowed significantly 
in 
the second quarter
. Industrial sales 
were 
supported by continued strength in exports and
 
surpassed
 pre
-crisis levels. Despite
 continuing 
adjustment in household balance sheets and rising 

inflation, 
tentative
 signs of a mild recovery in 
private consumption are 
more 
visible in 
the second 
quarter
. Final consumptio
n inched up by 1.4% 
y-o-y in Q2
-2011, arguably reflecting 
sustained 
real growth in wages. 
With 
the slowdown
 having 
only just been overcome
, businesses 
are
 cautious 
to new
ly hir
e, increas
e leverage or invest again. 
Gross fixed capital formation 
is exceptionally 
weak and is set to post
 the largest negative 
contribut
ion
 to growth
 for the third consecutive 
year
, with
 both construction and investment in 
equip
ment dropp
ing in the first half of 2011
. As in previous quarters, exports remained the key 

driver of econ
omic growth, but the initial strong 
momentum is levelling off in line with
 decelerating demand in EU
. Export
 gro
wth halved 
to 12.2% y
-o-y in Q2
-2011, but as exports have 
significant import 
content
, import growth also 
moderated
 to 7.5%.
 Reflecting a 
consistently
 improving trade balance
, stronger services and 

current transfer balance
, the current account
 turned 
positive 
in both the first and the second qua
rter and 
reached an unprecedented surplus of 2.6% of GDP 

for the 12
-month
-period ending in August 2011.
 A deceleration in exports
 is unlikely to lead to a 
sharp widening in 
the trade balance in 2011, as 

both private consumption and investment are still 

wea
k and unlikely to recover substantially during 
the second half.

forecast
 Overall, the standstill in domestic demand 
persisted in 2011 and growth has remained largely
 reliant on external demand. The strong export 
performance has not 
yet 
fed through 
to 
domestic 
demand, 
with unemployment remaining stubbornly 
high at 11.2% in Q2
-2011. Unemployment and 
NPLs are lagging the economic recovery and seem 

to have reached double
-digit highs, from which it 
is 
still 
difficult to come off. Employment 
contracted by 
a cumulat
ive
 12% over the last three 
years, but there are 
a few indications that it could 

start to grow again
. In spite of high unemployment
, nominal wage growth has contin
ued to remain 
sticky at over 9% 
y-o-y in 
the first half of 
2011, but
 the spike
 in inflation partly limited real wage 
dynamics in 
Q2-2011. Soft growth with employment lagging behind
 The second quarter 
of 2011 is illustrative for 
the 
soft growth 
outturns
 ant
icipated for the remainder 
of the year. Growth expectations for the last two 
quarters of 2011 remain positive in view of 
higher
 revenue 
from 
tourism and 
a very good harvest in 
agriculture, which would boost consumption and 
somewhat 
offset
 a slowdown in exp
ort and 
the
 continued slump in construction/investment. Tight 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   86 credit conditions, worsening consumer and 
business sentiment and a weak global backdrop 

imply that growth will be fairly 
limited
. Overall 
investment 
is 
likely 
to drop in 2011.
 However, a 
turnaro
und 
is expected
 in 
the second half of the 
year
 thanks to
 increased public capital spending. 
All in all
, real GDP is projected to expand by 2.2%

forecast
 Expectations for a recovery in domestic demand 
rely mainly on government support for important 

infrastructure 
projects and 
real 
wage 
dynamics in 
2012. As food accounts for a 
high share
 of the 
consumer price basket, the easing of pre
ssures 

from global food and 
energy prices as well as a 

weak growth profile will lead to lower inflation 
in 
the near term
. These 
encouraging
 price 
developments are envisaged to gradually 
strengthen private consumption in 2012 
from its 

current low base. Alth
ough lower inflation will 
sustain households™ real disposable income from 

late 2011
 on, the fragility of the labour market and 
the 
lack of 
consumer credit
 will restrain 
consumption growth. Negative wealth 
effect
s from
 a protracted
 slump in hous
ing
 and equi
ty prices 
may also 
weigh on
 consumer
 optimism. Against 
this background, 
private consumption is expected 
to expand less than GDP in 201
2 and pick up to 
3.0% in 201
3 as job creation 
resumes.
 While manufacturing activity 
may
 hold 
up 
relatively well 
in the com
ing quarters, investment
 growth
 is likely to remain subdued 
in the first part 
of 2012 
in light of the worsening of 
investment
 sentiment.
 Moreover, jitters over the global 
economy could lead to further delays in rebuilding 

inventories.
 As the absorption of 
EU funds 
improve
s further and capacity utilisation reaches 
pre
-crisis levels
 later in 2012,
 investment 
is 
expected 
to slowly 
increase
 from a very low level
. Weaker export growth will prevent notable 

progress in 
investment and employment until the 

second ha
lf of 2012. The cyclical slowdown in 
Europe will be reflected in a 
lacklustre
 labour 
market with u
nemployment remaining high 
in 
2012. 
Entrenched
 high 
unemployment and 
prevailing uncertainty as well as the higher 
provisioning costs on overdue loans 
are expe
cted 
to deter
 banks from 
increasing lending
. Hence, 
the 
economy is likely to operate below potential for a
n extended period
, which in turn should partly 
contain inflation
ary
 pressures. In this 
context
, further disinflation
 is expected along the way
, but
 inflation
 below
 3% is unlikely to be reached before 
2013, as wage rigidities and 
increases in 
regulated 
price
s will 
feed
 inflationary pressures over the 
horizon.
 Current account turns positive
 The contribution to growth from
 net exports ha
s been fading away 
since Q2
-2011 and exports 
are
 expected to cool down 
in line with
 sluggish 
external demand
 ahead
. Export and import growth 
rates should converge later in 2011, given the 

higher base for exports in H
2-2010, and come even 
closer in 2012
. Net exports are, howe
ver, expected 
to continue to contribute to growth in 2012 thanks 

to relatively strong demand from non
-EU trade 
partners. An expected decline in the trade deficit
 and a lower services surplus, together with 

persistent investment income outflows, are 

expecte
d to bring the current account into a 

monthly deficit for the remainder of 2011. 

However, 
it is 
projected to end 2011 with an 
annual
 surplus 
of 
1.6% of GDP
 and to remain 
slightly positive over the forecast horizon,
 helping 
to further reduce the external
 debt-to-GDP ratio.
 Risks tilted to the downside
 The forecast baseline scenario is subject to 

particularly significant risks 
at the current juncture
. The outlook for exports is clouded by uncertainty, 

particularly in the euro area. Moreover, prolonged 
stress 
in financial markets worldwide over fiscal 
and debt sustainability concerns
, as well as 
continued adverse spillovers from Greece, have the 
potential to delay the recovery in consumption and 

investment. Although the capitalisation of banks 

has remained at r
eassuring levels, the further 
deterioration in asset quality and the subsequent 

erosion of banks' capital buffers is likely to put 

additional pressure on banks' solvency and lending 

capacity.

     87 tightening in credit, low
 foreign capital inflows 
and further deleveraging in the economy. While 
balance
-sheet corrections might prove to be 
protracted, the extent to which investment recovers 
following the massive contraction over 2009
-11 will 
largely
 depend
 on improving the abso
rption of 
EU funds
. Uncertainty regarding the consumption 
behaviour of households remains one of the major 
risks to the outlook, both on the upside and on the 

downside. Should households 
lower
 their currently 
high precautionary 
saving rate
, this could 
supp
ort
 stronger consumption growth
 even 
under a 
declining
 employment scenario.
 Fiscal consolidation continues over 2011
-13 Fiscal consolidation resulted in a narrowing of the 
budget deficit from 4.3% of GDP in 2009 to 3.1% 

in 2010, i.e. below the revised budg
et target of 
3.8% of GDP. In 2011 the government has 

maintained the freeze in pensions
 and public
-sector 
wages and has made cuts in discretionary spending 
to restrain primary expenditure growth. This is in 
line with the government's intention to pursue an 

expenditure
-based fiscal consolidation. The latest 
budget execution data (September 2011, on a cash 

basis) reveals an improved fiscal performance 

against both the previous year
 budget 
execution 
and the 2011 budget targets. 
Although fiscal 

consolidation is 
expected to lose some ground
 in 
line with higher capital outlays 
during the 
remainder of the year, 
Bulgaria is on track to meet 

the accruals
-based fiscal target of 2.5% of GDP in 
2011, based on a no
-policy
-change assumption.
 Despite the expected slowdown i
n the global 
economy and the outlook for Bulgaria, the 
government has maintained its strong commitment 
to fiscal consolidation over 2012
-13. The gradual 
fiscal adjustment is expected to be achieved by a 

cyclical improvement in revenue as well as a 

containm
ent of public expenditure. Spending items 
such as public sector wages and pensions 
are to
 remain frozen
 in 2012
, while some other current 
non
-interest 
expenditure
 are expected to be cut. 
Under a no

deficit gradually dec

around 1
.7% and 1
.3% of GDP in 201

implies a cumulated structural effort of

over 
2011-13. Under the assumption of zero stock

. 3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
 Soft patch in 2012 followed by moderate
 recovery
  88 Rebound driven by restocking and exports 
 The Czech economy was hit by a collapse of 
foreign demand, but rising export orders have 

supported the recovery underway from the third 

quarter of 2009 onwards. Since then, GD
P growth 
has been driven largely by net exports and the 

replenishing of inventories, while the ongoing 

fiscal consolidation and negative confidence 

effects have continued to weigh on consumption 

and gross fixed capital formation. 
 Based on estimates of eco
nomic activity for the 
first half of 2011, GDP growth is expected to have 
slowed to 1.8% for the year as a whole. Wage 

restraint in the public sector, a sluggish recovery in 

the labour market and higher prices of food and 

energy resulted in a negative grow
th rate of 
household consumption during the first half of 
2011. The forecast for the full year is negative at 
-0.3%. Falling private consumption, together with 
cuts in government consumption expenditure (of 

1.0% in real terms), are expected to bring domest
ic 
demand close to stalling. Growth in 2011 is 

expected to be driven by net exports and, to a 
smaller extent, by gross fixed capital formation. 
With capacity utilisation at its long
-term average, 
improved access to financing and solid growth in 

orders duri
ng the first half of 2011, a 1.7% rise in 
gross fixed capital formation is projected for 2011. 

In particular residential construction, which 

according to revised data grew by more than 20% 
in 2010, is still forecast to reach solid growth in 
2011, as a resu
lt of both the acceleration in the 
number of new mortgages and in anticipation of 

the 2012 increase in the value
-added tax (VAT) 
rate applied to construction work.  
 A more complete picture of the developments in 
2011 will emerge in December 2011 after the
 announced publication of revised quarterly 

national accounts. 
 Lower growth ahead...
 The outlook for 2012
-13 is shaped by uncertainties 
surrounding the sovereign
-debt crisis, as reflected 
in the rapidly evaporating business confidence. 

The volatile situat
ion in global financial markets, 
together with the approval of the 2012 budgetary 
consolidation measures in the Czech Republic, 

have considerably altered the prospects of growth 
for 2012 compared to the spring forecast. GDP 

growth is now projected at only 
0.7% in 2012 and 

to moderately accelerate to 1.7% in 2013. 
Domestic growth factors are expected to remain 
weak over the first half of the forecast horizon and 

to start adding to growth only in 2013, 

accompanied by net exports

 forecast
 Private consumption expenditure will continue to 

be restrained by fiscal measures, most significantly 

by the increase in the reduced VAT rate from 10% 
to 14% scheduled for 2012. Given that some of the 
goods to which the reduced rate applies fall into 

the category of frequent out
-of-pocket purchases, 
the hike in the tax rate is expected to affect 

consumption confidence and spending overall. The 

forecast assumes that VAT rates will be unified at 
17.5% in 
2013 by further raising the reduced rate 
by 3.5 pps. and cutting the standard rate from its 

current level of 20%. Lower price growth in 2013 

is likely to provide some stimulus to consumption 

expenditure, but as the room for nominal wage 

increases is expect
ed to remain limited throughout 
the forecast horizon consumption growth is not 

expected to revert to its pre
-crisis pace yet.
 As gross fixed capital formation 
Œ and
 equipment 
investment in particular 
Œ is typically the 
component of demand most sensitive to
 the 
business cycle, the extent of the underlying 

uncertainties is consistent with a negative growth 
outlook for this component for 2012. The two
-step 
hike in the reduced VAT rate, which applies also 
to construction work, is set to discourage 

construction 
activity further, while in 2013 other 
components of investment may benefit from the 

decrease in the standard VAT rate. Assuming 
Member States, The Czech Republic
   89 uncertainties will reduce in the course of 2012, 
gross fixed capital formation is expected to 

provide a positive contribution to
 growth in 2013. 
Exports and imports are projected to decelerate 
compared to their pre
-crisis pattern. Low export 
growth is consistent with the expected slowdown 

in global economic activity and the intra
-industry 
nature of most of Czech Republic's trade. G
iven 
the high import content of exports imports are 
expected to follow a similar pattern, although their 

growth is likely to be further limited by weak 

domestic demand. 
 ...is likely to put hiring on hold
 The economic slowdown forecast for 2012 is 

expected
 to put pressure on the labour market. The 
employment rate fell in 2010 on account of cuts in 

public sector workforce and labour shedding in the 

private sector. In 2011 and 2012, the planned 

freeze in the public sector wage bill and the 
government's goal t
o increase efficiency in the 
public sector are consistent with negative growth 
in public employment. Hiring in the private sector, 

after some recovery in 2011 is likely to be put on 

hold and improve only in the second half of 2012. 

These factors are consis
tent with falling 
employment and a slightly higher unemployment 

rate in 2012. The revised Employment Act and the 

Labour Code, expected to enter in force in January 

2012, include measures that increase flexibility on 

the labour market by linking severance p
ayments 
to job seniority and raise incentives for employees 

to stay in a given job by tightening the rules for 
unemployment benefits. These measures may help 
speed the recovery in employment in 2013. 
 Higher inflation in 2012 due to VAT rise
 Inflation is a
ssumed to be driven predominantly by 
external factors and by the VAT changes, as 

domestic demand pressures are virtually absent
 over the forecast horizon. Supported by higher 

energy and food prices, the inflation rate is 

expected to average 1.8%, close to 
the middle of 
the band targeted by the Czech National Bank. The 

effects of the VAT changes, along with the 

ongoing deregulation of rents, will be the most 
important factors behind the developments in the 
inflation rate in 2012 and 2013, as imported price 

pressures are assumed to subside. The harmonised 
index of consumer prices is expected to reach 

2.7% in 2012 and decelerate to 1.6% in 2013.
 Subst
antial uncertainty around 2012 and 2013 
 The 2012
-13 forecast is subject to significant risks. 
Should the sovere
ign
-debt crisis cause another 
wave of European bank restructuring, the domestic 

credit sector could be negatively affected. While 
the amount of domestic deposits exceeds that of 
loans and regulatory capital is relatively high, the 
banking sector is predomi
nantly foreign
-owned, 
making the domestic credit provision a function of 
aggregate risk assessment as perceived in banks' 

central headquarters. On the positive side, decisive 

implementation of the competitiveness package 

adopted in September 2011 may help 
boost 

confidence and improve growth prospects towards 
the end of the forecast horizon. The package 
includes measures streamlining tax payments, 

improving the quality of public institutions, and 

increasing the supply of flexible jobs.

 Fiscal position set to improve at a slower pace 
due to worsening cyclical conditions
 The consolidation of public finances which started 
in 2010 is set to continue. The deficit reduction in 

2011 relies mostl
y on additional expenditure cuts 
across a broad set of expenditure categories. The 
public sector wage bill has been cut by 10% and 
cuts have affected also social transfers. Additional 

savings have been achieved in interest expenditure 

on government debt on
 account of better
-than
-expected borrowing conditions. Larger
-than
-budgeted cuts are expected in government 

investment, partly due to the fact that financing of 

some investment programmes from the EU has 

been temporarily suspended. On the revenue side, 

the

government indicate some slippages in the 

personal income tax (lower

from tax on self

1. 
 Based on the draft budget currently under 
discussion in the Parliament, consolidation efforts 
in 2012 will focus predominantly on the revenue 
side. The planned increase of the lower VAT rate 
is projected to bring additional revenue of 

approximately 0.7
% of GDP. However, taxes on 

income and social contributions will show 

relatively modest growth, in line with the 

slowdown of the economy. Personal income tax 

revenue will be negatively affected by the planned 
increase in tax allowances for families with 
children (0.1% of GDP). On the expenditure side, 
central government wages will be frozen until 

2014 based on the multiannual budget submitted to 

the Parliament, while wages in the education and 

health sectors will be allowed to grow by 

approximately 0.1% of 
GDP. Additionally, 
subsidies to the building savings scheme are to be 
cut by 50%. Nevertheless, the consolidation effort 
is likely to lead only to a moderate improvement of 

the headline deficit to 3.8% of GDP in 2012, partly 

due to a worsening of the cycli
cal position of the 
Czech economy. The headline deficit in 2012 is 

subject to significant risk as it does not yet include 

a one
-off expenditure on church restitutions (1.6% 
of GDP) which has already been agreed upon by 
the government but at the time of pub
lication has 
not yet been approved by the Parliament. 
 For 2013, the forecast includes the impact of 
several revenue measures which are currently in 
the pipeline.  First, a private pension pillar will be 
introduced, reducing revenues from social security 
contributions. As the reform will rely on a 
voluntary opt
-in, this forecast is based on a 
conservative estimate of a revenue shortfall of 

0.2% of GDP. Second, the fiscal impact of the 

envisaged harmonisation of VAT rates is expected 

to be positive but relat
ively modest (0.1% of 
GDP). With respect to the expenditure side, 
significant cuts in government consumption and 

savings in public procurement are envisaged but 

these have not been taken into account as concrete 

measures are not yet known. The above
-mentio
ned 
measures combined with the projected modest 

improvement in the macroeconomic environment 

are expected to slightly worsen the general 
government deficit in 2013 to 4.0% of GDP. The 
structural balance will exhibit a moderate 

improvement over the forecast
 period.  The debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase further over 
the forecast horizon reaching around 44% in 2013
. 4. DENMARK
 A modest recovery
  91 Recovery losing momentum
 Following the sharp recession in 2009, Danish 
output rebounded in 2010 on the back of an 

expansionary fiscal policy in addition to sizeable 

automatic stabilisers. The anticipated subsequent 
transition from the public to the private
 sector as a 
major growth driver has been hesitant thus far. 
Although Denmark is not affected by the 

sovereign
-debt crisis directly as exposure to 
peripheral member states of the euro area is 

relatively low, the recovery is projected to be weak 
in the shor
t term and to gain traction only in 2013.
 Private consumption continues to be held back by 
subdued consumer confidence and the high level 

of household debt. Private investment is expected 

to be postponed in the face of high economic 

uncertainty and as a co
nsequence of banks' 
tightening credit conditions. Public consumption 

expenditure growth is set to be low in line with the 

agreed consolidation strategy, while the external 

environment is expected to deteriorate markedly in 

the short term. Hence, real GDP g
rowth is 
projected not to exceed 1¼% this year resting 
almost exclusively on the strong contribution from 
net exports. Although major infrastructure 

investments and the planned reimbursement of 

early retirement pension contributions in 2012 will 

provide so
me support, annual real GDP growth 

rates are forecast to remain around 1½% and 1¾% 

in 2012 and 2013, respectively. 
 Lacklustre recovery of private consumption 
 Private consumption is expected to be rather 

subdued and to even fall this year. Heightened 

econ
omic uncertainty, the need for deleveraging, 
and a stagnating labour market are weighing on 
consumer spending in the short run. Rises in 
disposable income this year and next are expected 

to translate into significantly higher household 

saving rates rather 
than increased consumption and 

will contribute to a gradual reduction in 

households' debt
-to-GDI 
ratio
.  The planned reimbursement of early retirement 

pension contributions in 2012 as envisaged by the 

retirement reform agreed under the previous 

government 
is expected to lift private consumption 
somewhat, especially during the second half of 

2012 and the beginning of 2013. From the second 
half of 2012, an improving global economic 

environment, better labour market conditions and 

rising real wages should prov
ide further support.

forecast
 The situation in the housing market remains 
fragile. Despite the sharp correction in house 
prices since 2007 and low interest rates, amplified 

at present by saf
e-haven flows into Danish assets, 
house prices are not expected to pick
-up soon
. Nevertheless, residential construction should be 

propped up this year as a result of temporary 
public support for property renovations. 
 Slow recovery in private investment
 Vulnerabilities in Denmark's banking sector 
Œ concentrated in particular among small regional 
banks 
Œ are likely to increase financing costs for 
Danish institutes. Furthermore, given banks' strong 
dependence on international funding sources, 
credit condition
s for companies are expected to 
tighten. Credit
-growth to non
-financial 
corporations remains negative and companies are 

currently relying on 
previously
-accumulated 
profits
 to finance investments. Growth in 
equipment investment will fall this year before 

improving in 2012 and 2013.
(58) Overall gross 
fixed capital formation is expected to expand by 

½%, 5% and 5¾% in 2011, 2012 and 2013, 

respectively, also supported by major 
infrastructure investments such as the extension of 
the Copenhagen Metro and the railwa
y network. 
                                                            (58) The fall in equipment investment in 2011 also reflects the 
export of a
n oilrig in Q1
-2011 that lowers equipment 
investment and raises exports correspondingly.

 Deteriorating global outlook weighs on exports
 The strong performance of Germany and Sweden,
 Denmark's main trading partners, has boosted 
Danish exports in 
2011. However, the rapid 

deterioration of the global economic environment 
since this summer is projected to weigh on Danish 
exports in 2012. Recent gains in cost 

competitiveness are unlikely to bring about a 

structural turnaround in the trend of Denmark's 

past losses in export market shares. However, the 

product composition of goods exports should allow 
for further terms
-of-trade gains, thus contributing 
to the stabilisation of the merchandise trade 
balance around 3% of GDP. The current
-account 
surplus is e
xpected to decline gradually towards 
5½% of GDP. 
 Moderate improvements in the labour market
 Following the historically large fall in private 

employment in 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, 

the labour market has stabilised. Private sector 

employment botto
med out in mid
-2010 at the level 
reached in 2006, i.e. before the steep rise to 

unsustainable levels during the overheating period. 

In view of the uncertain economic environment, 

companies have been reluctant to raise staff levels 

at present. Employment is
 expected to shrink 
slightly this year before rising moderately in 2012 
and 2013
, also on the back of a gradually 
improving investment outlook. 
 Unemployment has been almost stable for more 
than a year. However, job turnover rates have 

rallied since the be
ginning of 2010 and long
-term 
unemployment has remained contained.
 A slight 
increase in the unemployment rate can be expected 

for the second half of 2011 due to the recent rise in 

the number of notified job cuts by bigger 

companies. In line with stronger e
mployment 
growth for 2012 and 2013, the unemployment rate 

is projected to decline gradually. 
 Falling inflation outlook, lower wage growth
 On the back of base effects related to energy 

prices, headline inflation is expected to fall to 

1.7% in 2012 from 2.
6% in 2011 and to
 remain 
broadly stable in 2013. The effect of tax increases 
on unhealthy 
food gradually peters ou
t and the 
contribution of the energy component is receding 
while services inflation will remain elevated.  
Core 

inflation, i.e. excluding energ
y and unprocessed 
food, is forecast to fall to 1.
7% in 2012 and to 
pick 
up marginally in 2013. 
 In light of the 
currently sluggish 
labour market 
improvement
, moderate productivity growth and a 
rather weak economic outlook, private sector wage 

negotiations
 scheduled for
 spring 2012 should 
allow for 
some degree of wage moderation over 
the 
subsequent 
two
-year period. Public sector 
wages are expected to fall this year on the basis of 

the wage agreements reached in spring
 to 
compensate for higher public sector w
age growth 
compared to the private sector during 2008
-10. Overall, r
eal wage growth of households is 
estimated to be negative in 2011 and 
to 
turn 
slightly positive in 2012 and 2013. 
Due to the 

crisis
-induced surge in labour productivity, 
nominal unit labou
r costs have been falling in 2011 
and are expected to rise 
moderately in 2012 and 
2013. 2011 budget execution on track
 Windfall gains linked to Danish pension yield 

taxation, a flat
-rate tax levied on the annual gains 
of pension funds, resulted in addition
al revenue of 
around 2.4% of GDP in 2010, thus helping to 
reduce the general government deficit to 2.6% of 
GDP. In the absence of such positive surprises this 

year, the general government deficit is expected to 

widen to 4% of GDP. The improvement of the 

headline budget deficit in 2011 net of 2010 
windfall gains builds on discretionary measures on 

the expenditure as well as revenue side in line with 

the 2010 Consolidation Agreement concluded for 

the period 2011
-13. This agreement includes
 the 
postponement of
 previously planned tax cuts, the 
temporary suspension of the automatic indexation 

of various tax thresholds (so
-called "§20 
regulation") until 2014, the shortening of the 

unemployment benefit period from four to two 

years and the introduction of a ceiling

   Need for continued consolidation efforts
 In 2012, the increase in the general bud
get deficit 
is due to a one
-off measure. Early retirement 
contributions are to be reimbursed in a lump
-sum 
payment,
(59) part of which is assumed to be 
reinvested in tax
-exempt private pension funds. 
The general government deficit is therefore 

forecast 
to ri
se to 
4.5%
 of GDP
 in 2012, despite 
continued consolidation efforts. In 2013, it is 

projected to fall to 2.1% of GDP, in the absence of 

the one
-off measure, on the back of measures 
under the Consolidation Agreement and thanks to 

lower social transfers and h
igher pension yield 
revenue in line with an improving economic 

environment. 
 The general government expenditure ratio is 
expected to fall from 58.2% of GDP in 2011 to 

56.9% of GDP in 2013 in particular due to the 
                                                           (59) The retirement reform has been agreed among political 
parties before the general elections in September 2011. As 
these parties still command a majority in Parliame
nt, the 
reform is expected to be adopted as planned. The size of 
the reimbursement is estimated at 0.9% of GDP.
 sustained government expenditure restraint,
 whereas the revenue share is projected to rise 
moderately from 54% of GDP to 54.7%. 
 The structural deficit is projected to fall from 2.1% 

in 2011 to 
1.4
% in 2013. 
However, low current 
estimates of potential output growth could 

potentially overstate the c
yclical component of the 
budgetary adjustment. Moreover, the structural 

balance also 
includes 
very volatile revenue items 
such as pension yield tax and North Sea oil 

revenues. From a bottom
-up perspective, 
discretionary measures of the 2010 Consolidation 
Agreement and the 2009 Spring Reform Package 
are estimated to entail consolidation of around 
1½% of GDP over the period 2011
-13. 
 After the sharp increase in 2008 and 2009, 

Denmark's general government gross debt level
 is 
forecast to remain broadly stable o
ver the forecast 

horizon and to reach 44¾% of GDP in 2013. Debt 
projections also include the impact of bilateral 
loans to Ireland as planned on the cut
-off date of 
the forecast.  
  5. GERMANY
 Growth momentum temporarily halted by uncertainty
  94 Heightened uncertainty clouds the short
-term 
growth outlook
 Following the remarkable rebound in 2010, 
Germany experienced a very dynamic start in 

2011, with real GDP expandin
g by 1.3% 
in the 
first quarter from the previous period. This was 
followed by an expansion of only 0.1% in the 

second quarter. The underlying growth momentum 

is likely to have been steadier than suggested by 

this uneven pattern, with some special factors 
Œ including the impact of weather on construction 

activity and the accelerated phasing
-out of some 
nuclear power plants 
Œ influencing the quarterly 
profile. Despite healthy export growth, the 

expansion in the first half of the year was driven 

predominantly 
by domestic demand. 
 In the meantime, however, downside risks have 

increased markedly and indicators are pointing to 
further moderation of growth in the second half of 
the year 
relative to the beginning of the year.
 While available data on industrial produ
ction bode 
well for the third quarter, the growth momentum 

could stall 
temporarily thereafter
. The external 
environment deteriorated over the course of the 
autumn. Consumer confidence has been dampened 
by mounting uncertainty amid the ongoing debt 

crisis; 
firms' assessment of the business outlook 
has been on a downward trend for some months, 

albeit starting from a high level; and orders 

received have been on the decline. So far, neither 

the availability of credit nor financing conditions 
appear to be much a
ffected by the uncertainty and 
reappraisal of risks in financial markets. 

Nevertheless, increased uncertainty is likely to 

weigh on the German growth outlook during the 

coming quarters. Export prospects are more 

subdued than expected earlier and uncertaint
y could have an impact on domestic confidence and 

demand. 
 However, the impact of uncertainty should be 

limited by the fact that the economy's 

fundamentals
 are essentially sound. A
n extended 
period of structural adjustment
 prior to the crisis 
led to increa
sed flexibility in the labour market, 
restored
 competitiveness and strengthen
ed 
corporate sector balance sheets. At the same time
, 
given Germany's lack of major accumulated 

domestic imbalances su
ch as overheating housing 
markets, the economy is not 
being h
eld back by the 
need to repair 
private and public
 balance sheets
. Therefore, only a temporary interruption of growth 

is expected before robust momentum is recaptured 

as uncertainty dissipates. The projected pace of 

expansion in 2013 is in line with the eco
nomy's 
medium
-term growth trend. Domestic demand 
should remain the prime driver of growth over the 
forecast horizon, again reflecting sound domestic 
fundamentals in conjunction with slower export 

growth.

 Export prospects more subdued, rebalancing 
to continue 
 Exports were vigorous
 in the first half of 2011, 
with deliveries to the euro area expanding 
particularly
 strongly. For the year as a whole, net 
exports are expected to contribut
e 0.4
 pp. to GDP 
growth, despite strong imports on the back of 

buoyant domestic demand. However, with more 

than 40% of German goods exports going to the 

euro area, export growth is set to moderate, 

especially in the next few quarters. Given the 

projected i
ncrease in unit labour cost, this 
moderation is not expected to be offset by market 

share gains. Import growth should remain 

relatively resilient, given that the slowdown in 

domestic demand is expected to be temporary and 

modest. Overall, this should lead 
to a markedly 

negative growth contribution from external trade in 

2012, contributing further to the rebalancing 
among demand components and the ongoing 
reduction of the German current
-account surplus. 
In 2013, a pick
-up in both export and import 
growth is 
projected, with net trade exerting only a 

slight drag on GDP growth.
 Member States, Germany
   95 Moderating exports 
temporarily weighing on 
investment 
 Gross fixed capital formation was a 
key
 driver of 
the upturn, expanding by 5½% in 2010 and by 
9½% y
-o-y in the first half of 2011. H
owever, the 
current uncertainty is likely to affect investment 

over the coming quarters. Specifically, while 

financing conditions are still favourable and 
capacity utilisation remains above the long
-term 
average, the uncertain outlook is likely to lead 
fir
ms to postpone their investment projects, with 
spending on machinery and equipment being 

particularly sensitive to the moderation of export 

prospects. However, such postponed plans are 

likely to be implemented once the economy returns 
to its previous stabl
e growth path in the course of 
2012. The momentum of construction investment 

was particularly buoyant in the first half of 2011. 

Looking forward, while the phasing out of public 

sector stimulus measures weighs on the 

construction outlook, private housing i
nvestment is 
likely to remain lively, supported by still 

favourable financing conditions and robust 
disposable income growth. Investors' likely 
preference for investment opportunities carrying 

relatively limited risk may also prop up residential 

constructi
on activity. 
 Consumption 
growth dented by uncertainty in 
the near term
 Private consumption held up well 
during the 

2008-09 recession
 and expanded
 steadily in 2010 
and early 2011, underpinned by buoyant labour 

market developments. T
he 
drop
 in household 
con
sumption recorded in the second quarter of 
2011 was somewhat puzzling
, as it exceeded by far
 the
 impact of the temporary increase in inflation on 
real disposable income
, but the spending dip is 
expected to be offset in the short term. Over the 
coming quart
ers, the current uncertainty could 
impinge on household consumption behaviour, 
although labour market resilience should continue 

to support disposable income, as should continued 

robust wage growth. In comparison to other 

Member States the medium
-term outl
ook for 
private consumption is further supported by the 
absence of large deleveraging needs in the 
household sector, as well as a relatively limited 

restraining effect from fiscal consolidation needs.
 Labour market to remain resilient 
 Having proven remark
ably resilient during the 

recession,
(60) the performance of the German 
labour market has been vibrant during the upturn, 

with a projected rise in employment of about 1.3% 
in 2011, one of the highest rates of increase since 
reunification. Having recorded onl
y a minor 
increase in the context of the recession, the 
unemployment rate dropped 
to 
an average of 
6.1%
 in 2011, the best performance since the early 
1990s,
 although the share of long
-term 
unemployment in total unemployment remains 

high. 
 Only a moderate f
urther improvement 
in the 
unemployment rate 
is expected over the forecast 

horizon
. Survey data indicate that firms plan to 
further increase employment in the short term. 

However, with more subdued growth ahead, labour 

demand should also 
moderate
. While a s
ignificant 
further increase in employment is forecast for 

2012, this reflects to a large extent the statistical 

carry
-over resulting from the continuous 
improvement in 2011. Developments should, 

however, continue to benefit from the increased 

flexibility i
n the German labour market. In 2009, 
the latter facilitated a substantial reduction in hours 

worked, thereby greatly limiting the impact of the 

crisis on the employment headcount. It is expected 

that firms will react in a similar manner to possible 
future 
demand shocks. Employment creation is 
projected to quicken slightly as the economy 
resumes its stable growth path later in the forecast 

period. In a medium
-term perspective, s
hortages in 
certain high
-skill segments of the labour market 
could turn into a ma
jor bottleneck for Germany's 
growth potential against the background of the 

trend decrease in the working
-age population.
 Wages and 
consumer price inflation to 
moderate  
 Supported by buoyant labour market 
condition
s, 
wages rose substantially in
 the first 
half of
 2011, 
with a sizeable increase in hours worked 
and 

voluntary one
-off payments 
contributing to a 
markedly positive wage drift. Despite healthy 

productivity developments, this 
is projected to 
result
 in a clear increase in unit labour costs, 
contrary 
to the pre
-crisis 
trend of improving cost 
competitiveness. While the 
clouding
 of the 
economic outlook 
might have a slightly damping 
                                                           (60) See box

patterns in the EU 
for details
. European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   96 impact on forthcoming 
wage 
negotiations 
for 
2012, 
wage growth is nevertheless expected to 
remain vigorous in view of the sti
ll tight labour 
market
. Together with moderating productivity 
developments 
from
 firms mak
ing
 use of flexible 
working time agreements, this is forecast to lead to 
a further increase in unit labour cost
s.  Following the intensification of
 inflationary 
pressu
res on the back of rising 
energy
 prices in late 
2010 and early 2011, consumer price inflation is 
projected to 
slow. HICP inflation should 
average 

2.4% in 2011 and remain below 2% in 2012 and 
2013, in view of the weaker economic outlook. 

Given comparatively
 more resilient domestic 
demand in Germany than in other euro
-area 
economies, domestic forces are expected to take 

over as the main driver of price increases, reflected 

in a moderate rise in core inflation
 to 1¾% in 
2013.  Key
 risks related to the resoluti
on of the crisis
 Risks to the forecast are mainly related to the 

successful resolution of the international 

sovereign
-debt and financial crisis. On the one 
hand, the forecast assumes that major feedback 
loops from the financial sector via credit supply to 
economic activity are less likely to occur in 

Germany than in other countries. The increased 

profitability of firms limits their external financing 

needs, while Germany's current position as a 

perceived safe haven also benefits the private 
sector
 to some e
xtent. Adverse effects cannot be 
excluded, however, should the current 
uncertainties drag on for a prolonged period of 

time. Moreover, should further substantial 

financial sector support measures prove necessary 

and put strain on the public finances, the r
esulting 
fiscal consolidation needs would weigh on 
domestic demand. At the same time, an earlier
-than
-expected resolution of the crisis could greatly 
limit its impact, especially on domestic demand. 
 Financial market stabilisation drove up deficit 
and debt
 ratios in 2010
 Th
e general government deficit rose from
 3.2% of 
GDP in 2009 to 4.3% of GDP in 
2010
. Economic 
stimulus measures in line with the European 

Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) and financial 
market stabilisation were the main drivers behind 
the incr
ease, while the swift economic recovery 
and the remarkably robust labour market had a 

favourable impact. Financial sector stabilisation 
measures, including in particular the asset transfer 

from
 Hypo Real Estate Group (HRE) 
to the relate
d bad bank 
FMS Wertm
anagement
, contributed 1.3% 
of GDP to the deficit. The transfer of impaired 

assets from ailing banks to related bad banks was 
also the main reason for the increase of the debt
-to-GDP ratio from 74.4% in 2009 to 83.2% in 
2010. Graph II.5.2:

Favourable

efforts under the

 adopted in 2010 
(around 
0.3
% of GDP
) are 
contributing 
to deficit 
reduction. 
For example, t
he contribution rate for 
unemployment insurance 
was increased to 3% 
after its temporary reduction in 2009 from 3.3% to 

2.8% as part of the stimulus package. 

Consolidation measures under the

 include on the revenue side n

 reduced

 and on the expenditure side
 lowered

  6. ESTONIA
 Reviving domestic demand is balancing growth
  98 Buoyant export still driving growth–
 After a deep contraction of foreign trade and GDP 
the Estonian economy has rebounded p
romptly, 
leading to a vigorous growth acceleration in 2010, 

culminating at almost 9% in the first half of 2011 
in annualised terms.
 Estonia™s remarkable export performance has been 
the main driving force behind the recovery. A 

favourable external environme
nt, particularly in 

Sweden, pushed up foreign demand. Exports of 
goods increased by 47% y
-o-y in the first half of 
2011, with the main contribution coming from 
electrical machinery and equipment exports to 

Sweden. Such a strong export
-driven recovery 
refle
cts a significant cost adjustment, which 
improved Estonia™s competitiveness and has 

helped to gain market shares.
 Along with foreign trade and its positive 

implications, domestic demand started to rebound 

in the second half of 2010 and increased by 10.6% 

y-o-y in the first half of 2011. Though 
approximately half of domestic demand growth 
came from the inventories cycle, private 
consumption and investment are also on solid 

footing. Consumption was boosted by strengthened 

confidence due to the recovering econ
omy and the 
euro adoption on 1 January 2011. Investment 

increased by 17.6% in the first half of 2011, 

mostly supported by purchases of equipment. 
Household investment in dwellings started to 
increase at the end of 2010, though remains at a 

comparatively lo
w level. Stalling public 
investment at the end of 2010 and in the beginning 

of 2011 were disappointing compared to the high 

investment planned by the government for 2011
-12. –but domestic demand is reviving
 Estonia™s export performance is slowing towards 
the end of 2011, although still growing by 25% on 
average in real terms.
 Along with the expected 
global slowdown and faltering external demand, 
exports are expected to weaken at the end of 2011, 
slowing down to 3.8% in 2012 and rebounding 

back up to 6% in 2
013, supported by the cost and 

productivity adjustments during the past two years.
 Reflecting increases in household disposable 

income and an improved labour market situation, 

private consumption is expected to grow by 3½% 

towards the end of the forecast h
orizon. Household 
savings, which increased significantly during the 

crisis, are on a downward trend but are expected to 

remain positive over the forecast horizon as 
individuals continue to deleverage. Consumption 
will be supported by the pension increases 

announced for spring 2012, bringing relief to 

elderly people who have been struggling with high 

food and energy inflation. Nevertheless, rising 

uncertainty and high unemployment may 
jeopardise the recovery and might lead to higher 
households™ saving again.

 Fixed investment is expected to remain strong 

during the whole forecast period. Corporate 

investment in equipment has rebounded against the 

backdrop of higher export demand. Though 

capacity utilisation reached 74% in summer 2011, 

indicating further investment needs, new projects 
may be put on hold until the global economy 
overcomes the current uncertainty.
 In 2012, strong 
public sector investment is set to counter the 

slowdown of cor
porate investment, with robust 
infrastructure investment reflecting a higher 
absorption of EU structural funds and investment 
related to the carbon credit trade contracts.
 Stronger domestic demand and industrial exports 

will prop up imports, with a slightl
y negative trade 
balance reducing the current
-account surplus 
towards 2013. The improved profitability of 
foreign
-owned companies will lead to an 
increasing income account deficit.
 Member States, Estonia
   99 Overall, annual GDP growth for 2011 of an 
expected 8% is higher than projec
ted in the 
previous forecast. Weaker external demand would 

drive GDP growth down to 3.2% in 2012, followed 
by a rebound in 2013 to 4%. The growth profile is 
projected to be more balanced as domestic demand 
gains ground.
 Unemployment and skill mismatches re
main a 
concern despite labour market recovery 
 After peaking at 16.9% in 2010, unemployment 
(age 15
-74) has declined very rapidly and is likely 
to be below 13% for 2011. Job creation, which 

resumed in the buoyant exporting industry already 
in 2010, has now
 largely spread to agriculture, 
construction and services. This strong rebound has 
been made possible by significant labour costs 

adjustments during the crisis, by Estonia's labour 

market flexibility as well as by recent changes to 

the status of the self
-employed. Employment 
growth is expected to continue in 2012, though at a 

much slower pace, as external demand slows down 
before regaining strength in 2013, when both 
domestic and external demand are expected to 

reinforce. Activity rates, which remained high
 both 
in historic terms as well as by country comparison 

throughout the crisis, increased further in the first 

half of 2011, pulled by the strong output recovery. 

However, activity may decline somewhat in 2012 
and 2013 as many young unemployed may return 
to the education system while discouraged long
-term unemployed may decide to leave the labour 

force.

 Active labour market policies will progressively 

rebalance from wage subsidies to training or 

ret
raining activities as the economy strengthens. 
Nevertheless, unemployment is expected to remain 

relatively high in both 2012 and 2013, despite 

growing levels of vacancies for skilled 
professionals and technicians. As the economy 

rebalances towards tradable
 sectors as well as to 
"greener" production processes and output, there is 

a risk that growing skills mismatches feed into 

persistent unemployment and reduce labour supply 
and further growth.
 Following the adjustment in the recent downturn, 

the average mon
thly gross wage in the whole 
economy reverted to positive growth in 2010 and 

could rise by more than 4% in 2011. Furthermore, 

nominal wage growth can be expected to 

accelerate in both 2012 and 2013, reflecting higher 

demand for labour but also likely skill
s 
mismatches and shortages. However, with nominal 
wage growth stabilised since spring 2011, real 
wage growth may not turn positive before mid
-2012, when inflation starts to subside.
 –as are persistently high prices
 After negative values in the first half o
f 2010, 
average annual inflation rapidly rose and hovered 

around 5.0
-5.5% in the first half of 2011, spurred 
by high international food and oil prices. 
Commodity prices in Estonia are very responsive 
to world market prices, reflecting a consumption 

basket 
rich in food and energy imports, the 
prevalence of short
-term contracts as well as the 
price
-taker nature of the economy. In parallel, 
prices in some specific (especially food) sectors 
likely suffered from oligopolistic market 
conditions, the extensive use
 of domestic inputs as 
well as higher demand from neighbouring 

countries. Tax changes and administered price 

increases also had a sizeable impact on average 

inflation (1.6 pps. in 2010 and 0.8 pp. expected in 

2011). Conversely, core inflation (i.e. inflati
on 
excluding energy, processed and unprocessed 
food), in particular the contribution of non
-energy 
industrial goods, remained low in both 2010 and 

2011, alleviating the risk of competitiveness 

losses. The impact of the euro changeover on 1 
January 2011 app
eared limited and mostly 
concentrated on services categories.
 Looking forward, the expected decline in global 

commodity prices should contribute to inflation 

moderation in 2012 and 2013. Nevertheless, there 

is a risk that second
-round effects add to an 
upw
ard pressure on wages due to relative 
shortages and skills mismatches in a growing and 

changing economy. Despite the flexibility of the 

labour market this may still hinder competitiveness 

and hence weigh on growth prospects.

 Sound public finances meet strong economic 
growth and sizeable investment commitments
 General government finances are expected to reach 
a surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2011. This is due to 
an increase in 
tax 
revenues due to 
strong
 economic 
growth
, as well as to the positive one

related to sales of the so

, public finances are

The nominal general government position is 
expected to be better than the cyclically adjusted 

one, reflecting the closi
ng output gap. Taking into 
account the cyclical component and the 
one

 The genera
l government debt will remain very low 
and stable. It is projected to decline to less than 6% 

of GDP in 2011, before increasing marginally over 

the forecast horizon. It is assumed that the deficit 

in 2012 and 2013 will be financed partly by 

running down pr

. 7. IRELAND
 Export
-driven recovery weighed by continuing household 
deleveraging and fiscal consolidation
  101 Irish economy returns to timid growth
 Ireland's economy saw an unprecedented coll
apse 
between 2007 and 2010, with GDP falling by 10% 
in real terms and 18% in nominal terms. The 

decline was led by the collapse in gross 
fixed 
capital formation (down 52% over the period in 

real terms). Although export gains were strong 

over the period 
des
pite
 the 
sharp decline
 in global 
demand, the 
interlinkages
 between the sovereign 
and banking sectors in the wake of the 2008 credit 

crunch saw borrowing costs jump to unsustainable 
levels 
by late 2010. This precipitated joint EU
-IMF 
support
 to provide sove
reign financing, allowing 
time to implement a policy programme aimed at 
restor
ing
 confidence in the Irish banking sector 
and public finances. 
 Since the programme was agreed in November 
2010, Ireland's economy has continued to adjust 
broadly 
in line with e
xpectations underpinning the 
EU
-IMF programme. Domestic dema
nd will 
contract again in 2011. However, this will be 
more 
than offset by a 
growth 
contribution from net 
exports of over 3 
pps.
 of GDP
, giving a headline 
growth figure of 
1.1% for 2011 as a whole.
 This 
divergent economic development will continue in 

2012. External
 demand will 
support growth with 
the domestic economy continuing to shrink, 
as 

exports continue to have only a limited 
impact on 

the labour market. 
Overall growth is projected at 
1.1
% in 
2012.
 Moving to the medium term, growth 
is expected to pick up to 2.3% in 2013 as the non
-traded sectors of the economy return to growth and 

the labour market begins to 
improve. Despite the 

slight upward revision to real growth in 2011, the 

deflator has bee
n revised noticeably downward 
from 0.6% to 
-1.0%. This is due to the negative 
terms
-of-trade developments in the first half of 
2011 stemming from high energy prices as well as 
export price weakness. However these 

developments are expected to unwind in 2012
. Domestic economy will remain weak
 Growth in the first half of 
2011 was strong, with 
GDP increasing by 1.3% 
y-o-y, a tentative sign
 of 
economic stabilisation. Although quarterly output 

in Ireland is highly volatile, this was the first time 
since GDP peake
d in 2007 that
 output
 expanded
 for 
two successive quarter
s. Although net exports 
and stock
-building were the dominant 
contributions 
to growth 
in the second quarter
, domestic demand showed positive signs
 too
, growing by 0.8%

forecast
 Still, private consumption is set to decline by 2
.4% in 2011, with government consumption falling by 
slightly more
. The contraction is being driven by 
continued high
 private saving due to both 
precautionary 
motives and the need for households 
to repair their balance sheets. Private consumption 
is set to fall again in 2012 (by 1.1%) as the effects 
of deleveraging and continued fiscal consolidation 

continue.
 Over the forecast horizon, public 
consumption is set 
to decline as consolidation 
continues. However, the annual profile is 

somewhat uneven as the provision of government 

guarantees to the banking sector affects. 
 Investment is set to decline again in 2011 with a 

positive contribution from machinery and 

equip
ment investment 
being outweighed by 
the 
continuing 
(but expected) 
contraction in 
construction output. 
Continuing the 2011 recovery, 
machinery and equipment investment is set to 
grow again in 2012 
(despite credit constraints
) as
 re-tooling
 is 
over
due after 
the large contraction 
since 2008
. This will broadly offset a further fall in 

construction output in 2012 with the net 

contribution to growth from 
gross fixed capital 
formation essentially flat for the year. 
Following a 
strong increase in 
inventories
 in the
 first half of 
2011, the contribution from stock
-building has 
been revised upward to 0.9 
pp.
 of GDP this year. 
Given the slowdown in external demand growth, 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   102 stock
-building is forecast to have a zero 
contribution to growth in 2012. 
 From 2013 on, domestic d
emand is set to 
provide
 a small but positive contribution to g
rowth, for the 
first since 2007, on the back of a return to 
employment growth and a further decline in 
private savings. 
 Exports stay solid
 Ireland's export performance has remained strong 

this 
year on the back of strong demand in the 
pharmaceutical and agri
-food sector, as well as 
gains from competitiveness improvements in 
rece
nt years. Real exports grew by 5.5%
 in the first 
half of 2011 compared to the same period in 201
0. Despite 
the global
 sl
owdown in the second half of 
the year, export growth for the year 
as a whole is 
set to average 4.5
% in 2011. 
Due to the
 a-cyclical 
composition of exports (in particular 

pharmaceuticals)
, the 
impact of the current 
slowdown in global demand is set to 
be rela
tively 
limited in Ireland 
with 
export growth slowing to 
3.8% in 2012, with a small terms of trade 
improvement expected too
. A recovery in global 
trade combined with continuing labour cost
 improvements 
compared to trading partners should 
see export
s return 
to robust growth 
approaching
 5% in the medium term
. Imports 
will continue to 
be 
held back by subdued domestic demand
 and 
net 
export growth is set to contribute substantially to 

medium
-term economic activity. 
 Weak employment outlook over forecast 
horizon
 Despite the 
timid 
economic 
upturn
, the labour 
market 
is showing little sign of recovery. 
Employment contracted by 2.1% in the year to the 
second quarter and t
he 
monthly
 measure of 
unemployment has risen gradually through
 the 
year to 14.3% in September. Job 
growth has 
restarted
 in some export
-oriented sectors but this is 
not likely to offset 
the 
continuing contraction in 
construction and public service employment
 this 
year or next
. The rebalancing need is compounded 
by the skillsets of the considerable number
 of long
-term unemployed (54% of total) who originate 

disproportionately from the construction and 

manufacturing
 sectors. Employmen
t is set to fall 
by 1.9
% in 2011 with a fu
rther reduction in 2012 
of 0.6
%. Net outward migration is set to continue 
over the 
forecast horizon
, dampening 
unemployment
 growth, although 
strong natural 
increase will keep population growth positive.
 Unemployment is set to 
average 14.4
% this year
, with a gradual decline to 14.3
% in 2012
 and 13.6% 
in 2013
. Over the medium term, the uni
quely high 
propensity to migrate makes estimates of 
unemployment outcomes in Ireland difficult.

 Inflation turns slightly positive
 During the domestic boom, Ireland suffered 

significant losses
 in competitiveness, as reflected 
in a strong rise in unit labour costs from 2002 to 

2008. Irish price levels grew to be among the 
highest in the euro area. 
Since early 2008, 
Irish 
inflation has been below the euro
-area average and 
a cumulative contraction
 of 3% in the HICP took 
place in 2009 and 2010.
 While inflation will return 
to positive territory this 
year and next
, it should 
remain subdued in the absence of strong de
mand 
pressures. Inflation of 1.1
% in 2011
 will be driven 
by external energy and admini
stered service 
increases, while core inflationary pressures re
main 
very weak. Inflation of 0.7
% is now expected for 
2012 although this 
will
 largely 
be

 Member States, Ireland
   103 Current account bounces back
 Ireland's external position is rebalancing
 and an
 unexpected 
current
-account surplus of 0.5% of 
GDP was recorded in 2010, the first surplus since 
1999. However this was followed by a deficit of 
1.1% of GDP 
in the first half of 2011 as corporate 
profit outflows to foreign affiliates surged on the 
back of the strong export performance. This trend 
often weakens in the second half of the year an
d another small surplus of 0.7
% is forecast for 2011. 
Over the mediu
m term this trend is expected to 
intensify 
with 
growth 
being export
-led while 
domestic demand remains weak as household 

deleveraging and fiscal consolidation continue. 
  Pace of credit contraction slows
 The contraction in bank credit has stabilised. On a 

year-on-year basis, credit advanced to households 
and to non
-financial corporations contracted by 
4.0% and 2.7% respectively in August. The credit 

contraction to households seems to be steadily 

recovering from its trough of 5.3% in December 
2010. Credit to 
non
-financial corporations has 
been volatile. Looking forward, credit expansion is 
not expected to be strong in the short to medium 

term in the context of banks deleveraging and 

limited credit demand.
 Consolidation continues
 The government deficit ratio to
 GDP 
reached a 
record
 31.3
% in 2010
, including 
one
-off banking 
sector support measures
 of 
20% of GDP
. As 
compared to the spring 2011 forecast the deficit is 
down by 1.1
 pps. of GDP due to the revisions to 
the public finance data and nominal GDP.

% of GDP
 The government deficit is estimated at 10.3% of 
GDP in 2011. Despite permanent fiscal 
consolidation measures of 3¼% of GDP, the 
structural deficit is estimated
 to decline by only 
½ pp. of GDP over 2010. The difference stems 
from negative
 potential growth and closing output 
gap, as well as negative domestic demand 

developments
 Œ the main source of tax revenue and 
job creation. 
Lower tax revenue and some overruns 
in mainly social spending are estimated at 0.3% of 

GDP as compared to the spring 2011 forecast. 

However, these are more than offset by higher
-than
-expected non
-tax revenue 
Œ fees on the bank 
guarantees (0.4% of GDP) and interests on the 

bonds injected as c
onvertible contingent capital 

into the domestic banks (0.1% of GDP). 
The sale 

of the spectrum licenses announced in the 2011 

budget is likely to take place in 2012 (one
-off 
revenue of 0.3% of GDP), but the Jobs Initiative 
announced in May 2011 has a defici
t-improving 
effect of 0.1% of GDP. The Jobs Initiative is 
budgetary neutral over the period 2011
-14, while 
having a deficit
-increasing effect of 0.1% of GDP 
in 2012 and 2013, and positive effect of similar 

size in 2011 and 2014. It includes a temporary lev
y 
on pension funds yielding almost 0.3% of GDP 

annually, which compensates for temporary 
reductions in some tourism
-related VAT rates and 
social security contributions on low wages. Interest 
rate margin reduction on EU loans provided as part 

of the EU
-IMF 
programme is estimated to produce 
savings of 0.2% of GDP. One
-off banking support 
measures (including possible capital injection in 

the credit union sector) of 11% of GDP in 2011 are 
considered as financial transactions in the forecast 
until their statisti
cal treatment is confirmed by 

Eurostat.
 The deficit ratio is projected to decrease to 8.6% of 

GDP in 2012 and 7.8% in 2013 
taking into account 
broad consolidation measures of 2
½% of GDP 
and 
almost 2%, respectively, as agreed under the 
financial assistance 
programme. The forecast 
includes savings from the interest rate margin 

reduction (½% of GDP annually). The deficit in 

2012 is improved by higher bank guarantee fees 
(0.2% of GDP), 
higher Central Bank's profits
 (0.2% of GDP)
 and return on the convertible bo
nds 
in the banks
 (0.2% of GDP
). Overall, the positive 
effects on the 2012 deficit outweigh negative 
effects of the weaker growth on revenue and 

unemployment
-related expenditure (1% of GDP). 
The temporary non
-tax revenue,
 which help reduce 
the forecast defi
cit in 2012
 are projected to recede 
in 2013.

      104 From a level of 25% in 2007, the debt
-to-GDP 
ratio is projected to peak at around 121% of GDP 
in 2013 before declining. This reflects the large 

primary deficits, banking sector support measures 
and rising debt s
ervicing costs. 
Debt project
ions 
also include the impact of
 the participation in the 
capital of the ESM as planned on the cut
-off date 
of the forecast
. Precautionary cash balances are 
assumed at 7½% of GDP by end 2013. 
 Risks remain balanced
 Over the mediu
m term
, growth is expected to pick 
up to 2.3% in 2013 as net export growth continues 
to make a positive contribution and domestic 

demand stabilises as the household saving ratio 
begins to fall.
 Lower growth stemming from weaker
-than
-expected global demand
 in 2012 is a very real risk, 
as exports comprise a large share of Irish GDP. 
However, the composition of Irish exports and 

their relatively non
-cyclical relationship with 
global demand would offset this to some extent
. 
Although 
growth has returned
, a pick
-up in 
employment is likely to lag considerably, which 

has particularly pressing policy challenges. On the 
upside, 
precautionary savings are high giving 
scope for a reduction and 
the Irish household 
sector is likely to find considerable relief in 2012 
give
n its exposure to short
-term interest rates.
   8. GREECE
 Painful adjustment
  105 Note: The following text and the forecast were 
finalised before the European Union S
ummit of 

26 October. Thus, they have not been updated 

to reflect the decisions taken at this summit 
which will have a direct impact on the debt 
and the deficit projections as of 2012. 
 Growth prospects are weakening further
 2011 is the fourth consecutive y
ear of declining 
economic activity. Over the course of this year real 

GDP is expected to contract substantially more 

than in 2010, falling by 5.5%.
 This is mainly due 
to domestic demand remaining very weak, marked 

by income losses, the adjustment in the la
bour 
market and highly restrictive credit conditions. 

Growth is also expected to remain negative in 

2012, with a recovery setting in from the last 

quarter of that year onwards. Overall, the Greek 
economy is expected to contract by about 15% 
from the beginn
ing of the crisis. 
 Conversely, underlying inflation, wage settlements 
and unit labour costs are moderating, thereby 

improving overall competitiveness. The 

progressive rebalancing of the economy as well as 
growth
-enhancing reforms and improving 
medium
-term
 prospects abroad are expected to 
move the economy back onto stable footing from 
2013 onwards, provided that 
the current adverse 

climate improves.
 Labour market adjusting amid social tensions
 The labour market is undergoing considerable 

adjustment. A profo
und contraction in economic 

activity, reflected in further weakening of labour 

demand, is weighing considerably on employment, 
which is set to fall in 2011 by nearly 6%. Reduced 
employment opportunities in the private sector and 

recruitment rearrangements
 in the public sector 
will likely push the unemployme
nt rate above 18
% in 2012. In turn, the weak labour market combined 

with declining wages is set to weigh on disposable 
income over the medium
-term, dampening real 
demand. Furthermore, as a result of conti
nuing 
uncertainty, private consumption is projected to 
contract further within the forecast horizon. There 

is evidence of strong downward pressure on labour 

costs, in particular non
-basic pay, as the cuts in 
public sector wages spill over to the private se
ctor 
and firms strive to recover competitiveness. 
However, this phenomenon will 
probably not 

ensure a fall in unemployment in the near term.
 Nonetheless, a faster rebound of employment in 

the recovery phase is possible, although this would 

depend on labour
 market reforms being 
implemented as planned and a swift reallocation of 

productive resources from non
-tradable sectors to 
tradables occurring.
 Labour costs are falling, 
primarily as a result of the deterioration in the 

labour market but 
wage
-setting
 refor
ms may also 
have contributed to this development. 
Moreover, 

wage moderation is driven by firms moving 
towards more flexible working arrangements, like 
part
-time employment or intermittent jobs.  Further 
declines in unit labour
 costs are likely to continue 
in coming years.

 Tight liquidity 
 Tight liquidity and a rising share of non
-performing loans are putting strains on the banking 

system. In line with the slowdown of economic 

activity 
and continuing deposit outflows, the 
annual growth rate of credit to the private sector 

remains negative. The private sector's access to 

credit remains restricted due to its high costs 

stemming from market pressures and elevated 

spreads. 
 Investment in bot
h housing and equipment has 
been continuously falling strongly. In 2011 fixed 

investment it is set to decrease by 16%. Public 

investment activity is also expected to remain 

particularly depressed in 2011 as a result of 

continued fiscal consolidation effort
s. Several 
initiatives taken in the public domain 
Œ including 
the acceleration in the absorption of EU Structural 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   106 Funds resources and the new investment law 
Œ may help improve market sentiment and thus 
contribute to a recovery in public investment as of 

2012. 
 Inflation pressure is on a declining path
 In 2011 the inflation pressure that built up in 2010 

(4.7
% annual average) is set to decline. The latest 
available data indicate that prices (HICP basis) 

have increased by 2.9% y
-o-y in September, down 
from 4.
9% in January 2011. For 2011 as a whole 
the overall inflation rate is expected to be 3%, 

reflecting the impact of the recent tax measures, 

while constant tax inflation in 2011 is projected at 

1%.

pps.
Headline inflation
At constant taxes
forecast
 However, a number of structural reforms targeting 

the existing inflexibilities in domestic markets 

would positively affect both inflation and inflation 

expectations. Looking forward, both headline and 

core inflation should declin
e as base effects and 
tax effects fade out, and slack in the economy and 
wage moderation start feeding through. 
 Slow adjustment in external imbalances
 The contraction in domestic demand, which is 
expected to be sustained over the forecast horizon, 

is also
 mirrored by shrinking total imports, which 
in 2011 are expected to fall by more than 6%. 
Total exports will be further supported in 2011
-12 by labour cost developments. However, these 
positive prospects may be weakened by less 

favourable than expected ext
ernal conditions, 
including a slower pace of global economic 

growth. Exports of goods should rise by around 
7% on average in 2011 and 2012, while exports of 
services 
Œ in particular world trade
-sensitive 
merchant shipping and tourist receipts 
Œ should 
reco
ver at a much slower pace in the wake of the 
global economic slow
-down. All in all, the 
contribution of net exports to GDP growth should 

be clearly positive in 2011 and 2012, due to both 

the accelerating pick
-up in exports and the ongoing 
contraction in im
ports. The current
-account deficit 
is expected to be 
10% of GDP in 2011 and to 
shrink to below 8%
 of GDP in 2012. Expected 
competitiveness gains and the benefits from 

ongoing structural reforms may result in an even 

faster adjustment of the current
-account
 balance.
 The risks to this baseline scenario are broadly 

balanced.
 On the positive side, the contribution of 
net exports to GDP growth may turn out to be 

stronger than projected in case the impact of 

ongoing and planned structural reforms arrives 

more swi
ftly and external demand recovers faster. 
In particular, the rapid implementation of measures 

aimed at enhancing investment opportunities and 

attract FDI may speed up the recovery. On the 

negative side, given the uncertainty about the 

turning point of the 
business cycle, it cannot 

currently be excluded that the economy may take 

longer than expected to return to positive territory. 

This risk is also reinforced by the projected global 
economic slowdown.
 Fiscal effort during downturn
 There has been progress in
 fiscal consolidation 
since the beginning of the adjustment programme, 
as the government deficit in 2011 will be just 

above half its 2009 level. Nonetheless, the fiscal 
target for 2011 will be missed again. This is 
mainly attributed to revenue fatigue asso
ciated 
with a deeper recession, an unstable tax 

environment and considerable income losses; on 

the other hand, primary current spending of the 

government has again proven its lack of 
responsiveness to policy intentions, making 
structural and institutional 
reform even more of a 
necessary condition for further consolidation. 

Under unchanged policies, the 2012 budget target 

of a government deficit of 7% of GDP is within 

reach.
 While there have been deficiencies in the 

implementation of fiscal measures, the 

Gov
ernment 
has 
made important progress in 
consolidation efforts. In June, Greece adopted the 

medium
-term fiscal strategy (MTFS), specifying a 
set of consolidation and fiscal structural reform 

measures through 
to 
2015. For 2011, the MTFS 
provided for fiscal co
nsolidation measures

% for the period through 2014. Most 
measures provided for in the MTFS for 2011 have 
been duly legislated and are being implemented. 

However, in a number of cases the quantification 
of the measures had to be revised downwards 
because 
of implementation 
delay
s or
 changes to 
their design 
that 
reduc
e their impact; in a few 
instances, the agreed measures were not 

implemented. Nevertheless, the deeper
-than
-expected contraction in economic a
ctivity, 

taxpayers' liquidity constraints, as well as other 

fiscal slippages (
e.g.
 in the fight against tax 
evasion) have also contributed to the reopening of 
a gap vis
-à-vis the previously agreed annual fiscal 
targets. The Government has prepared an 
addit
ional package of expenditure and revenue 
measures to minimi
se the fiscal slippage for 2011 
and to 
meet
 the fiscal targets for 2012
-14. It 
is 
no longer viable 
to close the fiscal gap for 2011. 
 The 2011 government deficit will most likely be 

between 8.5
% and 9
% of GDP, well above the 
ceiling of 7¾
% of GDP. So far, Greece
's fiscal 
consolidation has been well above the fiscal efforts 
in other European countries. According to 
available estimates, in 2010 and 2011 Gree
ce has 
implemented 
consolidation measures 
worth more 
than 16% 
of GDP 
in order 
to reduce the deficit 

from 15½
% of GDP in 2009 to 8.5
-9% in 2011. 
The fiscal consolidation effort of Greece has been 

very large, but more measures will be necessary. 

Without these measures, the government deficit 

would ha
ve kept on increasing.
  9. SPAIN
 Unwinding imbalances in a weakening external environment
  108 Continued rebalancing with slowing growth
 Real GDP is forecast to grow 
by around 
0.7% 
in 
2011 and 2012 and to gather some pace in 2013. 
Net exports should 
continue
 to 
support growth, 
with domestic demand becoming less of a drag 
over the forecast horizon and gaining strength 
from 2013 onwards. 
However, in interpreting these 

numbers it has to be kept in mind that these 
forecasts are significantly influenced by the 

technical no
-policy
-change assumption for 2012 
and 2013. D
ue to general elections scheduled for 
20 November 2011, the draft budget for 2012 has 

not been adopted yet. T
herefore, 
in line with the 
usual
 no-policy
-change assumption, the current 
forecast 
only takes into account
 a temporary 
extension of the 2011 budget into the first few 

months of 2012
 and measures already adopted or 
known with sufficient detail
. The fiscal 
consolidation 
efforts 
required in 2012 and 2013 to 
meet the deficit targets of 4.4% and 3% of GDP, 
respectively, 
are not yet reflected
 in this forecast. 
Taking into account these consolidation measures 

would significantly change the picture both for real 

GDP growth and for individual components.
 Spain has been recovering slowly from the sharp 

contraction experienced in the aftermath of the 

reversal of the housing and credit booms. The 

necessary correction of large internal and external 

imbalances accumulated
 during the boom years is 
ongoing and will prevail for some time. The 
medium
-term growth outlook continues to be 
affected by private sector deleveraging aimed at 
reducing the large stock of debt, fiscal 

consolidation needed to bring the public deficit 

back
 to a sustainable level, banking sector 
restructuring and record
-high unemployment. 
Weakening global growth and heightened 

uncertainty related to the intensification of the 

euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis also impinge on 
growth prospects. Nevertheless, on 
the back of 

resilient external demand and the progressive 

absorption of earlier imbalances, the recovery is 

expected to continue in the coming years
, albeit 
sluggish
. A weakening external environment and 
heightened 

uncertainty
 compared with spring have led
 to a 
downward revision of projected economic growth 

in 2011 and 2012. The weaker outlook has 
negative consequences for the Spanish banking 
sector. Despite already significant write
-downs 
(amounting to 10% of GDP since 2008), banks still 
have large exposur
es to the real estate sector. Due 
to difficult funding conditions the deleveraging 

process has accelerated, further reducing lending 

to the private sector, which may have negative 
consequences for investment and consumption of 
durable goods. Bank profitabi
lity is declining and 
credit risk remains a concern, as non
-performing 
loans are rising and house price adjustment is 

ongoing. In order to enhance the resilience of the 

banking system the Bank of Spain has increased 
minimum capital requirements, which have
 been 
already met by a vast majority of banks.

 Slow recovery of domestic demand
 Private consumption has remained subdued in

In addition, 
household
s have started to reduce the
 large stock 
of debt accumulated 
in the run

the crisis. 
As

 began
, the saving rate

over the forecast horizon
. Under a no

-change assumption, private consumption is 
expected to increase moderately in 2012 despite 
wealth losses due to falling house prices. This 
increase will be driven by some strengthening o
f household incomes thanks to a weaker contraction 

of employment and somewhat higher wage growth 

(due to the assumed fading out of public sector 

wage cuts under a no
-policy
-change assumption). 
In addition, inflation is set to decline noticeably, 

thus boost
ing real disposable incomes. The impact 
of fiscal consolidation measures required to meet 
Member States, Spain
   109 fiscal targets on household incomes is not reflected 
in this forecast. Household deleveraging is 

expected to continue and will be manifested 

mainly in lower housing i
nvestment. All in all, 
households are expected to remain net lenders over 

the forecast horizon.
 The financial situation of n
on-financial 
corporations 
has been improving in recent years. 
Their gross operating surplus has increas
ed, partly 
due to a significa
nt adjustment in employment
. This allowed them to 
achieve a net lending 

position
 for the first time in over a decade
, leading 
to further reductions in the stock of accumulated 

debt. However, average capacity utilisation is low 

and 
GDP is set to remain belo
w its potential 
over
 the 
forecast horizon even though the output gap is 
gradually closing. Given high levels of uncertainty 

investment has been very weak and has been 

almost entirely driven by replacement investment. 

In 2012 low growth prospects combined w
ith a 
potentially binding credit constraint may delay a 

stronger recovery. At the same time, the improving 

financial situation of enterprises and historically 

low interest rates should support somewhat 

stronger investment growth over the forecast 

horizon. 
 It is envisaged that the post
-boom adjustment in 
residential investment will have run its course by 

2013, although
 this process
 is being 
held back
 by 
more acute credit restriction in this sector
 (credit to 
the construction sector has been declining at a 

higher rate than credit to other sectors of the 
Spanish economy). All in all, a gradual recovery in 

private investment is expected in 2012 followed by 

some acceleration in 2013. 
 Exports continue to 
support economic growth
 Exports surprised on the upside in
 the first half of 
2011, recording a particularly strong performance 

in the first quarter. Robust export growth is 

expected to be sustained over the forecast horizon, 
although at a more moderate pace in line with the 
weaker external environment. The streng
th of 
exports stems mainly from the economic recovery 

of Spain's main trading partners, growing trade 

with emerging economies, and some improvement 

in the competitiveness of the Spanish economy due 
to declining unit labour costs.
 Intermediate and capital g
oods have been driving 
the strong export performance so far and they are 
expected to play a key role also in the future. In 
addition, services, including tourism, have also 
been growing strongly. In terms of geographical 
diversification, Spanish exports go
 mainly to other 
EU economies, but this share has been decreasing 

in favour of countries from outside the EU, which 
accounted for 40% of total exports growth in the 
second quarter of 2011. In addition, exports to 

non
-EU countries have been more dynamic, 
recording twice the rate of growth of intra
-EU 
exports. 
The robust export performance may also 
be explained by the presence of more competitive 

firms in the export sector compared to the rest of 

the 
Spanish economy. These firms tend to be 
larger, more produc
tive, and characterised by 
lower unit labour costs.
 Furthermore, recent 
evidence suggests that some firms have switched 

from domestic to external markets, thus increasing 
the export base of the Spanish economy. 
These 
latest trends are expected to continue 
over the 

forecast horizon, also in view of the recent euro 

depreciation. However, the pace of growth of 

exports of goods and services is expected to 

decelerate significantly to more moderate year
-on-year growth rates of 4
-5% for goods and around 
3% for ser
vices in 2012
-13. 
 Strong export growth combined with less dynamic 

imports due to weak internal demand resulted in a 

decrease in the trade and current
-account deficits. 
The adjustment of the external imbalance is 

expected to continue, supported by the rela
tive 

strength of external demand in comparison to 
internal demand and by some 
fall
 in oil prices.

 Employment creation delayed until 2013
 Compared to spring 2011 the outlook fo

, driven 
mainly by weaker growth. Employment is 

expected to decline more significantly 
in 
both 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   110 2011 and 2012. In 2012, additional job shedding 
should
 put upward pressure on the unemployment 
rate
, although this is likel
y to be
 limited by a 
decrease in 
the 
active population 
due to
 a siz
eable 
net outflow of migrant workers. 
Since the activity 

rate of i
mmigrants 
is one third higher 
than
 the 
domestic
 population
, the impact of this outflow on 
the size of 
the 
active population
 is greater than 
implied by
 the absolute 
outflow
.  The unemployment rate is not expected to fall 

below 20% over the forecast horizon. The sharp 

economic contraction and the 
still weak economic 
growth during the recovery, 
together with
 the 
ongoing structura
l adjustment in the construction 
sector
, largely explain the surge in unemployment
. Furthermore, rising
 rates of long
-term 
unemployment 
also point to 
an increase in the 
structural component of unemployment.
  Moderation in wage growth and inflation
 Inflatio
n is expected to decline to just above 2% by 
the end of 2011 and to remain relatively low over 
the forecast horizon. The difference between 

headline and core inflation is expected to be small 
due to more contained movements in oil prices 
than in the past. 
In addition, the differential with 

the euro area is expected to be negative due to 

weak internal demand and a lower energy bill 

(with Spanish prices exhibiting higher sensitivity 

to oil prices than the euro
-area average). 
 Nominal wage growth moderated sin
ce autumn 
2010, partly due to a wage cut in public wages in 

June 2010. As these effects fade out (under the no
-policy
-change assumption), wage growth is bound 
to accelerate, albeit remaining below the historical 

trend. Data for the first half of 2011 point
 to a 
significant 
negative wage drift
, linked partly to a 
rising share of temporary workers and lower wages 

for newly
-hired workers. Nevertheless, persistent 
wage rigidities prevent a more substantial 

adjustment of wages in an environment of very 
high unem
ployment. Nominal unit labour costs are 
set to increase slightly but will remain below the 
euro
-area average over the forecast horizon, partly 
due to increases in productivity. This should lead 

to an improvement in Spain's competitive position 

relative to 
other euro
-area countries. 
 Risks
 to the baseline scenario
 This baseline scenario is subject to considerable 

risks. In particular, the fiscal consolidation 
required in 2012 and 2013 to meet the deficit 
targets will impact on the forecast. Moreover, a 
more 
pro
nounced impact of credit constraints on 
firms and households, both in terms of cost and 

availability of credit, constitutes an additional 
downside risk. Finally, 
a persistently higher 
household saving rate due to increased uncertainty 

would also put neg
ative additional pressure on 
private consumption. 
 Fiscal consolidation
 still needs further efforts to 
meet targets
 The government deficit is projected to be 6.6% of 

GDP in 2011. This would imply a reduction of 

2.7
 pps. of GDP 
from the 9.3% of GDP recorded
 in 2010. The likely slippage from the 2011 target is 
confirmed by 
national accounts data 
for the first 
half
 of the year. 
This reflects in particular the fact 
that m
any autonomous communities exceeded 
considerably 
their budget deficit target
s for the 
first
 half of the year
. In the meantime, 
consolidation measures 
are being
 put in place
 both 
at regional and central level, which
 will have an 
impact in the second part of the year
 and contain
 the 
expected 
end
-of-year slippage.
 Even further 
corrective action wou
ld be required to reach the 
deficit 
target
 this year.
 The higher
-than
-targeted deficit in 2011 is due 
mainly to the emergence of a less favourable 
macroeconomic scenario than expected by the 
government. 
 Together with the expected slippages 
at regional lev
el this explains the deviation of 
0.6
 pp. of GDP
 from the 2011 official deficit 
target. Total revenues are set to rise by 2.3% in 
2011, boosted by 
revenue
-increasing fiscal 
measures in both direct and indirect taxation, such 
as the increases in VAT rates i
ntroduced in 
mid
-2010, in excise duties
 in December 2010, 
changes to corporate taxation introduced in August 
of this year and the introduction of a wealth tax for 

2011 and 2012 in September of this year.
 Nevertheless, total revenues are still expected to 
fall short relative to plans.
 Total expenditure is 
expected to decline by 
3.9
%, 
underpinned
 also by 
discretionary measures such as reductions 
in public 
investment 
and publicly
-financed pharmaceutical 
expenses
, a freeze in public sector wages and the 
phasing
-out of the
 0.5% of GDP 2010 stimulus 
package.

forecast
 The 
2011 
deficit outcome is expected to be uneven 
across 
the different levels of government in 
relation to 
the respective 
targets. Whereas the 
central government is broadly on track to meet its 
target, 
as reflected by budgetary execution data, 
slippages are expected for regional governments 

and the social securi
ty system.  
 Based on the 
no-policy
-change
 assumption, the 
budget deficit is forecast to
 reach 5.9% and 5.3% 
of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively. For 2012, 

given the delay in the budget preparation due to 

the general elections to be held on 20 November 

2011, the 2011 budget is likely to be temporarily 
extended as stated in the Constitution. Bearing this 

in mind, the 
forecast 
for 2012 has to
 be 
interpreted
 with 
particular 
caution
, particularly as regards the 
expenditure side, for which the no
-policy
-change 
assumption has a particular relevance
. Necessary 
consolidation measures to be included in the 2012 

budget 
would
 significantly alter currently 
projected figures. Under
 the
 unchanged
-policy 
assumption
, an 
additional fiscal consolidation of 
1.5 pp
s. of GDP in
 2012 and 2.3 pp
s. of GDP in 
2013 would be required to meet the deficit targets. 
 The structural balance is expected to improve from 

a deficit of 
7% of GDP in 2010 to 
just below 5
% of GDP in 2011 and further to 
4¼% of GDP in 
2013. Amidst the still
-high pub
lic deficits and very 
low GDP growth, government debt is set to 

increase from 61% of GDP at the end of 2010 to 

78 of GDP in 2013.

 Domestic growth weakened by global risks and declining 
confidence
  112 Economic recovery graduall
y fading away
 After real GDP expanded by 1.5% in 2010, the 
economy continued accelerating in the first quarter 

of 2011 and grew by a strong 0.9% q
-o-q, still 
supported by exceptional factors such as the car 
scrapping premium or the catch
-up of inventories.
 Growth came to a halt in the second quarter, 
again
 partly reflecting
 temporary factors such as low 
energy consumption due to exceptionally mild 
weather conditions. Without these various 

elements, the decline in growth in the second 
quarter would have been
 less pronounced
. Against 
this backdrop, 
GDP is still expected to increase 
in 
quarter
-on-quarter terms 
in the third quarter, with a 
technical rebound of a mode
st
 0.2%
 (mostly thanks 
to private consumption
), before entering into 
slightly negative territory 
in the last quarter, in line 
with rapidly deteriorating 
confidence
 indicators. 
Th

s into annual growth 
in 2011 
of 1.6%. 
 In 2012, growth is expected to turn marginally 

positive again in the first quarter, in parallel with a 

sta
bilisation of economic sentiment
. However, the 
subdued pace of the recovery 
will only slightly 
strengthen during the second half of the year, 

resulting in annual 2012 
growth of a mere 0.6%. 
 In 2013, annual growth is expected to accelerate to 
1.4%, as conf
idence 
improve
s gradually in line 
with a 
fading of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
. Investment growth is forecast to pick up towards 

the above
-average pace seen in 2011
, as the catch
-up 
following the 2008
-09 crisis has yet
 to 
fully 
materialise. 
 All components o
f domestic demand slowing 
down
 markedly
 The significant downward growth revision 
compared to 
the spring forecast 
stems from the 

deterioration of the external environment, notably 

in the euro area and the US, with negative 
confidence effects weighing on bot
h domestic and 
external demand and affecting consumers and 
companies. This can 
mainly
 be attributed to the 
impact of the sovereign
-debt crisis on financial 
markets, which feeds into economic agents' 

expectations. In particular, the household saving 
rate is
 expected to stabilise at the high levels 
already recorded, and corporate investment is 
forecast to slow down markedly 
in 2012
. 
Moreover, the inventory cycle seems to have now 

come to an end with the very strong contribution 

recorded in the first quarter o
f 2011. France's 
external trade deficit has reached new highs in 
mid
-2011, although this was partly related to more 
resilient domestic demand than in some partner 
countries (as shown by the positive contribution of 

net trade to growth in the second quarter
, when 
domestic demand retreated).

is expected to 
have the strongest impact on investment, in a

the ability of the French banking system to take the 

necessary measures to

 Basel III

  Private c
onsumption: retreating but still

 Household consumption growth is expected to be 
slowed down by 
a lacklustre labour market
, which 
has been the
 principal
 factor 
driving
 the observed 
fall in consumer confidence indexes
 in mid
-2011. The 
esc
alation
 of the sovereign
-debt crisis and the 
corresponding tensions on financial markets
 further depressed sentiment
. In this regard, 
household
 consumption
 will be
 significantly 
shaped
 by the general climate 
of the 
Member States,
 France
   113 crisis. Although wealth effects tend to b
e rather 
limited in France, the very high saving rate already 
reached in the second quarter of 2011 tends to 

suggest a more Ricardian attitude of French 
households
: in spite of their relatively limited 
indebtedness
, households 
might
 now be 
anticipating the
 consequences of fiscal 
consolidation needs in their country and abroad. 
Therefore, the household saving rate is expected to 

stay constant over the forecast period, in spite of 

its 
elevated
 level
. Private consumption is 
nevertheless
 expected to accelerat
e from 0.9% 
in 
2012 to 1.6% 
in 2013, in line with the evolution of 
real disposable income (increasing from 1.1% to 

1.4%). 
 Additional tax measures announced 
in August 
are 
not expected to weigh heavily on private 

consumption, as they 
mostly
 target high 
revenu
e earners
 or large profitable firms, 
which show
 a lower propensity to consume or invest. A recent 
drop
 of inflation expectations 
Œ in line with the 
slowdown expected in this forecast 
Œ is also set to 
exert 
a positive impact on private consumption 
in 
2012-13. Still, 
lower inflation expectations
 are
 projected
 to be 
more than offset
 by the above
-mentioned significant deterioration of households' 
employment expectations, the uncertainties 
associated with the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
, and the 
continued fragility of
 the financial sector.
 Investment and inventories significantly 
affected by uncertainty
 Capacity utilisation rates have generally been 
retreating somewhat from June
 2011 onwards
, suggesting that the causes for 
the investment
 slowdown began to materialise e
ven before the 
summer 
turmoil on financial markets. 
Moreover, 
composite business climate indices are now 
generally below their long
-term averages and 
have 
been 
rapidly deteriorating, casting doubts 
over
 growth 
prospects
 for the coming quarters. A 
decelerat
ion of gross fixed capital formation seems 
therefore unavoidable, although the third quarter of 

2011 is expected to have benefited from the lagged 

impact of rather robust housing starts in the 

preceding quarters. 
Financial
 institutions
 sector, 
still postin
g large profits in the first half of the year 
despite a substantial provisioning 
for
 Greek bonds 
in balance sheets, is under stress as a result of the 

sovereign
-debt crisis
, which is forecast to 
weigh on
 credit supply. Specifically, credit conditions are 

expected to tighten as banks need to strengthen 
their capital positions. However, recent 
announcements by French banks suggest that 
adjustment w
ill focus mostly on 
corporate 
and
 investment banking, export credit, and retail
 activities abroad. 
At the same ti
me, on the demand 
side, depressed business confidence caused by the 

sovereign and financial crisis is expected to 
cause
 some postponement of planned investment 

projects. The above
-mentioned supply constraints 
can therefore be masked for some time by 

depres
sed credit demand.
 As far as inventories are concerned, the
se are now 
found to be

 labour market 
is 
expected to 
adjust mostly through employment. Foreign 

demand will also suffer from the worsening of 

economic prospects in large economies like the 

US, Germany or the Mediterranean neighbours. 

However, the contribution of external trade to
 GDP growth is expected to be almost neutral, 

thanks to the marked slowdown of imports 

associated with weaker domestic demand. Overall, 

after a 
pronounced
 widening in 2011, in line with 
record trade deficits, the current external deficit is 

expected to dec
line somewhat, back to 3.0% of 

GDP in 2013.
 Labour market weigh
s on confidence in spite 
of rising disposable income 
 Due to the rigidities of the French labour market, 
the corporate sector is likely to adjust wage bills 

more through a freeze on hiring than
 through wage 
adjustment. Unemployment is consequently 
expected to increase over the forecast period, 
with
 net job creation not fully absorb
ing
 the increase of 
the active population
. This
 was
 already 
observed
 in 
the second quarter of 2011
, even before the 
slowdown of investment. However,
 the rise in 
labour force participation
 observed in 2011
 corresponds to a transitory supply shock
. This 
shock is underpinned by r
ecent measures, 
including the general pension reform and 
cancellation of exemptions to the job 
search 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   114 obligation, 
which 
boost
 the
 active population
, while t
he working age population is set to 
remain
 stable in 2012 and 2013. This largely explains why 
so far the increase in unemployment 
has hit
 older 
workers
 harder than other groups
. Moreover, the 
ris
e in subsidised employment towards the end of 
2011, in line with announcements made several 

months ago, is expected to cushion headline 

unemployment 
figures
 somewhat in the short run. 
 Overall, employment is still expected to expand. 

Combined with relative
ly steady nominal wage 
growth per head in the private sector (2.4% in 
2012, 2.5% in 2013), this is set to result in 
fairly
 dynamic nominal compensation of employees. 
 Stable inflation prospects
 The previous annual average HICP inflation 
forecast for 2011 r
emains unchanged at 2.2
%, but 
in 2012 it is somewhat lower than expected 
in the 

spring 
(now 
1.5% instead of 1.7%)
, and 
in 2013 
inflation is set to decline to 1.4%. The 

disinflationary impact of lower oil prices and the 
dim macroeconomic environment in 2012
 is set to 
be only partly offset by various measures 
associated with the latest fiscal package. These 

include the increase of excise taxes on tobacco, 

strong alcohols and soft drinks, as well as some 

other corporate taxation measures likely to 
indirectly i
mpact consumer prices. 
In the absence 
of significant hikes of consumption taxes (VAT) or 
administered prices, headline HICP 
inflation 
is 
forecast to stay below levels recorded in 
a number 

of peer countries. Core inflation is set to amount to 
around 1½% in 
2012 and 2013. 
 Risks to the forecast are large
 given the global 
uncertainty
 There are upside as well as downside risks 

associated with the ongoing 
sovereign
-debt crisis
, depending on the tim
ing
 of crisis 
decisions likely 
to impact on confidence. If confid
ence returns, it 
could prove robust and consequently translate into 

healthier growth patterns than those envisaged in 

the current forecast, particularly thanks to a drop in 

the 
household saving rate and a 
bringing forward
 of investment decisions. 
 There is
 also significant uncertainty about the 
extent of the transmission of the financial tensions 

to the real economy. The current scenario only 

assumes some limited credit tightening, with a 

significant but contained impact on investment 
(and private consumpti
on, via confidence and 
consum
er credit). However, a more restrictive 
stance cannot be fully excluded, depending on the 

evolution of the global environment. In this 

adverse scenario, 
a sharper fall 
in investment 
would heavily affect employment prospects, wi
th a 

significant second
-round impact on private 
consumption. Exports would also drop due to the 

deterioration of domestic demand in partner 

countries.  
 Fiscal consolidation: need for 
close vigilance
 In 2011, the public deficit is projected to 
reach
 around
 5¾% of GDP, down from 7.1% of GDP 
last year. This is broadly in line with the latest 

official forecast (5.7% of GDP)
 at time of 
publication
. Expenditure growth is set to remain 
below historical levels, with no increase in central 

government spending in vo
lume 
terms 
and only 
subdued growth in social benefits. While this is 

partly due to the phasing
-out of the remaining 
stimulus 
measures, some consolidation measures
 also contribute to the planned adjustment
: a freeze 
on base wage
s for civil servants, the rep
lacement 
of 
only half of 
retiring civil servants, a tighter 
healthcare spending norm combined with 

improved 
monitoring
, and a nominal freeze on 
transfers to local authorities
. On the revenue side, 
discretionary measures are expected to reduce the 

deficit b
y around 1% of GDP
, mainly consisting of 
a reduction in tax 
expenditure
 together with the 
end of the temporary cost of the local business tax 

reform.
 Concerning 2012, the French authorities 

announced in August 
2011 a new 
fiscal
 package of 
aroun
d ½% of GDP.
 The package mainly consists 
of revenue measures
, while new expenditure cuts 
represent
 less than 0.1% of GDP
. In particular, 
additional revenues would be raised through 
a 
further cut in tax expenditure, 
limiting the 
possibilities 
for
 carrying 
over
 losses i
n the 
calculation of corporate income tax
, and 
a rise in 
excis
e duties on tobacco and alcohol. A
n additional
 temporary
 tax on 
top 
incomes 
is due to
 remain in force until the 3% 
of GDP 
deficit target
 for 2013
 is met. However, 
according to this 
forecast, 
the
 deficit is expected to reach
 about 
5¼% of GDP in 2012, thus remaining well above 
the slightly revised official target of 4.5% of GDP 
(4.6% in the April 2011 update of the Stability 

Programme). The difference mainly stems from

to expected higher so

forecast
 In 2013, under the usual no
-policy
-change 
assumption, the deficit is forecast to improve only 

marginally to around 5% of GDP, mainly due to 

the increasing impact of the pension reform 

(additional estimated impact of 0.2% of GDP). The 
exp
ected outcome thus remains significantly above 
the official target of 3.0% of GDP. This is mainly 
linked to the less benign macroeconomic scenario 
and a significant base effect. In addition, the 
authorities envisage even more subdued 

expenditure growth tha
n in previous years, for 
which corresponding structural measures are 

however not yet specified and which therefore 

cannot be taken into account in this forecast.
 Overall, this implies an improvement in the 

structural balance of approximately 1¾% of GDP 

ove
r the forecast horizon
, mainly concentrated in 
2011 and 2012 (1% and ¾% of GDP respectively)
. The debt ratio is expected to continuously rise over 

the forecast horizon, reach
ing
 92% of GDP in 
2013. 
This
 projection include
s the impact of 
guarantees to the E
FSF, bilateral loans to Greece, 
and the participation in the capital of the ESM as 

planned on the cut
-off date of the forecast
 (together 1% of GDP)
. The State guarantee
 to 
Dexia
 Group and its subsidiary Dexia Crédit Local 
is not
 expected 
to have an
 impact 
on public debt.
 11. ITALY
 Subdued growth ahead
  116 Increasing uncertainty weighs on growth 
prospects
 The modest recovery experienced by Italy after the 
2008-09 crisis is coming to a standstill in the 
second half of 2011 and growth is expecte
d to 
remain subdued over the forecast horizon. 
 Real GDP expanded by 1.
5% in 2010 as a whole, 
but in quarterly terms growth 
already 
eased in the 
second half of the year
. This sluggish pace 
continued in the first quarter of 2011, while in the 

second quarter
 growth picked up somewhat. 
As for 
the euro area as a whole, a 
renew
ed slowdown in 
economic activity is now under way
 in Italy
, amid 
high risk aversion and increasing uncertainty in the 

domestic and international economic environment. 

A particular factor w
eighing on 
the countr
y™s 
growth prospects is the steep increase in spreads 

on Italy™s sovereign bonds vis
-à-vis 
German 
benchmarks (around 350
-400 bps for 
10-year
 bonds
) following the intensification of the euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis during the summer.
 For 
Italian banks this has entailed higher funding costs 

and more difficult access to 
the interbank 
market. 
As a result, credit conditions for the wider 
economy are tightening, as signalled by the 
Bank 
Lending 
Survey
 for the third quarter of 2011 
publishe
d by the Bank of Italy
. The forecast 
assumes that financial markets will gradually 
stabilise in the course of 2012; should financial 

conditions 
deteriorate 
further, the 
growth outlook 
for Italy would worsen
, especially via reduced 
credit availability for c
ompanies and households. 
 Another new factor is an accelerated and large 

fiscal consolidation effort envisaged for 2012
-13 that was adopted in summer 2011 following the 

increase in Italian risk premia. While these 
consolidation measures
 Œ together with th
e ECB 
Securities Markets Programme (SMP) 
Œ have 
contributed to avoiding further increases in interest 
rates, they are set to weaken domestic demand in 

the short term. There may however be some 

limited scope for containing this impact through 

careful design
 of the still
-to-be-specified tax and 
assistance reform. 
 The recovery at a standstill in the second half 
of 2011 Real GDP 
is projected to remain
 flat in the third 
quarter and even 
contract
 slightly in the fourth 
quarter (
-0.2%
 q-o-q); in 2011 as a whole, 
GDP is 
forecast to grow by 0.5%.
 After rebounding in 2010 exports continued to lead 
the recovery in the first half of 2011, with exports 

of goods significantly more dynamic than those of 

services. The deceleration in global demand 
in the 
second half of the
 year is set to weigh on 
Italian 
exports
. Lacklustre domestic demand is dam
ping
 goods 
imports in 2011 
following
 a sizeable 
increase in 2010, while services imports are 

projected to decline further. As a result, net exports 

are set to provide a positive con
tribution to GDP 
growth in 2011.
 The 
support to investment in equipment provided 
by e
xternal demand
 in the first two quarters of 
2011 is weaken
ing
 in the second half of the year. 
Moreover, 
the combination of tighter credit 
conditions and subdued domestic d
emand is set to 

adversely affect firms' investment decisions. As a 
result, investment in equipment is expected to 
grow at a modest pace in 2011 as a whole, while 

investment in construction is projected to decline 

due to the protracted weakness of the prope
rty 
market and significant contraction in government 

capital spending.
 Private consumption 
came close to stagnating
 in 
the first half of 2011. Despite a moderate increase 

in real disposable income, persistently weak labour 

market conditions and inflationar
y pressures are 
expected to continue affecting consumer spending 

decisions in the second half of the year. 
 Net exports driving growth in 2012
-13 Real GDP is expected to grow by 0.1% in 2012 

and 0.7% in 2013. In quarterly terms, real GDP is 

projected to re
main broadly flat in the first half of 

2012 and slightly accelerate to 
0.2
% q-o-q as from 
the last quarter 
of 2012.  
 Export growth i
n 2012 and 2013 is expected to be 
largely determined by
 demand prospects 
in euro
-area partners
: modest in 2012 but improvin
g in 
2013. As the 
share of its exports going to
 Member States, Italy
   117 fast
-growing emerging markets 
remains relatively 
low, Italy is set to continue losing market shares. 
Still, as 
imports are assumed to grow considerably 

less than exports in 2012
-13 on the back of very 
weak 
domestic demand, net exports are forecast to 
make a positive contribution to real GDP growth in 
both years.
 Investment in equipment is set to 
decrease
 in 2012 
due to higher financing costs
, negative profitability 
prospects for firms, still low levels of capa
city 
utilisation in industry and the need for further 
balance
-sheet adjustment, notably within small and 
medium
-sized enterprises. In 2013, it is forecast to 
regain some traction under the assumption of more 

stable financial markets and improved profitabil
ity. 
 Investment in construction is projected to continue 

contracting in 2012 
before
 return
ing
 to modest 
growth in 2013. While investment in residential 

construction
 is expected to pick up somewhat over 
the forecast horizon as housing market conditions 

gra
dually improve, government investment 
spending is set to continue declining as part of the 

budgetary consolidation strategy.
 Private consumption is forecast to remain almost 

flat in 2012
-13 as labour market conditions are not 
expected to improve much and c
onsolidation 
measures are
 set to dampen the increase in real 
disposable income, despite lower inflationary 

pressures. 
 A stagnating labour market 
 After further declining in 2010 because of the 

lagged effects of the 2008
-09 crisis, headcount 
employment gro
wth gradually recovered in the 
first half of 2011
. This was true 
both 
for
 services, 
mainly in low
-skilled activities, and 
manufacturing, mainly in the form of temporary 

contracts. The slowdown in economic activity 

expected as from the second half of 2011 i
s set to 
lead to a marginal decrease of headcount 
employment in 2012, followed by a modest rise in 
2013, on the back of a gradual output recovery. 

Full
-time equivalent employment is forecast to 
follow a similar path as employers are no longer 

expected to h
oard labour through the wage 
supplementation scheme (CIG)
, as 
they did 
during 
the 2008
-09 crisis
.(62)                                                            (62) The CIG allows employees to stop working or reduc
e hours 
worked while keeping their job at reduced pay
. Reflecting the moderate decline in headcount 

employment and a shrinking labour supply in 

response to depressed labour market conditions, 

the unemployment r
ate increased only 
slightly
 since mid
-2008 and peaked at 8.5% in the second 
quarter of 2010. It then declined slightly and 
stabilised at around 8% in mid
-2011. However, 
the 
youth unemployment rate is still more than 6 pps. 
higher than before the crisis, at
 27.6% in August 
2011. Moreover, long
-term unemployment (
63) as a 
share of total unemployment soared by almost 

5 pps. between mid
-2010 and mid
-2011 to around 
53%. Over the forecast period the 
overall 
unemployment rate is set to remain slightly above 
8% on a
ccount of the stagnating labour market.
 The combination of j
ob losses in 2010 
and
 the 
moderate GDP recovery implied a rebound in 

productivity. As both labour market conditions and 

GDP developments are expected to be weak over 

the forecast horizon, producti
vity is forecast to rise 
only mildly in 2011
-13, in line with its subdued 
pre
-crisis trend. 
 Labour market and productivity developments are 

poised to leave little scope for wage increases 

beyond the adjustment to projected HICP inflation 

excluding importe
d energy, as foreseen in the 
reformed wage
-bargaining framework. As a result, 
unit labour costs are expected to increase 

moderately in 2011
-13, broadly in line with
 the 
rest of the euro area. 
 Easing inflationary pressures
 After picking up in 2010 the rate
 of HICP inflation 
continued to rise in the first half of 2011, mainly 

due to sustained energy price increases. In spite of 

persistently weak demand some second
-round 
effects from higher commodity prices were 

observed in the second quarter of 2011, notably
 in 
transport services, leading to a rise also in core 

inflation. Headline inflation is expected to reach 

2.7% in 2011 on average, while core inflation is 
forecast at 
2.0
%. 
 The
 September
 2011 rise in
 the statutory VAT rate 
from 20% to 21%
 is expected to h
ave a
 relatively 
moderate 
impact on the HICP in 2012, also in view 
of 
stagnating domestic demand
. With 
the energy 
component of the HICP forecast to decelerate 

sharply 
to 2.0% 
on the back of declining oil prices 
and favourable base effects, core inflation i
s 
projected to 
be slightly higher than headline

forecast
 As the Italian economy is highly dependent on 

imported energy, the marked rise in import prices 

in 2010 
worsened the terms of trade and 
contributed majorly to the 
significant deterioration 
in the trade balance and thus in th
e external deficit, 
which reached around 3½% of GDP. 
 In 2011 the external deficit is forecast to remain 

broadly 
stable as 
the 
further worsening 
of the 
terms of trade 
is broadly compensated by positive 
developments in net exports in volume terms. Over 

the 
forecast horizon the external deficit is 
projected to decline to 2
¼% of GDP, 
driven by
 the 
balance of goods and services
, which
 is set to 
improve thanks to modest growth in import 

volumes and slightly more favourable terms of 

trade.
 Fiscal consolidation le
ads to a sizeable 
primary surplus
 The general government deficit is projected to 
decline to 4.0% of GDP in 2011, from 4.6% in 

2010. The primary surplus is set to improve more 

significantly (by 1 pp.), to 0.9% of GDP, on the 
back of consolidation measures a
dopted in 2008, 
2010 and 2011. Conversely, interest expenditure is 
projected to rise by 0.4
 pp. of GDP
, driven by the 
higher risk premium on Italy's sovereign debt. 
 In structural terms the 2011 adjustment is just 
below ½ pp. of GDP for the overall balance
 and 
¾ pp. for the primary balance.
 On the revenue side
, direct taxes are set to rise less 
than nominal GDP
 in 2011
, also due to the 
temporary postponement of some personal income 
tax payments to 2012. Indirect taxes are sustained 

by imports and the initia
l effects of the summer 
consolidation packages, namely the rise in excise 

duties on transport fuel introduced in July and the 
1 pp. increase in the statutory VAT rate from 
September. The gradual expiry of 
one
-off taxes
 drives 
the
 decline in capital revenue
s. Overall, 
revenues are expected to remain stable as a share 

of GDP 
in 2011 
relative to 2010
 (45.8
%).  As in 2010, primary expenditure is expected to fall 
in nominal terms
 in 2011
. On the one hand, c
urrent 
primary expenditure is set to increase slightly
 compared with
 2010, essentially due to 
higher 
social transfers, while intermediate consumption is 
projected to remain flat and the public wage bill to 

decrease, as wages are frozen and public 

employment 
decline
s. 
On the other hand, c
apital 
spending is forec
ast to 
fall 
by 
around
 14% on 
2010, also due to the one
-off proceeds of the sale 
of broadband licences, which are recorded as 

negative expenditure 
(of more than 0.2% of GDP
). As a share of GDP, primary expenditure is set to 

drop
 by 1
 pp. relative to 2010 (t
o 44.8

difficult to assess ex ante.
 As a result of the 
safeguard clause and 
the
 revenue
-enhancing 
measures adopted in 2011
 (other than in the 
context of the fight against tax evasion)
, tax 
revenues are set 
to pick up considerably in 

2012-13, with an annual increase of around 
6.5
% and 5% res
pectively. Social contributions are 
projected to rise modestly in both years on account 

of the moderate increase in the wage bill. Capital 

revenues are set to fall again in 2012 due to the 

expiry of one

but
 are expected to 
recover 
somewhat in 20
13. Overall, revenues are set to 

increase by around 1¾ pps.
 of GDP
 over the 
coming 
two 
years (to 47.
4% in 2013).
 On the expenditure side, the enacted cuts to 

ministerial and local spending in 2012
-13 are 
assumed to fall on 
capital 
expenditure and 
intermedi
ate consumption. Compensation of 
employees is projected to continue declining
 as a 
result of the continued restraint of recruitment and 
wages
, while social transfers keep growing slightly 
above nominal GDP in both years. Overall, 

primary expenditure is pro
jected to increase only 
marginally in 2012
-13 relative to 2011. As a share 
of GDP, this implies a cumulative fall of around 
1¾ pps. over the two years (to 43.

 12. CYPRUS
 Subdued growth prospects while fiscal challenges persist
  120 Economic activity s
talled in 2011–
 After a modest recovery in 2010, with GDP 
growth at 1.1%, economic activity expanded by 

1.5% in the first half of 2011. However, despite an 

exceptionally good tourist season, growth 
prospects for the year as a whole have been badly 
affected
 by the accident in July that destroyed the 
Vassilikos electricity producing plant, accounting 

for half of total generating capacity. A worsening 

external environment and tightening financial and 

fiscal conditions compounded the damaging effect. 
As a resul
t, annual economic growth is expected to 
grow only slightl
y, by 0.3%, this year.  
 Domestic demand, 
traditionally 
the main driver of 
growth, is expected to continue 
to 
shrink
 in 2011
 at 
a similar pace 
to the previous
 year. Tightening 
bank 
lending condition
s coupled
 with 
a worsening 
labour 
market 
outlook 
and 
weakening
 confidence 
have been 
weigh
ing
 on private consumption
. Public consumption 
has also put a brake
 on growth. 
In addition, w
eak foreign demand for 
housing and 
a restructuring of corporate balance 
sheets 
have 
kept investment on a correction path
 for a third year in a row.

 On the other hand, 
exports of services have 
enjoyed buoyant growth, driven mainly by an 
exceptionally good y
ear for tourism
. Touris
t arrivals for the first nine months of the year surged 
by 11%, while tourism revenues for the first eight 

months recorded an increase of 16%. This was due 
to political instability in competing Mediterranean 
destinations and an incre
ased flow of arrivals from 
developing markets such as the CIS. Moreover, 

financial 
intermediation 
and business services 
continued 
to 
grow
 solidly
. In line with the 
contraction in domestic demand, import growth 
decelerated
.  The 
downward 
adjustment 
of the 
labour market
 continued in 201
1, with the impact concentrated in 
labour
-intensive sectors such as construction and 
trade. The unemployment rate remained on a rising 
trend, 
reaching an average of 7.3
% in the first two 
quarters of the year,
 up from 
6.2
% in 20
10.  –and recovery is expected to resume only in 
2013, with the labour market lagging behind
 Economic activity is projected to stagnate in 201
2 and to 
recover moderately
 only in 2013. During 
this period, domestic demand is 
set to remain 
weak. The deteriora
tion in financial markets and 
the tightening of credit conditions should sustain 
the cost of 
and limit 
the access of the 
private sector 

to financing
.  Leading indicators point to a weakening of 

consumer and business confidence. This suggests 
that the econo
my will lose further steam
 before 
recovery kicks in during the second half of 2012
, alongside the improvement of the external 
environment
, the start of the tourist season
 and the 
resumption of investment projects as uncertainty 

dissipates. 
In the short 
ter
m, fiscal 
consolidation
 will have an adverse impact on economic activity
 through a
 decline in
 disposable income and public 
spending
. Housing investment is projected to 
remain on a downward adjustment path, although 

to a lesser degree than in previous years
. Overall, 
however, the outlook for investment is promising, 

as it is expected to benefit significantly from 
reconstruction work in the destroyed Vassilikos 
power station and from other public
-private 
partnership infrastructure projects.
 The contribution o
f the external sector 
to 
growth is 
set to remain positive. While slowing global trade 

and 
worsening economic
 prospects in Cyprus' 
main trading partners 
should 
weigh on exports of 
goods
 and services
, this is expected to be partly 
offset by
 the healthy perfo
rmance of business 
services and 
tourism
. Against a backdrop of 
weak 
domestic demand growth, imports are expected to 

expand 
moderately throughout the forecast period
.  Member States, Cyprus
   121 The 
weak
 economic outlook is expected to 
adversely affect t
he Cypriot labour market. 
Full
 employment conditions and large migratory 
inflows seem to belong to the past. Subdued
 economic 
activity should dampen job creation
 while unemployment 
will
 ease 
only towards the 
latter year of the forecast period
. Productivity 
growth is expected to remain 
sluggish
 in line with 
low economic activity and weak employment. 
Wage growth is expected to moderate given 

unfavourable labour market conditions in tandem 

with public sector wages restraint, which is also 

expected to spill over to private sector wages. In 
particular, it has been agreed that there will be no 
cost
-of-living 
adjustment (
COLA
, adjust
ing
 wages 
to inflation over the previous 6 months
) for public 
sector wages for the first half of 2012. In addition, 

the government and 
social partners 
agreed 
to 
ref
orm the COLA by the end of 2011. 
Nevertheless
, unit labour costs may rise by more 
than the average in the euro area until 2012, as 
productivity stagnates in tandem with growth, but 
dec
elerate significantly
 in 2013 with the 
resumption of recovery.
  Risks ap
pear broadly balanced
 Overall, 
risks appear
 to be broadly balanced
. On 
the one hand, risks associated with financial 

markets' reactions to developments in the euro area 

as well as adverse spillovers from Greece, 
particularly in view of the large exposure o
f the 
financial sector, are not negligible. Moreover,
 the 
tightening of 
financial and 
credit conditions 
together
 with 
the already higher financing costs 
and the 
high 
degree of leverage 
of private agents 
could 
delay the rebound in
 consumption
 and 
investment
. On the other hand, successful 
implementation of fiscal consolidation, coupled 
with promising outcomes of the ongoing gas 

exploration, could have significant confidence 

effects. The continuation of turmoil in the Middle 

East and North Africa (MENA) region
 may further 
strengthen Cyprus' status as a regional safe
-haven 
through 
the tourism, trading and shipping channels 
beyond what has already been assumed in this 

forecast.
  Inflationary pressures are 
on the rise
 After inching higher in 2010, almost exclusive
ly 
driven by energy prices, HICP i
nflation is 
projected to rise 
further to 3½% 
in 2011. Higher 
prices of imported oil, on which Cyprus
 is highly 
dependent, an increased energy bill associated with 
higher energy production costs following July™s 

accident an
d the impact of the VAT hike on food 
and pharmaceuticals are among the factors 

expected to exert inflationary pressures. In 2012, 

inflation is 
projected to decline somewhat and to 
return to its long
-term trend only
 in 2013
. Core 
inflation is 
forecast
 to re
main 
contained a
t about 
1.7% throughout the forecast period.
 The current
-account deficit declines 
moderately while remaining large–
 Due to the economic slowdown, the current
-account deficit declined further in 2011. The 
reduction would have been even more 
pronounced 

in the absence of rising oil prices. It is noteworthy 
that this improvement took place in tandem with
 a deterioration of the fiscal position. This suggests 
that 
the private sector continued to unwind 
outstanding debt
. The substantial savings of 
the 
private sector 
were reflected in subdued 
consumption, shrinking investment and, 

consequently, lower growth. 
 However, at an estimated 7
¼% of GDP in 2011, 
the current
-account deficit is still large, especially 
given the 
weak 
economic activity. In the me
dium 
term the deficit is set to 
remain on a correction 

path
, but at a 
moderate rate, reflecting lower GDP 
growth.
 –reversing the deterioration of public finances
 The budget deficit is estimated to have widened to 

6.7% of GDP in 2011 from 5.3% in the previo
us 

year. This is significantly higher than the deficit of 

4% of GDP planned in the May 2011 update of the 
Stability Programme. This deviation is explained 
mainly by lower
-than
-expected revenues (2¼ pp
s. of GDP), despite the rise in VAT on food and 

pharmace
uticals in the beginning of the year, but 
also slightly higher 
expenditure
 (½ pp
.). The 
revenue shortfall was due to
: (i) a slowdown of 
activity;
 (ii) reduced corporate profitability
; and 
(iii) the disruption of economic activity following 

the Vassilikos p
ower plant destruction. 
Composition
al growth effects have also been non
-negligible. At the same time, expenditure slippages 

appear to be related to rising social outlays due to 
higher unemployment and redundancy payments, 
as well as due to the electoral cy
cle and the higher 
cost of financing. 
With a view to reducing the 

budget deficit, the government adopted a fiscal 

consolidation package yielding an estimated 

annual consolidation impact of about ½ pp. of

impor
tant structural measures: the enactment of 
contributions from public sector employees to their 
public pensions and the inclusion of newcomers in 
public sector in the social security fund, with the 
abolition of occupational pensions. 
The structural 
deficit
, measured by the cyclically
-adjusted 
balance net of one
-offs
, rose to 
almost 6
% in 2011 
from 
5¾% of GDP in 2010. 
 For 201
2, the 
draft 
Budget Law
 submitted to the 
Parliament on 13 October targets
 a deficit of 
2.8
% of GDP, on the basis of an estimated defici
t for 
2011 of 
6.5
%. The draft law incorporates a second 
package of consolidation measures yielding an 
estimated consolidation impact of
 about 3
 pps. 
of 
GDP in 2012, of which 2.3
 pps.
 of GDP 
are on the 
expenditure side and mostly permanent 
in 
nature. 
Howeve
r, 
in this latter package the two main 
measures
 proposed by the government 
Œ namely
 the targeting of social transfer and the increase of 
the VAT rate from 15% to 17%, which account for 
almost 2 pp
s. of GDP 
Œ have not been 
adopted
 yet
.  Th
e forecast at hand
 projects 
a deficit of 4.9% of 
GDP for 2012. 
It incorporates a more 
prudent
 assessment of revenue prospects, given a less tax
-rich growth composition, and possible overruns on 
the expenditure side, especially of current primary 
expenditure in view of past 
trends on key items 
such as the wage bill and social transfers. 

Moreover, measures 
that
 are still under discussion 
with an uncertain outcome or with no information 

on the modalities of their implementation, such as 
the two aforementioned measures, are not 
taken 
into account. 
The structural 
balance is expected to 
improve by about 
1¾% of GDP
 in 2012.
 Based on the no
-policy
-change assumption, the 
deficit is set to subside marginally to 4.
7% of GDP 
in 2013, due to savings on the public wage bill 

from the abolit
ion of public sector posts and the 

adopted measure 
of one 
new 
recruit for every four 
retirees in the broader public sector. With weak 

growth and an increasing deficit, the debt
-to-GDP 
ratio should remain on a rising trend and reach 

almost 71
% of GDP by 201
3. Debt projections 

also include the impact of guarantees to the EFSF, 

bilateral loans to Greece, and the participation in 

the capital of the ESM as planned 
by 
the cut
-off 
date of the forecast
. 13. LATVIA
 Growth exceeds expectation
s in 2011 but outlook for 2012 worsens
  123 Corporate profits support investment and GDP 
growth in 2011
 A strong rebound in corporate investment as well 
as sustained increases in private con
sumption and 
exports pushed up Latvia's economic growth to 

5.6% y
-o-y in the second quarter of 2011. 
Investment was mainly financed by corporate 

profits, with bank credit playing a decreasing role. 

On the supply side, manufacturing and tourism 

reported rec
ord rates of expansion of 14.7% and 
25% in the first half of 2011. Both sectors 

benefited from the steep improvement in the 
country's price competitiveness in 2009
-10 when 
unit labour costs (weighted according to trade 
patterns) dropped by around 20%. On t
he other 
hand, financial services and construction, which 

had been on a downward path for several quarters, 

eventually approached a turning point in the 

middle of the year.

forecast
 Despite g
lobal uncertainties, the latest monthly 
indicators suggest that retail sales, industrial 

production and exports grew at a fast pace also in 

the third quarter of 2011. These stronger 

developments support an upward revision of the 

GDP growth forecast to 4.5%
 in 2011 from 3.3% 
expected in spring. However, the expected 

slowdown in major EU economies and the steep 

fall in confidence in the euro area imply a 

significant downward revision of GDP growth to 

2.5% in 2012 from previously projected 4%. 

Despite a relati
vely strong impact on the growth 
outlook, the new shock will not have such 

devastating effects on the economy as in 2008
-09, 
when it compounded the burst of the property 

bubble, the collapse of the construction sector and 
resulting huge financial outflows.
 Moreover, the 
export sector is now expected to take some 
advantages from the softer euro, leading to a 
depreciation of Latvia's nominal effective 

exchange rate, which will partly offset the 

weakening external demand. Overall, the 

Commission's economic sen
timent indicator (ESI) 
for Latvia also paints a broadly positive picture, 
balancing the dynamic internal demand and a 
softening external environment. After a one
-off 
decline in August, the indicator recovered in 

September to a four
-year high of 3.6 pps. ab
ove 
the long
-term average.
 Unemployment drops substantially, helped by 
emigration flows
 The unemployment
 rate
, based on the Eurostat 
definition for the age group of 15
-74, dropped by 
3.2 pps. to 
16.2% 
y-o-y in the second quarter of 
2011. The overall improv
ement was supported by 
net job creation as well as by strong emigration 
flows that lowered the number of job seekers. The 

labour force contracted by 0.7% y
-o-y in the 
second quarter of 2011 and the monthly statistics 

on the international mobility of the po
pulation 
showed that the change was largely driven by an 
increasing rate of emigration. The participation 
rate remained stable, however, as both the labour 

force and the working age population contracted at 

similar rates.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   124 expected to rise only marginally in 2012
 as the 
weakening economic outlook will contain labour 
demand. This is supported by the latest economic 

surveys where employment expectations for 
manufacturing and service sectors stayed positive 
but below the levels at the start of the year, while 
retail 
and construction firms reported negative 
employment expectations.
 Inflation to fluctuate near EU average
 Consumer price inflation expectedly accelerated in 
2011 reflecting higher energy and food prices as 

well as two rounds of consumer tax hikes at the 

beg
inning of 2011 and in the summer. The 
harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) 

surged to an annualised 
4.2% in 
January
-August
 compared to a deflation of 1.1% in 2010. 

However, inflation was mainly affected by taxes, 

food and energy prices, with core infl
ation 
remaining subdued. The constant
-tax estimates of 
the national statistics office show much lower 

inflation of 2.8%, of which around 2 pps. can be 
attributed to changes in prices of energy and 
unprocessed food. As tax and commodity price 

effects will f
ade away in 2012
-13, headline HICP 
inflation is expected to decelerate substantially 

towards the EU average rate. On the demand side, 

prices could face certain upward pressure from 

second
-round effects linked to the steep wage and 
employment growth in the 
first half of 2011 but 
this is likely to be offset by the supply
-side impact 
of the global slowdown.

 Current account moves back to deficit
 The current account moved 
to a small deficit in 

January
-August 2011, following a two
-year period 
of surpluses driven by internal adjustment and 

cyclical effects. In nominal terms, merchandise 
exports and imports rose at similar annual rates of 

about 32% in January
-August. The rever
sal in the 
primary income balance as well as the gradual 

recovery of private consumption and investment is 

set to expand the current
-account deficit further in 
2012-13. Nevertheless, as capital account inflows 
will offset the current
-account gap, the net e
xternal 
lending is projected to remain positive. The 

country's external indebtedness is therefore 

expected to decline further in relation to GDP, 

continuing the positive trend of deleveraging in the 

private sector that brought the country's external 

debt t
o 149% of GDP as of end
-June 2011, down 
from 165% as of end
-2010. The net inflow of FDI marked an eight
-fold 
improvement in annualised terms to LVL 437 

million in January
-August 2011 (3.2% of the 
projected full
-year GDP). The rebound is largely 
driven by t
he reversal in reinvested earnings of 
foreign
-owned companies that moved to a positive 
balance of LVL 84 million from a negative value 
of LVL 226 million a year earlier.
 Outlook for public finances reflects growth 
revival and past consolidation effort
 In l
ine with the revival of economic growth, tax 
revenue continued improving in the first three 
quarters of 2011. Income taxes in particular 

performed above expectations, while the 
improvement in the labour market led to lower 
unemployment costs. Together with
 restrained 
expenditure growth, this points to a notable 

improvement in the outlook for public finances in 

2011. At the same time, as plans for restructuring 

of a state
-owned bank are being implemented, a 
negative risk factor for public finances identified
 in the spring forecast is expected to materialise. 

Moreover, the 
government has also decided
 to 
provide stop
-gap financing to the national airline 
company, which has incurred significant losses 

over the past two years. The estimated impact of 
these
 decisi
ons is ¾% of GDP in 2011. Overall, 
these
 offsetting 
items 
lead
 to only a modest deficit 
improvement in 2011 compared to the spring 
forecast, with the general government deficit now 

expected at 4.2% of GDP, significantly down from 

8.3% of GDP recorded in 20
10, which was 
negatively affected by a number of one
-off factors. 
The structural balance is set to improve in 2011 
less than the change in the headline deficit, by a 

still impressive 1½% of GDP.

     125 Due to early elections that took place in mid
-September, the 
annual budgetary process has been 
delayed, 
with the draft budget law for 2012 
expected by early December
. The current forecast 
therefore does not include measures which the 

government intends to adopt to fulfil its aim of a 
deficit of 2.5% of GDP in 2012. 
A number of 
earlier decisions with effect in 2012 are 

nevertheless already included in the forecast, 

notably the suspension of the pension indexation 

until end
-2013, as well as the full
-year impact of 
some tax increases that took place in mid
-2011. 
The for
ecast for 2012 includes some estimated 
further costs of restructuring of the national airline. 

Overall, not considering the forthcoming measures 

of the 2012 budget, the general government deficit 

is expected to decline to 3.3% of GDP in 2012 as 

revenue is 
projected to grow faster than 

expenditure, while the structural deficit remains 

broadly stable. Although the exact composition of 

measures to support the consolidation is not yet 
known, the new government has restated publicly 
its commitment to meeting the
 deficit target of 
2.5% of GDP in 2012 set under the Balance of 

Payment assistance programme. 
 Albeit exceptional restructuring costs are assumed 
to be considerably lower in 2012 than in 2011, 
such measures remain a risk factor to the fiscal 
outlook. Furth
er downside risks for 2012 are 
related to uncertainties concerning the economic 

outlook discussed above and their impact on 

revenue. In 2013 the nominal general government 

deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged as 
the planned increase in state co
ntributions to the 
mandatory funded pension scheme, with a negative 

impact of 1.0% of GDP, offsets an improvement in 
tax revenue due to improving macroeconomic 

conditions.
 In June 2011, Latvia returned successfully to the 

international financial market by 
issuing a USD 

500 million Eurobond. Further borrowing from 
international financial markets is expected in both 
2012 and 2013, including with the aim to pre
-fund 
the repayment of loans under the international 

financial programme 
Œ these repayments will star
t in 2012 and peak in 2014
-15. As a result, the gross 
general government debt is expected to continue 

increasing over the 
forecast horizon, reaching 
47.1
% of GDP by end
-2013, t
hough
 rapidly fall
ing
 thereafter as large repayments 
are
 made.
  14. LITHUANIA
 Strong recovery to dampen in line with global trends
  126 Strong economic growth in 2011 as domestic 
demand picks up
 With private domestic demand gradually taking 
over
 as the main engine of growth, Lithuania's 
economy has quickly recovered from a deep 

recession. Following a contraction of nearly 15% 
in 2009, output expanded by 1½% in 2010 and 
further by a robust 6½% in the first half of 2011. A 

determined and sustained 
implementation of broad 

policy reforms has been vital in harnessing 

Lithuania's growth potential 
to complete its return 
to strong
 and balanced growth.
 The recovery was initially driven by strong 

external demand as exports expanded across 

sectors. Improved 
competitiveness underpinned by 

strong wage discipline supported the vigorous 

export performance. However, imports expanded 

somewhat more strongly than exports as the 
recovery gathered momentum. As a consequence, 
the trade deficit has further widened and th
e contribution of net exports is expected to turn 

slightly negative in 2011.
 The current
-account 
balance turned negative in the first half of 2011 

mainly due to
 a higher
 merchandise trade deficit
, a higher
 income 
account deficit 
and 
a lower current 
transfe
rs surplus

forecast
 Domestic demand has taken over as the main 

driver of economic growth since investment and 

private consumption growth started to resume in 
the second half of 2010. Fin
ancial market 
conditions have gradually
 improv
ed while
 lending 
activity
 and saving rates have declined. Private 
investment has been strong, especially in 
equipment and non
-residential construction while 
public investment was concentrated on energy and 
educ
ation.  
 Private consumption has picked up due to a 
remarkable rebound in employment in the second 

quarter of 2011 and moderate wage increases.  

Unemployment decreased markedly in the second 

quarter of 2011 to 15.6%, down from 17.2% in the 
first quarter. W
ages have followed an upward 
trend since the second quarter of 2010, but 
increases have been limited due to the public 

sector wage freeze. However, previous post
-crisis 
social benefit reductions have been extended and 

indirect tax increases maintained, thu
s continuing 
to limit private demand.

 Inflation rose in the first three quarters of 2011 and 

is set to reach around 4.0% on average for the 

entire year, while h
eadline inflation quickly 
increased on the back of higher energy and food 

prices as well as lagged effects of excise duties 
hikes in the previous year. After turning negative 
in the first half of 2010, core inflation has 

accelerated noticeably from 0.3% in
 Q3-2010 to 
nearly 3.0% in Q3
-2011 as domestic demand 
growth gathered momentum.  
 Looming slowdown due to worsening 
prospects for the global economy
 Lithuania's GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 is set to 
slow markedly. 
Not only has 
the
 global economic 
outlook w
orsened, 
but
 persistent volatility and 
tensions in world financial markets are expected to 
lead to more d
ownbeat business and consumer 
sentiment
.  Member States, Lithuania
   127 Private investment is expected to slow on the back 
of a less favourable business outlook
 and likely 
tighter c
redit conditions. However, continued 
frontloading of EU co
-financed projects
 is to 
support public investment.  A recovering labour 

market is set to increase private consumption. Skill 
mismatches have emerged in some sectors, putting 
upward pressure on wage
s. The planned reversal of 
previous pension cuts from 1
 January 2012 will 
also add to consumption dynamics. However, 

overall unemployment remains high and structural 

unemployment has increased. Moreover, as 

consumers, non
-financial corporations and the 
pub
lic sector continue to restore their balance 
sheets in the light of increased uncertainty, 

domestic demand will be more subdued than 

previously expected. 
 The current
-account deficit is projected to widen 
slightly in 2012 and further in 2013. The goods 
tra
de deficit is expected to increase over the 
forecast horizon as external demand weakens at a 

faster pace than domestic demand. As growth 

prospects of Lithuania's main export partners, 

namely Germany, Russia, the other Baltic States 

and Poland have been rev
ised downwards, export 
growth is expected to weaken.

 Inflation is likely to decelerate in 2012, driven by 

lower global commodity prices. The 2012 increase 

of excise duties on tobacco w
ill temporary add to 
inflation. Core inflation is projected to remain at 
elevated levels.
 The balance of risks to the baseline scenario 
appears tilted to the downside. An increase in 

global risk aversion and a worsening business 

outlook might trigger stron
ger
-than
-projected 
capital outflows. Moreover, the deleveraging 

process in the economy might prove to be more 
protracted. A negative feedback loop between the 

real and financial sector might emerge, further 
weakening output dynamics. Upcoming 
parliamentary
 elections in October 2012 could 
result in a lack of commitment to continue fiscal 
consolidation, which could weaken market 
confidence in Lithuania's adjustment path. 
 Fiscal outlook improves on the back of higher 
growth
, but challenges remain 
 Given stron
g economic growth in the first half of 
2011 and continuing fiscal consolidation efforts 
undertaken by the government, recent budgetary 

outcomes were better than expected. In 2010 
Lithuania's general government deficit reached 
7.0% of GDP, outperforming its
 target of 8.1%. 
The government is also expected to be able to meet 

the 5.3% of GDP general government deficit target 

set for 2011 in the latest update of the convergence 

programme. The adjustment strategy has primarily 

relied on a nominal expenditure free
ze, 

underpinned by the extension of temporary 
consolidation measures implemented during the 
crisis and the control of other expenditure. After 

the first three quarters of 2011 expenditure is 

considerably below target, while tax revenues are 

largely in line
 with the 2011 budget. Tax revenues 
are around 17% higher compared to the same 

period of the previous year on the back of reviving 
domestic demand and partly to government efforts 
to improve tax compliance. On the other hand, 

despite higher debt
-servicing 
costs, expenditure 
remained slightly below their 2010 level as the 

public sector wage bill, spending on goods and 

services as well as social benefits further 
decreased.  
 For 2012, the forecast includes the measures 
adopted by the government in the draft 2
012 
budget. The 2012 draft budget targets a deficit of 

2.8% of GDP, in line with the excessive deficit 
procedure. It assumes that tax changes are limited 
to the increases in excise duties on tobacco 

according to EU legislation. Other additional 

revenue is 
to come from non
-tax revenue such as 
higher dividends from state
-owned enterprises due 
to their higher profitability and increased 
efficiency (0.4% of GDP). Moreover, one
-off 
measures, in particular the sales of the so
-called 
"Kyoto units" (0.3%) and land 
sales also add to 
revenue. Following the implementation of the tax 

compliance strategy, the government is also 

expecting better tax compliance and collection in 

2012; however, no additional revenue from this

Furthermore, the budget includes across

cuts of 2% in appropriations to line ministries, 

yielding around 0

measure which is to be reversed is the reduction in 
pension benefits. Their restoration back to

2012 deficit.  Some of the temporary measures 

adopted during the crisis concerning

wages. Furthermore, other previously contained 

expenditure is likely to increase. On the basis of 
the standard no

  15. LUXEMBOURG
 Uncertain times ahead for a large financial centre
  129 An unfavourable international environment 
weighs on growth
 Strong domestic demand boosted the Luxembourg 
economy in 2010. 
GDP 
growth of 
2.7%
 was higher 
than in most other Member States, but remained 

far below the 4.7% recorded on average b
etween 
2000 and 2007.
 A large increase in government 
expenditure and changes in inventories were the 

main drivers of growth, while the external balance 

of goods and services contributed negatively. 

Exports of services (mainly financial services) are 

tradit
ionally the main drivers of growth in 
Luxembourg, but these did not return 
to their 
dynamic pre
-crisis growth
 path. Exports of 
services grew by 10% in value, but only by 1.3% 
in volume. 
Provisional figures for the first two 
quarters of 2011 show only subdu
ed growth, with 
the quarter
-on-quarter
 increase in GDP estimated 
at 
about 
0.25
% in both Q1 and Q2.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)
forecast
 The financial sector has been the country's main 

growth engine in recent decade
s and now 

represents almost 30% of total value added. The 

nature of its activities and the international 

character of its ownership make it particularly 

sensitive to developments abroad. The continuing 
uncertainty on financial markets is affecting 
exports 
of financial services in 2011. Therefore, a 
contraction of exports of services cannot be 

discarded, also in view of the poor stock market 

performance of summer 2011. Activity indicators 

and consumer confidence are also on a sharp 

downward path. This sugges
ts a contraction of the 
economy in the third and fourth quarter of 2011. 

GDP is expected to grow by an average 1.6% in 

2011. The unfavourable international environment 

should weigh further on the economy in the first 

half of 2012. As a consequence, growth 
expectations are moderate. GDP growth is 
projected at around 1% in 2012, with mainly 

private and government consumption contributing 

positively. From the second half of 2012 on, the 

international environment is expected to become 

more supportive again. In 
2013, GDP growth will 
accelerate and is expected to reach some 2.3%. 
This is still below potential and well below the 

average rates recorded in the past, as no further 

expansion of the financial sector is expected. The 

main contributions in 2013 will come 
again from 

consumption and a revival of private investment, 

while the external balance will only contribute 
marginally.
  Inflation will start to decline
 Inflation has been stable at 3.3% y
-o-y in 
September 2011 (HICP). Earlier changes in 
administered price
s (water and health care) 

continue to have an upward effect on the index, 
while energy prices remain high compared to a 
year earlier. As was the case in the past, inflation is 

higher in Luxembourg than in France and 

Germany, but similar to the figure in Be
lgium. For 
2012 a decline to 2.1% is foreseen as the effect of 

rising energy prices observed at the beginning of 
2011 fades out.
 Strong employment growth, but insufficient to 
reduce unemployment
 Employment growth has been accelerating since 
the end of 2009
 and has continued its dynamic 
path in the first half of 2011.
 For the whole of 
2011, employment is projected to increase by 
2.9%. Non
-resident employment rises faster than 
national employment,
 as has been the case in the 
years preceding the crisis.
 Unempl
oyment had increased from around 4% in 
September 2007 to almost 5.5% in winter 
2009, 
which is nevertheless still quite low in comparison 
with the rest of the EU. Between March 2009 and 

July 2010 it decreased steadily, before stabilising 

at around 4.5%. How
ever, this decrease seems to 
be associated with a decline in the activity rate, 

pointing to a discouragement to seek a job. In 

recent months unemployment started to rise again

     130 despite the strong job creation. With a gloomier 
economic outlook for 2012, unem
ployment is 
projected to rise further to 4.8%. In 2013 (national) 

employment will increase again sufficiently to 
bring down the unemployment rate, although only 
marginally.
 The automatic indexation of wages (2.5%), which 

was due in spring 2011, was postpon
ed to 
1 October 2011. The next automatic indexation is 
expected for spring 2012, unless an agreement 

with social partners is reached on a new 

postponement. Without such a postponement, 
wages are expected to grow by 4.5% on average in 
2012. This will strong
ly push up unit labour costs, 
accelerating to a 5.3% increase in 2012. The lower 

inflation rates foreseen for 2012 and 2013 will 

somewhat slow the impact of the automatic 

indexation mechanism, so that wage growth will 

decelerate to 3.3% in 2013. Unit labou
r costs will 
increase by about the same rate in 2013.
 The budget deficit increases in 2012 but 
remains low
 According to recently released revised public 
finance data, the general government deficit in 

2010 was only 1.1% of GDP instead of 1.7%, 

mainly thank
s to upward revisions of revenue. In 
2011, revenues were particularly buoyant over the 
first half of the year, with a large increase in 
income taxes paid by households and corporations 

and a boost in VAT receipts from e
-commerce. A 
relapse is expected in t
he second half, as some 
positive factors are only temporary (like a catch
-up 
in the backlog of corporate tax collection and 

delays in VAT
-reimbursement) or heavily 
dependent on the economic climate. The budget 

balance in 2011 is expected to show a deficit 
of 

around 0.6% of GDP. With a gloomier economic 

outlook, the deficit is expected to deteriorate to 

around 1% of GDP in 2012, which is still one of 

the lowest in the EU. In 2013, under a no
-policy
-change assumption, the budget balance will 
slightly improve 
to a deficit of around 0.9%. The 
structural budget balance is expected to continue 
its deterioration over the forecast horizon, from a 

surplus of 0.5% in 2011 to a 
structural 
deficit of 
0.2% in 2013.
 Luxembourg gross debt will surpass the 20% of 

GDP level 
in 2012, after which it will stabilise. 
Debt projections also include the 
participation of 
the Luxembourg State in Dexia
-BIL and the 
impact of guarantees to the EFSF, bil
ateral loans to 
Greece
, and the participation in the capital of the 

ESM as planned on 
the cut
-off date of the forecast
. 16. HUNGARY
 Bumpy ride ahead
  131 Net exports again pull growth into positive 
territory
 The Hungarian economy entered 2011 amid
st a 
number of indicators pointing towards accelerating 
growth, supported by a slow rebalancing in the 

economy and a positive contribution from 
domestic demand. Developments over the course 
of the year have led to a significant revision of this 

picture.
 Th
e gloomier outlook stems from the deterioration 
of the external environment which played out 
through several channels, as well as an acute 
domestic perception of squeezed demand and 

policy uncertainties. The slowdown of global (and 

German) growth as well a
s the sovereign
-debt 
crisis have implied a decline in external demand: 

the export sector showed a stellar performance in 

the first quarter (4.8% quarter
-on-quarter), but 
unfavourable external developments prevented this 

pace of expansion from being sustain
ed. 
Banks 
have
 also
 been facing higher funding costs and 
tighter liquidity, squeezing credit for the economy 

further.
 Finally, inst
alm
ent payments on foreign 
currency
Œdenominated (FX) loans surged as the 
forint depreciated, depressing consumption: 

around 6
5% of household loans from banks are 
denominated in FX, overwhelmingly in Swiss 

franc. 
 Domestically, uncertainties about further austerity 

measures to come (new measures were announced 
in September) have directly affected consumption 
expenditure and enter
prises, and weighed on 
investment beyond an already sluggish demand 

and extraordinary sectoral taxes. C
ontrary to 
earlier official expectation
s, the large overall 
personal income tax cut 
appears
 not
 to have
 succeeded in lifting domestic demand
, although it
 has cushioned the impact of negative 

developments
. On the other hand, t
he payout of the 
real yield achieved on private pension fund 

investments repatriated into the state pension pillar
 was larger than estimated in the spring due to the 

favourable timing 
of the stock market, which may 
have delivered some boost to consumption 
(assuming a degree of myopic behaviour).
 Overall, domestic demand will once again 

contribute negatively to growth in 2011, from an 

already weak base. According to preliminary 
annual da
ta from the national accounts, the 
contraction of domestic demand in 2010 was more 

pronounced than previously thought: excluding 

inventories, it fell by 3.7% as opposed to 2.8% in 

previous notifications. The difference is largely 

attributable to a much ste
eper decline in gross 
fixed capital formation, although private and 
public consumption expenditure were also revised 
downwards. GDP is projected to grow by 1.4% in 

2011, marginally higher than the revised figure of 

1.3% growth in 2010. 
 Clouds on the horiz
on In 2012 export capacity will increase as new plants 

are set to start production (Mercedes and 

Hankook). But uncertainty surrounding global 

economic activity will be an important factor in 
determining 
growth
 in the small, open Hungarian 
economy, although
 its impact in either direction is 
mediated by the high import content of exports.
 Fiscal policy is 
also 
weighing 
on growth
 prospects
. The additional fiscal measures planned in the 

context of the 2012 budget update 
(much of which 
is correcting a substantia
l fiscal loosening in 2010 
and 2011) 
will further subdue 
economic activity
 through a variety of channels, including a broadly 

budget neutral tax reshuffle 
that again increases
 the burden on the poorest households, 
which also 
have 
the greatest propensity to
 consume.
 This 
comes on top of the significant cuts in social 

transfers, some of which (e.g. the reduction of 

unemployment benefits to at most three months) 

are already operational and others will come into 

effect in 2012.
 The law adopted in
 a surprise mov
e in 
September
 2011 allowing 
the early repayment of FX 
mortgages
 at a discount to the prevailing exchange 
rates
 appears to intend to
 reduce th
e drag on 
household consumption. 
However, t
he households 
that are most likely to be able to participate in the 

sch
eme are the ones that have been relatively 
better able to weather the hike in FX loan 

repayments
. Those who will be putting their 
savings towards repayment may then focus on 

rebuilding precautionary savings in the shorter 

term, even though their net asset 
position will not 

change dramatically. Households with longer than 
average FX loan maturities could face higher 
instalment payments for the duration of the new 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   132 loans, since their maturity may need to be shorter 
in order to make the switch financially attra
ctive. 
The 
full 
magnitude of the effect 
of the scheme 
will 
depend on 
the eventual 
participation 
rate, but its 
net impact on consumption among participants is 

ambiguous at best.
 Furthermore, households in the greatest 

predicament are the where jobs have bee
n lost or 

are at risk. The measure will have a negative 

impact on their consumption through: (i) further 

increasing the loan repayment burden in the case 

of households ineligible to participate in the 
scheme thanks to the depreciation of the forint; 
(ii)
 tightening credit to enterprises due to the 
resulting losses for the banking sector and hence 

endangering employment and, more generally, the 

investment climate. 
 Expanding labour supply
 In a positive development, labour supply has been 

expanding (which con
tributes to the 

unemployment rate projections). Increasing the 

very low activity rate has been one of Hungary's 
key structural bottlenecks to growth, and a series 
of policy decisions are now bearing fruit. 

Translating this into job creation, however, 

remai
ns a challenge especially in the shorter term. 
The main source of new employment is set to 

remain the public works scheme. However, public 
works have so far not contributed to increasing 
participants' chances of finding subsequent 

employment in the private
 market.
(64)  The drastic 
cut in the duration of unemployment benefits 

further exacerbates the difficulties of finding 

another job in the available time frame before 
public works (which pay below the minimum 
wage) would become the main income source.
 The pl
an to increase the minimum wage by 18% 
will further hit labour demand exactly in the 
segment where employment challenges are the 
most acute. This may also pose a serious threat to 

the viability of many small businesses that are 

already struggling and are f
acing serious liquidity 
constraints. The government intends to compensate 

the affected enterprises but the form this may take 

is unclear at the time of publication, and may not 
arrive in time to tide over the hardest
-hit SMEs.

. Turnaround from structural fiscal deterioration 
in 2011 to consolidation in 2012
 Following a 
deficit 
of 4.2% of GDP
 in 2010, the 
general government bal
ance is expected to turn to 
surplus thanks to one
-off revenues linked to the 
elimination of the obligatory private pension 
Member States, Hungary
   133 scheme.
 The
 official estimate for this year's 
surplus 
has been revised up 
from 2% of GDP 
(contained in the April 2011 Convergence 
Pro
gramme update (CP)) to 3.9% of GDP
 in the 
autumn notification. The larger surplus is mainly 

due to: (i) higher one
-off revenue stemming from 
the elimination of the obligatory private pension 

scheme (now amounting to 9¾% of 
GDP, i.e. ½% 

of GDP higher than p
reviously assumed); (ii
) an 
intention not to assume the debt of the public 

transport 
companies (1.4% of GDP) and not to buy 
out selected PPP projects (0.7% of GDP)
, contrary 
to earlier plans; and (iii) additional measures of 
0.4% of GDP
 adopted in Septembe
r 2011.
(65) These factors are only partly counterbalanced by 
one
-off 
expenditure 
of around 0.9% of GDP
 triggered by 
a decision 
of the European Court of 
Justice 
against Hungary 
on the rules of carrying 
forward 
excess VAT
 for enterprises
. The forecast 
shows a
 somewhat lower 
surplus projection (3.
6% of GDP)
, notably since it assumes a partial 
assumption of the debt of public transport 

companies (0.2% of GDP) based on recent 

information
. Regarding 2012, the draft budget submitted to 

Parliament on 30 September 
targets a
 deficit of 
2.5% of GDP 
as 
set in the latest CP. In order to 
achieve t
his
, the budget proposal contains several 
measures altogether amounting to a gross effect of 

more than
 4% of GDP
 to reduce the underlying 
deficit of around 6% of GDP in 2011 and t
o compensate the 
earlier enacted 
personal income 

tax
 (PIT) 
cut of close to 1% of GDP. First, in 
compliance with the CP and the announcement of 

the Sz
éll Kálmá
n Plan in March 2011, the draft 
budget reflects structural
 measures in several areas 
(such as labo
ur market, pharmaceutical subsidies 
and retirement schemes). However, the expected 

gross saving of around
 1½% of GDP is 
0.3% of 
GDP 
lower
 than the original plans. 
Second
, additional 
measures 
already announced
 in the CP 
of around 1
¼% of GDP
 are also include
d, 
such as 
the nominal wage freeze and the limited increase 
of purchase of goods and services in the public 
sector as well as the cut of the employment tax 

credit. 
Third
, the budget contains additional 
revenue increasing measures of 
around
 2% of GDP 
(inclu
ding 
a hike 
in indirect tax rates
, the increase 
of the social security contribution 
rate 
and the full 
elimination of the employment tax credit
) and 
                                                           (65) The 
permanent 
wide
-ranging cu
ts in budgetary 
appropriations 
with a gross deficit
-improving impact 
of 
more than ¾% of GDP
 to counterbalance budgetary 
slippages
 was already incorporated in the latest CP.
 further saving measures of 
½% of GDP. F
our
th, 
the deficit
-decreasing measures are partly 
counterbalanced by 
deficit
-increasing 
decisions
 of 
around 
1% of GDP, such as the expansion of the 
public work
s programme, the tightening of 
the tax 
base of the PIT as well as the supplementary wage 
both
 in the public and the private sector
. Finally, in 
order to counterbalanc
e the negative budgetary 
effect of unforeseen adverse developments, the 

government, based on the revenue
-increasing 
steps, created a substantial reserve of 0.7% of 

GDP.
 In contrast to the deficit target set by the 

government, t
he Commission project
s the 20
12 
general government deficit to 
reach
 2.8
% of GDP. 
Compared to the draft budget this higher deficit 

forecast
 reflects on the revenue side
: (i) 
lower 
economic growth by 1 pp.
 as well as a more 
cautious assessment of revenue developments 

resulting in 
a high
er deficit of 
around 
½% of GDP
; and on the expenditure side
: (ii) higher outlays of 
¼% of GDP related to state
-owned transport 
enterprises
(66) and maintenance of roads
; as well as 
(iii) 
higher interest expenditure 
and higher 
contribution to the EU budget (a
ltogether ¼% of 
GDP) 
due to exchange rate and yield assumptions. 
At the same time, these revenue shortfalls and 

expenditure slippages amounting altogether to 1% 

of GDP are assumed to be largely counterbalanced 

by the extraordinary reserves of 0.7% of GDP 

taking into account a recent proposal to amend the 
budget bill so that a cautious use of this reserve is 
ensured.
(67)      Compared to the spring forecast of a deficit of 
3.3% of GDP in 2012, the improvement of the 
budgetary forecast is explained by the rece
ntly 
announced consolidation measures
, which more 
than 
offset
 the worse macroeconomic forecast.
 In 2013, the budget
 deficit 
is 
forecast
 to deteriorate
 again
, since the phasing out of the extraordinary 
levies on selected sectors (including the financial 

one
) is not expected to be counterbalanced by the
 structural reform programme reaching its peak
.                                                            (66) At the calculation of the additional fina
ncing need of the 
public transport companies, the partial assumption of the 
debt of these companies has already been taken into 
account.   
 (67) According to an amending proposal submitted to the 
Budget Bill by the Audit and Budget Committee of 
Parliament, 
the extraordinary reserves cannot be used 
before September 20, 2012 and stipulates that the

     134 This is based on the usual no
-policy
-change 
assumption and does not take into account 
potential measures that the government may take 

to achieve its deficit targe
t of 2.2% of GDP. In 
particular, the decisions aiming at savings in local 

government and the public transport sector, as 
outlined in the CP,
 are not appropriately specified 
and planned revenue from the introduction of the 
electronic road toll is not backed
 by measures.
  There are positive and negative risks around the 

scenario presented
 here
. On the one hand,
 expenditure of the line ministries may be higher 
than budgeted
 if some of the detailed measures 
underpinning the savings are not fully 
implemented
. Mo
reover, 
a further deterioration of 
the macroeconomic environment
 compared to 
what is already projected
 may result in 
additional
 revenue shortfalls. On the other hand, mainly in 

2013, the 
full
 implementation of structural reform 
plans as set out in the CP
 could
 generate 
significant saving
s compared to the current 
forecast.
 Following a structural deterioration of 1½% in 

2010 and 1¼% in 2011, 
the structural balance is 

expected to improve by 2
½% in 2012
, in large part 
due to the measures described above
. In 201
3, 
a structural deterioration of ½
% of GDP 
is expected.

  17. MALTA
 Global uncertainty hits domestic demand
  135 After a relatively mild contraction in 2009, real 
GDP in Malta grew by 2.7% in 2010 on the back 

of a strong rebound in external demand as well as, 

to a smaller extent, an upturn in business 
investment. While the economy continued to grow 
at a re
latively healthy pace in the first half of 2011, 

weak industrial production data and business 

confidence indicators point to a slowdown in the 

second half. In 2012, growth is expected to remain 

subdued before the economy starts gaining speed 
again in 2013.

forecast
 Loss of momentum after strong rebound in 2010 
 In the first half of 2011 economic growth 
continued to be driven by net exports as export 

growth outpaced the expansion in imports.
 External demand is expected to remain the main 
source of growth for 2011 as a whole. By contrast, 
domestic demand is set to contribute only 

marginally to economic growth in 2011. After 

contracting in 2010, private consumption is 

projected to grow in 2011,
 supported by positive 
labour market developments. 
 Gross fixed capital formation contracted in the first 

six months of 2011 given weak activity in the 

private sector. It is expected to remain strongly 

negative for the remainder of the year on account 

of d
eclining capacity utilisation levels, global 
economic uncertainty and increased financing 

costs, as well as the base effect from a surge in 

transport investment in the second half of 2010.
 Overall, Malta's real GDP is forecast to grow by 

2.1% in 2011.
 Dome
stic demand improves gradually in 
2012-13, but remains subdued
 The weakening of economic activity is set to 

continue into 2012, bringing real GDP growth 

down to 1.3%, before picking up to 2.0% in 2013.
 Private consumption is projected to moderate in 

2012, 
but remain positive supported by relatively 
strong wage growth. In 2013, it is forecast to 

accelerate, also boosted by more robust job 

creation.
 Investment activity in the private sector is 

expected to remain subdued in 2012 on tight 

lending conditions by 
banks and a weak global 

outlook. As a result, the contribution from gross 

fixed capital formation to real GDP growth is set 

to be only marginal. While the improving global 

economic outlook in 2013 will impact positively 
on business confidence, investment a
ctivity is 
forecast to remain relatively moderate as excess 
supply and overpriced assets are expected to keep 

housing investment at low levels.
 Net exports are projected to continue to add to real 
GDP growth in 2012
-13, but less significantly so 
than in pr
evious years. Subdued domestic demand, 
which is highly import
-intensive, is forecast to 
weigh on import growth in 2012 and
 Œ to a lesser 
extent
 Œ in 2013. Notwithstanding the slowdown in 
activity in the euro area, the expansion in exports 
is projected to c
ontinue to outpace import growth, 
based on improving terms of trade, a relatively 
high share of trade with emerging markets and 

further market share gains for services exports.
 The projected dynamics in net exports 
drive an 

improvement in the trade balance
 and, in spite of 
growing net outflows on the income account, also 

in the current account deficit, 
from over 7
% of 
GDP on average in 
2005-09 to around 
2.7
% of 
GDP in 2012
-13. Further gains in female participation and 
employment
 After reaching 2.0% in 2010,
 employment growth 
is set to moderate over the forecast horizon, in line 
with the deceleration in economic growth. A 

sizeable share of the expansion in headcount 
employment is expected to be accounted for by 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   136 women, also thanks to targeted policy action to 
attract them to the labour market. As a large share 

of the new jobs is likely to be part
-time, average 
working hours are expected to decline over the 
forecast horizon.
 While the increasing integration of women into the 
labour market entails further sizeabl
e gains in the 
labour force over the forecast horizon, the 

projected pace of job creation is sufficiently strong 

to absorb them and produce a slight decrease in the 

unemployment rate. 
 After 
subdued developments
 in 2010, growth in 
compensation per employee
 is projected to 
rebound in 2011. 
Based on
 the cost
-of-living
-adjustment mechanism (COLA) a
nd technical 
assumption
s for public sector wages, compensation 
per head
 is 
forecast
 to speed up in 2012
-13. 
 Headline inflation moderates
 while core 
inflation rises
 HICP inflation is forecast to average 2.6% in 2011, 
up from 2.0% in 2010, mainly on the back of the 

foods and non
-energy industrial goods 
components.
 Energy inflation is set to decelerate 
significantly, owing in part to a drop in oil prices 

in the second h
alf of the year and a high base 

effect due to a hike in electricity tariffs in 2010 

(coupled with the government™s decision to keep 

them constant in 2011). Core inflation is projected 

to pick up to 1.8% from 1.0% in 2010.
 HICP inflation is forecast to dece
lerate to an 
average of 2.2% in 2012
-13 due to an expected 
moderation in oil and commodity prices on 

international markets. Nevertheless, energy 

inflation is projected to remain relatively high in 

2012 as the decline in oil prices is offset by higher 
elect
ricity rates. The biggest contribution to HICP 
inflation in 2012
-13 is forecast to come from 
services, where prices are expected to accelerate 
over the forecast horizon, supported by robust 

wage growth. Core inflation is projected to slow 
down to 1.5% in 2
012, due to moderation in the 
non
-energy industrial goods component, before it 
accelerates back to 1.8% in 2013.
 Risk
s tilted to the downside
 Risks to this forecast appear to be tilted to the 

downside. The forecast assumes that financial 

markets will gradu
ally stabilise in the course of 
2012; should financial conditions deteriorate 
further, this could put additional upward pressure 

on interest rates and further tighten access to 

credit. Given the high share of loans with floating 

interest rates, higher rate
s could further increase 
credit risk, which already stands relatively high 
with a non
-performing loan ratio of 7.3% for the 
domestically
-oriented banks in the second quarter 
of 2011. In addition, high exposure to the 

construction sector (including real est
ate collateral 
on their books) leaves banks vulnerable to further 
adjustment in real estate prices. On the upside, a 

more resilient labour market could result in a less 

pronounced deceleration in private consumption in 

2012. Government deficit improves in 
2011 but 
widens thereafter 
 In 2010 the general government deficit slightly 

narrowed to 3.6% of GDP, from 3.7% of GDP in 

2009. C
urrent 
primary 
expenditure rose by 3.
6% as 
a result of 
moderate growth in compensation of 
employees and a more pronounced increa
se in 

intermediate consumption and social transfers. 
Gross fixed capital formation remained flat 
reflecting weak absorption of EU funds, the 

postponement of some projects and one
-off sales 
of shipyards assets. 
In spite of some revenue
-enhancing measures (i
ncluding a tax amnesty), 
tax 
proceeds grew 
less than GDP 
as the rebound in 
econom
ic activity 
was driven by relatively tax
-poor components (mainly exports). 
Total current 
revenues grew by 2.8%.
 The deficit is 
expected
 to narrow to 3% of GDP in 
2011, when th
e primary balance is projected to be 
in surplus for the first time since 2007
. Around two 
thirds
 of the deficit reduction 
between 2010 and 
2011 is
 related to the expiry of some temporary 
measures 
supporting the economy that were 
adopted 
with
 the 2010 
budge
t. Nevertheless, 
current primary expenditure 
growth i
s expected to 
accelerate compared to 2010, 
to 4.0%. 

Compensation of
 employees is forecast to 
accelerate following a two
-year period of 
containment, and s
ocial transfers are expected to 
keep increasing at
 a fast pace due to 
buoyant 
age
-related entitlements. 
Capital expenditure is set to 
rebound after the stagnation recorded 
in 2010
, helped also by an increased absorption of 
EU 

funds
. On the revenue side
, dir
ect taxes are set to 
increase 
only 
slightly
 on th
e back of a deceleration 
in corporate profits' growth
. Indirect taxes 
should
 benefit from the increase in excise duties and the 

projected 
modest rebound in private consumption,

  18. THE NETHERLANDS
 Moderate growth hinging on external demand
  138 A broad
-based recovery 
in the economy 
started towards the end of 2010–
 In 2010 the Dutch economy recovered from its 
2009 recession, recording po
sitive GDP growth of 

1.7%. The pick
-up in economic activity was 
mainly driven by a strong rebound in world trade. 
On the other hand, domestic demand (excluding 
inventories) remained a drag on growth, although 

it did revert to positive territory in both the
 fourth 
quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, 

mainly as a result of a surge in investment. As a 

consequence, quarterly GDP growth rates showed 
a strong performance of 0.7% and 0.8% 
respectively. 
 The momentum of domestic demand was lost 

again in t
he second quarter of 2011, resulting in a 
growth slowdown to 0.2%. With the exception of 

inventories, all domestic demand categories 
contracted. Household consumption decreased for 
the second quarter in a row, in line with a fall in 

real disposable income 
and adverse wealth effects 

stemming from falling equity and house prices.
 The decline in global growth lowered the 
contribution of external demand to GDP growth in 
the second quarter, which had been the main driver 

of the recovery since the second half of 
2009. 
 –but future growth will rely on exports
 again
 Growth in the last two quarters of 2011 is foreseen 

to remain subdued, owing to ongoing uncertainty 

related to the European sovereign
-debt crisis. 
While consumption and investment are hit by 
confidence e
ffects, exports are expected to slow 
down in view of worsening prospects for world 

trade. Overall, however, the external sector is still 

due to show a positive contribution to growth. 

Thanks to the relatively high carry
-over from 2010 
and the strong first 
quarter of 2011, annual GDP 
growth is projected to still amount to 1.8%.  
 Private investment is expected to suffer given low 
confidence levels and a slowdown in exports. 

Also, despite increases over the past quarters 

capacity utilisation rates remain at a
 low level, 
especially in the manufacturing sector, thereby not 
providing an incentive for capacity
-increasing 
investments. 
 A progressive decline in consumer confidence 
since the start of 2011 culminated in a historically 

large drop in August and Septembe
r and a further 
decline in October. This, together with the 

continued adjustment in the housing and stock 

markets, is foreseen to contribute to weak private 

consumption over the next quarters. Private 

consumption is expected to remain sluggish 

throughout t
he forecast period due to moderate real 
wage growth in combination with government 
consolidation measures. The latter mainly affect 
households, especially through a higher tax burden 

and sizeable cuts in social security transfers, 

notably health care allow
ances. Moreover, wealth 
effects have a relatively larger impact on 

consumption in the Netherlands compared to other 
EU Member States due to comparatively high 
levels of accumulated financial assets and 

leveraged housing wealth. 
 Dutch exports are set to su
ffer from worsened 
global trade prospects, which are also foreseen to 
affect its main trading partners. Exports of goods 
and services are projected to only grow moderately 
in 2012 and 2013. As imports are set to fall in line 

with domestic demand, net expor
ts are expected to 
remain the major source of economic growth. 

Given the expected positive performance of the 

trade balance, the Dutch current
-account surplus is 
expected to continue to show a significant surplus.

forecast
 HICP inflation is expected to rise to 2.5% in 2011, 

mainly as a result of rising energy and food prices, 

continuing a rising trend since the second half of 

2010. Owing to expected declines in commodity 

prices (notab

government consumption, HICP inflation is 
Member States, The Netherlands
   139 forecast to gradually decrease in 2012 and 2013 to 
respectively 1.9% and 1.3%, in spite of some 

upward pressure from government measures on 

administered prices.
 The risks associate
d with the baseline scenario are 
predominantly on the downside. These are mainly 
associated with downward risks from the global 

economic environment. Risks are, however, not 

solely concentrated on the international side. 

Negative domestic developments, suc
h as a 

sustained and more severe fall in house prices, 

could also hamper the recovery through adverse 
wealth effects affecting mainly private 
consumption and investment. Consumption could 

also be negatively affected if pensions were 

lowered due to problems
 in the pension funds, in 
view of continued financial market stress and the 

low interest rates. 
 Unemployment projected to rise slowly
 The labour market is giving off mixed signals. The 

demand
-led gradual improvement in the 
unemployment rate during the fir
st half of 2011, 
exemplified by an increase in the number of job 
vacancies and temporary workers, has come to a 
halt. Month
-on-month data for both July and 
August 2011 show a rise in unemployment. Over 

the forecast horizon, unemployment is expected to 

rise
 further, albeit at a slow pace, resulting in 
unemployment rates of 4.5% in 2011, 4.7% in 
2012 and 4.8% in 2013. 
 Following a small decline in 2011 the labour force 
is assumed to grow at a mild pace in 2012 and 

2013. The presence of the 'discouraged worker
-effect' is diminishing, but is not expected to fully 

disappear in 2012.  The projected slowdown of the 
economic recovery causes potential employees to 
refrain from entering the labour market in view of 

weak job prospects. In addition, demographic 

developm
ents start to account for a small shrinking 
of the labour force, as population ageing starts to 
come into effect. These factors are, however, more 
than offset by a still growing participation rate, 

leading to an overall moderate increase in the 

labour forc
e over the forecast period. The 
increasing participation is mainly related to the 

ongoing rise in the participation of women, 

although this effect is decreasing over time.    
 Employment prospects are forecast to remain 
subdued, showing a small decline in 
2011 and 

2012 and a limited rebound in 2013. The main 
negative contribution comes from the government, 

as a large part of the planned consolidation effort 
is concentrated in the reduction of the size of the 
public sector. Employment in the private sector i
s 

also expected to fall in 2012, as the past policy of 
labour hoarding will imply little need for 
additional personnel as the economy picks up.  By 

contrast, a pronounced rise in employment in 

healthcare is projected over the forecast horizon.  
 Following 
a stabilisation in 2011, nominal unit 
labour costs are expected to increase in 2012 and 
2013 as the rising trend in inflation since mid
-2010 puts upward pressure on wages in the private 

sector. Furthermore, employers' social 

contributions are expected to i
ncrease, exerting 
further upward pressure on nominal unit labour 
costs. 
 Sizeable consolidation leads to a considerable 
improvement of the general government 

balance
 In 2010 the general government deficit improved 
to 5.1% from 5.6% in 2009, mainly as a res
ult of a 
stronger
-than
-expected economic rebound from the 
crisis, which lead to higher revenues. For 2011 the 
general government deficit is expected to further 
improve to 4.3% of GDP as the government 

changed its expansionary fiscal stance of the 

preceding
 years to a restrictive one, reversing the 
stimulus package and introducing consolidation 

measures. 
 In 2012 the main budgetary cuts will be realised by 

reducing the number of civil servants and 

eliminating several government subsidies. These 

cuts are to b
e complemented by significant 
reductions in social security expenditure in the 

form of health and child care allowances. In total, 
the government is expected to cut expenditure by 
around EUR 5 billion (around 0.8% of GDP). At 

the same time, tax relief for 
companies of around 

EUR 2 billion (around 0.3% of GDP) should 

largely compensate for the loss in subsidies. On 
balance, despite the weak prospects for growth, the 
general government deficit is expected to improve 

to 3.1% of GDP in 2012. In 2013, continued 

consolidation is expected to lead to a further 

decrease in the general government deficit to 2.7% 

of GDP. In both years, falling interest payments 

mitigate the general government deficit outcome, 
due to the current historically low interest rates on 
Dutch 
government bonds. The structural balance is

 Following the increase in 2010

gross government debt is expected to rise further in

projections include the impact of guarantees to the

 Recovery losing pace
  141 Weakening exports and sagging confidence 
weighing on the recovery
 The recovery of th
e Austrian 
economy has been 
gaining
 ground
, albeit at a moderating pace
. GDP 
growth averaged 3.8% y
-o-y in the first half of 
2011, reflecting 
a strong carry
-over
, and 
maintained a solid 0.7% on average for the first 
two quarters of 
2011, with manufacturing
 being
 the main driv
ing force
. On the demand side, 
growth was supported by the ongoing increase 
in investment, including inventory build
-up, while 
private consumption growth remain
ed subdued and 
net exports weaken
ed. Export 
growth remained 
robust 
at 6.4% 
in year
-on-year terms in the 
seco
nd 
quarter
. However, 
quarter
-on-quarter
 growth has 
stalled
 and has been
 outstripped by import growth, 
possibly reflecting 
still
-strong
 equipment imports.

 a strong performance in the second half of

Higher
 capacity utilisation in 
manufacturing, as well as hefty in

slump in construction seems to have ceased and 

may 
provide
 a boost to economic activity 
in the 
near future

h a limited 
decline (
-0.3% in 2009), private consumption 
recovered in 2010, posting 2.2% growth thanks to 

favourable labour

 Financing con

 Cred

momentum since 2010 on the back of the 
economic recovery, is likely to tail off over the 
forecast horizon. The renewed tightening of credit 

standards coupled with lower credit demand from 

both companies and households due t

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   142 Europe are expected to be the main causes of the 
subdued credit activity going forward.
 Corporations and households seem to adopt a 
"wait
-and
-see" attitude with regard to consumption 
and investment out
lays, posing a risk of only 
marginal growth throughout most of 2012. A 
tangible revival of economic activity is not 

foreseen before the later quarters of 2012.
 On the upside, Austria is well positioned to benefit 

from the ongoing buoyant demand in the emer
ging 
economies of Latin America and Asia. Firms have 
boosted 
their 
competitiveness by 
upgrading
 capacity and by 
retai
ning productivity gains
. Productivity has 
continued to
 improv
e, while unit 
labour costs have
 declined even in nominal terms, 
providing corp
orations with a buffer to 
accommodate wage increase demands.
 Not least 
the nascent recovery
 in the construction sector
, together with sound corporate 
and household 
balance sheets, bodes well for investment activity.
 Unemployment to edge up again
 In 2010 
the moderate crisis
-related
 employment 
loss 
was
 reversed 
as a result
 of steadily growing 
labour demand in services and a recovery in 

industrial employment. Strong employment growth 
Œ at 1½% 
y-o-y Œ has continued in 2011. 
In August 
2011, the unemployment rate
 was 3.7%, close to 
its pre
-crisis trough of 3.5% recorded in June 2008.
 However, these trends are unlikely to persist and 
the labour market outlook is highly uncertain. 
The 
outcome of first wage negotiations in October has 
pushed negotiated wages signific
antly upwards, 
limiting the scope for sustaining the pace of 

employment gains over the forecast horizon and 

putting upward pressure on unit labour costs going 

forward. However this wage signal may well be 

attenuated by the loss of momentum in economic 
acti
vity and the possible rise in unemployment. 
The latter is projected to increase in 2012
 to 
slightly above its level of 2010 as job creation 
stalls while both working age population and the 

participation rate edge
 up.
 Externally induced easing of inflation 
 Having 
stayed
 below 2% for most of 2010, 
inflation has averaged 3.
8% since April 2011
 and 
reached 4% in September 2011,
 driven by higher 
motor and heating fuel prices, as well as 
rising
 food prices. Core inflation, defined as HICP 

excluding energy and unp
rocessed food, has not 
remained unaffected by these surges
, which
 seem 
to have spilled over into 
the price of 
servic
es, 
where the annual rate of change accelerated from 

1.2% in August 2010 to 
a peak of 
3.9% in August 
2011. These effects are projected to 
disappear 
gradually, leading to a moderation of inflation
 by 
2012. Wage dynamics should remain contained 
over the forecast horizon as 
the pace of 
economic 

expansion decelerates
, although the transmission 
of negotiated wages into the effective wage level 

may 
exert upward pressure on service prices
. Fiscal consolidation stalls as growth l
oses 
momentum
 The general government deficit rose from 4.1% in 
2009 to 4.4% in 2010. The increase was 
largely
 due to the 
statistical revision of March 2011 made 
to Austrian pub
lic finance figures for the period 
1995-2010.
(68) Additional discretionary measures 
came into force in 2010 (namely parts of the 2009 

tax reform such as relief for families with children 

and tax cuts for the self
-employed)
, but
 these
 were 
offset to a large 
extent by higher
-than
-expected tax 
receipts. 
 Fiscal consolidation
 began in 2011, facilitated by 
the favourable economic developments, and is 

projected to result in a narrowing of the deficit to 
3.4% of GDP this year. The budget law for 2011 
contained a pa
ckage of measures (amounting to 

around ¾% of GDP) aimed at bringing Austrian 

public finances back onto a sustainable path. 

Almost half of the consolidation effort is taking 

place on the revenue side. The biggest item is a 

bank levy (0.2% of GDP), designed 
in response to 
the latest global financial crisis and intended to 
collect a
 contribution from financial institutions to 
the costs incurred by the Austrian authorities of 

stabilising the financial sector. The effect of the 

latter is being mitigated, however
, by the 
withdrawal of a
 fee on loans. Another substantial 
element in the package is a rise in the fuel tax and 

in the tax on cigarettes (a combined effect of 

around 0.2% of GDP). Apart from this, the set of 
                                                           (68) As a result of discuss
ions between the Austrian authorities 
and Eurostat on the implementation of rules contained in 
the "Manual on Government Deficit and Debt", in March 
2011, Austrian public finance figures were revised from 
1995 onwards. While the changes concerning the peri
od up 
to 2006 were less significant, those for the years 2007
-10 
raised the general government deficit by between 0.4 and 1 

pp
. of GDP. The revisions stem from three sources: 1) the 
assumption by the government of 70% of the costs of 
infrastructure financi
ng of the Austrian Federal Railways, 
2) the costs of financing the regional public hospitals, and 
3) the assumption of a part of the liabilities of the "bad 
bank" KA Finanz.

     143 agreed measures comprises, inter alia, the 
intro
duction of a tax on airline tickets, a rise in the 
tax on property sales by private foundations and an 

increase in registration fees for less environment
-friendly vehicles. The total effect of the latter 

measures should have only a modest budgetary 
impact.
  The measures on the expenditure side consist 
mainly of
 cuts in family allowances and pension 
entitlements as well as some saving in the area of 

long
-term care. 
Some reductions in administrative 
costs are also foreseen across the board.
 The effect 
of thes
e expenditure measures will coincide with 
a drop in spending on labour market relief as the 
short
-time work scheme is phased out. 
However, 
the consolidation effort will be partly offset by 

additional spending on long
-term care, education, 
R&D and energy
-saving renovation of buildings. 
 The general government deficit is projected to 
edge down to 3.1% of GDP in 2012 as weaker 
economic activity to some extent offsets the 

additional impact of the 2011 consolidation 

measures. No significant new consolidation pla
ns 
are included in the federal government's draft 

budget for 2012 which was presented to the 

Parliament on 19 October. For 2013, assuming no 
change in policy a further marginal correction of 
the deficit (to just below 3% of GDP) is expected 
on the back of 
accelerating GDP growth.   
 It should be also noted that
 developments in
 the 
structural budget deficit
s over the forecast period
 are
 affected by two one
-off measures, namely by 
the assumption of a part of the liabilities of the 

"bad bank" KA Finanz in 2010
 (equivalent of 
0.3% of GDP) and cancellation of government 

participation in Hypo Alpe Adria bank in 2011 

(0.2% of GDP).
 Due to statistical revisions for the period from 
1999 onwards, gross government debt reached 
almost 72% of GDP in 2010. The revision 

stemmed from both the above
-mentioned 
adjustment to the general government deficit series 

and, less significantly, a reclassification of other 

items impacting only on debt (e.g. treatment of 

cash collaterals and regional public housing unit). 

Throughout the 
forecast period, the debt ratio is 
projected to rise steadily, from 72.2% of GDP in 
2011 to almost 74% of GDP in 2013. 
Debt 

projections also include the impact of guarantees 

to the EFSF and the participation in the capital of 

the ESM as planned on the cut
-off date of the 
forecast.

 Progressing despite adverse global economic conditions
  144 The economic rebound is losing steam 
 After a rebound in 2010 driv
en by 
a revival of 
international trade, inflows of EU funds and 
an 
improving labour market situation, economic 

growth strengthened further to 4.4%
 y-o-y in the 
first half of 2011
. Activity 
was driven by domestic 
demand, 
in particular re
-stocking of invento
ries, 
accelerating 
private investment on the back of 
soaring profitability as well as improved access to 

credit and, finally, rising private consumption 

underpinned by positive labour market prospects. 
 In the second half of 2011, however, the Polish 
econo
my is expected to feel the repercussions of 
the global slowdown. In particular, weaker 

external demand is set to hamper export growth. In 

addition, turbulences in financial markets have 

begun to weigh on consumer and producer 
confidence, ultimately limitin
g private investment 
expenditure, employment growth and the 
expansion of private consumption. These 

developments are expected to result in real GDP 

growth slowing to 3.6% y
-o-y in the second half of 
the year, leading to annual growth of 4% in 2011.
 Weakeni
ng confidence and falling external 
demand hamper growth 
 The fallout from the global slowdown is expected 
to shape the prospects of the Polish economy over 

the forecast period. The economic uncertainty is 

likely to affect economic activity in 2012 and a 
marginal rebound is anticipated only in 2013. Real 
GDP is therefore projected to increase by 2.5% in 
2012 and 2.8% in 2013.
 In 2012 both domestic and 
external demand are likely to contribute to growth, 

with favourable labour market conditions, inflows 

of EU 
funds and a depreciating currency being the 
main driving forces. In 2013 private investment 
and private consumption are expected to inch up 

against the background of a reviving global 

environment.
 Public investment is set to accelerate further, at 

least un
til the summer of 2012, as several 
infrastructure projects are expected to be finalised 

before the Euro 2012 football championship. As 

the end of the EU financial perspective for 

2007-13 is set to reduce the inflow of EU funds, 
this might however substanti
ally curb public 
investment growth towards the end of 2012 and 
turn it negative in 2013. Private gross fixed capital 

formation is forecast to slow in 2012 after a 

temporary rebound in 2011. In particular, the 

corporate sector is set to delay investments as
 a result of uncertain demand prospects, weakened 

global confidence and hampered access to credit. 

However, the expected improvement in external 
demand in 2013 is likely to revive private 
investment as large and medium
-sized companies 
have sufficient cash 
at their disposal and credit 

supply is set to accelerate. 
 Real disposable income and consumption will 
benefit from further real wage growth, higher than 
previously indexation of pensions, increased 

consumer spending during the Euro 2012 

championship and s
luggish but positive 
employment growth in 2012. Consumer 

confidence, which is expected to deteriorate 

further, might somewhat counterbalance these 
positive developments and result in increased 
household savings. Improving labour market 

conditions amid rebo
unding global demand and 

confidence are set to result in an accelerating 

private consumption towards the end of the 

forecast horizon.

 The impact of external trade on growth is likely to 
be positive in 2012 and broadly neutral thereafter. 
Decelerating ex
ternal demand is 
set
 to hamper 
exports, though 
the 
depreciating currency will 
limit the negative effects. Moreover, 
the 
weakening currency will benefit domestic 

producers at the expense of importers
, leading to 
lower import growth in 2012. In 2013 accelera
ting 
domestic demand 
is expected to 
stimulate imports, 
Member States, Poland
   145 outweighing the effects of rebounding export 
growth.
 This scenario is subject to broadly balanced risks.
 On the upside, a stronger
-than
-expected 
depreciation would further boost exports and 
enhance imp
ort substitution. On the downside, 
stronger deleveraging from emerging Europe could 
adversely affect credit markets for private and 

public borrowers, leading to lower investment and 

consumption. 
 Current
-account deficit stabilises at a relatively 
high leve
l The current
-account de
ficit deteriorated to 4.6
% of 
GDP in 2010, following 
a sharp increase in 
imports and 
a correction 
of the sizeable errors and 

omission item
 of the balance of payments 
statistics. It
 is expected to reach 
5% of GDP in 
2011, and to ther
eafter
 improve temporarily to 
4.3% of GDP in 2012 
as a result of a depreciating 
currency and 
a moderate increase in 
current 
transfers, before reaching 
4.8% in 2013
. The rise 
in the deficit reflect
s a rebound in private 
investment fuelling demand for import
s and higher 
income transfers 
linked to
 increased holdings of 
sovereign debt by foreigners. 
 Financial system is fundamentally stable but 
highly dependent on foreign financing
 Poland's banking sector has substantially improved 
its 
liquidity and capital buf
fers since 2008 as 
profitability increased 
over the course of 2011
. The 

overall share of non
-performing loans is relatively 
stable 
at 8
.5% of total loans
, though 
loan quality 
varies significantly across segments. The 

proportion of impaired loans is highest
 in the 
consumer credit segment (18%), which could 

threaten the
 increase in private consumption going 
forward
. Moreover, 
banks' r
eliance on foreign 
funding for 
liquidity provision and on 
foreign 
exchange 
swap markets 
for
 access to foreign 
currenc
y might re
sult in a credit squeeze if risk 
appetite wane
s further. 
 Inflation decreases temporarily 
 The rate of HICP inflation is forecast to 
rise
 from 
2.6% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2011 on the back of high 

fuel and food prices, 
an increase 
in indirect taxes 
and strong d
omestic demand in the first half of 
2011. 
However,
 it is expected to moderate again in 
2012 to 2.7%
, reflecting 
lower commodity prices 
and 
weaker 
domestic demand. The effects of the 
depreciating currency and growing wage pressure 
will 
be felt 
towards the e
nd of 2012 and result in 
an 
inflation 
rate 2.9
% at 
the end of the forecast 
horizon. Increas
ed economic activity and improv
ed labour market 
conditions
 led to
 a gradual 
acceleration of nominal unit labour costs 
in 2010-11. Looking ahead, 
the gradual 
slowdown
 and stalling employment growth are likely to delay 

somewhat 
the expected wage acceleration. 
However, 
an 
emerging labour 
shortage 
is likely to 
fuel wage growth in 2013, 
affecting unit labour 
costs and adding to core inflation. 
 Labour market revival halts 
temporarily
 Employment is expected to grow by 1% in 2011, 

leading to a moderate decrease in the 

unemployment rate to 9.3%. However, 

deteriorating external demand and falling 

confidence are forecast to freeze employment 

growth, especially in manufacturing, 
in the short 
term. It is set to rebound moderately in 2013 on the 
back of an improving global outlook, leading to a 

fall in the unemployment rate to 8.6% at the end of 

the forecast horizon.  
 Fiscal consolidati
on is losing momentum
 After a 
continuous 
deter
ioration
 from 1.9% of 
GDP in 2007 to 7.9% of GDP in 2010 in the wake 

of the financial and economic crisis, owing in part 

to a sizeable stimulus package, the general 
government deficit is projected to have started 
declining in 2011 thanks to a sharp (but te
mporary) 
economic rebound in the first half of the year and 

an ambitious consolidation plan implemented in 

2011. 
 In 2011 the headline deficit is expected to fall to 

5.6% of GDP, driven by a significant increase in 

the revenue ratio (from 37.5% of GDP in 2
010 to 
39.6% of GDP in 2011) and a slight decline in the 

expenditure ratio (from 45.4% of GDP in 2010 to 

45.2% of GDP in 2011). On the revenue side, a 
number of supportive developments are notable: a 
change in the pension system that retains part of 

the co
ntribution in the public first pillar, an 
increase in VAT rates (by 1 pp.) and in excise duty 

on tobacco (by 4 pps.), the abolition of VAT (on 

company cars and fuel) and excise duty (on 
bio
-fuels) exemptions, and a freeze in Personal 
Income Tax (PIT) thres
holds. These are 
compounded by the impact of faster GDP growth 
and an improvement in Corporate Income Tax

     146 (CIT) annual settlements, following a period of 
sharp economic slowdown and exceptionally low 

revenues. Growth in government spending has 

been constra
ined by the expenditure rule limiting 
increases in all newly enacted and existing 
discretionary expenditure items to 1 pp. over the 
rate of inflation, a freeze of the wage fund of 
public sector employees (except for teachers) and 

additional minor cuts in s
ocial spending.
 In 2012, the lack of significant new reforms (and 

removal from the forecast of the effects of the 

deficit rule for local government entities due to its 
postponement), as well as the effect of the main 
austerity measures implemented in 2011 
and 

remaining in force in 2012 (expenditure rule, 

freeze in the wage fund, higher VAT rate), are 

expected to be partially offset by a significantly 

slower GDP growth. The headline deficit is 

expected to decline to 4.0% of GDP, owing in part 

to a limited in
crease in the revenue ratio (from 
39.6% of GDP to 40.8% of GDP), slower than in 

2011 because of a stagnating labour market and 

diminishing responsiveness of tax revenues to the 

changes in tax base. A continuing slowdown in the 

expenditure ratio (from 45.2%
 to 44.8% of GDP), 
driven mainly by a significant deceleration in 

public investment spending, further drives the 
falling deficit.
 The headline deficit is expected to keep decreasing 
in 2013, reaching 3.1% of GDP, on the back of 

rebounding economic growth a
nd persistently low 
public investment expenditure, alongside a 
slowdown in inflows of structural funds.
 Given the structural character of most 
implemented reforms and a negative but relatively 

stable output gap, the structural deficit is set to 

follow the 
evolution of the headline deficit, falling 
from 7.6% of GDP in 2010 to 2.5% in 2013.  
 Despite a significant reduction in the headline 
deficit and implementation of the liquidity 
management reform obliging some general 

government entities to deposit liquid
 funds in a 
centralised account, general government debt is 

expected to increase from 54.9% of GDP in 2010 

to 56.7% of GDP in 2011. This comes not least as 

a result of a significant depreciation of the Polish 

zloty and consequently an increase in the value
 the 
debt denominated in foreign currency. The 

growing debt trend is forecast to slow in 2012
-13, 
due to the return of the exchange rate to a level 

more in line with the fundamentals of the economy 

and a further decline in the general government 

deficit. T
he projected debt figures are, however, 
subject to large uncertainty due to high exchange
-rate volatility affecting the debt valuation

 Strong fisc

  147 Deteriorating economic sentiment weighing on 
domestic demand
(69) The rebalancing of the economy away from its 
over
-reliance on domestic demand is proceeding 
against the background of the economic 

adjustm
ent programme. Business and consumer 
confidence indicators have been on a downward 

trend since the beginning of 2011, with some even 

reaching multi
-annual lows in September. 
Domestic demand recorded a strong contraction in 

the first quarter of 2011, which 
was reflected in all 
major expenditure components. However, its 
impact on GDP was cushioned by a concomitant 
decline in 
imports. Domestic demand showed 

some resilience in the second quarter of 
2011, helped by an unexpected but p
robably 
short
-lived
 stabilis
ation in the labour market. As a 
consequence, private consumption expenditure 

declined by less than expected in the spring 
forecast. In addition, healthy export growth lifted 
GDP in the second quarter. In volume terms GDP 

remained flat in the second quarte
r, following two 

consecutive quarter
-on-quarter declines in 
Q4-2010 and Q1
-2011.

economic developments will be influenced by

Credit supply to non

to be constrained, in particular in 2012, as a 
consequence of accelerated deleveraging e
fforts in 
the banking sector, with possible adverse effects 

on business investment.
 However, the demand of 
non
-financial corporations for bank credit should 
be equally subdued as the expected strong 
shrinking of domestic consumption is set to act as

  a drag
 on investment activity for the remainder of 
2011 and in 2012. Fixed investment is thus 
projected to decline by a cumulative 20% in 

2011-12 before a modest recovery of capital 
formation takes hold in 2013 due to the projected 

stabilisation of domestic cons
umption and strong 
export growth. Private consumption developments 

will be affected by two countervailing forces: 

ongoing debt reduction efforts by private 

households, but also consumption smoothing amid 
a sharp drop in real disposable income due to 
accele
rated fiscal consolidation. The household 

saving rate is expected to drop by 0.4
 pp. to 9.4% 
of disposable income in this year and to increase 

slightly in 2012
-13. Real private consumption is 
forecast to decline by 4¼% this year and by 6% in 

2012 before st
abilising in 2013. As a result of 
intensified fiscal consolidation, government 

consumption is set to shrink in volume terms by 

3% this year and by 6¼% and 4%, respectively, in 

2012 and 2013. This would add up to a cumulated 

decline in domestic demand of 13
% between 2010 
and 2013.

 Export activity is predicted to slow down in the 
short term, following the recent significant 

deceleration of external demand, which is 

projected to last u

-2012. However, due to 
strong export dynamics in the second quarter, 
export volumes should still increase by 6½% in 
this year before slowing down in 2012. In 2013 an 

acceleration of exports is expected in line with 

stronger foreign demand. The weak
ness of 
domestic demand is expected to affect goods with 

typically high import content, such as consumer 

durables and investment goods. Import volumes 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   148 are therefore anticipated to contract by a 
cumulated 10% in this year and next year, and to 

increase slig
htly by 1% in 2013. As a result, the 
hitherto high trade deficit is foreseen to turn into a 
small surplus in 2013. On the other hand, rising 
interest rates and a still
-high level of external 
indebtedness should further widen the deficit in the 

primary inco
me balance. The current
-account 
deficit is thus is projected to narrow at a slower 

pace than the trade deficit and to reach 4% of GDP 

in 2013.
 Price pressures remain subdued
 Headline inflation is evolving as predicted in the 

spring forecast, with price dev
elopments being 
driven by high energy prices and the effects of 

VAT hikes. HICP decelerated during the summer 
but soared to 3.5% in September, largely due to an 
acceleration of goods prices. When measured at 
constant taxes, HICP inflation has been below th
e euro
-area average since December 2007. Prices are 
anticipated to accelerate further in the final quarter 
of this year and in 2012 due to consecutive VAT 

rate changes on 1 October 2011 and 1 January 

2012. Annual HICP inflation is forecast to average 
3½% i
n 2011 and 3% in 2012, but to decelerate 
markedly thereafter amid continued mark
-up 
compression and downward wage pressure in the 
context of relatively weak domestic demand. The 

recovery of the labour market in the second quarter 

is not expected to continu
e over the forecast 
period. Unemployment is set to increase into 2013. 
 Risks to the economic outlook are tilted to the 
downside
 Downside risks to the forecast prevail over the 
short term. In particular, accelerated deleveraging 

in the banking sector throu
gh lending restraint 
rather than raising capital would be detrimental to 

the prospective recovery in business investment, as 

would be a further worsening of the global 

economic outlook. On the positive side, an earlier 

recovery of the world economy could l
ift export 
volumes in 2012. Recently implemented reforms 
on labour and product markets could unlock 
economic growth earlier than expected.
 Tight fiscal consolidation 
 Medium
-term prospects are affected by the plans 
to sizeably reduce the government deficit
 and put 
the public debt ratio on a downward path. Under 

the ongoing Economic Adjustment Programme, 
government targets are for a deficit of 5.9% of 

GDP in 2011, 4.5% in 2012 and 3% of GDP in 

2013. Taking into account the combined effect of 

the planned cons
olidation measures and the 
subdued GDP path over the period 2011
-13, the 
reduction of the government deficit to 3% of GDP 

in 2013 from 9.8% of GDP in 2010 will largely be 

the result of a falling expenditure
-to-GDP ratio, 
with an additional contribution of 
a slight rise in 

the revenue ratio. The improvement in the 

structural balance over the forecast period will 

amount to close to 8 pps. of GDP.

forecast
 A la
rge fiscal consolidation eff
ort has been
 implemented in 2011, 
encompassing a wide range 

of structural measures in various areas of the 

revenue and expenditure sides of the budget.
 On the expenditure side
, these 
include an average cut
 of 5
% in 
government
 wages, reductions in 
governmen
t payroll lists, cuts in social transfers 
(such as unemployment benefits and family 
allowances
), and a freeze of 
essentially all 
other 
social outlays. 
Measures
 have also aimed
 at reining 
in spending
, in particular in the health sector, state
-owned enterpri
ses (SOEs) 
and
 public investment. 
Consolidation e
fforts on the revenue side consist 
main
ly of a 2 pps. increase in 
the standard VAT 
rate 
in 
January
 2011. In addition, revenue 
inflows 
benefit from 
the carry

a number of 
tax hikes in
 mid

non

revenues

 higher prices
, fees for services 
and through assets and concessions sales

 also 
planned, the latter having only a temporary effect 

on the budget.
 Nonetheless, the achievement of the government 

deficit target for 20
11 would be at risk
 in the 
absence of further corrective measures
. This is 
mainly due to expenditure overruns and
 shortfalls 
of non

      149 events
 are hampering fiscal prospects for 2011, 
including notably the assumption of debts of about 
0.3% of GDP from a financially
-troubled 
government enterprise and a failed public
-private 
partnership, both in the remit of the Madeira 

regional government.
 Additional
 costs related to 
the sale of 
the troubled bank 
BPN 
will add another 
0.2% of GDP to the 2011 government deficit.
 Against 
this
 backdrop, additional measures have 
been taken to counteract the emerging budgetary 

slippage. In particular a one
-off ta
x surcharge in 
personal income has been introduced and the VAT 
rate on electricity and natural gas has been 
increased 
(with a substantial carry
-over into 2012)
. Furthermore
, the government will proceed with the 
transfer of 
bank
 pension funds to the state s
ocial 
security system, with the 
sizeable resulting 
up-front capital transfers contributing to a temporary 

reduction of the 
fiscal 
deficit.
 In 2012, Portugal is expected to undertake 

additional consolidation efforts worth 
over 5
% of 
GDP, included in a compr
ehensive package of 
spending cuts and tax increases.
 Measures on the 
expenditure side 
notably 
include
 cuts 
of 
government wages and pensions, which can 

amount up to a reduction of income by 1/7 for 
those earning or receiving more than 1000 euro per 
month, a
s 2 of the 14 annual payments will be 
eliminated. In addition, r
eductions in public sector 
employment 
are also foreseen and access to some 
social transfers is to be tightened. Savings 
in the 

area of health 
are expected to come from a 
restructuring of healt
h services and lower spending 
on medication.
 Rationalisation in the 
area of 
education and of 
public administration
 in general 
should yield additional savings.
 A sharp decline in 
capital expenditure
 is also targeted, including by 
state
-owned enterprises
. On
 the revenue side
, the 
consolidation 
plan
s for 2012 rely considerably on 
higher indirect taxation: at the level of 
VAT
 the 
structure of taxation is set to change, with
 more 
goods and service
s being 
taxed at the 
higher 
intermediate 
and 
standard rates
 and so
me excise 
taxes will also 
be 
increase
d. Regarding direct 
taxation, the focus is 
mainly on a broadening of 
the 
tax base by reducing deductions and
 exemptions 
at 
personal and corporate income
 tax levels
. Exemptions 
relating to real estate 
taxation 
are 
also 
set to 
be reduced.
 For 2013, additional sizeable consolidation efforts 
of 2% of GDP are foreseen, largely based on the 

deepening of previously implemented cost
-cutting 
measures and a further broadening of tax bases. 

Government debt is projected to stabilise
 at 112% 
of GDP in 2013, up from 72% of GDP in 2008

 Recovery to continue despite worsening external environment
  150 Modest recovery after a long rece
ssion Economic growth was robust in the first quarter of 
2011 (when GDP grew by 0.5% 
q-o-q), but tail
ed off in the second quarter to a 
mere
 0.2% increase. 
Real GDP is currently projected to grow by around 
1.7% in 2011 as a whole
. On the demand side, net 
exports were the key driver for growth in 
the first 
half of
 2011, but the
se are likely to contribute less 
to growth in 
the second half of the year
 due 
to the 
expected slowdown in 
external demand. Private 
consump
tion did not pick up significantly as it was 
held back by stil
l weak household balance sheets. 
However
, both retail trade 
developments
 and the 
retail sentiment indicator point to slight 
improvements lately. Public investment is assumed 

to increase towards the end of the year as the 

authorities are movi
ng ahead with 
various
 road 
construction projects
. The still very low EU funds 
absorption rate of 3.7% (as of end
-September
 2011) indicates that there is great potential for 
higher public investment
.  Progress in implement
ing
 the measures required 
under the
 multilateral f
inancial assistance 
programmes
 of the EU, the IMF and the World 
Bank
(70) has reduced previously built
-up 
imbalances and has helped restore confidence 

among investors in the country. Following the 

successful completion of the 2009
-11 balance o
f payments assistance programme, Romania has 

returned to the financial markets and is now 

financing itself both on the 
domestic
 and the 
external market. 
 The labour market shows signs of improv
ement. 
The second quarter
 of 
2011 saw significant 
improvement
, probably also driven by important 
reforms implemented in April 2011 in the areas of 
labour market legislation (Labour Code) and social 

dialogue (Social Dialogue Code). While regi
stered 
unemployment is
 coming down, indications 
from
 the labour force survey (
LFS) point to a broadly 
                                                           (70) Following the successful completion of the 2009

assistance programme and at 
the request of the 
Romanian authorities, a follow

precautionary BoP programme for Romania was approved 
by the Council in May 2011 which entered into force in 
June. The new programme is again a joint programme with 
the IMF and the WB and it focuses on structural reforms to
 support the re

continuation of fiscal consolidation and the preservation of 

financial stability remain important conditions.

 Growth becomes more broad
-based in 2012, 
but is affected by international turbulence
 Growth is expected to moderately accelerate in 
2012 to 2.1%. After export
-led growth in 2011 
activity is expected to become more broad
-based 
in 2012 as the increase in exports spills over into 
domestic demand. External demand is expected to 
remain supportive but to be less robust in 2012 due 

to the worsening economic outlook in Europe and 

other par
ts of the world. Although households and 
corporates are expected to continue to adjust their 

balance sheets during the first half of 2012, the 
projected increase in employment, coupled with 
lower inflation, should support real disposable 

income. This contr
ibutes to a revival of private 
consumption during the second half of 2012. 
 Government consumption is not expected to 
contribute much to growth in 2012 as it is 

constrained by the need for further fiscal 
consolidation and the continued reduction of 
public 
sector employment. Investment is expected 
to be an important growth driver next year given 

the country's high needs to modernise its public 

infrastructure, partly with the help of co
-financing 
from EU structural funds. Private investment is, 
however, likel
y to be weaker on account of 
increased uncertainty linked to the 2012 elections 
and due to the lagged effects of the turbulences in 

international financial markets during 2011.

   151 activity is expected to 
show
 a modest recovery in 
2012, as 
financial
 ins
titutions continue to repair 
their balance sheets after a long period of 
deterioration in asset quality.
 Economic growth is expected to increase to 3.4% 
in 2013 about 1 pp. above current estimates of 
potential growth. Wages are expected to continue 

to read
just upwards from still very low levels 
(compared with the main trading partners), thus 

improving household balance sheets and leading to 

higher growth in private consumption than in 

2012. Both private and public investment are 
expected to accelerate; on t
he public side, the 
Government is planning to increase its capital 
spending in 2013 while on the private side some of 

the investments planned for 2011 and 2012 will be 

delayed and will shift into 2013. Moreover, the 

infrastructure projects started in 2011
-12, mostly 
financed by EU funds, are assumed to be executed 

at full speed. Although economic growth will be 
mainly driven by domestic demand in 2013, 
exports are expected to continue to increase on 

account of wage competitiveness and the sustained 

expansio
n in Romanian export capacity.
(71) Risks to the current forecast are skewed to the 

downside for 2011 and balanced 
thereafter
. There 
is a downside risk for 2011 due to
 the
 economic 
uncertainties surrounding the Eurozone, the 

sovereign
-debt crisis
 and financi
al markets
. However, 
going forward risks appear more 
balanced.
 Downside risks include: (i) the 
additional needs for repairing household balance 
sheets coupled with 
tighter credit standards for 
consumer lending
 may result in lower
-than
-expected private cons
umption; this in turn could 
harm the assumed transition to a more broad
-based 
recovery driven by private household demand; (ii) 

continuing uncertainty in financial markets and 
sovereign
-debt developments in the euro
-area 
periphery, as well as the global ec
onomic outlook 
in general may affect Romania's future prospects. 

However, 
there are upside risks:
 (i) 
the role of 
investment foreseen in the baseline may be more 

pronounced if the absorption of EU funds 
improve
s significantly in 2012 and 2013; (ii)
 moreove
r, 
since 2012 is an election year there is a

Œ accounted for 
a decline of 22% 
in the first half of 2011 in the trade deficit (to 4.2% 

of 
GDP)
. The current
-account deficit is expected to 
remain stable at around 4.3% of GDP i
n 2011 and 
to marginally widen in 2012 and 2013 due to a 

stronger pick

deterioration of the primary income and net

 balances
. Inflation moderated significantly recently, but 
upside risks remain over medium
-term
 Sign
ificant upside risks to the medium
-term 
inflation outlook remain in place, although price 
pressures eased in the course of 
the 
summer. In the 
second quarter 
of 
2011, following a succession of 
upward p
rice shocks, Romania was still the
 Member State with the
 highest inflation in the EU 
(at 8.4% in May
 2011). Annual inflation dropped 
sharply in the third quarter of 2011 reaching its 

lowest level in 21 years (i.e. 3.5% in September 

2011) due to a base effect resulting from the VAT 
hike a year ago and helped fur
ther by easing food 
prices. Therefore
 inflation has come into the 
NBR's target range of 3.0
% ±1 pp. 
set for 
end
-2011. 
 Inflation 
is expected to remain within the target 
range 
in Q4
-2011 and the first half of 2012. 
Nonetheless, looking further ahead, the te
mporary 
downward pressure on headline price indices 
stemming from volatile food prices may reverse in 

the second half of 2012
, although inflation is 

currently assumed to stay within the target range
. Moreover, the main upside risks to the inflation 

outlook
 still relate to prospects for sizeable upward 
adjustments in administered prices (in particular of 

electricity, gas and other utilities). Conversely, 
a 
deterioration in global economic conditions 

(including lower commodity prices) would have 
a 
disinflatio
nary effect.
 Fiscal consolidation will continue 
 The budget deficit is projected to decrease from 

6.9% of GDP in 2010 to 4.9% of GDP this year. 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   152 The austerity measures taken by the authorities in 
July 2010 continued to have a decreasing effect on 

the defici
t in the first half of 2011. Moreover, total 
revenue is expected to increase compared with 
2010, although it has been showing signs of 
underperformance in the July and August budget 
execution. Income from both VAT and excises was 
better than expected in th
e first six months of the 
year as a result of improved tax collection. 

However, excises have been underperforming in 

the budget execution for end
-August. Non
-tax 
revenue has also been lower than projected, while 

other items are evolving broadly in line wit
h expectations. 
 On the expenditure side, savings are higher than 

expected due to a better performance of personnel 

spending following a faster
-than
-anticipated 
reduction in public sector employment. Capital 

spending has also been under
-executed in the fir
st 
eight months of the year and is therefore projected 
to register a more modest growth rate for 2011 
compared to original expectations.

 Domestic payment arrears decreased at end
-August relativ
e to end
-January 2011, but arrears in 
the health sector may re
-accumulate by the end of 
the year if measures fall short of what is needed 

and funding is not increased. Moreover, while 
arrears continue to be on a decreasing trend, they 
have increased slight
ly at end
-August compared to 
end
-July. The fall in arrears between January and 
August was due to decreases at local government 
level and in social security, whereas arrears at 
central government level increased. Most of the 

arrears are at the level of loca
l government (50% 

of the total stock of arrears), followed by the social 

security sector (39%).
 Most of the arrears in the social security sector are 

in the health sector where the reforms 

implemented have not yielded the expected results. 

However, the aut
horities have committed to 
undertake an in
-depth reform of the health sector 
by end
-2011 to address persistent budgetary 
shortfalls. On the expenditure side, measures to 

restructure the system would include the 

implementation of a revised basic benefits pa
ckage 
which would exclude non
-essential health services 
from being insured by the government, a move to 

an increased use of generic drugs and a revision of 

the price and list of compensated drugs. On the 

revenue side, the reforms include a re
-design of the
 clawback tax,
(72) the introduction of a co
-payment 
system for those using the healthcare system and 

the introduction of supplementary insurance to 

cover medical services which go beyond the basic 
benefits package.

healthcare budget by requ

 decrease 
further to 3.7% of GDP under a no

assumption. The authorities have not yet finalised 
the 2012 budget, so therefore the current forecast 
does not include any additional policy measures 
that may be included in the 2012 budget. The 
cur
rent projections assume continued expenditure 
restraint, particularly regarding subsidies, as well 
as additional savings from the reforms that are 

currently being implemented such as the 

introduction of means tested social benefits, the 

reduction in the nu
mber of social assistance 
programmes and the continued implementation of 
the pension reform. 
 As part of the EU/IMF precautionary programme, 
the authorities are also working on shifting capital 

spending from domestic financing towards an 

increased use of 
EU structural funds, as well as 
prioritising the large number of existing 
investment projects and improving the capital 
budgeting process in order to achieve efficiency 
gains. No major discretionary measures have been 

taken into account in the revenue proj
ections. In 
particular, no changes in the main tax rates are 

expected in 2012. 
 According to projections, the budget deficit is 
expected to decrease to 2.9% of GDP in 2013 as a 
result of a continued decrease in the share of total 

expenditure in GDP, as wel
l as a slight increase in 
the share of total revenue in GDP.
     
 23. SLOVENIA
 Prospects depend on stabilisation of construction
  154 After a 1.4% increase in 2010,
 real GDP growth is 
expected to slow to 1.1% in 2011
 and 
1.0% in 
2012, before
 accelerating back to 1.
5% in 20
13. Growth in 2011 continues the 
2009 and 
2010 
pattern of strong net export performance 
offset
 by 
a sharp retrenchment in 
investment. This pattern 
is 
forecast to be partly reversed in 2012, as the 

worsening global environment is 
assumed to be 

counteracted by more benign domestic 

developments in the construction sector. 
 Uncertainty
 set to weigh on households
 Total disposable income of households in 2
011 is 

expected to contract slightly in real terms as 
the 

persistent decline in 
employment outpaces 

moderate real wage
 growth. 
Households 
therefore 
sustain
 their consumption only through reduced 
saving. In 2012 stabilising employment, the 

assumed 
expiry of
 certain freezes in social 
transfers and significantly lower inflation are 

forecast to revive growth in disposable incomes. 

However, the boost to consumption is assumed to 
be limited 
given
 higher precautionary savings
 amid 
increased economic u
ncertainty
. The saving rate is 
forecast to stabilise in 2013 as the 
global 
crisis 
abates, allowing consumption to grow more 
closely in line with disposable income.

, with work on larger non
-residential projects
 resuming 
under reorganised 
contracts
. This forecast 
accordingly 
projects 
a moderate
 rebound 
in construction activity 
in the 
third quarter of 2011, 
bringing to an 
end 
three 
consecutive years of rapid contraction 
and 

ushering in a period of relative stability for all 

categories of construction output
. By end
-2011 the 
share of construction in the economy 
is expected to
 settle at around half its 2008 peak
. This is assum
ed 
to be maintained over
 the forecast horizon.
  Meanwhile, equipment investment, which had 

recovered in 2010, is expected to decelerate 

somewhat in 2011
-12 owing to the slowdown in 
demand. With the near
-disappearance in 2012 of 
the drag from construction, 
total 
gross fixed capital 
formation 
is forecast to return to mild positive 
growth, driven by investment in equipment. 

Growth is forecast to strengthen further in 2013 as 
investment in equipment picks up again.
 Constrained credit
 Investment prospects in Slo
venia are also subject 

to financial developments. In 2011 c
redit growth 
has continued its sharp slowdown and has even 

turned negative for domestic bank lending to non
-financial corporations. 
A demand
-led reduction of 
credit, corresponding to adjustment 
to 
corporate 
over
-indebtedness, 
may account for some 
deleveraging
. However, high spreads between 
corporate borrowing rates in Slovenia and the euro 

area, coupled with evidence of 
strong 
companies 
obtaining credit directly from abroad, may also 

indicate that t
he credit needs of 
some viable 
companies are not adequately met by domestic 

banks, which could impose a speed limit on 

investment and 
growth. 
The position of the banks
, the largest of which passed the EU
-wide stress test 
with a very narrow margin,
 is made 
considerably 
more difficult by rapidly deteriorating credit 

quality
, notably in the corporate segment
, the 
uncertain value of collateral and the imperative to 

increase capital ratios
, even after 
the 
recapitalisations in early 2011. 
 Member States, Slovenia
   155 External demand 
does no
t lead all the way
 External rebalancing continues to drive economic 
growth. Strong export growth in 2010 and 2011 

has been coupled with sharply decelerating 

imports, the consequence of exceptionally weak 
domestic demand. 
Thus, also in 
2011, net exports 
are
 expected to contribute 
strongly
 to real GDP 
growth. 
With declining export prices relative to 
trading partners, a portion of the market shares lost 

in 2010 is projected to be regained in 2011. 

Weaker external demand in 2012
-13 and the 
rebound in domestic d
emand are forecast to 

gradually erode the positive contribution from net 

exports to real GDP growth. With
 relatively benign 
terms of trade in 2012
-13 following the high 
commodity price inflation recorded in 2011, 

rebalancing is forecast to continue
. These 
developments correspond to a small and increasing 

current
-account surplus over the forecast horizon.  
 Stagnant labour market
 The labour market remains weak, with 

employment continuing to fall into 2011. Private 

sector job
 losses in 2011 have 
been 
concentr
ated in 
the construction sector but have also affected
, to a 
lesser degree,
 manufacturing and trade and 
distributive services. 
Only limited further
 job 
losses are forecast for 2012, with employment 

stabilising going into 2013. 
Unemployment is 
forecast to p
eak at 8.
4% in 2012, with the share of 
long
-term 
unemployed becoming an increasing 
concern on account of 
the 
persistence of labour 
market weakness and the existence of skills 

mismatches.
 Average
 wage growth 
was
 very 
high 
in 2010 
due 
to the temporary effect
s of the 2010 minimum 
wage increase
, the transition back to normal 
working hours
 and some 
further
 composition 
effects from the loss of low
-paid jobs. These 
effects 
are expected to 
fade away during 2011, 
leading to a profile of 
decelerating 
wage growth in 
the private sector
 over 2011 and 2012
. By contrast, 
public sector
 wage growth is expected to resume 
from 2012 
in the absence of 
further
 measures to 
contain the wage bill. Coupled with only
 modest 
productivity growth, these wage developments 
would lead to un
it labour cost growth at around 
1% in 2011
-12, accelerating to 1.4% in 2013. 
 Core inflation is expected to rise substantially by 

the end of 2011 as temporary factors
 depress
ing
 services inflation 
to exceptionally low levels drop 

out of the calculation. De
spite this, headline HICP 
is forecast to remain on a downward path through 

to the end of 2012 
due to the unwinding of the 
effects 
of previous high commodity prices
 and 
temporarily high wage growth. Overall, HICP 

inflation is forecast to remain somewhat bel
ow the 
euro
-area average
 over the forecast horizon.
  This forecast is subject to a number of risks tilted 

to the downside. 
Most importantly, gross fixed 

capital formation 
and
, consequently
, real GDP 
could be significantly weaker if the 
incipient
 stabilisat
ion of construction output 
is not 
sustained
. Relatedly, abrupt falls in real
-estate 
prices 
remain a possibility given the absence of 
significant adjustment to date. This would have
 knock
-on effects on banks
' collateral
 and 
mortgage 
delinquency, as well as 
on 
other sectors
 through 
channels including wealth effects and confidence
. Difficulties in managing these asset impairments 
and raising fresh capital coupled with any renewed 
funding stress 
could 
further tighten credit 
conditions
. This would accelerate del
everaging in 
non
-financial corporations, causing further 
disruptions to illiquid, highly
-indebted firms and 
curtailing investment. 
 Government deficit ratio stabilises in 2011
 The general government deficit is forecast to 
broadly stabilise at 5.7% of GDP i
n 2011. 
However, without the
 deficit
-increasing one
-offs 
related to
 the recapitalisation of Slovenia's largest 
bank (0.7% of GDP) and the capital transfer to the 

railway company (0.4% of GDP), the budgetary 

position would improve. The structural balance is
 projected to improve by around 
1 pp. of GDP.
 On the revenue side, no measures were taken in 
2011 except in the area of excise duties (increases 
for tobacco to achieve the minimum rates set at the 

European level and changes for mineral oils to 

counteract i
nflationary pressures from fluctuations 
in world oil prices). Accordingly, revenues except 

excise duties are projected to move in line with 
their tax bases. The forecast factors in some 
improvement in the absorption of EU funds.
 Most of the temporary measu
res restraining 
primary expenditure growth in 2010 have been 

extended into 2011 and some of them have been 
reinforced. The public sector wage bill is contained 
through the non
-payment of various bonuses, a ban 
on promotions, recruitment restrictions and li
mited 
indexation. Increases in the number of pensioners 

and the unemployed, as well as a broader safety

transfers growing by

% in spite of more limited 
indexation arrangements. Intermediate 

consumptio
n and capital expenditure were cut in 
the September supplementary budget; government 

gross fixed capital formation is thus projected to 
decline markedly for the second year running. 
Other capital spending is affected by the above
-
mentioned one
-offs as well
 as support for the 
national airline and called state guarantees 

(together accounting for 1.3% of GDP). Interest 

expenditure will rise to around 2% of GDP due to 

higher debt and interest rates, from 1.6% in 2010.
 The parliament was dissolved on 21 October 
2011 

ahead of early elections scheduled for December. 

Apart from the non
-payment of bonuses in the 
public sector, no consolidation measures are in 

place for 2012
-13 so that the forecast is based on 
the usual no
-policy
-change assumption. While tax 
revenue i
s projected to move in line with the 
underlying tax bases, many categories of 

expenditure are forecast to exhibit strong dynamics 

due to the expiry of the temporary measures 

restraining their growth. Coupled with the further 

strong increase in the number o
f pensioners and 
the announced higher basic minimum income for 

the most socially vulnerable people from 1 January 
2012, this implies that current primary expenditure 
growth is projected at 3.4% in 2012 and 4.0% in 
2013, compared to 0.9% in 2011. However, t
he 
deficit is still forecast to narrow in 2012 to 5.3% of 

GDP as a result of the disappearance of the 

one
-offs recorded in 2011. In 2013 the deficit is 
projected to widen again to 5.7% of GDP, 

reflecting 
buoyant
 social transfers and 
compensation of employe
es. The structural balance 
is forecast to deteriorate by 
around ¾ 
pp. of GDP 

in 
both 
2012 and 2013.
 The gross government debt ratio is forecast to rise 

to 45½% of GDP in 2011, up from 39% in 2010, 

driven by the primary deficit and the increasing 
interest b
urden. Mainly as a result of persisting 
primary deficits, the debt ratio is projected to grow 
further over the forecast horizon, to around 54½% 

of GDP in 2013. The debt projections include the 

impact of guarantees to the EFSF, bilateral loans to 

Greece and
 the participation in the capital of the 
ESM as planned on the cut
-off date of the forecast. 
They are subject to upside risks from further 
capital support operations and calling of 
guarantees.
  24. SLOVAKIA
 Growth slowdown ahead
  157 Strong externally driven growth set to slow 
down significantly
 After posting one of the strongest rebounds in 
GDP in the EU in 2010, growth is expected to 

remain high in 2011, yet lower
 than in the previous 
year. This is chiefly on account of signs of 
slowdown in external demand in the second half of 
the year, the short
-term impact of fiscal 
consolidation and sluggish private consumption 

recorded in the first half of 2011. As the economi
c outlook for 2012 among the main trading partners 

has recently significantly worsened, external 
demand and trade are likely to decelerate 
markedly. This is expected to put on hold private 

investment decisions, reducing inflationary 

pressures and exerting 
a drag on GDP growth, 

which in turn is expected to drop to about 1%. 

Growth is expected to gather momentum in 2013, 

reflecting an improvement in the global outlook, a 
decrease in uncertainty and a gradual resumption 
in domestic investment and foreign deman
d. 
Private consumption is also expected to recover in 

2013 after several years of stagnation. The 

relatively sound fundamentals of the Slovak 

financial and industrial base should facilitate the 
recovery. 
 In the first half of 2011, exports continued to be 
strongly supported by the positive developments in 

industrial production and trade registered among 

Slovakia's main trading partners, notably 

Germany. From the production side, the increase 
in output has been driven by strong gains in value 
added in manufa
cturing, notably in the automotive 
industry, which have more than offset the declines 

registered in construction, wholesale and retail 

trade and agriculture. In response to the expected 

slowdown in world trade, the contribution of 
exports to growth is fore
cast to decrease in 2012 
before rebounding in 2013, when the Slovak 
economy is projected to benefit from a cyclical lift 

as the global economic outlook improves and 

uncertainties about the recovery fade out. 
 Domestic demand subdued in 2011
-12 but 
expected
 to pi
ck up in 2013
 Domestic demand has remained virtually flat in 

2011, as moderate investment growth has been 

offset by a combination of stagnant household 

consumption and a significant contraction in 
government spending, both partly reflecting the  

majo
r fiscal consolidation effort the authorities 
embarked on. As the measures to reduce the deficit 

in 2011 affect almost exclusively disposable 

income of households, the period of sluggish 

income growth is set to continue, putting a drag on 
growth.

forecast
 Households are expected to show near
-stagnant 
consumption growth of around ½% in 2012, in line 
with trends in real disposable income. In 2013 

private consumption should increase more 

signif
icantly, by 1.3%, as the broader economic 
sentiment and outlook improves and the 

combination of a moderate rebound in the labour 

market and relatively benign inflation support 

disposable income.
 Gross fixed capital formation is the only 
component of domest
ic demand expected to still 
contribute positively to growth in 2011. 
Profitability of non
-financial corporations has 
remained among the highest in the EU, propping 

up investment. However, from the second half of 

2011 onwards both domestic business and fore
ign 
direct investment will be weak, reflecting adverse 
financial conditions and uncertainty on the demand 
side, in particular as regards external demand, 

although a rebound is expected in 2013.
 By contrast, investment in construction is forecast 

to hold up
 under the assumption that long
-planned 
public investment projects in infrastructure are 

implemented in 2012 and 2013, also reflecting an 

acceleration of drawing on EU funds. This 

notwithstanding, private investment in housing, 

which had significantly cont
ributed to growth in 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   158 the years preceding the crisis, is expected to 
remain subdued in 2012 and to only gradually 

return to grow in volume terms in 2013. This is 

likely in view of the broader slowdown in 
economic activity, generally lower post
-crisis 
cross
-border investment in real estate and reduced 
household demand given continuing financial 
uncertainty.
 After a hike in 2011, HICP inflation is forecast to 
moderate
 After two years of historically low price increases 
below 1%, HICP inflation is forecast to s
pike at 
4% in 2011. The main reasons are the steep 

increase in energy and commodity prices at the 
beginning of the year, the adjustment of regulated 
prices and the increase of some excises and 

indirect taxes, notably the hike of 1 pp. in the VAT 

standard r
ate. Downward pressures on oil and 
commodity prices for 2012 and 2013 should 

significantly lower imported inflation over the 

forecast horizon. As the effect of consolidation 

measures on prices also fades out, the projected 
marked slowdown of economic activ
ity in 2012 
should also contribute to reducing core inflation to 
2%, while overall HICP inflation is forecast at 

1.7%. Headline inflation is expected to reach about 

2% in 2013, sustained by a recovery in domestic 

demand and further increases in administere
d 
prices. This forecast does not include the effect of 
additional consolidation measures currently under 
discussion but not yet approved. 
 Labour market improves in 2011 but risks 
worsen in 2012 After the disruption brought by the 2008
-09 crisis, 
the labou
r market has shown signs of recovery in 
the first half of 2011. But the labour market is 
expected to stall going forward and only 
moderately advance towards the end of the 

forecast horizon. 
 Given that 
a siz
eable and permanent productivity
-oriented adjustm
ent in the labour market had 
already taken place at the firm level in the wake of 

the crisis,
 the forecast assumes that adjustments in 
2012 will initially mainly take place in the form of 

fewer hours worked, rather than a further reduction 

in headcount emp
loyment. Against this 
background, measures favouring internal 

flexibility may prove particularly effective in 2012 
as the economic outlook is expected to improve in 
2013. On the other hand, due to labour hoarding, 
the expected employment gains associated w
ith the 
projected cyclical rebound will also be moderate.
 Over the forecast horizon economic growth is set 
to remain well below the high levels historically 
associated with a significant reduction in the 
unemployment rate. Despite the strong 
performance of
 private sector employment, the rate 
of registered unemployed has remained stable 

around a six
-year peak in the first half of 2011. 
With growth in employment expected to stall in 

2012, unemployment 
is forecast to remain high 

and to slightly increase 
in the
 second half of 2011. 
New secondary school graduates not continuing in 

education will enter a tight labour market at a time 

of slowing growth and youth unemployment of 

above 30%, more than 10 pps. higher than the pre
-crisis level. 
 Public finances consolid
ation under way
 The export
-based rebound of the economy in 2010 
did not translate into higher government revenues. 

In combination with higher
-than
-budgeted 
expenditure and extraordinary expenditure for 
floods, this led to the general government deficit 
rem
aining at a high level. In the 2011 autumn EDP 
notification the 2010 deficit was 
revised 

downwards
 by 0.2
 pp. to 
7.7
% of GDP
.   In 2011 the consolidation measures adopted by the 
government placed somewhat more emphasis on 
the expenditure side than the reve
nue side. 
Expenditure measures featured a reduction of the 

public sector wage bill and intermediate 

consumption as well as increase in efficiency of 

healthcare and capital spending (e.g. through a 

requirement to publish public tenders online). 
Revenue side
 measures included a 1 pp. 
hike in the 
VAT rate and broadening of the base for personal 
income tax and social contributions, all of which 

amounted to some 1% of GDP. In addition to these 

consolidation measures there are several 
developments with a deficit
-increasing impact of 
about 1% of GDP in total, e.g. increased costs 
related to restructuring of railway companies; 

higher
-than
-budgeted transfers to healthcare 
providers. These are, however, broadly offset by 

developments with a deficit
-decreasing impact, 
notably higher
-than
-budgeted dividend income, 
lower co
-financing of EU projects, and lower
-than
-budgeted pension expenditure. Methodological 

revisions in the autumn of 2011 required that the

forecast
 In view of the upcoming early elections in Mar
ch 
2010, implementation in particular of expenditure
-reducing measures is uncertain as the current 
government budget proposal has so far not been 

adopted by the Parliament. The envisaged 

restrictions on growth in the public wage bill 
through a freeze of wa
ge costs at the central 
government level and a further reduction of 
intermediate consumption may hence not 

materialise. Moreover, there are further negative 
risks of expenditure slippages such as possible 
overspending of municipalities. The forecast takes 

into account sufficiently specified measures, in 
particular an increase of excise duties on cigarettes 
and a broadening of the corporate income tax base. 

Growth will be tax
-weak as most of it is expected 
to come from external demand and investment, 

with mo
re heavily taxed private consumption 
remaining flat. Coupled with the continued 
increase of expenditure, this is expected to result in 
a reduction of the deficit to just below 5% of GDP 

in 2012. Under the no
-policy
-change assumption 
for 2013, the deficit i
s projected to stabilise at 5% 
of GDP. Over the entire forecast period the 

structural balance is expected to improve slightly.
 The debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue 
increasing over the forecast period, reaching some 
51% of GDP in 2013, more than 2
0 pps. higher 
compared to 2008. 
Debt projections also include 
the impact of guarantees to the EFSF and the 

participation in the capital of the ESM as planned 

on the cut
-off date of the forecast. 
  25. FINLAND
 Economic recovery slowing 
but public finances stable
  160 Strong recovery in GDP after the crisis
 Finland's export
-reliant economy proved highly 
sensitive to the collapse in global demand in 2009, 
with GDP falling by an unprecedented 8% in that 

year. The subsequent rebound in GDP has also
 been rapid, with GDP expanding by 3.6% in 2010 

and continuing strongly in the first half of 2011. 

GDP grew by just under 4% y
-o-y in the first half 
of 2011 on the basis of quarterly growth of 0.3% 

and 0.6% in the first and second quarter 

respectively.
 The
 strong economic activity in 2010 and 2011 
was driven by both a rebound in exports and a 

rapid recovery in domestic demand (notably 

household consumption and investment). 

Household consumption growth has accelerated 

from 2.7% in 2010 to over 4% y
-o-y in th
e first 
half of 2011, driven by demand for transport 

vehicles and consumer durables. Despite a sharp 

decline in consumer confidence over the course of 

2011, with the latest reading from September 

already well below the long
-term average, the 
latest retail 
trade reading (from August) still 
showed robust growth. The resilience of 
consumption expenditure appears to be influenced 

by the strength of the labour market, rising wages 

and a decline in the saving rate (after a temporary 

rise over the 2009 crisis). Ho
useholds also benefit 
from low interest rates, with a vast majority of 

mortgage loans tied to the variable EURIBOR rate.
 House prices and construction volumes have 

continued to increase in the first half of 2011, 

albeit more slowly than over 2010 when acti
vity 
rebounded from the trough in 2009. 
Taking
 account of the weakening in consumer confidence 
and the projected slowdown in activity, the 
housing market is expected to cool further over the 

forecast period. The latest data on residential 

building permits 
and construction starts indicates a 

stabilisation of residential construction volumes in 

positive territory close to the current level, 

suggesting that the expected cooling of the housing 
market will be gradual. Business investment is 
forecast to decelerat
e, but remain in marginally 
positive territory, upheld by replacement 

investment needs
 after the extended low point in 
2009-10. While in 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011 

export volumes rebounded by over 10% in year
-on-year terms, trade stalled in the 
second quarter 
of 2011. Of the main industry sectors, the 

electronics and paper industries have shown the 

weakest performance, whereas mining, chemicals, 
basic metals and the machinery industry have been 
leading growth. While exports of goods increased, 

exports of services declined significantly in the 
first half of 2011. This is most likely partly 

explained by a Finnish flagship company Nokia, 

which is downsizing its locally developed 
software.
 The shift towards domestic
-demand
-driven 
growth is set to cont
inue  In spite of the rapid rebound, GDP volume is 
expected to surpass the pre
-crisis peak of 2008 
only in 2012
-13. While household consumption 
volume has already exceeded its pre
-crisis level,
 export volumes are forecast to remain below the 

peak even in 2
013. The Finnish economic 
structure, traditionally heavily reliant on industry 

and its export performance, has been shifting 

towards services and domestic demand over the 

past decade, with the 
trend 
picking up
 in the past 
years. Nevertheless, as the share 
of industry in the 

Finnish economy is still well above the euro
-area 
average, GDP continues to be relatively sensitive 

to external demand conditions.
 The global economic slowdown and ongoing 

structural changes within some of the main Finnish 
industries wil
l weigh on exports in 2012 and 2013. 
As imports will be boosted by relatively buoyant 

domestic demand, the external sector is not 

forecast to add significantly to growth over the 

forecast period. Despite the rise in global 

uncertainty, short
-term leading i
ndicators for 
export growth, industrial new orders and 

production growth even rebounded somewhat in 

August,
 although growth appears low compared to 
the brisk recovery period in 2010. This suggests 

that the growth momentum for goods exports will 

slow in the
 short term. In the longer term, the 
projected gradual improvement in global sentiment 
should back the resumption of recovery in exports. 
However, the current account is stay close to 

balance over the forecast period, contrasting with 

the previous decade w
hen the surplus averaged 
5% 
of GDP
 (although already on a declining trend).

forecast
 While Finland has preserved its solid economic 
fundamentals (healthy financial sector, stro
ng public finances, resilient labour market), continued 

uncertainty in global financial markets is likely to 
eventually take its toll on growth. Quarter
-on-quarter GDP growth is forecast to decelerate to 
marginally above zero in the fourth quarter of 2011 

and the first half of 2012. In line with the forecast 

gradual recovery in the global economic outlook, 

GDP growth is expected to pick up thereafter. 

However, taking account of the weakening of the 
growth potential of the Finnish economy due to its 
declinin
g working
-age population, the recovery 
will be more subdued than in previous recovery 

cycles, with annual GDP growth expected to reach 

slightly below 2% in 2013.
 Labour market is set to remain 
relatively strong
 Labour market developments have been positive
 in 
the first half of 2011, with unemployment 

declining from 8.5% in the second quarter of 2010 

to 7.9% in the same period in 2011. In spite of 
slowing economic growth, both employment and 
unemployment are expected to continue to 

improve marginally in 2012
 and 2013, given that 
the trend decline in employment in industry is 

compensated by services. 
 The Finnish labour market is confronted with a 

notable demographic shock. Due to the retirement 

of a large baby
-boom generation, the working
-age 
population is pr
ojected to decline by over 5% of 
the current labour force by the end of the decade. 

Beyond 2020, this demographic shift will level off. 
By 2013 the decline in working age population is 
expected to start affecting the labour market more 

forcefully; unemploy
ment rates are likely to fall 

even in a context of lower employment growth.
 Risks arising from the global outlook
 Similarly to 2008
-09, trade remains the primary 
transmission channel of global economic shocks, 

which would in turn suppress domestic confiden
ce 
and investment activity.
 The Finnish financial 
system is assessed in both domestic and 

international stress tests as being on a strong 
footing and thus unlikely to act as a drag on 
growth.
 Although the share of exports in GDP has declined 

in the afterma
th of the 2008
-09 crisis, Finland's 
small and open economy is still highly dependent 

on external demand. Finnish exports have a bias 
towards investment goods and are therefore 
dependent on global investment conditions in 

emerging markets and in Europe. Sho
uld the 
potential global risk scenarios materialise, growth 

in Finland would be strongly affected, as was the 

case in 2008
-09. However, given that the main 
export industries have had time to adjust to volatile 

global demand (while in 2008 the depth of the 
shock was unexpected and the economy was 
entering the recession from a cyclical peak), GDP 

is not expected to be as sensitive as in 2009.
 Prices stabilising in 2012
-13 HICP inflation picked up considerably in the first 

nine months of 2011, averaging 3.4%, 
also boosted 

by tax rises on energy, VAT and excises on 

alcohol, tobacco and sugar, which are estimated to 
have contributed ½ pp. to annual inflation. Recent 
falls in global energy and food prices have not yet 

translated into a decrease in inflation, but a
re 

expected to drive down inflation in the fourth 

quarter of 2011. The government has decided on 

further increases in taxes on alcohol, tobacco, 
sweets, energy, cars and some services from 2012, 
which are estimated to add almost 1
 pp. to inflation 
in 2012.
 However, as base effects from elevated 
commodity prices fade, HICP inflation is 

nevertheless forecast to decline from 
the peak of 

3.2% in 2011 to 2.6% in 2012 and further to 1.8% 
in 2013. Relatively high inflation has led to a decrease in 
real earnings de
spite rises in nominal wages. This 

complicates the new rounds of wage negotiations 

as employee demands for wage growth have 
increased.
 Wage growth, which is settled by 
multiannual collective agreements and is in the 
short term relatively insensitive to swi
ngs in 
output, is set to remain relatively robust. 

Nevertheless, second
-round inflation effects are

 Public deficit forecast to settle at 
slightly over 
½% of GDP in 2012
-13 A buoyan
t economic recovery and discretionary 
tax increases of about 0.7% of GDP have boosted 

public finances in 2011, with the general 

government deficit forecast to decline from 2.5% 
of GDP in 2010 to 1% of GDP in 2011. On 
5 October the government announced its 
budget 
proposal for 2012 and the medium
-term spending 
limits extending until 2015. The government plans 

a wide range of both increases and decreases to 

various revenue and expenditure items, aiming to 
shift taxation from direct to indirect taxation and 
inc
rease social spending while cutting 
administrative expenditure and transfers to local 

governments (the latter is technically neutral in 

terms of direct impact on the consolidated general 

government finances, but might indirectly induce 

budget consolidation
 at the local governments). At 
the general government level, the consolidated 

measures foreseen in the budget proposal improve 
public finances in 2012 by 0.5% of GDP on 
account of revenue measures. For 2013, based on 

measures detailed in the spending limit
s decision, 
the current forecast includes revenue
-based 
consolidation measures worth about 0.3% of GDP 
and expenditure side consolidation of 0.2% of 
GDP. Some additional tax measures will likely be 
detailed over the course of 2012 and included in 

the 2013 
budget in due course.
 Fiscal policy is estimated to be 
broadly neutral in
 2012-13, as the consolidation effort by the central 
government is partly offset by the somewhat looser 

aggregate fiscal position at the municipal level and 

by a projected rise in deb
t-servicing costs in 2013. 
Even though the general government debt level 
has 
been 
increasing relatively quickly
 since the 2009 
global crisis brought public finances into deficit
, a rise in 
debt
 servicing costs 
was averted 
by 
exceptionally low effective int
erest 
rates on 
Finnish sovereign debt
. The forecast assumes a 
normalisation of interest costs in 
2013 towards the 
long
-term average, adding to expenditure growth
 in that year. The general government deficit is 

projected to settle to 0.7% of GDP in 2012
-13. The 
debt ratio is forecast to climb from 49.1% of GDP 

in 2011 to 53.5% of GDP in 2013. 
Debt 

projections also include the impact of guarantees 

to the EFSF, and the participation in the capital of 

the ESM as planned on the cut
-off date of
 the 
forecast.
  26. SWEDEN
 Growth to decelerate amid rising uncertainty
  163 Growth shifting to a lower gear
 After growing by 5.6% in 2010 the Swedish 
economy continued its rapid reco
very in the first 
half of 2011, recording an average quarterly 

growth rate of slightly below 1% q
-o-q. Most 
sectors of the economy contributed to this 

performance, with household consumption and 

investment showing particular strength. Although 

retail sales
 have had a difficult year of 2011 so far, 
household consumption has held up well thanks to 

brisk sales of durable consumer goods such as cars 
in the first half of the year. Over the summer, 
however, increased uncertainty regarding 

sovereign risk in the eu
ro area and its implications 

for economic growth sapped business and 

consumer confidence, which has fallen sharply to 

levels usually observed in connection with very 

slow or even negative output growth. In addition, 
the stock market also fell by some 20% o
ver the 
summer. Hard data for the third quarter are 
sending mixed messages, with industrial 

production and new orders on a slightly declining 

path, while the production of services is still 

holding up well.  
 Recovery hampered by weak housing and 
credit ma
rkets
 The end of 2011 and early 2012 are likely to be 
characterised by stagnation. Investment is forecast 

to contract somewhat as the weaker growth 

outlook and higher financing costs discourage new 
investment. The spread between an investment
-grade corpora
te bond and a similarly
-rated 
government bond has reached levels not seen since 
mid
-2009. The inventory cycle is also expected to 
turn once again, with a negative contribution to 

growth in 2012.
 The outlook for export growth in 2012 is also 

rather subdued,
 as a number of trading partners are 
weighed down by the fallout from the sovereign
- debt crisis. Private consumption should also grow 

less briskly, with household spending held back by 

bleaker employment prospects and higher 
perceived uncertainty, includi
ng regarding house 
prices. Some relief is expected from a more 
accommodative monetary policy stance and 

stronger real wage developments, whereas fiscal 

policy is not expected to do much to boost demand 

in the short term. 
 To the extent that sovereign
-debt 
concerns are 
expected to abate in the second half of 2012, a 

gradual recovery is likely to get underway and gain 

some traction in 2013. However, some lingering 

uncertainty and the effects of fiscal retrenchment 

in many trade
-partner countries are likely to
 keep 
external demand fairly muted. On the domestic 
side, household consumption should gain support 
from improving consumer confidence and wage 

growth, although weak employment growth and a 

more subdued housing market are likely to have a 

dampening effect.
 Investment activity is likely to 
pick up after a fairly weak 2012, when housing 
investment in particular slows down significantly. 
Overall, GDP is expected to grow by 4.0%, 1.4% 

and 2.1% in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.

 Unusually large risks 
to baseline scenario
 Given the concerns regarding the resolution of 

sovereign
-debt problems and the pace of 
deleveraging in large indebted economies, the 
degree of uncertainty is particularly
 large at this 
juncture. On the upside, given the very high saving 
rate among Swedish households, private 

consumption could turn out stronger than expected 

even under a moderate wage and employment 

growth scenario. On the downside, a more 
pronounced correc
tion in the housing market could 
weigh on growth as households cut spending to 
rebuild their asset position and housing investment 

growth slows down further. Swedish household 

indebtedness is at historically high levels, as a 

consequence of a more
-than
-dec
ade
-long mortgage 
borrowing boom. This makes Swedish households 
very sensitive to mortgage rate hikes. The recently 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   164 observed trend towards wider spreads between the 
repo rate and the actual rate facing mortgage 

borrowers could squeeze household purchasing 

power even when monetary policy remains in an 
accommodative mode.

 Although the exposure of the banking sector to the 
mortgage market has increa
sed, defaults on 

mortgages are extremely rare in Sweden. The 

banking sector relies strongly, however, on short
-term market financing in foreign currency. 

Renewed global financial market turmoil could 
thus quickly translate into rising financing costs 
for S
wedish banks. If banks were to 
pass these 
higher costs of funding on to their customers
, the 
more costly 
debt
 servic
ing
 would force households 
and corporations to rein in consumption and 

investment. At the same time, heavy reliance of 

Swedish banks on shor
t-term funding could lead to 
liquidity shortages and constraints on the supply of 

credit, which would dampen domestic demand 

even further. 
 Decline in unemployment to pause
 Strong employment growth since late 2009 

brought employment back to its pre
-crisis 
level 
already by mid
-2011. Since labour supply has 
grown strongly in parallel
, the unemployment rate 
has only retraced half of its previous rise, falling 
from a peak of about 9% to 7.
2% by 
September
 2011 in seasonally
-adjusted terms.
 Companies' 
hiring plan
s point 
to continued growth in 
employment in the months ahead, although at a 
slower pace. Sub
-par growth is expected to result 
in meagre job creation over the forecast horizon, 
limit
ing further declines in the unemployment rate, 
which is expected to remain
 at around 7.3% in 
2013. There is some uncertainty as to the net effect 
on potential labour supply of hysteresis effects 

following the last recession, on the one hand
, and
 the impact of various reforms aimed at increasing 
labour supply
, on the other
. Over 
the coming months, a new round of 
wage 
bargaining 
will take place, which will set the scene 
for wage developments for large swathes of the 
Swedish work force. As 
labour market conditions 
are currently much tighter th
an was the case when 
the 
expiring agreem
ents were 
concluded in 2010
, the new agreements are likely to result in 
somewhat higher agreed pay increases in 2012 and 
2013. However, the still
-low labour utilisation rate 
and the expected economic slowdown should keep 

overall wage growth stable at 2.7% 
per year due to 
weaker wage drift.
 Inflation stable below the target 
 Inflation 
has remained below 2% in 2011 despite 
rising food and oil prices. The impact of high 

commodity prices has been moderated by 
strong 
currency appreciation 
which continued 
until s
pring 
2011. At the same time, low core inflation 
(HICP 

excluding energy and unprocessed food)
 reflects 
subdued
 unit labour costs
, stemming from 
reasonable 
productivity
 growth
 and 
modest 
wage 
increases
.  Looking forward, underlying inflation is 
expected 

to 
pick up slightly 
as the effects of the appreciation 
of the krona fade out and unit labour costs increase 

along with decelerating productivity. The increase 

in core inflation 
is foreseen to be offset by 
minimal
 energy and food price increases reflecting sli
ghtly 
declining 
commodity price
s for both 2012 and 
2013. As a result of these opposing forces, 
annual 
HICP 
inflation is forecast to remain relatively 
stable over the forecast horizon at around 1.5%, 

rising towards 2% at the end of 2013. 
 The changes in ind
irect taxes foreseen for 2012 are 
expected to have a neutral effect on inflation. The 
VAT reduction for restaurant and catering services 
from 25% to 12% is estimated to reduce headline 

inflation by 0.2 pp. This effect will be 

counterbalanced by an increase
 in the excise tax on 
tobacco and indexing of energy taxes.

surplus target
. Households
, which have recorded significant 
surpluses 
due to ample pension savings
, are 
assumed to further increase th
eir savings in the 
short
-run in response to the overall economic 
uncertainty and 
declining real house prices
. The 
corporate sector 
is likely to continue to record 
a positive trade balance 
based 
on a competitive 
advantage
 and siz
eable surpluses on the incom
e balance sup
ported by extensive profit repatriation
. As a result, the current
-account surplus
 is forecast 
to 
remain relatively stable over the forecast period 
at about 6
-6.5% of GDP.
  Prudent fiscal policy to keep public finances in 
surplus 
 With the stro
ng recovery, general government net 
lending improved in 2010, posting a small surplus 
of 0.2% of GDP. This is expected to strengthen 

further to around 1% of GDP in 2011 as a result of 

still buoyant employment growth having a positive 

impact on tax revenues
. As a percentage of GDP, 
however, revenues are likely to decrease 

somewhat, partly due to tax cuts for 
pensioners
. The expenditure ratio is expected to fall more 

markedly due to the phasing
-out of temporary 
support to municipalities, scaling
-back of labou
r market measures and lower sick
-leave payments 
resulting from previous reforms.
 As a result of the 
deceleration of growth and new discretionary 

measures being introduced as part of the 2012 

Budget Bill, the surplus is likely to shrink 

somewhat next year t
o around 0.7% of GDP. The 
main expansionary measures contained in the 
Budget Bill presented in September are a halving 
of the VAT rate for restaurant and catering 

services, extra funding for infrastructure 
investment and a package of active labour market 
measures. Overall, the Bill contains measures of 
about 0.5
% of GDP
. However, the fiscal stance is 
likely to be neutral, as some previous measures are 

expiring. 
 The structural balance is expected to be fairly 

stable at slightly below 1% of GDP over the 

fore
cast period.
 With growth picking up in 2013, 
the headline surplus is expected to widen again. 

Thanks to this, and planned privatisation receipts 

of about 0.5% of GDP per year over the forecast 

period, gross public debt is expected to fall 

gradually from al
most 40% of GDP in 2010 to 
around 
32½% of
 GDP in 2013
. 27. THE UNITED KINGDOM
 The pause in growth risks becoming prolonged
  166 Growth slows as external events incre
ase 
uncertainty
 After 
a promising start to 2010, the UK economic 
outlook has deteriorated significantly since the turn 
of the year.
 Output in the second quarter of 2011 
was just 0.6% higher than in the same quarter of 
2010. Quarterly output did not grow at
 all in the 
three quarters to the second quarter of 2011, 
remaining 4.4% below its pre
-crisis peak. This 
puts the UK's recovery performance well behind 

its major peers.
 Much of this weakness can be traced back to 

household consumption, which has contracted
 for 
four successive quarters. Households spent 6.4% 

less in the second quarter of 2011 than at the pre
-
crisis peak in the fourth quarter of 2007. Survey 

indicators suggest that this weakness will continue, 

with consumer confidence as measured by the 
Commi
ssion's Business and Consumer survey 
having fallen sharply since May 2011 to below its 
average for 2008 and 2009, although still well 

above its January 2009 trough. Overall economic 

sentiment, as measured by the Economic 

Sentiment Indicator, has also decli
ned sharply 
since May, having risen above its long
-term 
average in the early part of the year.
 On the output side, while the manufacturing 

sector's strong recovery has faltered recently, 

services sector performance has strengthened 

during 2011, growing 0.7
% and 0.2% in the first 
two quarters respectively. Without the growth 
contribution from services, the economy would 

have contracted in both quarters. However, it 

seems unlikely that this stronger services 

performance will be maintained. Confidence in the 

sector appears to have declined even more sharply 
than in the rest of the economy over recent months. 

Domestic consumption and financial services 

exports, the two main sources of demand for 

services, also appear likely to remain subdued.
 Net exports and cor
porate investment remain the 
best hopes for a return to stronger growth although 
the prospects for both are mixed. On the export 
side, the Bank of England's announcement in 

October that it would increase the size of its 

quantitative easing programme should
 help prevent 
any substantial appreciation in sterling, protecting 

exporters' price competitiveness. Weak domestic 
demand should also hold back import growth. 

However, the external sector's growth contribution 

has remained volatile; it contributed 1.4 pps.
 q-o-q in the first quarter of 2011 but subtracted 0.3 pp. in 

the second quarter. Weakness in the euro area, the 

UK's main export market, will hold back external 

demand at least in the short term. As regards 
corporate investment, the sector's large financi
al 
surplus, the government's announcement that it 
will explore options to use its own balance sheet to 

support corporate debt issuance and highly 

expansionary monetary policy all provide reasons 

for optimism. However, weak demand prospects 
are likely to ma
ke firms cautious about investing 
and ongoing stress in the banking sector will 
continue to hamper credit availability.

The United Kingdom - Output gap 
and contributions to GDP growth
 In all, this yields an uncertain out
look. The 

slowdown which began at the end of 2010 now 

looks more like a prolonged soft patch than a 

simple weather
-related blip. Risks from the euro
-area sovereign
-debt markets and the banking sector 
heighten this uncertainty. As such a contraction in 

GDP 
in at least one of the next few quarters cannot 
be ruled out. However, the outlook for corporate 

investment and net exports still appears positive 

enough to justify a forecast of modest positive 

growth with the economy expanding by 0.7% in 

2011, 0.6% in 20
12 and 1.5% in 2013. The 
substantial downward revision from the spring 
forecast is explained mainly by the bleaker outlook 

for household consumption, corporate investment 

and exports, offset partially by slower expected 

import growth.
 Member States, The United Kingdom
   167 Is the net exports re
bound finally with us?
 Hopes of an imminent growth impetus from the 
external sector have been a feature of many UK 

economy forecasts ever since world trade started to 

recover with sterling remaining well below pre
-crisis exchange rates. 
Recent data revisio
ns 
suggest that the external sector has made a more 
significant contribution to UK growth than first 
thought. 
However, s
trong data on export orders 
suggest 
the export rebound may still have further 
to go
. The surge in import growth which 
accompanied the UK
's exit from recession has 
evaporated with imports falling in both the first 

two quarters of 2011. Weak consumption growth 
and the ending of the acceleration in stock building 
are likely to keep import growth weak or negative 

throughout the forecast period
. While exports also fell in the second quarter, this 

followed four consecutive quarters of expansion. 

The outlook for exports is clouded by uncertainty 

in the global economy and particularly in the euro 
area. Given the worsening external conditions, 
forec
ast export growth has been revised down 
significantly since the spring forecast. However, 

with the exchange rate likely to remain 

competitive following the Bank of England's 

decision to undertake more quantitative easing 

firms should have a continuing ince
ntive to 
explore new foreign markets. With hindsight it is 

not surprising that an increase in the resources 

devoted to export markets has been slow to 

materialise given economic uncertainty and 

restricted credit availability, but the longer the 

exchange ra
te remains at its current level, the 
greater should be firms' confidence that a sudden 

appreciation is not imminent. As such, the forecast 

is for modest export growth to exceed weak import 

growth, with the external sector contributing 

positively in all thr
ee years of the forecast.
 Consumption and investment yield weaker 
outlook for domestic demand
 It has been clear for some time that domestic 
demand growth in the coming years would be 

weak. With government consumption falling, 

consumers struggling with fall
ing real incomes and 
the stock cycle having peaked, the only bright spot 

on the horizon was business investment which is 

overdue a rebound after its unprecedented collapse 

during the recession.
 The surprise has been the degree of weakness in 
household cons
umption, which was 1.7% lower in 
the second quarter of 2011 than in the same period 
in 2010. During 2010, as the household saving rate 

fell steadily from its crisis peak it appeared that 

households were eschewing additional saving in 

favour of maintaining 
reservation levels of 
consumption as falling real wages pushed down 
their disposable incomes. However, this trend now 

appears to be going into reverse. Households could 
be becoming more cautious as the risk of 
unemployment heightens. The partial reversal o
f the 2010 housing market recovery could also have 

discouraged households from relying on house 

price rises as a means to increase net worth. 

Finally, while household debt has fallen as a 

percentage of GDP since 2009, it remains well 
above the EU average, 
implying a continuing 
incentive for households to deleverage. The 

increasing certainty that interest rates will remain 

at record lows for a significant period is the only 

compensating factor. Given that these conditions 

are likely to persist, consumption i
s forecast to 

remain very subdued with a strong possibility of 

further quarterly contractions around the turn of 
the year. With real wages forecast to return to at 
least modest growth, this implies a continuing 

increase in the household saving rate.
 This l
eaves business investment likely to be the 
only significant support to domestic demand. With 

investment as a share of GDP having fallen to 
around 14% of GDP in the aftermath of the crisis, 
compared to a long
-run average of 17%, a 
significant recovery seems
 likely at some point if 
only to keep up with depreciation. What remains 

uncertain is the timing. The sharp fall in 

investment in the first quarter of 2011 is likely to 
push its annual growth rate into negative territory, 
barring a significant rebound in t
he last two 
quarters. Whether this represents a one
-off reverse 
or a more persistent malaise is as yet unclear. On 

the one hand, low real and nominal interest rates 

(which should go even lower once credit easing 
and increased quantitative easing are 
implem
ented), the huge corporate sector surplus 
and the need for further investment to maintain the 

existing capital stock should all push investment 

higher. However, on the other hand, continued 

problems with access to credit for some firms, 
uncertain prospects
 for domestic and external 
demand and lower capacity utilisation seem to 
offer a strong incentive to firms to wait and see 

before committing to large scale capital spending. 

On balance, this yields a forecast of moderate 

investment growth with the level re
maining well 
below pre
-crisis peaks.
 European Economic Forecast, Autu
mn 2011
   168 Employment: can private sector growth offset 
public sector cuts?
 The most concrete signal that the slowdown in the 
recovery had begun to impact the labour market 

came through data showing that unemployment 
increased fro
m 7.7% over the period March
-May 
2011 to 8.1% for June
-August. This was its highest 
level since 1996. Over the past year, the labour 

market has been characterised by strong falls in 
public sector employment offset by modest private 

sector growth. Because i
t accounts for 80% of 
employment, a small percentage growth rate in the 

private sector can offset a much bigger percentage 

fall in public sector employment. However, it 

appears that in the three months to August, private 
sector growth was insufficient to a
chieve this.
 The speed of the reduction in public sector jobs 
has been surprising. Excluding the impact of the 

state
-owned banks, it fell by 228 000, or 3.8%, in 
the year to June 2011. This already equates to 

around half the total job cuts which the Office
 for 
Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated would be 
necessary to deliver the government's spending 
reduction targets over the period to 2014
-15.(73) To 
the extent that this represents an unexpected 

frontloading of the planned job cuts, it should 

improve the
 employment outlook since fewer cuts 
can be expected later on. However, it could also 

imply that government departments are 

implementing a higher
-than
-expected share of the 
cuts through job losses rather than cuts to other 

spending. In that case, the emplo
yment outlook 
could be worse than previously thought. Both 
explanations probably have some validity. 
However, once falling private sector employment 

intentions are also taken into account the overall 

employment outlook does appear markedly worse. 

As such, 
unemployment is forecast to rise to 8.7% 

in 2012 before falling back to 8.6% in 2013.
 Stronger monetary stimulus but credit growth 
remains weak
 In spite of the extraordinary monetary stimulus 
provided by the Bank of England (interest rates at 

0.5% and quan
titative easing increased from GBP 
200 bn to GBP 275 bn, or 19% of GDP), net 
lending to business has remained mainly negative. 
Some positive signs may be starting to emerge. 

Net lending by UK banks to UK businesses was 

positive in August, only the fourth p
ositive month 
                                                           (73) Here and throughout 20xx/xx refers t
o the UK financial 
year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
 since January 2009, although three
-month and 
annual net lending remained negative. 

Furthermore, data suggest that in the first half of 

the year UK banks met their targets for increased 
lending to businesses agreed under the Project 
Merlin ini
tiative. The government's plans for credit 
easing should further support net lending. 

However, if this does represent the start of a 

recovery in net lending it will be severely tested in 

its early days. A peak in maturities of UK banks' 

debt in the fourth 
quarter of 2011, coupled with 

heightened risk aversion and tighter liquidity 

conditions as a result of the distress in some euro
-area sovereign
-debt markets will test banks' 
already fragile will to lend. As such, any recovery 

in business lending seems like
ly to be reliant on a 
degree of government support.
 Inflation: still high but still likely to fall
 The short
-term outlook for inflation has worsened 
somewhat over recent months, with 
household
 energy price
s pushing the annual rate to 5.2% in 
September
. How
ever, while the upward shock to 
inflation, driven by VAT rises, commodity price 

increases 
and sterling depreciation, has lasted long 
enough to stretch the definition of "temporary" 

right to its limit
, the case for believing that 
inflation will fall sharply
 in 2012 remains as strong 
as ever. While average earnings growth ticked up 
in the three months to July 2011, it fell back again 
sharply in August, in line with the generally 

weaker labour market picture, continuing to show 

an absence of second round effec
ts from the price 

shock. Furthermore, the circumstances which have 

driven inflation so high over the past eighteen 

months look unlikely to be repeated. While sterling 
may weaken slightly in response to looser 
monetary policy, a further fall on the scale se
en in 

2008 and 2009 seems highly unlikely. Weakness in 

the global economy makes any sharp increases in 

world commodity prices improbable and all of the 
announced VAT rises have now been 
implemented. Inflation is therefore forecast to fall 

to 2.9% in 2012 a
nd 2.0% in 2013.
 Continuing commitment to fiscal consolidation
 Despite the downturn in both the global economy 

and the outlook for the UK, the government has 

maintained its strong commitment to fiscal 

consolidation. Recently published outturn data for 
2010/11 produced a positive surprise with the 
deficit estimated at 9.6%, below the 9.9% forecast 

in the March 2011 budget. The main sources of the

      169 lower
-than
-expected deficit were methodological 
changes and upward revisions to GDP. 
 Recent data have shown gove
rnment revenues to 
be slightly below their forecast levels. However 
government consumption has been lower than 
expected leaving overall borrowing lower than 
forecast by the OBR in March 2011. Significant 

improvements in the structural deficit have already 

been delivered, as it fell to 8.3% of GDP in 

2010/11 from 9.8% of GDP in 2009/10. The 

consolidation is forecast to slow slightly in 

2011/12 before picking up again through 2012/13 
and 2013/14. The worsening growth outlook 
implies clear downward risks to th
e latest UK 
official fiscal forecasts published in March. 

However, given that the UK's own fiscal targets 

are assessed in cyclically
-adjusted terms, there will 
be flexibility to accommodate a nominal overshoot 

in the deficit to the extent that the OBR judg
es the 
overshoot to have been driven by cyclical rather 
than structural weakness. The higher deficit 
forecast does imply some risk to the 2014/15 

Excessive Deficit Procedure deadline for reducing 

the deficit below 3% of GDP. However, given the 

uncertainty 
around current growth forecasts it is 
preferable to focus on the structural budget which 

is still forecast to show a strong improvement.
In policy terms, the only change of note since the 

spring forecast has been the decision that central 

government will f
und the extension to 2013 of a 
freeze in the Council Tax collected by local 
authorities. This is estimated to cost GBP 800 
million (0.06% of GDP) and will be funded 
through efficiency savings in other areas.
 Gross debt for 2010/11 was revised up by 3.9 pps
. to 80.6% of GDP, following the inclusion of 
Eurostat's amendments on the treatment of 

financial sector interventions. It is projected to rise 

throughout the forecast period although the rise 
will slow significantly in 2013/14, reflecting the 
lower foreca
st deficit.

suggest a higher growth rate for the third quarter, 

partly thanks to a strong tourist season.
 In spite of improving GDP data the econo
my has

declining trend. The working

of construction works was 11.
2% lower year
-on-year in August. Exports, which had picked up in 

2010, are not a main driver of the economy in 
2011. Real exports were only 1.1% higher year
-on-year
 in the second quarter in spite of relatively 
strong import growth among trading partners. I
f net exports remain the main contributor to GDP 
growth in 2011 (see 
Graph II.28.1
), it is only due 
to declining import volumes which were 6% lower 

year
-on-year
 in the second quarter. This in itself is 
indicative of a still depressed level of economic 

acti
vity.
 Monthly data on industrial production also indicate 

that an economic recovery has not yet materialised. 

The working
-day adjusted volume of industrial 
production 
was
 4.4% 
lower year
-on-year
 in August
 and the trend is pointing downwards. Tourism, on 

the other hand, is providing substantial support for 
the economy in 2011. One important physical 

indicator, the number of foreign tourist arrivals, 

increased 7.6% year

 in the first eight

 A sluggish growth performance
 Although economic activity seems to have 

bottomed 
out
 in the first half of 2011 at 8% below 
the pre
-recession level
, it is unlikely that
 the 
economy will return to even moderately high 
growth in the near
 term.
 The economy is facing 
considerable headwinds on the way to a full 
recovery. W
eak labour
 market c
onditions continue 
to exert downward pressure on incomes and 

spending. The high level of indebtedness of 

households and companies and their need to 
deleverage are weighing on domestic demand.
 Consumer confidence 
seems to suffer
 from 
the 
uncertainties origi
nating in
 the international 
environment.
 Investor confidence has taken a 
severe 
hit
 during the recession and will take some 
time t
o recover.
 On the positive side, EU
 accession
, expected to take place in mid
-2013, should provide a stimulus to investment act
ivity 
over the forecast period.
 Although the banking sector showed resilience 
during
 adverse conditions in recent years, the 
renewed turbulence in international financial 
markets may become a challenge for Croatia's 
foreign
-owned banks
. Maintaining 
financi
al 
stability
 will be 
crucial for a recovery of the real 
economy
. The quality of loan portfolios 
has 
continued to decline in 2011 as
 reflected in a rising 
share of
 non
-performing loans. The government's 
credit 
programmes via
 the Croatian Bank for 
Reconstruc
tion and Development
 and the central 
Candidate Countries, Croatia
   173 bank's provision of additional liquidity to the 
banking sector in March seem to have had only a 

marginal impact on 
overall lending to the 

corporate sector. 
More recently, the central bank 
has withdrawn kuna liquidity fr
om the banking 
sector in the context of downward pressure on the 

kuna's exchange rate vis
-à-vis the euro. The 
downward trend of interest rates for bank loans, 
which persisted through the summer months, is 

therefore unlikely to be maintained. Worsening 

fina
ncing conditions for 
the
 foreign parent banks 
of Croatia's main banks are also likely to result in 

less favourable credit conditions for households 
and businesses.
 The need for fiscal consolidation restricts the room 
for government spending. In the present
 forecast, 
public consumption and investment develop in line 

with the government's current fiscal policy 

strategy. Overall, government spending will only 

contribute marginally to GDP growth.
 Following a disappointing performance and a large 

loss of market 
share in 2011, Croatia's exports are 

projected to accelerate moderately over the 

following two years, but still remain below the 

Croatia's export market growth.
 During the recent 
recession, n
et exports provided a significant offset 
to 
faltering domestic de
mand (see 
Graph II.28.1
). 
This pattern will, to a more limited extent, be 

continued in 2011, particularly because imports are 

still declining. In the following year, when imports 

are projected to increase marginally, the 

contribution of net exports will be
 significantly 
smaller. When investment activity picks up speed 

in 2013, imports will accelerate and net exports 

will subtract from GDP growth just as before the 

recession. 
 The forecast projects 
annual GDP growth of 0.6% 
in 2011. Thereafter, growth is for
ecast to increase 
moderately to 0.8
% in 2012
 and 1.2% in 2013
. Over this three
-year period domestic demand 
gradually replaces net exports as the driver of GDP 

growth. Uncertainties emanating from the 

international banking system and financial markets 
const
itute the major downside risk to this growth 
scenario.
  Current account close to balance
 Croatia's external balances underwent significant 
correction
 in the context of the recent recession. 
Sharply r
educed capital inflows and domestic 
demand resulted 
in mu
ch lower trade and current
-account deficits. In 2010, the la
tter fell to 1.4
% of 
GDP, compared to more than 9% two years earlier. 
 In 2011 the value of imports has started to rise 
again because of higher prices for imported goods 
and services which, in ter
ms of the overall import 
bill, more than offset still declining import 
volumes. Export receipts have also been boosted 
by higher prices. Overall, the external balance of 
goods and services is projected to 
swing 
into 
surplus
 in 2011 for the first time since
 the early 
1990s. However, this improvement is being 

counteracted by a rising deficit on the balance of 

primary incomes and current transfers. 

Consequently, the current
-account deficit is only 
projected to narrow marginally to 1.2% of GDP.
 In 2012, the cur
rent
-account deficit is projected to 
decline to 0.6% of GDP partly because the growth 

of export volumes will again outstrip the growth of 

import volumes in the context of still sluggish 

output growth. Another factor is the assumed 

decline in commodity pric
es which leads to a small 
improvement in Croatia's terms of trade. In 2013, 

when domestic demand strengthens, the current
-account deficit is projected to widen to 1.4% of 

GDP again. The rise in imports in that year is to a 

large extent a reflection of the 
projected pick
-up in 
investment activity.
 Low inflation and high unemployment 
 The recession was associated with a disinflationary 

process 
that
 lowered head
line inflation rate to
 1.1% in 
2010. 
Disinflation was primarily driven by 
growing spare
 resources 
feeding through
 to price
- and wage
-setting. Most prominently, compensation 
of employees declined slightly on an annual 
basis
. 
While domestic inflationary pressures have 

remained subdued in 2011, energy
 prices and other 
commodity prices
 have rebounded. This h
as raised 
headline inflation, i.e. the annual change of the 

consumer price index, to 2.2% in September
 2011. Inflation pressures are expected to remain low 
over 

the forecast horizon. Cost
-push pressures from the 
domestic side shou
ld remain
 insignificant as
 unit 
labour costs 
are projected to be almost flat. There 
should
 be 
no imported inflation
 given the 
assumption of energy and commodity prices 
following a slightly declining trajectory
. There is 
some pent
-up pressure to increase 
administ
ered
 prices
, which t
he government is likely to give in to 
after the upcoming parliamentary elections
. Certain VAT rates may also be hiked in the

 Taking all these factors 
into account, headline
 inflatio
n is forecast to fall 
back to 1.5% in 2011 and to 
rise slightly to 1.7% 
in 2012
. In t
he labour market, a
 turnaround towards
 employment
 growth
 is only expected for 2013
. However, 
the unemployment rate will already peak 
in 2011 because the ongoing shrinking of the 
labour fo
rce will prevent falling employmen
t to be 
converted into a rising unemployment rate in 2012. 

When economic activity picks slightly more 

strongly in 2013, the unemployment rate is 
projected to
 fall to 
12.4%, still 4 pps. higher than 
before the recession. In spite of high
 unemploymen
t, wages
 are expected to
 show
 downward "stickiness"
, though 
more so in 
the
 public sector 
than
 in the private sector.
 A small reduction of the fiscal deficit
 The recent recession put public finances under 
severe pressures, pushing the general government 

deficit up 
to 4.9% of GDP in 2010. The deficit is 
budgeted to increase further to 5.5% in 2011. 
Based on 
fiscal outturns
 in the first three quarters 
of the year, it appears realistic that this target will 
be achieved. For the first time in many years a 

supplementary 
budget is unlikely to be needed.
 Total budgetary revenues are forecast to 
increase 
relatively slowly in 2012 and 2013 given
 the 
projections for private consumption, employment, 
wages and inflation. Total budgetary expenditure
 is are forecast to increase 
in line with 
the 
government's current fis
cal policy strategy.  On 
this basis t
he general government
 deficit 
is 
projected to decline
 to 5.4%
 of GDP
 in 201
2 and 
to 5.2% in 2013. G
eneral go
vernment debt is 
projected
 to increase gradually from 41.2% of 
GDP at th
e end of 2010 to 53.8
% of GDP at the 
end of 2013.
 The fiscal projection
s are
 sensitive to changes in 
the macroeconomic 
environment and to the 
measures that will be taken by the authorities in 
the context of the state budget for 2012, to be 
adopted after th
e upcoming parliamentary 
elections
.    29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV 
REPUBLIC OF MACEDONI
A Catching up, albeit with question marks ...
  175 Post-crisis recovery in 2010 a
nd first half of 2011
 Output growth accelerated markedly during 2010, 
from around 1% y
-o-y in the first half to about 3% 
in the second, bringing annual growth to 1.8%, 

compared to 
-0.9% the year before. In the first half 
of 2011, output growth was at aroun
d 5% y
-o-y. 
The main sources of growth have shifted, from 

external demand in the first half of 2010, to 

investment in the second half of 2010 and the first 

quarter of 2011 and finally to private consumption 

in the second quarter of 2011. However, besides a
 base effect a significant part of the domestic 
recovery appears to reflect public spending, in 

particular in the area of construction but also in the 

form of early transfer payments ahead of general 

elections in June 2011. 
 On the back of strong domestic 
demand, the 
current account deteriorated, from 2.8% of GDP in 
the fourth quarter 2010 to around 4¼% of GDP in  

the second quarter of 2011 (four
-quarter moving 
average). Capital inflows in the form of current 

private transfers were slightly lower in the fir
st 
half of 2011, but the overall level is still high at 
19% of GDP. In March, the government decided to 
use about half of an IMF Precautionary Credit 

Line. As a result, additional funds amounting to 

some 3% of GDP strengthened the country's 

foreign exchang
e reserves.
 The 
central
 government deficit rose from 
-2.5% of 
GDP at the end of 2010 to a full
-year estimate of 
around 
-3½% of GDP in 2011. Revenues rose in 
line with nominal GDP, but spending was slightly 

higher, mainly due to increased capital spending. 

In September 2011, the government adopted a 

supplementary budget, mainly reallocating 
spending in order to meet the 
-2.5% deficit target. 
 Inflation started to decelerate after a peak in May 
2011, coming down to 3.4% y
-o-y in September. 
On average, inflati
on was 4.1% in the first nine 
months, with 
the main drivers being strong rises 
for food, rents but also energy prices.
   Official labour
 market data point to a continued
, albeit decelerated
 increase in overall employment. 
Employment ha
s increased markedly
 in agriculture 
and in the public sector, in particular 
at municipal
 level
. The former 
is 
probably due to 
government 
incentives to register so far unregistered 
employment
. Unemployment continued to drop 
slightly, but still remained high
, affecting one 
third
 of the labour force. 
Youth unemployment 
declined 
to 
some 5
2%.  Graph II.29.1:

 The speed of growth will largely depend on 
domestic f
actors 
 In 
the second half of 
2011, domestically
-driven 
growth impulses are expected to peter out, leading 
to annual GDP 
growth of around 3%. Private 
consumption and investment are likely to be the 

main sources for 
growth, benefiting from 
improved consumer confidence, stable private 

transfers and an improved business environment. 

In 201
2, export market growth is expected to 
decelerate, but thanks to the completion of some 

export
-oriented FDI projects, the country's exports 
are likely to expand in 2012 and 2013. This, 

together with stable private consumption and 

increased investment, will allow the economy to 

grow at 2½% in 20
12 and around 3½% in 2013. 

Inflation is expected to decelerate in 2012, 

following the expected slowdown in prices for 
energy and metals, but 
Œ on the back of stronger 
growth 
Œ to accelerate again in 2013. 
 Employment growth has been rather high 
in recent 
years, 
at 
about 
3% 
a year
. However, a
 significant 
share
 of those additional jobs are probably the 
result of a stricter registration procedure and do not 
necessarily reflect newly created employment. In

      176 view of the 
probably
 still difficult international 
envi
ronment in 201
2-13, the country's potential for 
creating employment or raising real wages will 
remain limited. 
Wage growth is likely to remain 
subdued, given the need to remain externally 

competitive. 
Improving the country's labour 
income thus requires 
rai
sing
 productivity by 
modernising and deepening the capital stock.
   In response to the mainly domestically
-driven 
growth, the current
-account deficit in 2011 is 
likely to rise above 5% of GDP. In 2012 and 2013, 

the surplus in private current transfers is e
xpected 
to decline from its current exceptionally high level 

of nearly 20% of GDP towards its longer term 

average. In 2012, this will keep the current
-account deficit fairly stable despite a slight drop in 

the trade deficit, reflecting weaker domestic 

dema
nd. In 2013, the deceleration of current 
transfers will contribute to the rise in the current
-
account deficit.
  Public finances are likely to remain under 
control 
 Based on the country's track
 record of respecting 
fiscal targets, the forecast expects 
publi
c sector
 deficits to decline from 2
½% of GDP in 20
11 to 
2¼% in 
2012 and 2% in 2013
. The forecast 
expects that in case of spending constraints, the 
authorities will reduce capital spending, as 
has 
happened in the past 
on similar occasions.

 30. ICELAND
 Uncertainties persist amid a tentative recovery
  177 Economic recovery has continued in the first 
half of 
2011–. Following the collapse of its banking sector in 
October 2008, Iceland went into a long and deep 

recession. Real GDP declined by 6.
7% in 2009 and 
by 
4% in 2010, driven by a strong adjustment in 
domestic demand. The recession 
bottomed
 out in 
the secon
d half of 2010
 and the e
conomy started to 
recover mildly, based on stronger private 

consumption and 
exports. 
In the first half of 2011, 
the recovery continued with real GDP 
growing at 
2.5%
. However, the pace of recovery is faltering 
and uncertainties conti
nue to persist. A
nnual 
growth decelerated in the secon
d quarter of 2011 
compared to the first, as i
nvestment spending 
remain
ed 
subdued
. Export 
performance 
deteriorated
 while imports continu
ed to grow 
markedly, while 
private consumption was buoyed 
by tempor
ary measures
. High
-frequency indicators for the third quarter 
present a mixed picture of the economic situation. 

Consumer confidence indicators dropped, the 

number of corporate insolvencies doubled in July 

on a year
-on-year basis and most of Iceland
's trad
ing partners have revised downwards their 
economic forecasts. On the other hand, tourism has 

performed 
particularly 
well during the summer 
months
 and there were indications for a rise in 
private spending
. – with household spending being supported 
by tempor
ary measures–
 The 
outlook for domestic demand in 2011 has 
improved somewhat compared to the spring 
forecast due to stronger private consumption. 

However, this improvement is expected to be 
short
-lived as 
private consumption
 in 2011 is 
largely driven by tra
nsitory factors. These include 
one
-off pay increases
 related to wage settlements
, extraordinary mortgage interest allowances, 
temporary 
withdrawals
 of savings
 from voluntary 
pension schemes, as well as one
-off 
debt relief 
measures provided in the context o
f debt 
restructuring. 
While those factors provide 
temporary stimuli to private consumption, the 

three year wage agreement between social partners 

of May 2011 with r
elatively strong wage increases 
may have a more lasting positive impact on 

disposable income
s and on consumers' 
expectations. However, at the same time there are 

constraining factors as well. Consumer inflation 

has been on the rise recently, eating into 

households' real purchasing power. Many 

households
 will be left with a significant debt 
burden
 even after 
benefiting from various 
debt 
restructuring
 measures
. The level of 
unemployment, although declining, is projected to 

stay far above pre
-crisis levels. 
The 2012 budget 
contains further tax increases, reducing disposable 

incomes. Fiscal consolidat
ion measures could lead 
to further cuts in benefits and transfers to 

households. Overall, this points to a deceleration 
of private consumption growth in 2012.

 –while uncertainties p
ersist with respect to 
firms' investment plans.
 The corporate sector 
continues to 
suffer from 
financial problems and many firms 
still
 need to 
repair their balance sheets 
before being 
able to 
plan and finance new 
investment
 projects. 
A programme for debt re
structuring of SMEs was 
set up 
in late 2010
 to accelerate th
is process and 
create certainty among debtors and creditors. The 

scheme 
became 
fully operational in May 2011 and 
is supposed to 
assist 
a large number of 
firms in 
financial distress.
 Once corporate
 debt 
restructuring 
starts

 pace
, investment 
activity 
by SMEs 
is likely to unfold slowly. 
However, some investment related to the 

construction of the planned aluminium smelter at 

Helguvik is likely to be postponed beyond the 

forecast horizon, and in
vestment in another energy 
company has been scaled down. Over the short 
term, a
 boost to investment 
is expected from the 
construction at the Straumsvik smelter. Moreover, 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   178 some private public partnership projects in 
transport and tourism are being elaborate
d, but 

their implementation is unlikely to start soon. In 

line with government's announcements, public 
investments are projected to decline again in 2011, 
before new projects will lead to some growth 
acceleration in 2012. Taking this into account, this 
for
ecast projects
 gross fixed capital formation to 
grow by around 7% in 2011 and around 9% in 

2012. A weaker global outlook limits prospects for 
stronger exports
 Weaker than expected 
economic growth in 
Iceland's main trading partner countries 
has 
worsened 
the
 prospects for external demand and 
export growth. Moreover, 
growth 
in a
 large share 
of merchandise exports will continue to be subject 
to technical constraints (fishing quotas, capacity of 
aluminium smelters). 
Services exports 
are 
projected to benefit from
 stronger activity in the 
tourism industry.
 In sum
, the forecast projects 
a mild recovery
 in 
2011, followed by a moderation of growth in 2012. 

Over the forecast horizon, domestic demand will 
be the main driver of growth whereas the 

contribution
 of 
net expo
rts
 is likely to remain 
negative.
 The inflation outlook has worsened–
 After annual inflation 
fell
 below the Central Bank's 
official 2.5% inflation target in early 2011, it 

accelerated markedly to 5.7% in September as a 

result of rising oil, house and food 
prices and 
strong pass
-through effects from unexpectedly 
high wage increases negotiated in the collective 
wage agreements of May. As those effects have 

worsened the inflation outlook, inflation 

expectations have risen markedly.
 At the same time, a
 modest r
ecovery of 
GDP 
growth and disposable incomes should not exert 

significant 
additional 
inflationary pressure
 over the 
medium term
. The
 inflation outlook rests on 
the 
assumption of a continued exchange rate 

stabilisation, 
which has been a 
prime focus of 
monet
ary policy
. As a result, annual average 
inflation is forecast to fall gradually over the 

forecast horizon.
 –the trade balance will remain in surplus–
 External deficits have shrunk markedly following 

the recession. The sharp contraction in domestic 

demand a
nd depreciation of the exchange rate 
(around 50% during the crisis) contributed to 
a substantial improvement in the trade balance. 
The forecast projects a slight reduction 
in the trade 
surplus as of 2011, as 
a weaker outlook for 
Iceland's main trading part
ners limits external 
demand and export growth. 
The current
-account 
balance is difficult to project, as net interest has 

appeared to be rather volatile. A large part of the 

net interest balance 
is 
account
ed for by
 banks in 
winding
-up proceedings. The foreca
st assumes that 
related accrued interest on the debt of those b
anks 
will be gradually reduced.
 –but the labour market continues to struggle 
with relatively high, 
but falling, unemployment
 The labour market remains weak, with 
unemployment close to historic 
highs. The 

unemployment rate rose from 7.8% in the first to 

8.5% in the second quarter of 2011, only slightly 
lower than in the same period of 2010. The level of 
total employment fell by 1% y
-o-y in the first 
quarter and rose marginally in the second quart
er 
(0.3%).
 The forecast projects that employment levels will 
respond to an increase in economic activity in 
2011 and 2012 with some time lag
. This will brin
g the unemployment rate down to below 7%
 by the 
end of the forecast period
, still
 far above the 
aver
age pre
-crisis rat
e. Public finance consolidation continues–
 Following a marked deterioration of public 

finances in the wake of the crisis, the authorities 

took a series of fiscal consolidation measures with 
a view to reducing the fiscal deficit by around 
3 pps. in 2010, from 10% of GDP in 2009. While 
the measures were successful in reining in 

spending and strengthening revenues, the revised 

general government deficit in 2010 remained at 

virtually the same level as in 2009 as a percentage 
of GDP, as the ove
rall budget spending was 
affected by called guarantees for the Housing 
Financing Fund and the Agricultural Fund. The 

2011 budget framework adopted in late 2010 

initially foresaw new fiscal measures amounting to 

around 2.7% of GDP, with most of the adjustme
nt 
on the expenditure side (2% of GDP). This 
changed the structure of fiscal adjustment

    179 compared to 2009 and 2010, which was largely 
based on revenue measures. The first half of the 

year showed strong revenue performance and 

spending below projections. Tot
al general 
government revenues increased by 3.9% and total 

spending by 0.9% y
-o-y. The general government 
balance recorded a deficit of 2.5% of (annual) 

GDP, compared to a deficit of 3.1% in the first half 

of 2010.
 –but fiscal policy has been relaxed somew
hat 
in the course of 2011.
 However, in the context of the three
-year 
collective wage agreement adopted in spring, the 
government took additional spending 

commitments, comprising additional public 
investment   as   well  as  social   protection,  active 
 labour market policy and education measures. As a 
result, expenditure adjustment measures in 2011 
are expected to account for 1% of GDP instead of 

2% as initially foreseen, and total spending is 

likely to exceed the initial level. Therefore, the 
budget bala
nce for 2011
 has been revised and a 
higher fiscal deficit is projected as compared to the 
spring forecast. A continuation of fiscal 

consolidation is, however, assumed for 2012 and 

2013, leading to a gradual reduction of the fiscal 
deficit and allowing for 
a marginal decrease of the 
general government debt
-to-GDP ratio below 90%.

forecast
 In the first half of 2011, the economy continued to 

register sustained output growth of between 2.1% 

and 2.5% according to national sources. Retail 

sales increased by 14.3% y
-o-y as consumers 
remained confident and employment recorded 
positi
ve growth. On the supply side, manufacturing 
grew by 9.7%, while the construction sector 

expanded by 30.8%. Tourism, catering, and 

agriculture also grew on an annual basis.
 A credit
-constrained catching
-up Compared to the spring, the current forecast 

prese
nts a revised growth scenario based on the 
higher than expected outcome in 2010. Early 

indications point to slightly stronger growth in 
2011 as credit activity
 Œ at least for households
 Œ is 
expected to show some positive growth in the last 
quarter of the 
year. Tourism will continue to 
support private domestic demand.
 Risk aversion has resulted in the failure of several 
privatisation tenders, hampering the outlook for 

gross fixed capital formation in the medium term. 

Therefore, any GFCF growth would likely 
result 

from ongoing works in some tourism resorts, as 

well as some new energy and water treatment 
projects. However, towards the end of the forecast 
period investment should benefit from more 

favourable financing conditions.
 The unemployment rate remains h
igh, although it 

decreased marginally from 19.7% in 2010 to 

19.2% in June 2011. Its persistence at high rates 
reflects significant layoffs resulting from the 
restructuring of the metal and mining industries 

and a subdued and lagged response of the labour 

market to the initial phase of recovery. Stronger 
domestic demand over the forecast horizon should 

progressively improve the employment situation, 
although given the seasonal nature of key sectors 
like tourism, agriculture or construction, full
-year 
employm
ent rates will remain still weak. 
 Consumer prices remained subdued in 2010 thanks 

to a reduction in the prices of food and electricity. 

Inflation accelerated in the first half of 2011, 
averaging 3.5%, due to oil and food price 
dynamics. However, the gradu
al recovery of 

domestic demand should not exert strong 

inflationary pressures and consumer price inflation 

is expected to remain around 3% in the medium
-term. Moreover, the expected moderation of global 
energy prices should support price stability.
 Net exp
orts supported the recovery in 2010 as 
imports still contracted while exports benefited 
from the rise in metal prices. However, local 

aluminium production should reach full capacity 

by end
-2011, thus limiting the scope for further 
expansion of the main mer
chandise exports.
 The current
-account deficit narrowed to 25% of 
GDP in 2010, and decreased further during the 

first half of 2011 to 22.4% of GDP, driven by a 

widening surplus of the services and income 
accounts. Yet, the recovery of domestic demand 
and in
 particular of investment will result in an 
acceleration of imports, leading to a negative 

contribution of net exports by 2013.

    181 The most important downside risk is probably 
related to a liquidity squeeze that would result 

from a contraction of credit and t
he very high level 
of non
-performing loans. Other main risks are 
related to the external environment, including a 

slowdown of the global and EU economic 
recovery as well as potential metal price shocks.
 Overall, growth is likely to decelerate in 2012 
befor
e rebounding in 2013 due to stronger external 
demand, but also owing to a recovery of bank 

lending supporting private consumption and 

investment.
 The case for a structurally balanced budget
 Past efforts to balance the budget have showed 

their limitations i
n an economic environment of 
scarce credit. In 2010, the lack of liquidity in the 

economy resulted in the accumulation of tax 

arrears worth 2% of GDP, fuelling a larger than 

planned consolidated deficit of 4.9% of GDP. For 
the first half of 2011 the cumula
tive deficit stood 
at 
1.6% of annual GDP
. On current trends, the 
activation of state guarantees extended to the 
bankrupt steel mill will further increase the 

projected full
-year deficit by 1 pp. to 4% of GDP, 
compared to the 2.5% target of the medium
-term 
fiscal framework. Based on the expectation that the 

authorities will effectively address the issue of tax 
arrears, the forecast envisages a steady annual 

decline in the deficit during the forecast period.
 Public debt increased from 41% of GDP in 2010 to 
45% of GDP in June 2011, and is expected to 
increase slightly in 2012 as a consequence of 

additional budgetary financing needs. The gradual 
improvement in the budget balance should reduce 
borrowing requirements, and consequently the 

public debt stock. Howeve
r, contingent liabilities 
from state guarantees amounting to some 10% of 

GDP pose an important risk to this debt projection, 

in particular as about half of the guarantees are 
linked to a single company.

 Riding the tides of the slowdown
  182 Growth in 2011 stronger than expected –
 Annual 
GDP growth 
reached 9% 
in 2010
 and 10% 
in the first half of 2011
, helped by strong base 
effects
, in spite of low
 expor
ts growth 
caused by 
sluggish demand
 in Turkey's chief export markets
. The major factors behind 
this 
robust performance 
were the continued buoyancy 
of investment and a
 positive contribution from net trade (as import
 volumes weakened for the first time since
 2009).
 At the same time, 
the economy show
ed some signs 
of overheating: e
xternal imbalances widened 
rapidly and inflationary pressures intensified, in 

part due to a significant rise in core inflation and 

the uncertain outlook for Turkish exports.
 In 
the 
second half of 
2011 and 
in 
2012, growth is 
therefore 
expected to moderate to a more 
sustainable pace
 as a result of a more restrictive

forecast
 –but 
is set to slow sharply in 2012–
 A marked 
growth 
slowdown 
is expected until end
-2012. In 2011 
consumer spending 
was
 buoyed by 
rapidly increasing access to bank lending and a 

sharp improvement in the labour market; but 
lending growth to consumers has slowed 
noticeably
 and the seasonally adjusted 
unemployment rate has edged up since March. I
n addition, 
core
 inflation is picking up
. It has moved 
up steadily this year 
(unlike the very volatile 
headline inflation) 
to 
7.5%
 in 
September 
Œ the 
 highest since early 2009
 Œ reflecting the 
exchange 
rate 
pass
-through
, relatively 
high commodity 
prices
 and declining
 spare capacity in the economy 
as a whole. This will undermine consumers™ 

purchasing power.
 As a result of these headwinds, consumer spending 

growth 
is expected to
 slow from 
% in 2011
 to 
less than 1
% in 2012, and accelerate in 201
3 to 
about 
2%. While investment was still very robust 
in 
the second quarter of 2011
, it too is
 set to 
weaken 
sharply. Though lending to 
corporate 
sector
 has held up better than that to 
consumers
 in 
recent months, it is only a matter of time before it 

starts to slow significantly. In early September, 

bank lending rates on commercial loans were 3
 pps.
 higher than in March. This development, 
together with the sharp deterioration in the global 
economic e
nvironment, is likely to make 
businesses more cautious about expanding 
investment
, particularly in the light of 
the
 very 
strong recovery since 2009. 
Annual investment 
growth 
is expected to
 slow from nearly 3
3% in 
2011 to 
3% next
 year and 
4.6
% in 201
3.  The
 combination of much more subdued domestic 
demand and a more competitive exchange rate 

should ensure that net exports continue to 
support
 GDP growth
 in 2012 and 2013
. However, the scale 
of the boost will be constrained by the weakness of 

demand in the EU
, the main destination of 
Turkey™s exports. Although export volume growth 

is expected to 
hover around 5
% in
 2012, 
slightly 
higher than in 2011, 
overall GDP growth is 

forecast to ease to 
3% in 2012 
next year
, before 
accelerating to 4% in 2013
. External defici
ts pose a major risk
 While signs of improving external balances in 

recent months are clearly welcome (July™s 

seasonally
-adjusted trade gap was the smallest this 
year), the prospective turnaround is still set to be 
comparatively modest, with the current
-account 
deficit shrinking gradually from about 10% of 
GDP this year to 8.5% of GDP in 2013. This still 

represents a large external financing requirement 

during a period of very sluggish global growth and 

fragile financial markets. However, 
notwithstanding thi
s major vulnerability, the 
Turkish lira has not been as badly affected by the 
market turmoil of summer 2011 as may have been 

feared, even rallying against the euro since the end

the central bank is expected to leave its key repo 

rate unchanged at 5.75% until mid

 Fiscal and monetary fine
-tuning may be 
challenging–
 Turkey™s fiscal consolidation in the past decade is 

an impressive success story. In the wake of the 

2001 financial crisis, the government managed to 

cut the public debt
-to-GDP ratio from 75% to 
currently 
about 40%. As a result of expansionary 
fiscal policy, public finances deteriorated in 2009 

but 
thereafter 
continue
d to improve 
through to
 2011. In 2010 and 2011, the budget deficit 
narrowed to 3
½% of GDP 
and is forecast to
 amount to 2.5% in 2012
-013. However, only 
a credible, strong and binding fiscal rule will 
lead 
to 
this expected 
fiscal outcome
. Downside risks
 also stem from increased 
expenditure, as the Medium
-Term Programme 
(2012

-term growth

 Eventual policy tightening will be required if the 

5% inflation target for 2012 and 2013 is to be hit. 
However, given the state of global markets and the 
scale of Turkish banks™ need for foreign financing, 

the policy rate seems currently of
 limited 
importance. 
 Labour markets are affected by the slowdown in 

growth. Employment growth is expected to fall 

back to levels of about 1% annually, from the 6% 

growth registered in 2010. The rapid decrease in 

the unemployment rate, 
which came down from
 12½% in 2009 to less than 11% in 2010 and 10% 
by mid
-2011, is virtually halted

. The slowdown 
largely reflected weak private consumption 

coupled with an increasingly negative impulse 

from the 
fiscal side. Some temporary factors 
weighed on activity in the first half of 2011. High 
commodity prices combined with supply

disruptions relating to the Japanese tsunami 
disaster constrained output across the economy and 

deferred corporate employmen

 the brunt
 of peaking oil prices and 
stagnation 
in the labour market, where improving 
trends from 2010 and early 2011 have stalled 

leaving unemployment above 9% amid the lowest 
activity rates since the early 1980s. Confidence 
and wealth were further depressed by a series of 

stock market declines that wi
ped out most of the 
gains from the 2010 equity rally and led consumers 

to further curtail spending.

 Private capital formation fared better, supported by 

robus
t corporate investment in equipment, 
software and structures in selected industries (e.g. 

mining). Investment benefited from 
robust
 corporate balance sheets and the low cost of capital 

but has become increasingly thwarted by rising 

uncertainty regarding th
e economic outlook.    
 The housing market remained subdued in 2011 and 
most indicators suggest that it has not bottomed 

out yet. New residential construction stabilised at a 

low level but the large supply of existing homes 

coupled with weak demand is putt
ing downward 
pressure on prices. House price indices declined in 
the first quarter of 2011 and have remained flat 
since then. 
 Fiscal contraction vs. loose monetary policy 
 The gradual phasing out of crisis stimulus 

packages as well as shrinking public con
sumption 
and investment resulted in a fiscal contraction in 

the first half of 2011. By contrast, monetary policy 
remained accommodative with the Fed committing 
to keep policy interest rates at historically low 

levels (0% to ¼%) at least until mid
-2013. 
Fur
thermore, during its September meeting the Fed 
decided to extend 
the average maturity of its 

holdings of 
securities 
so as to 
put downward 
pressure on longer
-term interest rates and help 
make broader financial conditions more 

accommodative
 ('Operation Twist
').  Labour market improvements, still tentative at the 

turn of 2010, have stalled. After falling to 8.8% in 

March 2011 the unemployment rate rebounded 
above 9% in April and has remained there since 
then. Persistently weak labour demand led to the 

lengthen
ing of unemployment duration, increased 

exits from the labour force and depressed activity 

rates. High commodity prices (predominately oil 

and food) pushed consumer price inflation up to its 
pre
-crisis level (3.9% y
-o-y in September 2011). 
At roughly half 
the rate of headline inflation, core 
inflation has been accelerating as well to reach 2% 

in August (up by 1 pp. from January), suggesting 

significant pass
-through of supply shocks to core 
prices. 
 Slow growth scenario
 Real GDP is expected to
 rebound from t
he 
exceptionally sluggish growth in the first 
half of 

2011, but 
the overall 
outlook for the coming years 

has deteriorated considerably compared to the 
spring forecast
. Real GDP growth is expected to

-EU Countries, The United States of America
   187 decelerate from 1.6% in 2011 to 1.5% in 2012 and 
1.3% in 
2013, largely reflecting the negative 

impact of fiscal policies combined with slack 

private demand, weakened by domestic and global 
uncertainties.  
 Private consumption
, which accounts for almost 
70% of US GDP, 
is predicted to 
remain sluggish 
over the fore
cast horizon. Weak employment 
prospects coupled with a contractionary fiscal 
environment (particularly in 2013) will generally 

restrain spending, as will the feeble situation in the 

housing market and the ongoing process of 
deleveraging. While households h
ave made great 
progress in deleveraging in recent years (see graph 

below), the process is likely to continue over the 

forecast horizon, limiting the chances of robust 

credit
-led spending growth.

 Grim labour market outlook 
delays recovery 
 The labour market outlook is expected to remain 

challenging, reflecting high unemployment 

combined with declining activity rates. The share 

of long
-
number of 
unemployed has registered historical 
highs (above 40% since early 2010 compared to 

10% in the 1990s), pointing to new labour market 

and social challenges emerging in the US. These 

negative trends limit prospects for a major decline 
in the number of unemplo
yed over the forecast 
horizon. The unemployment rate is expected to 
remain at around 9% until 2013. 
 Gross fixed capital formation is expected to regain 

some strength in line with rebounding corporate 

investment
. We expect confidence to improve 
gradually o
ver the forecast horizon under the 
assumption of a resolution to the European debt 

crisis and the emergence of a convincing plan for 
medium
-term fiscal consolidation in the US. This 
should lead corporations to intensify investment 

particularly in areas neg
lected in the past couple of 
years (e.g. structures, transportation equipment).

 Private residential investment has yet to bottom 

out as the persistently difficult labour market 

situat
ion limits the scope for a rebound in the short 

term. At present, a 
flat 
supply
 of new homes meets 
a rising number of existing homes on sale. The 

resulting downward pressure on prices  further 
worsens the position of homeowners , leading to 
more mortgage d
efaults via a feedback loop. This 
situation is expected to ease in the course of 2012 

and trigger a very subdued and gradual recovery of 

house prices and, subsequently, of residential 

investment. 
 Uncertain profile of fiscal consolidation 
 Fiscal policy is
 set to exert an increasing drag on 
economic growth over the forecast horizon. 
On 
2 August President Obama signed 
the Budget 
Control Act of 2011
 (BCA
) which
 cuts federal 
spending over 
the 
next 10 years in exchange for 
raising the debt ceiling. The act impo
ses budget 
cuts 
amounting
 to 
at least
 USD 2.1 trillion until 
2021. Out of this amount US
D 0.9 trillion will 
come
 from agreed caps on discretionary spending 
while an 
additional USD 
1.2
 trillion is to
 be found 
by 23 November by the bipartisan Congressional 

Committee
 for Deficit Reduction (CCDR)
. If the 
Committee fails to reach an agreement
, broad
-based spending cuts are to be applied 

automatically from 2013 of an amount equal to the 

difference between the agreed savings and the 
USD 1.2 trillion target. 
 The 
BCA sets the US on a path of steady 
consolidation that is designed to be front
-loaded in

-agreed spending cuts coupled with 
the scheduled expirati
on of the 2010 payroll tax 
cuts and unemployment benefits, the expiration of 

the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts as well as the 
ongoing effect of  crisis
-linked stimulus and other 
programmes coming to an end.  
 However, the amount of actual fiscal 
tightening
 over the forecast horizon is likely to be lower than 
implied by the current law, due to a number of 
recent initiatives aimed at easing the major fiscal 
drag ahead. This forecast assumes  that: (i) the 
least disputed tax
-cuts
-related part of the USD 447 
bn 
American Jobs Act
 proposed by President 
Obama in early September will be enacted into law 

generating a positive fiscal impulse of around 1% 

of GDP; (ii) the Bush tax cuts set to expire in 2012 

are likely to be partially extended, thus easing the 

2013 consol
idation by around 1% of GDP. The 
extent of fiscal restraint in 2013 is unclear, due to 

the unknown outcome of the Committee's 

negotiations at the time of publication, as well as 

to the number of policy options currently discussed 

in Congress.
   Risks tilte
d to the downside
 The risks to the outlook are 
clearly 
tilted to the 
downside. 
Fiscal policy will remain a source of 
uncertainty as the design of medium
-term fiscal 
consolidation is complicated by the weak 
economic outlook and a political gridlock ahead of
 the presidential elections. Should the consolidation 

plan to emerge from the current debate be 
insufficiently ambitious or credible for financial 

markets, this would undermine already weak 

business and household confidence. 
Resum
ing
 stock market declines 
triggered by 
any 

unfavourable policy developments

internationally

confidence and discourage spending

 Strong rebound in the short run but fadin
g prospects
  189 Earthquake fallout was sharp but short
-lived 
 The 
2008
-09 crisis was followed by
 six quarters of 
relatively strong growth 
up to the third quarter of 
2010. The resulting cumulative GDP growth of 6% 
over this period helped make good 
almost 
two 
thirds
 of the GDP losses 
posted during the crisis
. However, t
he final quarter of 2010 
GDP marked a 
turning point in this recovery, as GDP 

subsequently fell by a cumu
lative 
2% up to the 
second quarter of 2011, mainly due to the 
triple 

disaster 
that 
hit on 11 March. 
The ensuing shock 
curtailed consumption significantly in the weeks 

following the earthquake. 
In April the supply
-chain disruptions led to the biggest drop i

production on record.

 Exports
, as well as
 world production of

electricity supply forced corporations and 

consumers alike to reduce energy consumption. 
From late April/early May onwards the supply
-chain disruptions were overcome. 
Consumers 
regained confidence
 and 
spending increased

However, with a significant number of nuclear

 the need for additional oil 
imports for electricity production
, the disaster is 
set to have a more long

Japanese economy 
over and above
 the immediate 
reconstruction costs. 
 As a result 
of the disaster GDP contrac

combined 
with 
the

 Moderate growth ahead
 Looking ahead, the prospects for 2012 are for 

growth of 1
.8%, one of the highest expected 
growth rates among advanced countries. 

Nevertheless, a strong underlying carry
-over of 1 
pp. masks the relative weakness of in
-year growth. 
At the end of 2012 GDP is due to still be 4% 

below the level reached five years ear
lier.  
 Exports are likely to grow at a moderate pace and 
slightly more than imports, allowing a small 
positive contribution of net exports. However, the 

strong yen, a narrowing technological advantage 

compared to some key competitors like Korea, and 

the d
windling prospects for world trade will limit 
exports. In addition, anecdotal evidence points to 

an accelerating relocation of production facilities 
abroad due to the appreciating yen, an improved 
skill base in the recipient countries and energy 

shortages 
in Japan. However, there are two reasons 
to believe that exports will nevertheless rise in 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   190 2012. First, the recovery in exports has been cut 
short by the earthquake and recent gains still leave 

the export level below where it would have been 

without the ea
rthquake. Second, the weighted 
average of Japan's export market is growing much 

stronger than world trade. Almost 60% of Japanese 
exports go to Asia, whereas only slightly more 
than a quarter of exports are directed towards 

either the USA or Western Europe
. Assuming that 

emerging markets continue to outperform 

advanced economies in 2012, a relatively solid 

outcome for Japanese exports can be expected. 
 Investment is expected to positively contribute to 
growth in 2012 despite some negative factors. 

Recently 
falling corporate profits, relocation of 
production facilities and the strong yen are 

elements that do not bode well for private non
-
residential investment. However, the 

reconstruction needs, investment delays 

immediately after the earthquake and the base 
effect do suggest a potential for a rise in non
-residential private investment (2.2%) in 2012. 
Currently private non
-residential investment stands 
at 2003 levels, about 19% below the peak reached 

in 2008. Non
-residential investment is barely 5% 
higher than
 at the trough. Despite a structural lack 
of demand, demographic challenges and 
confidence problems at the global level, such 
depressed levels of investment are not likely to 

last. The desire to keep or regain a technological 

advantage, to innovate in orde
r to adjust to a 
shrinking workforce and the superior access to 

capital compared to foreign competitors suggest a 
moderately positive investment outlook.
 Private residential investment collapsed by about a 
third between 2007 and 2010, but is likely to grow
 by around 3% in 2011 and 2012 alike. Easy 

financing conditions, declining construction prices 
and changed preferences towards property away 
from potential Tsunami sites are the main reasons
 for this moderate growth.
 Public investments are a large risk fac
tor to this 
forecast. Reconstruction needs after the March 
earthquake are evident and the Diet already passed 
two supplementary budgets totalling around JPY 6 

trillion (1.3% of GDP). A third supplementary 

budget totalling JPY 12.1 trillion was further 

outl
ined by the government. 
However, neither the 
composition nor the timing of the pla
nned 
spending is clear. In addition the government is 
lacking a majority in the upper house and the final 
version of the third supplementary budget will be a 
compromise betwe
en the government and at least 

one opposition party. Public investment is 

expected to increase by JPY 2.3 trillion (11.5%) to 

a level last seen in 2006. However, this outcome is 
far from certain given possible implementation 
delays and the unclear composit
ion of the spending 
of the third supplementary budget. Given a broad 

political consensus about the general need for a 

third package a significant effect on public 

investment is assumed in this forecast. 
  Household consumption is expected to rise only 

very
 moderately. A further improvement of the 
labour market is unlikely over the forecast period. 

Recent discussions about pension cuts and tax 

increases amidst rising awareness about the 

precarious fiscal situation as well as the long
-term 
problems of the pen
sion system will continue to 
weigh on consumer sentiment. The continuing 

decline in property values and the large and 

increasing concentration of wealth among older 
citizens are negative for the consumption outlook. 
The strong yen and falling commodity pri
ces will 
lift the purchasing power of consumers and 

eventually boost household consumption. 

However, the strength of the yen, in particular vis
-à-vis other Asian currencies, might raise imports 
and encourage consumption abroad, as anecdotal 
evidence points
 to a surge in shopping trips to 
Seoul and Hong Kong. 
 Government consumption is steadily increasing 
due to a rising demographic burden. For 2012 only 

a very small increase is envisaged, as consolidation 
pressures are mounting and sufficient revenue
-enhanc
ing measures are not likely to be 
implemented in the short term. In 2013 moderate 
growth is forecast to continue. It is reasonable to 

expect lower government expenditure growth as 

immediate needs due to the earthquake diminish 
and consolidation efforts are
 likely to take centre 
stage.  
 Fiscal c
onsolidation efforts are stalling
 Japan remains the only advanced economy with a 
gross government debt
-to-GDP ratio above 200%. 
The ratio is still rising and a combination of low 

growth rates and muted consolidation 
efforts will 
not help in correcting this trend. Market access is 

still granted and the insecurity in world bond 

markets might even strengthen the home bias of 

Japanese investors in the short run. But the rising 

debt ratio makes a serious and workable plan 
for 
fiscal consolidation crucial for keeping the

    191 situation under control in the medium term. Even 
an increase of the average interest rate for 

outstanding government bonds of only 100 basis 

points would result in higher debt servicing costs 
worth 2% of GDP
. Managing expectations of 
Japanese investors and implementing a credible 

fiscal consolidation plan are therefore of utmost 
importance.
 While m
onetary policy remains supportive of 
the outlook–
 Deflation has stopped for now, even after the 

rebasing of the g
oods basket in August, which 
lowered the official inflation rate by more than ½ 

pp. Falling commodity prices, the effects of the 
strong yen and sluggish demand might result in a 
return to moderate deflation in the forecast period. 

A return to the more seri
ous deflation seen in 2009 
seems unlikely in light of higher price expectations 

of households. Moreover, if needed the Bank of 

Japan has a margin for increasing its asset 

purchasing program further. Financing conditions 

for companies are easy and currently
 imply a 
competitive advantage for corporations in 

particular compared to Asian rivals.
 –downside risks prevail
 Downside risks to the forecast dominate. The 

energy shortage might create more medium
-term 
problems than visible now. Because of the global 

slow
down, world trade might be weaker than 
foreseen, and possible falls in sentiment may 

weigh on investment more heavily than expected 
in the baseline. There is, however, an upside risk to 
consumption growth as income prospects might 

brighten somewhat and hou
seholds tap into their 

still sizeable savings. In addition, investments 

might surprise on the upside if easy financing 

conditions and the need to modernise and improve 

equipment win the upper hand.
  35. CHINA
 Growt
h is slowing down
  192 In 2010 China's real GDP 
grew by 10.3%. It
 was 
primarily driven by investment, which accounted 
for around half of GDP (while household 

consumption was down to one third). In the first 
half of 2011, China's GDP decelerated slightly 
from 9.7% in the first quarter to 9.5% in the 
second quarter in annualised terms. It eased further 

in the third quarter, posting 9.1% growth. China's 

manufacturing 
PMI registered the longest 
consecutive fall si
nce February 2009 in the second 
quarter of 2011, even 
dropping below the 50 mark 

dividing expansion from contraction in the third 

quarter, before rebounding to 51.1 points in 

October. The growth moderation appears set to 

continue in the second half of the 
year, bringing 
annual growth for 2011 to 9.2%. Growth is 

expected to slow further to 8.6% in 2012 and 8.2% 
in 2013.
 China's economic growth is likely to moderate 
throughout the forecast horizon because of the 

fading of stimulus measures and weak net extern
al 
demand. In addition, ongoing credit and monetary 
tightening will limit prospects for GDP growth. 
China has now less room than in 2008 for a 

stimulus response in case of need, given the rise of 

off
-balance sheet lending and the indebtedness of 
local gove
rnments. On the other hand, private 
consumption is likely to benefit somewhat from 

growing incomes thanks to wage increases and a 
healthy labour market. 
 Investment remains the main driver of economic 
growth. Especially investment in the real estate 

sector
 is expected to remain buoyant
 (in part due to 
an expansion in the construction of social housing 
as part of the 12
th five
-year plan), although the 
government has enacted measures to slow house 
price appreciation and deter speculation. In the 

second quarte
r of 2011 real estate investment held 
up well (33.2% 
y-o-y), showing a small decline 
from the first quarter (34.1%). In the first half of 
2011 investment in fixed assets picked up by 25% 

y-o-y in both quarters, from a growth rate of 
19.5% in real terms in 
2010. Tighter monetary 

policy and the government's clampdown on the 
property market could in principle contribute to 
softening investment, but so far China continues to 

be powered by investment. 
 Consumption growth remained robust. Retail sales 

have gained
 momentum during 2011, reaching 
year
-on-year growth of 17.7% in September. Real 
wages have been increasing steadily since 2010, 

which bodes well for private consumption 

contributing more to China's GDP growth in 2011. 

However, for this trend to fully take 
hold would 

require the policy measures mentioned in the 12
th Five
-Year Plan to boost domestic consumption 
to 
be specified and 
succeed in shifting towards a 

more balanced growth model. Moreover, 
annual
 inflation is still expected to be around 6% in the 

thir
d quarter of 2011, potentially limiting 
consumers' purchasing power.
 The external sector held up well amid the global 

weakness, driven by the resilience of demand 
within Asia. In 2010, exports rose in value terms 
by 31.3% 
y-o-y, while imports rose by 38.7%
. Export growth appears to have lost some steam in 

the second half of 2011, with year
-on-year growth 
slowing to 17.1% in September from 24.5% in 

August. Import growth decelerated to 20.9% in 

September after an increase of 30.2% y
-o-y in 
August. As a conseq
uence, China's trade surplus 

decreased to USD 107.1 bn in the second quarter 

of 2011 compared to USD 197 bn in the first 

quarter. In the second half of 2011, Chinese 

authorities expect a further moderation of export 

growth and a narrowing of the trade surp
lus, 
mainly due to 
weaker
 demand in advanced 
economies. Import growth could continue to 

outpace export growth,
 in relative if not absolute 
terms,
 led by robust domestic demand 
for
 both 
commodities and capital goods. 
 China's current account surplus has bee
n stabilising in nominal terms from USD 297 bn in 
2009 to USD 306 bn in 2010, although 
it declined 
as a share of GDP 
from 5.9% in 2009 to 5.1% in 
2010. In 2011, the nominal surplus could turn out 

to be smaller
 than expected
, given weaker external 
global co
nditions. On the assumption that the 
government engages in
 fiscal consolidation, that 
external demand sees a moderate recovery and the 

real exchange rate remains stable, the current 

account surplus should remain stable as a share of 

GDP before widening aga
in in 2013. 
 Foreign exchange reserves continued to rise, 
growing by further USD 153 bn in the second 
quarter of 2011 to USD 3.2 trillion (from USD 

3.04 trillion in the first quarter).

 dollar, 
against the euro it has 
depreciated
 up to October 2011 by 4.3% since 
being released from its dollar peg in June 2010
. Inflation is declining gradually
 After an increase of 5% 
y-o-y in the first quarter, 
annual consumer price inflation reached 6.1%
 in 
September 2011. Since the target of the Chinese 
central bank was to keep inflation below 4% in 
2011, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) therefore 
tightened monetary policy
. This is expected to 
have an impact on prices in the second half of 

2011. Inflati
on is estimated to have already peaked 
in year
-on-year terms
 and is foreseen to gradually 
ease to between 5% and 6% in 2011. Barring 
further food supply shocks, inflation should 
continue on a gradual downward path 
until
 the end 
of the forecast horizon. How
ever, this might be 
offset by rising labour costs due to higher wages 

and broader cost pressures, or due to a surge in 

commodity prices. 
 The PBoC raised its benchmark policy rate five 

times since October 2010 to counter price 
pressures. The one
-year lendi
ng rate reached 6.5% 
in August 2011. However, the strong growth 
performance of China and market expectations of a 

continuing appreciation of the renminbi
 against the 
dollar
 have
 induc
ed a (partly speculative)
 inflow of 
capital
. This
 somewhat hampers the ab
ility of the 
PBoC to tame inflation
 by raising interest
 rate
s further in the near future
, especially
 if the global 
growth slowdown proves more marked than 

expected. 
 In a further step to counteract inflation and 
overheating
, banks' reserve requirement rati
o (RRR) was increased six times to 21.5% for large 

banks 
during 
the first two quarters of 2011. 
Furthermore, the rate of currency appreciation 

vis
-à-vis the USD has edged up in the second and 
third quarter of 2011, 
notwithstanding the 
continuing 
robust inc
rease in USD reserves

 The property market poses a threat to China's 
economic stability
 Since 2010, the Chinese authorities have moved 
aggressively to cou
nteract the 
construction
 boom 
and the speculative excesses in the property 

market. Home purchase limits have been expanded 

to cover smaller cities
, raising required down 
payments to 50% for second homes and to 100% 

for third homes. For the first time since
 2008 prices in the largest cities 
Œ including Beijing, 
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen 
Œ remained 
flat both in July and August 2011. Growth in new 

mortgages moderated to 18.6% in the second 

quarter of 2011 compared to 50% in the same 

period of 2010. Grow
th in house sales has also 
moderated 
its peak in 2009, to about 20% in the 
second quarter of 2011. 
 However, China remains vulnerable to property 

bubbles, also because of structural factors such as 

excessive liquidity, low real interest rates and lack 

of i
nvestment channels for individuals. Especially 
the government's policy moves targeting house 
prices, as well as weakening sales, have 
pushed
 real estate companies into an increasingly tight 
credit environment. China's central bank also 

curbed lending to pr
operty developers. For this 
reason, developers are forced to seek more 

expensive and riskier forms of financing (such as, 

for example, offshore bonds). 
 Fears of a banking crisis represent another 
downside risk
 Local government debt has expanded considerab
ly 
following the credit and monetary stimulus 
launched in response to the global financial crisis 

in 2008

to local government to around USD 1.7 trillion

     194 date
 compared to USD 0.5 trillion in 2007. Since 
2010 credit conditions have been tightened and 
deposit and loan rates have increased. The PBoC 

has also enacted measures to prevent off
-balance 
sheet lending. Despite this shift in policy,
 credit 
growth had continued to increase during 2010, 
especially for lending to local government 
financing vehicles. In the first three quarters of 

2011, new lending moderated to within the 

government's target range; against the backdrop 

declining inflatio
n, it is unclear to what degree 
Chinese authorities will pursue their restrictive 

measures. Amid growing concerns that the 
accumulation of local government debt poses an 
important credit risk, the Ministry of Finance 

approved a trial program that will allo
w some 
provinces and municipalities to issue short
-term 
bonds.
 The banking system appears capable of absorbing 
 potential losses, as the system
-wide loan
-to-deposit 
ratio is reportedly still relatively low compared to 

pre
-crisis levels. However, a deterio
ration of the 
economic situation (coming from either lower 
growth, a real estate downturn or higher interest 
rates) risks causing distress for smaller banks that 
would find it difficult to meet regulatory 
requirements.
  To counter the associated risks, the
 bank 
regulatory agency has asked banks to raise capital 

requirements and provisioning for lending to local 

government vehicles and has strengthened the 
effectiveness and frequency of credit risk 
assessments. Moreover, the domestic arm of 

China's sovereign
 wealth fund, Central Huijin, 
increased its stakes in China's big four commercial 

banks, signal
ling the government's commitment to 
stand behind the banking sector should failures 

materialise.
  36. EFTA
 The outlook deteriorates
  195 Having recovered from the crisis, both Switzerland 
and Norway are weathering the headwinds from 

renewed volatility in financial markets and its 

impact on the world economy. With the fiscal 
stance in a more neutral position, public finances 
are in good shape to withstand downside risks, 
should they materialise. At the current juncture 

government spending in the EFTA countries is still 

constrained, with domestic demand being driven 

by the priva
te sector. While in Norway strong 
growth in household spending is expected, 

Switzerland is likely to rely on increased 

investment to drive domestic demand growth.  

Risks to the forecast mainly concern prices. While 

the Norwegian forecast will depend strong
ly on the 
price of oil, Switzerland's outlook hinges upon the 

value of the Swiss franc.
 For both economies the positive contribution to 

growth from external trade is likely to resume. 

Growth in exports and imports is projected to 

continue 
its 
rebound from 
crisis low
s. 
Although 
remaining well below EU levels, unemployment is 
likely to remain above pre
-crisis levels 
over
 the 
forecast 
horizon
. Addressing labour market 
developments
 is arguably
 the 
main policy 
challenge
 EFTA states share
. The outlook for the 
for
ecast period shows moderate to solid growth in 
both Switzerland
 (74) and Norway. 
 GDP growth back on track in Norway...
 Real GDP contracted by 1.4% in 2009, with rising 
government spending contrasting with shrinking 

private domestic demand and net external 
trade 

but. The return to growth in 2010 was rather 
hesitant with an annual increase of only 0.3% of 
GDP. The challenge for Norway will be to create 

growth momentum as the fiscal stimulus fades out 

towards the end of the forecast period. The 

expansionary fi
scal policy exercised during the 
crisis is expected to become much more 
constrained in the coming years. In 2011 the fiscal 
stance turned less expansionary as the fiscal 

stimulus package is envisaged to be halved 

compared to 2010.

Switzerland's outlook includes Liechtenstein. Iceland's 
outlook can be found in the section on candidate countries.
 GDP growth is likely to a
ccelerate in 2011 to 
2.4%, rising further and to 2.7% in 2012 and 2.9% 
in 2013. This rebound is mostly driven by 

domestic demand, with external trade expected to 
continue contributing to growth, albeit in a minor 
way. The decline in investments in Norwegia
n mainland industries, which started in 2009, 

worsened in 2010. However, a rebound is expected 

for 2011 and beyond, even though it will not return 

to its pre
-crisis level during the forecast period.

 Export growth is likely to be driven by services 

and traditional goods, rather than Norway's oil 

exports. Oil production is expected to decrease 

slightly in the forecast period. However, as this 
decrease is more than offset by the export of 
traditional go
ods, exports are likely to grow by 
around 1.1% in 2011 and 2012 respectively, 

moving up to around 1.5% in 2013. Import growth 

is expected to outpace the growth of exports. The 

net contribution to GDP growth of net exports is 

expected to decrease towards th
e end of the 
forecast period, though remaining positive.
 Households continue to spend–
 Household consumption, which accounts for 

around 55% of GDP in mainland Norway, is likely 

to grow solidly throughout the forecast period. 

Low interest rates, increased i
ncomes and wealth 
and better economic prospects all helped to 

stabilise household consumption in 2010. 

Consumer spending is expected to grow by 2.8% 

in 2011. On the back of good prospects for 

household incomes, consumption growth is likely 

to peak at 3.5% 
in 2012 before moderating to 2.9% 
European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2011
   196 in 2013, despite slightly higher expected policy 
interest rates during the forecast years. However, 

the relatively high indebtedness of Norwegian 

households is a downside risk to household 
spending. The dominance of loans 
at variable 
interest rates in combination with the gradual 
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus measure could 
negatively impact consumer spending. 
 Norway's housing 
market on solid foundations
 House prices are expected to maintain their 

upward trend during the fo
recast years. The solid 
underpinnings of the residential property market 

are expected to support increased investment, in 
particular in residential construction, thus turning 
the decline of the past two years into an upswing in 

the forecast years.
   Inflat
ion in Norway remains moderate...
 Consumer price inflation declined to an annual rate 

of 2.3% in both 2009 and 2010. The strengthening 

of the NOK should dampen inflationary pressures, 

resulting in  a slowdown of inflation of about 1.5% 
in 2011. In the rema
inder of the forecast period the 
inflation rate will likely remain below 2%, at 1.5% 
in 2012 and 1.9% in 2013. The recession in the 

Norwegian economy was partly responsible for the 

past fall in wage growth, which is now expected to 

rebound over the forecas
t horizon, translating into 
some upward pressure on prices. 
 – while unemployment remains low
 Unemployment in Norway is relatively low 

compared to the EU. However, in 2010 it affected 

3.5% of the total labour force, a
 high reading by 
Norwegian standards. U
nemployment is expected 
to ease to 3.1% by the end of 2013.
 Current account remains positive
 Norway™s current account should remain 

comfortably positive throughout the forecast 

period. Although the trade surplus narrowed in 

2010 it is likely to widen again
 in 2011, partly due 
to higher oil prices. In 2012 the trade surplus is 

expected to remain stable, supported by a surplus 

in the services balance. However, the balance of 

primary incomes has shown somewhat more 

volatility. The income balance is likely to t
urn 

positive this year, with a neutral stance in 2012 and 
a small surplus in 2013. All in all, the current
-account surplus is set to remain around 12% of 
GDP within the forecast horizon.
 Switzerland's economy remains on a stable 
growth path
 The Swiss econo
my performed relatively well 
during the crisis compared with many other 
European countries. Still, the drop in GDP by 

almost 2% in 2009 made it the worst recession in 
more than three decades. The Swiss economy 
rebounded with a growth of 2.7% last year and 
this 

relatively strong performance continued in the first 

two quarters of 2011. However, renewed financial 

turbulence has put strong upward pressure on the 

Swiss franc, threatening the export sector. Growth 
is expected to decelerate to 1.7% in 2011, partly
 due to weaker government spending growth. GDP 
growth is likely to accelerate in 2012 to 1.9% and 

to continue at 1.8% of GDP in 2013. 
 Household consumption growth resumed only 

moderately in 2010 after dropping in 2009. The 

spending recovery is likely to c
ontinue, starting at 
a modest pace of just over 1.1% in 2011 to reach 
1.8% in 2012 and 2.1% in 2013.
 Growth in public 
investment is expected to be modest as well in the 
coming years, despite increased government focus 

on infrastructure investment. 
 Exports
 are picking up again in Switzerland
 Exports rebounded strongly in 2010, mostly due to 

strong growth in pharmaceutical and machineries 

exports to Asia. Real growth in exports of goods 

and services is expected to moderate significantly 
in 2011 and 2012. How
ever, 
further 
strength
ening
 of the Swiss Franc may 
threaten
 this outlook
. Downside risk
s remain for
 the services sector in 
relation to the ero
sion of
 bank secrecy, which may 
have a negative impact on the contribution of the 

financial
 sector to GDP.

EU Swiss inflation
 The Swiss National Bank is expected to maintain 
the course of its expansionary monetary polic
y in 
2011 and 2012. The 
SNB is likely to keep its 
key 

interest rate
 at low levels
, around 0.25% in 201
1. 
However,
 the SNB has signalled its intention to 
consider a 
small rise 
in the key interest rate. 
Recent robust domestic credit growth seems not to
 pose 
an imminent threat to financial stability 
because of the still relatively low 
debt levels
 in the 
private sector. 
 For the forecast years
, inflation is 
expected to remain low
, not least due to moderate 
wage growth. T
he efforts of the Central Bank 
to keep th
e Swiss franc 
above the level of 
1.20 
CHF/EUR 
following the commitment made
 in 
September 
2011 may
 lead to some inflationary 
pressure. 
The National Bank 
has committed to 
defend the rate of 1.20 CHF/EURO, 
using all 

available means, including currency interve
ntions.
  Low unemployment
 The unemployment rate was elevated, at 4.1% at 

the end of 2010, a level not seen since the mid
-nineties. Unemployment is expected to decrease 

gradually to 3% by the end of the forecast period. 
Wage growth is expected to steadily s
low down 
over the same period, with a slight increase 
towards the end of the forecast horizon.
 Swiss current account
 External trade turned positive again in 2010,
 mostly due to strong exports.  The external sector 

is expected to continue to post a positive
 contribution to growth in 2012 and 2013. The 

current
-account surplus stood at 16.3% of GDP in 
2010. Overall, the current account is set to remain 
significantly positive. It is forecast at 13.9% of 
GDP in 2011, 14.1% in 2012 and 13.7% in 2013. 
 37. RUSSIAN FEDERATION
 The recovery stutters
  198 In Russia,
 real GDP grew 
by 
4% in 2010 and 
continued at this rate
 (at 
4.1%
 y-o-y) during
 the 
first quarter of 2011. However, some 
moderat
ion
 is visible in
 the 
second quarter
's slowdown to 
3.4% 
y-o-y. Sur
veys point to a deceleration in already 
sluggish economic activity, notably the PMI, 
which declined to 50.2 in September from 50.8 in 

August, having declined for four consecutive 

months. GDP g
rowth in 2011 
has t
herefore
 been 
revised down to 3.9% 
compared t
o the spring 
forecast
. Economic growth has been increasingly 
supported by domestic demand (both consumption 

and investment
), while external demand is 
slowing.
  Russia's growth 
outlook is still
 strongly depend
ent 
on international commodity prices
, and a 
con
siderable
 amount of non
-performing loans 
continues to 
inhibit
 credit growth. 
Economic 
growth is expected to decelerate slightly from 

3.9% in 2011 to 3.8% in 2012 and to edge up to 

4.0% in 2013.   
 Exports accelerated in 2010
, but the sluggish 
expansion in 
the oil and gas sector (
where 
some 
existing fields are almost depleted), combined with 

the 
negative demand effects 
of the euro
-area
 debt 
crisis, 
are likely to 
limit export volume growth to 
5-5½% per year 
between
 2011 and 20
13. In the 
second half of 2011
 higher agricultural output 
could partially 
boost
 exports
, as 
exports of grain in 
2011 could exceed the record high of 22.4
 million
 tonnes exported in 2008. Imports increased 

strongly in 2011 due to the strengthening of 

domestic demand but 
the
 ongoing sharp 
deceleration in the growth of imports
 is expected 
to continue
.  Growth stabilises on a lower level compared to 
pre
-crisis  The expansion of domestic demand was a major 
driver of economic growth in 2010. Growth in 

consumer spending and investment activity is
 still 
increasing in 2011, and both are expected to 
continue growing slightly. With expected GDP 
growth of around 4% a year, growth will remain 

below the rates achieved before the crisis. In the 

absence of a more comprehensive growth strategy, 

GDP growth w
ill remain relatively subdued.

forecast
 Despite increasing imports of goods due to 

strengthening domestic demand, Russia's trade 
surplus is increasing compared to 2010, growing 
by 19% y
-o-y in H1 of 2011. In t
he fist six months 
of 2011, exports rose at an annual rate of 32.1%, 

while imports increased by 39.9%. The main 

imported items in this period were machinery, 

equipment and transport (46% of total imports). 
The growth in exports, supported by high oil 
price
s, resulted in a rise in the current
-account 
surplus from 4.8% of GDP in 2010 to an expected 

5.9% in 2011. High energy prices for 2011 are the 

main reason behind this strong current
-account 
surplus. While oil and gas account for two thirds of 

Russia's expo
rts, their growth is limited due to 
sluggish productivity and a lack of maintenance. 

Overall, the current
-account surplus is expected to 
decrease to 4% of GDP in 2012 and to 3.8% of 

GDP in 2013, mainly due to assumed lower oil 

prices. 
 The labour market
 situation is improving
 slightly. 
The unemployment rate, which rose from 7% in 

2008 to 8.2% in 2009, has started to edge down. In 

2011 the unemployment rate is expected
 to decline 
to 7.
4% and
 to 6.9% in 2012
, returning to pre
-crisis levels on the back of a re
duction in the 
unemployment gap between rural and urban areas 
and between men and women.  
 Inflation picked up to almost 10
% by January 2011
 due to higher food prices following widespread 
damage to crops ca
used by forest fires in August 
2010.(75) CPI inflat
ion moderated to 7.2% y

   199 September 2011, continuing its slowdown from 
9.5% on average in the first half of this year. 

Inflation has been slowing down for the fifth 

month in a row. This downward trend was largely 
driven by food prices. For the fifth c
onsecutive 
month, food price inflation declined to 6.6% in 

September from 8.7% in August.  
Global 
uncertainty affects exchange rate dynamics
. In the current financial environment of heightened 

risk aversion, 
Russia™s equity market
 has dropped 
more than any
 other 
emerging market economy's. 
Since end July
, interbank lending rates
 have risen
, and the rouble has dropped against the euro. 
 The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) manages the 
rouble against a USD/EUR basket made up of 55 

cents of a USD and 45 cents of a 
EUR. The real 
effective exchange rate appreciated by about 9.5% 

in 2010. Strong appreciation pressure on the rouble 

continued in the first half of 2011 
as a result of 
surging oil prices (in Jan
-Aug 2011 the rouble 
strengthened in real terms to USD by 8.5%,
 by 
2.4% to EUR). Starting in August this year, Russia 
has experienced a significant weakening of its 

currency in reaction the uncertain global outlook.
   As of mid
-October the rouble lay within the central 
bank's range of 32.5
-37.6 against the basket (aft
er 
the last change in the beginning of October). The 

value of the bi
-currency basket stood at RUB 35.7 
as of 6
 October 2011. As of September 2011, 
Russia's foreign
-exchange reserves reached USD 
496.4 bn, their highest level since November 2008.

 Preventing exchange rate volatility
 The CBR
 reduced its refinancing rate four times 
in 
2010, 
from 8.75% in February to a record
 low 
of 
7.75% in June.
 In the light of 
high inflationary 
expectatio
ns and rising oil prices
, the CBR 
increased the refinancing rate to 8% on 25 

February 2011 and to 8.25% as of 3 May 2011. 

Since May the CBR has not undertaken further 

monetary tightening. 
 The CBR is committed to inflation
-targeting. The 
CBR set inflation 
targets of 5
-6% in 2012 and 4.5
-5.5% in 2013. There is a commitment to move 
towards a floating exchange rate, with the CBR's 
intervention confined to preventing excessive 
volatility of the rouble. 
 The banking system is quite liquid and CBR data 
show an im
provement in the quality of banks' 
balance sheets, as the share of non
-performing 
loans has declined to 8% of loans in April 2011, 

having peaked during the crisis at 10%,
 showing 
an improvement in the quality of banks' balance 

sheets.  
 Inflationary pressu
res are slowing down
 Inflation picked up during the first four months of 

2011. Food inflation was the main factor pushing 

up inflation. Not only elevated food prices, but 

also high oil and gas prices, budgetary expenditure 
and money supply growth have unde
rpinned 
inflationary pressures. The inflation rate stood at 
9.6% in April 2011.

 Fiscal developments
 Under the current budget proposals for 2012
-14 
the central government deficit is set to shrink to 

1.5% of GDP in 2012, befo
re reaching 1.6% in 

2013 and 0.7% in 2014. This is in line with the 
Commission forecast at hand, which expects a 
deficit of 1.5% of GDP in both 2012 and 2013. 

According to the Medium Term Expenditure 

Framework, the budget is expected to return to 

balance b
y 2015. Additional fiscal spending 
associated with the election cycle, however, 
appears possible in the current year and in 2012.  
 In the medium term, the hosting of the
 2014 
Winter Olympic Games and of the
 2018 football 
World Cup will necessitate substa
ntial investment 
in transport, hotel and sports i
nfrastructure, 
estimated at around USD 70 b
n. 
This event could 
support, in part, the 
modernisation
 of the economy, 
which
 is needed in order for Russia to enhance its 
competitiveness in the 
global economy.
