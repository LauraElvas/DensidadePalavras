         February2011EU recovery gaining ground The economic recovery in the EU con
tinues to make headway. After a strong performance in the first half of 
2010, real GDP growth for both the EU and the euro area slowed down in the second half of last year. The 
deceleration was expected and in lin
e with a soft patch in global grow
th and trade, which reflected the 
withdrawal of stimulus meas
ures and the fading away of positive impuls
es from the inventory cycle. Nonetheless, 
the global economy, particularly the US and emerging markets, proved more dynamic in the fourth quarter than 
expected in the autumn. This is likely to have supported EU exports, providing a countervailing impulse to the 

adverse weather effects observed in the final 
part of the year in some Member States. 
Looking ahead, EU GDP growth in 2011 is set to be somewhat stronger than expected in the Commission's 
autumn 2010 forecast, despite lingering vulnerabilities in financial markets. This improved outlook is supported, 
inter alia, by better prospects for the global economy and upbeat EU business sentiment. The latter generally 

points to economic activity gathering pace going forward and shows signs that the recovery is also broadening 
across sectors. Moreover, developments in profitability, or
der books, lending to households, saving ratio also 
point to a gradually firming pace of domestic activity. The encouraging progress in economic sentiment stands 
in contrast with the tensions observed in some
 sovereign-bond markets in
 the EU since autumn. 
Based on an update for the seven largest EU Member St
ates, growth prospects for this year have been revised 
slightly up in the Commission's February 2011 interim forecast. GDP growth in 2011 is now projected at 1.8% 

in the EU and 1.6% in the euro area, both 0.1 pp. higher than in the autumn. While upward revisions are 
reported for most countries consid
ered here, the expected pace of re
covery remains uneven across Member 
States. Germany continues to benefit from the robust
 external environment and strong domestic demand 
dynamics, whereas significant adjustment challenges s
till weigh on activity in several other countries. 
The inflation projection has been revised 
up more markedly. A surge in energy and commodity prices in the last 
few months has led to an uptick in headline HICP inflation. The inflation forecasts for 2011 are thus revised up, 
with HICP inflation now proj
ected at 2.5% and 2.2% in the EU and the 
euro area respectively. Nevertheless, the 
remaining economic slack, subdued wage growth and overall well-anchored inflation expectations should keep 
underlying inflationary pressures in ch
eck, with inflation ex
pected to end the year at close to 2% in both regions. 
Amid still high uncertainty, risks to the EU growth outlook at the current juncture appear broadly balanced for 
2011. Risks to inflation seem somewhat tilted to the upside, on account of ongoing geopolitical tensions in the 

MENA region.

  2 Interim forecast Februar
y 2011 
Global outlook improves again After a buoyant recovery in the first half of 2010, 
the world economy went through a soft patch in the 

third quarter of 2010. Global activity rebounded in 
the fourth quarter and leading indicators suggest a 
further acceleration. The re
covery continued to be 
uneven, with advanced economies lagging behind 
emerging ones in the business cycle. The rise in 
commodity prices has contributed significantly to 

the hike in headline inflation, especially in 
emerging market economies, where commodities 
(in particular food) account for a larger share of 

consumer baskets. In advanced economies, core 
inflation and inflation expectations remain 
contained, which has so far allowed monetary 

policy to remain accomm
odative. In global 
financial markets, conditions have improved 
gradually since the autumn
 2010 forecast, despite 
nervousness and episodes of heightened risk 
aversion. Stock markets have continued to recover.

In this interim forecast, 
global growth in 2011 is 
being revised upwards, mainly on the back of the 
additional fiscal stimulus adopted in the US in 
December 2010, while grow
th in major emerging 
market economies continues to be buoyant. Global 

GDP (excl. EU) is projected to grow by some 4¾% 
in 2011, up by ¼ pp. co
mpared to the autumn 
forecast. The global recovery is still expected to be 

uneven between emerging and advanced 
economies. 
 
While the global outlook has been revised upwards, 
concerns about global growth remain in place. 
Rising headline inflation and possibly excessive 
capital inflows can lead to overheating in emerging 
markets. Reversal of capital flows in countries 
where current-account deficits are widening or 

where there is heightened geopolitical uncertainty 
creates an additional concern at the global scene.  
 Financial markets recovering from sovereign-
debt crisis but important vulnerabilities remain Whilst remaining relatively fragile, the overall 
financial-market situation in the EU has improved 
since the autumn forecast.
 Sovereign-bond spreads 
have trended down in the beginning of the year, 

though they remain at 
elevated levels. Money 
market activity is more favourable and real 
financing conditions remain supportive. 

Nevertheless, important vulnerabilities remain in 
place, especially with rega
rd to banks' funding and 
the assessment of the sustainability of public 

finances in some euro-area Member States. 
Looking ahead, notwithstanding the risk of 
disruptions, overall monetary and financial 

conditions are expected to provide further support 
to the recovery in 2011. 
More specifically on sovereign-bond markets, some 
positive factors have led to an easing of tensions. In 

addition to positive news from the real economy, 
policy reforms in some Member States have raised 
confidence. Also expectations of further EU 
measures to harness financial-market stability going 
forward have probably contributed to the improved 

market sentiment. The successful auctions by some 
euro-area sovereigns and the successful bond 
issuance by the European Financial Stabilisation 

Mechanism (EFSM) and th
e European Financial 
Stability Facility (EFSF) bear
 witness to the overall 
improved conditions. Nevertheless, bond spreads of 

peripheral euro-area soverei
gns remain at elevated 
levels. The benchmark sovereign-bond yields are 
significantly up since mid-2010, mainly driven by 

higher inflation expectations and an improved 
growth outlook.  
Spreads between yields of corporate and 
government bond have narrowed substantially, 

reflecting declining default perceptions. In money 
markets, conditions have continued to improve 
since the beginning of this year. For the majority of 

banks in the euro area, 
the access to market-based 
financing continues to normalise. Bank credit 
provision to the economy has improved further. 
    3Interim forecast Februar
y 2011
Bank lending to households has continued to 
increase, whilst remaining subdued. The volume of 
bank loans to the non-financial corporate sector 
continued falling, but at lower rates. The latest ECB 

Bank Lending Survey points to slightly tightening 
(house purchases) or stable (non-financial corporate 
sector) credit standards in parallel with stronger 

demand for lending, amid continued constraints on 
banks' balance sheets. 
  EU recovery making headway As expected in autumn, the pace of EU economic 
activity moderated in the second half of 2010. This 
reflected the phasing out of temporary support 
measures and the slowdo
wn in global activity, 
which dampened EU export growth. In the third 
quarter of 2010, GDP growth in the euro area and 
the EU softened to 0.3% and 0.5% respectively, 
compared to the previous quarter. In the final 
quarter, according to Eurostat's Flash estimate, 

GDP expanded by 0.3% from the previous quarter 
in the euro area and by 0.2% in the EU. In a few 
countries, GDP growth in the fourth quarter was 

negatively affected by the exceptionally harsh 
winter weather. Activity in these countries is 
expected to bounce back in the first quarter of 2011. 

In 2010 as a whole, GDP is estimated to have 
grown by 1.8% in the EU and 1.7% in the euro 
area, in line with the autumn forecast.

The economic 
outlook
 for the EU in 2011 has 
slightly improved compared
 to the autumn forecast. 
The upward revision to EU GDP growth is 

supported by slightly better prospects for the global 
economy, in particular in the US, as well as by 
stronger sentiment. Indeed, the elevated levels of 
the Economic Sentiment Indicator as well as of the 
composite PMI suggest solid growth going forward.  
The improved outlook for the external environment 
will provide a boost to EU 
exports, particularly in 
the more export-oriented economies. In line with 
this view, managers' assessment of export order 
books has improved strongly over the last three 

months.  
While 
exports
 should continue supporting the 
recovery going forward, rebalancing of growth 
towards domestic demand is expected for 2011, 

driven by growth in private investment. A better 
export outlook should translate into a stronger 
impetus for 
equipment investment
, which will 
increasingly contribute to growth. In addition to this 
impetus from the export-led industrial rebound, 
equipment investment should benefit from the 

continued improvement in corporate profits, 
stronger order inflows and the low level of stocks, 
as well as from higher capacity utilisation rates, 
now close to their long-term averages. This view is 
supported by the strong bu
siness confidence and the 
latest Commission's investment survey, which 
suggests robust invest
ment plans for 2011. 
Construction investment is, however, projected to 

remain relatively subdued this year due to ongoing 
adjustment in this sector.  
Private consumption
 remained subdued in the 
second half of 2010. Looking ahead, a gradual 

firming is expected this year. The ongoing 
stabilisation in the labour market, the recovery of 
lending to households as well as the continued 

decline of the household saving rate, bode well for 
consumer spending in the near term. In contrast, 
weak real disposable income (dented by higher 

inflation), ongoing deleveraging and still muted 
consumer confidence are expected to weigh on 
private consumption over
 the forecast horizon. 
 Growth forecast for the EU economy slightly 
revised up For 2011, GDP growth is 
now forecast at 1.8% in 
the EU and 1.6% in the euro
 area. This represents a 
0.1 pp. upward revision compared to the autumn 
forecast in both the EU an
d the euro area, reflecting 
the improved external environment and stronger 

confidence. However, this
 aggregate picture masks 
uneven developments across Member States. In the 
  4 Interim forecast Februar
y 2011 
euro area, Germany is exp
ected to lead the ongoing 
recovery, with GDP growth projected at 2.4%, 
followed by France (1.7%) 
while Spain's recovery 
remains muted (0.8%). Ou
tside the euro area, 
growth in Poland and the UK is respectively 
projected at 4.1% and 2.0%. All these 
developments confirm the Commission's 

expectation of a multi-speed recovery within the 
EU. As argued in previous forecast documents, this 
is not surprising given differences in the scale of 

adjustment challenges and ongoing rebalancing 
within the EU and euro area. 
 Headline inflation up while core remains low  In line with expectations, 
consumer price
 inflation
 increased moderately in the course of 2010, 
reflecting a rise in global commodity prices, 
changes in taxation and administered prices, as well 

as the impact of upward base effects from the food 
and energy components.  
In the last quarter of 2010, headline HICP inflation 
in the EU (at 2.4%) and euro area (at 2.0%) was 

higher than expected in 
the autumn forecast. To a 
large extent this can be attributed to the surge in 
commodity prices toward
s the end of the year. 
Upstream pressures have also been building up 
gradually from producer prices. Nevertheless, 
core 
inflation
 (i.e. all items excluding energy and 
unprocessed food) has remained low (1.0% on 
average in 2010), and the underlying inflation 
pressure has been contained, supported by moderate 

wage developments across EU Member States.  
The generally feeble labour-market conditions kept 
wage growth
 subdued in the euro
 area in the third 
quarter of 2010. At the same time, annual unit-
labour-cost growth remained negative for the third 
consecutive quarter, reflecting a cyclical 

improvement in productivity and only moderate 
growth in compensation per employee. The 
situation varied largely,
 however, across Member 
States. Looking ahead, compared to the autumn forecast 
headline inflation for 2011 has been revised up by 
0.4 pp. both in the EU and the euro area and is now 

expected to reach 2.5% an
d 2.2%, respectively. On 
a quarterly basis, the outlook is for a peak in 
headline inflation in the fi
rst quarter of 2011 at 
2¾% in the EU (2¼% in
 the euro area) and a 
gradual decrease towards 2% in both zones by the 
end of the year. This prof
ile reflects the diminishing 
effects of pass-through from both the surge in 
commodity prices at the 
turn of the year and 
statistical base effects exerting a downward 

pressure on inflation for most of 2011.  
Within the euro area, th
e projected 1 pp. annual 
revision for Spain stands out. Unlike in other 
Member States covered by the interim forecast, 

inflation in Spain is driven not only by commodity 
prices but even more so by the impact of the 
planned increases in indirect taxes and administered 

prices. Outside the euro area, inflation has been 
revised up on account of changes in indirect 
taxation and commodity prices, as well as due to 

a stronger-than-expect
ed pass-through of 
exchange-rate changes to headline inflation (in the 
case of the UK).

Despite the upward revisions to headline inflation 
mentioned above, the underlying inflation trends 
identified in the autumn forecast remain valid. The 
lingering slack in the economy and weak labour-

market conditions are 
expected to keep the 
underlying inflationary pressures contained. 
Nevertheless, core inflation is expected to rise 

slowly in line with the pick-up in activity and 
possibly due to higher imported inflation from 
emerging-market economies. The headline rate may 

prove to be volatile in the course of 2011, driven by 
changes in commodity prices related to the outlook 
for advanced economies, geopolitical tensions and 
base effects.

 Ongoing recovery prepares ground for labour 
market improvements  With the recovery in its third year, 
labour-market
 conditions in the EU and 
the euro area are showing 
signs of improvement, thereby following the usual 
and expected pattern of lagging response to 
developments in GDP. Already since mid-2009 the 

labour input in terms of hours worked in the euro 
area has moved up and since the beginning of last 
year also the number of employed persons has 

stabilised, having recorded a moderate increase in 
the first three quarters. 
Mirroring these developments, the unemployment 
rate has been almost stab
le since mid-2010, staying 
at around 9½ percent in the EU and at around 10% 

in the euro area. With the recovery continuing on a 
solid footing, improvemen
ts are expected for the 
period ahead. Both survey indicators of firms' 

employment expectations as well as the PMI 
employment index support this positive outlook for 
the euro area and the EU. But improvements will be 

moderate and unevenly distributed, in particular 
with gains in Germany and a continuation of the 
difficult situation in Spain. 
Turning to 
public finances,
 the bulk of 
consolidation measures affecting 2011 had already 
been taken into account in
 the autumn forecast. 
Only a few Member States announced or 

implemented additional consolidation measures 
since then. The limited size of these measures, 
combined with the slightly improved growth 

outlook should not lead to any major revision of the 
public finances this year. A full assessment of 
prospects for public finances and the labour market 
will be carried out in the Commission's upcoming 
spring forecast. 
Elevated uncertainly, but risks still broadly 
balanced  Amid still high uncertainty, risks to the EU growth 
outlook at the current juncture appear broadly 
balanced for 2011.  
On the 
upside
, stronger global growth Œ beyond that 
allowed for in the baseline Œ would further benefit 
EU export growth. Also, the impetus from export-
led industrial rebound to domestic demand could 
prove stronger than assumed. Moreover, the strong 
business confidence could translate into stronger 

domestic demand than cu
rrently projected. A 
further upside risk relates to the spill-over from 
stronger activity in Germany to other Member 

States, which could materialise to a greater extent 
than expected at present.  
On the 
downside
, the still relatively fragile 
financial-market situation remains a concern. 

Tensions in some segments of the financial 
markets, though easing, remain, and potential spill-
over to other market segments and to the real 

economy cannot be ruled out. These concerns 
would be aggravated in cas
e of further increases in 
long-term government bond yields. Significant 

fiscal sustainability issues are yet to be tackled in 
key countries outside the EU. Another downside 
risk relates to renewed increases in commodity 

prices, negatively affecting disposable incomes and 
thereby private consumption. Finally, the fiscal 
consolidation in a number
 of Member States may 
weigh more on domestic demand than currently 
envisaged. 
Risks to the 
inflation outlook
 in 2011 seem 
somewhat tilted to the upside, on account of 
ongoing geopolitical tensions in the MENA region. 
While the considerable slack remaining in the 

economy and well-anchored inflation expectations 
should keep underlying inflation in check, the 
upward pressures on non-core HICP components, 

stemming from the developments in commodity 
prices could come to the 
fore more than currently 
projected. Should geopolitical tensions spread 

further in the MENA region, disruptions to oil 
supply could not be excluded, fuelling oil-price 
increases beyond what is 
assumed in this forecast. 
  6 Interim forecast Februar
y 2011 
Growth and inflation prospects in the seven 
largest Member States  
1. Germany Œ robust and broad-based 
recovery continues The German economy rebounded strongly from the 
recession, with real GDP estimated to have 
increased by 3.6% in 2010, the highest growth rate 
since the early 1990s. Exports expanded buoyantly, 

largely reversing the massive decline recorded in 
2009 and paving the way for a broader-based 
recovery of the German economy. Indeed, the 

highest growth contribution came from domestic 
demand (2.5 pps., including inventories). 
Catching-up effects after th
e crisis, increased public 
spending on infrastructure and rapidly increasing 
capacity utilisation led to a rebound in investment, 
while private consumption was supported by the 

robust performance of the labour market as 
evidenced by rising empl
oyment and hours worked. 
As expected in the autumn, the pace of economic 
expansion slowed somewhat in the second half of 
the year, with real GDP 
expanding by 0.7% in the 
third and 0.4% q-o-q in 
the fourth quarter. The 
slightly stronger-than-expected slowdown in the 
final quarter reflected the exceptionally harsh 

weather conditions. These hit investment most 
severely, notably activity in the construction sector.  
A marked technical rebound in the first quarter of 
2011 is expected to reverse the latest development. 
In the following quarters, economic activity should 
continue to expand steadily,
 confirming the outlook 
for a broad-based recovery. Further gradual 
employment gains and a pick-up in wage growth 
should underpin the momentum of private 

consumption. Likewise, full order books, 
favourable real interest
 rates and lower capital 
exports after the end of asset booms abroad 

contributing to the absence of credit supply 
bottlenecks, should further sustain domestic 
investment. While slowing somewhat compared to 
2010, exports should continue to benefit from 
expanding world trade.  
The improved outlook for trading partners 
compared to the autumn
 forecast, record-high 
business confidence and the technical rebound at 

the beginning of the year, 
imply that real GDP is 
now projected to expand by 2.4% in 2011, despite 
the statistical carry-over from 2010 being slightly 

lower than previously forecast. 
HICP inflation surprised on the upside in the last 
quarter of 2010 and in January 2011, essentially 
reflecting higher-than-expect
ed energy prices. High 
oil prices should continue to exert upward pressure 

in 2011, with headline in
flation now expected at 
2.2% for the year as a whole. However, core 
inflation should remain contained and, although 

wages are expected to grow more buoyantly, the 
impact on unit labour costs should remain limited, 
given sound productivity growth. 
 2. Spain Œ external demand sustains economic 
activity Quarterly real GDP in Spain increased by 0.2% in 
the fourth quarter of 2010, after having remained 
flat in the third quarter. 
For the year as a whole, 
economic activity is estimated to have contracted 

by 0.1%, slightly less than expected in the autumn 
forecast. Domestic demand is set to have dragged 
down GDP growth by 1¼ pps., while net external 

demand contributed positively by around 1 pp. 
Annual real GDP growth is
 projected at 0.8% in 
2011. Net exports will continue to provide a 
significant positive contribution to growth, while 

the drag from domestic demand will be smaller than 
in 2010. Domestic demand is expected to remain 
weak this year as unemployment remains at a 

record high, residential construction adjusts further, 
the deleveraging of households and firms continues, 
and the public sector restraints consumption and 

investment expenditures. Progress in fiscal 
consolidation and structural reforms in the labour 
market, pension system and banking sector has had 

a positive impact on sentiment in the Spanish 
sovereign bond market. Nevertheless, overall credit 
conditions in the private sector have become 
tighter. A further moderate decline in the household 
savings ratio from the 2009 peak will nevertheless 

allow modest growth of private consumption. 
Improvements in industry confidence and, more 
specifically, in export orde
r books, suggest that the 
recovery of external demand at the end of 2010 will 
continue in 2011. This w
ill provide some support to 
private investment.  
Exports in 2011 are expected
 to grow faster than 
previously forecast, in 
line with the improved 
outlook for global demand and some improvement 
in cost competitiveness. With import growth 

projected to remain subdued
 amidst weak domestic 
    7Interim forecast Februar
y 2011
demand, the current-account deficit is set to narrow 
further. 
Inflation increased significantly in the last quarter 
of 2010 and was above 3% in January 2011. This is 
partly explained by the surge in energy prices. 

However, the hike in VAT in July 2010, higher 
taxes on tobacco introduced in December and a rise 
in administered electricity
 prices also played an 
important role. Headline HICP inflation is projected 
to be just below 2½% on average in 2011. Core 
inflation is set to remain subdued, on the back of 

expected weak demand and still moderate unit-
labour-cost developments.

3. France Œ recovery taking hold, domestic 
demand getting firmer Throughout 2010, support to activity from 
temporary factors, which kick-started the economic 
recovery, gradually disappeared: the destocking 

cycle ended and stimulus pa
ckages Œ especially car 
scrapping schemes Œ in France and in neighbouring 
countries were mostly phased out. Domestic 
demand, France™s traditional growth engine, 
contributed 1 pp. to 2010 growth. In particular, 

investment finally picked up in the second quarter 
of 2010, after having decreased for eight 
consecutive quarters. Net trad
e (0.4 pp.) and stocks 
(0.1 pp.) contributed positively to growth in 2010. 
Overall, GDP growth came out at 1.6% in 2010. 
The short-run prospect
s for activity appear 
favourable. Business climate indicators have shown 
a strong acceleration for 
the latest months, in 
particular as regards industrial activity but also 
services (notably wholesale and retail trade 
sectors). All business climate indicators stand now 
above their historical av
erage, and point to an 
acceleration, except in the construction sector. The 

capacity utilisation rate is back to the levels 
recorded in summer 2008 and closer to its long-
term average. In this context, investment is set to 

strengthen, benefitting from low interest rates and 
the fact that firms shou
ld realise investment 
projects put on hold during the crisis. Exports are 

also set to benefit from strong growth in 
neighbouring countries, especially in Germany. 
Regarding more specifically the first quarter, the 

end of the car-scrapping premium still had a short-
term positive impact in the first weeks, due to the 
delay between orders passed and production in 

plants. GDP is thus expected to grow by 0.6% q-o-q 
in the first quarter, before returning to more 
subdued growth rates in the subsequent quarters 

(0.3%, 0.3% and 0.4% respectively). This easing is 
expected against the back
ground of low household 
confidence, still high unemployment and fiscal 
consolidation (in particular measures related to 
reductions in tax expenditure and the slowdown of 

the public wage bill). All in all, growth is projected 
at 1.7% for 2011 as a whole. 
While core inflation is ex
pected to stay close to 
1½% in 2011, headline 
HICP will be sizeably 
higher since oil and agri
cultural commodity prices 
have gone up significantly (the latter having a 

smaller impact). This transl
ates into an annual rate 
of 2.0%. 
 4. Italy Œ the moderate recovery continues to 
be export-led The Italian economy is experiencing a moderate 
recovery after the severe
 output losses recorded 
during the 2008-09 crisis. In
 2010 as a whole, real 
GDP expanded by 1.1% according to preliminary 

estimates. Quarter-on-qua
rter GDP growth reached 
around ½% in each of the first two quarters, then 
eased to 0.3% in the third 
and decelerated further to 
0.1% in the fourth quarter due to less buoyant 
external demand and the expiry of tax incentives for 
investment in equipment at the end of June.  
Supported by sustained global demand, exports are 
expected to continue driving the recovery also in 
2011. This is in line with business confidence 
indicators that point to healthy expansion in the 
manufacturing sector. By contrast, still weak

y 2011 
labour- market conditions and higher imported 
inflation are set to dampen private consumption 
dynamics. Investment is expected to grow 
moderately. On the one hand, it is set to benefit 

from improved profitability and credit conditions. 
On the other hand, still low levels of capacity 
utilisation leave little scope for new investment 

plans. Overall, GDP growth 
in 2011 is projected at 
the same rate as in 2010 (1.1%), confirming the 
autumn 2010 forecast, w
ith quarter-on-quarter 
growth at around 0.3-0.4% throughout the year.  
After a sizeable decline in
 2009, HICP inflation 
increased to 1.6% on average in 2010. The 

acceleration of prices in 
the last quarter of 2010 
was mainly due to the d
ynamics of the energy 
component, amplified by a base effect from 2009. 

In 2011, HICP inflation is
 expected to reach 2.2% 
on average. This is a 0.4 pp. upward revision 
compared to the autumn 
2010 forecast attributable 
to the assumption of higher oil prices, while no 
major second-round effect
s are expected, mainly 
thanks to the reformed wage bargaining framework 
that uses forecast HICP inflation excluding prices 
of imported energy as a benchmark.  
 5. The Netherlands Œ consumption crucial for 
continued recovery The economic recovery that started in the second 
half of 2009 came to a sudden halt in the third 
quarter of 2010, largel
y due to a significant 
negative contribution from stocks to real GDP 
growth. In the fourth quarter, the economy started 
to grow again, with real
 GDP increasing by 0.6% q-
o-q. In 2010 as a whole, economic growth is 
expected to have reached 1.7%, with domestic 
demand and net exports contributing by 0.7% and 

1.0% respectively.  
For 2011, economic activity 
is forecast to continue 
growing at the modest pace of 1.7%. Exports, the 
traditional driver of the Dutch economy, are likely 

to contribute only moderately to growth in 2011. 
Furthermore, domestic demand growth, despite 
returning to positive territory in 2011, is set to be 

slowed down by several factors. Firstly, from 2011 
on, the fiscal stimulus measures will be phased out. 
In addition, the government has embarked on an 

ambitious consolidation strategy. For investment, 
the outlook remains rather weak. Despite strong 
improvements in industrial
 sentiment, the capacity 
utilisation rate stabilised in recent quarters at 
around 78%, still significantly below the pre-crisis 
level of around 82%. This suggests that growth in 
private investment could be limited to replacement 
investments, as there is no need yet to increase total 

capacity. Furthermore, the recent tightening of 
criteria for credit approval 
by banks to corporations 
and the rise in long-term interest rates also do not 

support the outlook for private investment. In this 
context, the continuation of the recovery will 
crucially depend on developments in private 

consumption. As modest wage increases and higher 
inflation put real disposable income under pressure, 
it is unlikely that consumption will be able to play a 

pivotal role in this respect. However, a positive 
impact could come from the labour market, where 
developments, in particular in unemployment, 

continue to outperform expectations.  
The annual HICP inflation rate came in at 0.9% in 
2010 and is expected to rise to 1.7% in 2011. The 
projected increase mainly 
results from the recent 
rise in oil and food pri
ces, which are expected to 
mostly feed through in the HICP in the first half of 
2011 as they tend to have lagged effects on 
inflation in the Netherlands.  
 6. Poland Œ accelerating domestic demand 
supports rebound Economic activity accelerated 
in the third quarter of 
2010, with real GDP grow
th reaching 1.3% q-o-q, 
while in the last quarter of 2010 it is estimated to 

have increased by 0.9% q-o-q. Continued robust 
performance in the second 
half of the year can be 
attributed to strong consumer spending, as 

households brought forward some of their spending 
from 2011 in fear of tax and price hikes.  
For 2010 as a whole, real
 GDP grew by 3.8%, one 
of the highest growth rates in the EU. This was 
mainly due to a sharp rebound in world trade in the 
first half of the year, fuelling manufacturing activity 

and resilient consumer spending, resulting from 
improving confidence as the 
labour market survived 
the crisis broadly unscathed. However, private 

investment continued to suffer from uncertainties 
regarding the global recovery, despite the strong 
financial position of the corporate sector and 

increasing capacity utilisation levels. All in all, real 
GDP growth in 2010 was driven by domestic 
demand, predominantly private consumption and 

inventories, while the contribution of net exports 
remained broadly neutral throughout the year. 
    9Interim forecast Februar
y 2011
Quarterly real GDP growth is projected to ease 
further to 0.8% q-o-q in the first quarter of 2011, as 
VAT increases and inflati
on pick-up are expected 
to hamper temporarily private consumption. Real 

GDP growth is likely to remain stable at around 1% 
q-o-q thereafter, driven by improving domestic 
demand. In particular, business climate indicators, 

rising above their historical
 recovery levels, suggest 
improved outlook in the private sector. In addition 
to the impact of strong public spending in 

infrastructure, investment growth will also be 
pushed up by accelerating private investment. 
Moreover, moderate employment growth and the 

stronger-than-expected pick-up in wages are likely 
to support consumer spending, despite levelling-off 
consumer confidence and higher inflation rates. 

However, the inventory build-up is set to become 
less supportive after its strong contribution to 
growth in 2010. For 2011 as a whole, GDP is 

projected to grow by 4.1%.  
HICP inflation reached 2.6%
 y-o-y in 2
010, on the 
back of rising commodity pr
ices. It is expected to 
hover around the upper bound of central bank's 
inflation target of 3.5% in the first half of 2011, 
reflecting rising commodity prices and improving 

domestic demand, and gradually ease thereafter.  
 7. United Kingdom Œ negative shock in the last 
quarter of 2010 but economy should recover In the fourth quarter of 2010, UK GDP fell by 0.5% 
q-o-q, following rapid growth earlier in the year of 

1.1% in the second and 0.7% in the third quarter. 
The autumn forecast had predicted growth of 0.6% 
in the fourth qu
arter. December's bad weather was a 
factor in curtailing the small construction boom and 
likely forced the contraction in distribution, hotels 

and restaurants, and transport. However, business 
services and finance Œ less obviously weather-
linked Œ also declined (-0
.7%). The UK Office for 
National Statistics estimated that GDP would have 
been "flattish" without the snow-effect. 2010 annual 
growth is estimated at 1.4%, with 1 pp. negative 

contribution of net exports.
  While the fourth quarter's poor performance 
reduces the expected level of 2011 output slightly, 
it improves growth prospects for the first half of 

2011 as snow-hit sectors return to normal and 
postponed construction activity catches up. The 
growth forecasts for the 
first and second quarter 
have therefore been revised up to 1.0% and 0.6% 
respectively. Otherwise the quarterly profile 
remains unchanged, yielding 2011 annual growth of 
2.0%, only slightly below the autumn forecast 

reflecting a lower carry-over from 2010. Growth in 
2011 should be driven by net exports and corporate 
investment, offsetting falling government 

consumption. Private consumption growth is likely 
to be weak but still positive, in spite of contracting 
real wages, as consumers prop up spending by 

reducing savings. Exports should improve given 
sterling's stability well below pre-crisis levels and 
strength in some major export markets, particularly 

the US. Stronger export
s, a credible policy 
environment and investment levels well below pre-
crisis peaks should supp
ort corporate investment, 
expected to gather pace in
 2011, financed by the 
high savings accumulated 
in the corporate sector.

2010Last observation (December 2010/ January flash 
2011)Source: European Commission 
Annual HICP inflation has continued to surprise on 
the upside, reaching 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 

2010, above the 2.9% projected in the autumn 
forecast. Transport costs, housing and household 
services were the main contributors to the 
December increase. Retailers may also have 
increased prices before the January VAT rise. 
However, there is still little evidence of second-
round effects as wage growth remains low and 
inflation expectations st
ay below crisis peaks. 
Inflation may increase further in early 2011, but 
should fall later in the year as spare capacity holds 
down domestic prices, and the sterling depreciation 

and commodity price rises no longer affect the 
annual comparison.

BOX: TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO THE INTERIM FORECAST
 Technical background In February 2006, the Commission presented the first of 
what are now twice-yearly interim forecasts with the 
objective of updating its comprehensive spring and 
autumn economic forecasts (w
ith the next fully-fledged 
forecast scheduled for 13 May 2011). This interim 
forecast updates the outlook of the autumn 2010 
economic forecast of 29 November 2010. The cut-off 
date for this interim forecast to take new information on 
board was 15 February 2011. 
The interim forecast updates the outlook for the largest 
seven EU Member States, i.e. Germany, Spain, France, 
Italy, the Netherlands, Po
land and the United Kingdom 
(which are the largest in the EU based on an average of 
the ranking in terms of both population and nominal 
GDP). The update covers real GDP growth and HICP 
inflation for the current year
. These updates are prepared 
using indicator-based fore
casting models and/or 
judgemental forecasting techniques.  
Estimates for the European Union and the euro area are 
prepared using the nominal GDP-weighted updates for 
the largest Member States. In terms of nominal GDP, 
these countries account for 79% of the European Union, 
while the five euro-area Member States account for 83% 

of the euro-area aggregate. The outlook for the smaller 
Member States has not been individually updated. The 
Commission has made projections for the euro area and 
the EU using the updates for the five and seven largest 
Member States respectively, and assuming that the 
revisions to GDP and inflat
ion for the smaller Member 
States are proportionate to those of the larger ones. 
Quarterly data are updated with the latest available 
information. When comparing quarterly with annual GDP 
growth it must be kept in mind that, whenever possible, 
quarterly data are adjusted for both seasonal influences 
and the number of working days while annual data is 
presented in unadjusted form. Calendar factors are, 
however, relatively small in 2011 and amount to -0.1 pp. 
External conditions  This forecast is based on a 
set of external assumptions. 
Technical assumptions are used for interest rates, oil 
prices and exchange rates. Except for the latter, these 
assumptions are based on market
 expectations at the time 
of the forecast. To shield these assumptions from possible 
volatility during one specific tr
ading day, averages from a 
10-day reference period have been used.  
The technical assumption as regards exchange rates has 
been standardised using fixed nominal exchange rates for 
all currencies. They are kept constant based on the 
averages from 10 working days up to 11 February, 
implying e.g. an annual aver
age of USD/EUR of 1.36.  
Interest-rate assumptions are, since spring 2007, 
market-based instead of expert-based. These assumptions 
should be interpreted with caution, as market-based 
assumptions do not only reflec
t policy rate expectations, 
but also liquidity conditions in a period of market 
uncertainty. Short-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts.
 Long-term interest rates 
for the euro area, as well as 
short- and long-term interest 
rates for Poland and the UK are calculated using implicit 
forward swap rates, corrected for the spread between the 
3-month interbank interest rate and the 3-month 
swap-rate. In this forecast, the euro-area short-term rate is 
assumed to be at 1.5% and th
e long-term interest rates at 
3.4% in 2011. 
The outlook for oil prices is based on futures prices. The 
price per barrel of Brent crude oil is projected at 101.6 
USD/barrel in 2011 (corresponding to 74.7 EUR/barrel). 
This would be 12.7 USD/barrel higher (or 10.7 

EUR/barrel higher) than assumed in the autumn 2010 
forecast.  
Global demand in 2011 is revised upwards, following the 
improved outlook for US growth and a rebound in world 
trade and industrial production. Global GDP growth, 
excluding the EU, is now forecast to reach 4.8% in 2011, 
about ¼ pp. more than expected in the autumn forecast. 
World trade is set to rise moderately in 2011, with growth 
in export and import volumes (excluding the EU) 
estimated at around 7½% (down from about 8% in the 
autumn forecast).
