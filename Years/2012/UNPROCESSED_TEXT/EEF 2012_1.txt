EDITORIAL
The EU economy continues to deal with a difficult post-financial crisis correction, which bears heavily on
its growth and employment performance. This forecast has been prepared against a mixed background of
mostly disappointing hard data and survey indicators since our spring forecast, encouraging signs of
progressing economic adjustment in Member States and important policy advances. Wide cross-country
divergences in economic activity and labour market dynamics have opened, originating primarily in
varying needs for public- and private-sector deleveraging and for reallocation of resources across sectors,
but also in large disparities in financing conditions. The distress in more vulnerable Member States has
progressively started to affect the remainder of the Union.
The aggravation of the sovereign-debt crisis in the first half of the year, with rising market concerns about
the long-term viability of the euro area and negative feedbacks between banks' funding pressures and
economic activity, and to a lesser extent the unexpected slowdown in non-EU GDP growth and global
trade, are the main reasons for the disappointing growth performance in 2012. Due to the weak starting
point, the gradual recovery setting in in 2013 will result in a low annual GDP growth rate of ½% for 2013
in the EU, while GDP in the euro area will remain unchanged. GDP growth is forecast to rise in 2014 to
around 1½% in the EU and the euro area, with domestic demand returning to provide a positive
contribution to growth on the back of an expected normalisation of financing conditions, a stabilisation of
sectoral balance sheets and returning confidence. The weak short-term growth outlook raises concerns for
the labour markets, where a further rise in the already high unemployment rate next year appears likely.
Bold reforms are needed to prevent a prolonged period of high unemployment, which would bring social
hardship and a destruction of human capital detrimental to longer-term growth.
Two elements instil a degree of moderate optimism going forward. First, major policy decisions have
significantly reduced tail risks and relieved market stress. The June European Council decisions were
swiftly followed up with concrete progress towards establishing a Banking Union. The European Council
of 18-19 October agreed on a timetable for the establishment of a Single Supervisory Mechanism and
advanced further on the deepening of EMU, encompassing the financial, budgetary, economic, and
political dimensions. The introduction of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) by the ECB
complemented these institutional efforts, contributing decisively to removing doubts about the integrity
and viability of the euro area. As a result, funding constraints for the public and private sectors are easing
up, although difficulties in parts of the banking sector are likely to continue to weigh on credit supply.
Second, economic adjustment within the euro area is continuing. This is most visible in the reduction of
large current-account deficits driven by partly permanent declines in domestic absorption and gains in
competitiveness, but is also apparent in gradually rising wages and domestic demand in surplus countries.
Internal and external adjustment has farther to go, and it will have to be sustained over time to see an
impact on stocks of domestic and external liabilities. The speed and the short-term economic costs of the
adjustment depend on the degree of wage and price flexibility within economies and on their capacity to
reallocate resources across sectors. Continued structural reforms in deficit countries and a shift towards
more domestic demand-based growth in surplus economies are expected to contribute to intra-euro-area
rebalancing in the coming years. By boosting confidence and providing investors with a longer-term
perspective, swift progress towards completing EMU's architecture would help overcome market
fragmentation, increase the incentive to invest in weaker economies and ensure more balanced financing
conditions, hence supporting the process of rebalancing.

OVERVIEW
Moderate recovery
expected to start in
2013

The ongoing post-financial crisis correction continues to weigh heavily on
economic activity and employment in the EU. In the first half of 2012,
domestic demand has continued to contract while the global economy has
also slowed down, and consumers as well as firms have become more
pessimistic about the near-term perspectives. The EU economy has dipped
back into contraction in the second quarter with further weakness expected in
the second half of the year. Unemployment has risen and cross-country
divergences have widened. Yet, compared with the situation before the
summer, over the last few months financial tensions have somewhat abated.
A return to moderate growth is projected in the first half of 2013. The full
implementation of far-reaching policy measures announced over recent
months and progress with the correction of imbalances should reduce
financial stress in vulnerable Member States further and lead to a gradual
restoration of confidence across the EU, which is necessary for investment
and private consumption to return. As the current weakness of global demand
is expected to be temporary, net exports are projected to provide some

1

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

impetus for the recovery of investment, later spilling over to consumption.
Domestic demand continues to be held back by the legacy of the crisis of
2008-09 as households, banks and sovereigns are simultaneously reducing
their leverage. At the same time, resources in countries that ran large currentaccount deficits before the crisis need to be reallocated from the production
of goods and services for domestic consumption towards tradables. As this
adjustment is progressing, an improvement of deficit countries' economic
performance is expected to lead to some growth convergence towards the end
of the forecast horizon.

2

The global economy
has decelerated …

Global GDP growth has lost steam in the course of 2012, and leading
indicators point to further weakness in the remainder of this year. Among the
largest non-EU advanced economies, Japan's post-disaster recovery is
pausing, while in the US growth appears to be gradually firming after a
protracted period of subdued performance. However, the uncertainty related
to the path of US fiscal policy over the coming months remains high. At the
same time, many emerging market economies have recently been moving
towards a more moderate rate of economic expansion, which in part reflects
the slowdown in the EU and other advanced economies, but also domestic
weakness. With growth set to strengthen gradually in non-EU advanced
economies and expected to become more balanced in emerging markets,
world growth outside the EU is projected to go through a soft patch rather
than a prolonged period of weakness and to recover somewhat in the course
of 2013 reaching an annual rate of 4%. A further moderate acceleration is
projected for 2014. In line with global GDP, world trade growth has been
decelerating through 2012, but is expected to recover gradually in 2013 and
2014.

… and GDP in the EU
has been falling

In Europe, economic sentiment resumed its decline, dropping significantly in
the summer months. After stagnation in the first quarter of 2012, the EU and
euro-area economies contracted in the second quarter reflecting a decrease in
domestic demand and lower net export growth. Unemployment increased
further, in particular in the countries that were hardest hit by the sovereigndebt crisis. Available hard data and leading indicators point to a weak second
half of the year. For 2012 as a whole, GDP is now expected to contract by
¼% in the EU and almost ½% in the euro area.

Policy has helped
calming financial
markets…

After a few months of respite brought about mainly by the provision of
longer-term liquidity by the Eurosystem in early 2012, the sovereign-debt
crisis intensified again in spring. However, financial markets have recovered
since July, helped by important policy decisions in the EU and the
announcement of further monetary easing on both sides of the Atlantic.
Sovereign yields in most vulnerable countries have receded somewhat since
summer. Risk appetite appears to have improved as stock markets have
recuperated the losses experienced earlier in the year. The ECB measures
explicitly aim at repairing the monetary transmission mechanism. However,
data available for the euro area so far do not show any easing of credit supply
conditions for the private sector.

… preparing the
ground for modest
growth to resume in
the course of 2013 …

Conditional on the assumption that the policy measures agreed at EU and
Member-State levels will be implemented smoothly and that this will lead to
a gradual restoration of confidence, GDP in the EU and the euro area is
expected to start growing again after the turn of the year and progressively
move towards a moderate expansion. Given the weak starting point, GDP in
2013 as a whole is projected to grow by only ½% in the EU and to remain

Overview

broadly stable in the euro area. The legacy of the deep financial and
sovereign-debt crisis will continue to weigh on the pace of growth over the
forecast horizon. However, positive results from the ongoing adjustment of
imbalances and recently undertaken structural reforms are expected to start
materialising in 2014. Growth in 2014 is therefore expected to be more
robust and also better balanced. Nonetheless, at a projected rate of 1½% in
both the EU and the euro area, it will remain well below pre-crisis levels.
… with net exports as
main driver …

Domestic demand has made negative contributions to GDP growth for more
than a year and is likely to do so also in the second half of 2012 and well into
the first half of 2013. This leaves net exports, which are set to benefit from a
gradual recovery of global demand, as the only positive contributor to GDP
growth in the EU for some more quarters to come.

… and domestic
demand set to
recover only slowly

Private consumption, by far the largest component of domestic demand, is
expected to stagnate in the EU and to decrease in the euro area in 2013, as
real disposable incomes remain under pressure from a further contraction of
employment, low real wage growth and higher taxes. Households are on
average not expected to reduce their savings in the downturn. In fact, the
downward pressure on the saving rate stemming from consumption
smoothing and a growing proportion of households that find it hard to put
money aside is expected to be offset by higher precautionary savings and the
continued need in some Member States to reduce a high level of household
debt.
In line with the ongoing fiscal consolidation, government consumption is
expected to contract moderately in 2013. There are somewhat better
prospects for an earlier recovery of investment. Gross fixed capital formation
has been held back by overcapacities and the worsening outlook for GDP.
However, with low financing costs in the EU as a whole and good selffinancing capacities of non-financial corporations, equipment investment is
set to pick up supported by the expected recovery of global demand and
restoration of confidence in the EU. This being said, tight credit supply
conditions in some Member States are likely to limit the projected expansion
of domestic demand there.

Unemployment to rise
further in 2013

The slowdown is set to affect employment with the usual lags. Employment
in the EU is projected to contract by another ¼% in 2013 after a fall of ½%
this year, also because firms now have less scope to react to the demand
shortfall by reducing working hours than during the 2008-09 recession. With
the projected turnaround of GDP growth in 2013, employment should
stabilise towards the end of next year. However, the moderate growth
projected for 2014 will generate only modest employment gains, which are
expected to remain below the employment losses incurred in 2012 and 2013.
Unemployment is thus expected to peak at 11% in the EU and 12% in the
euro area in 2013 before falling back slightly in 2014.

Growth differentials
across Member States
remain substantial …

Member States' performance is set to differ strongly this year and next.
Heterogeneity in GDP and employment developments results from varying
adjustment needs following the imbalances in the run-up to the crisis. In
particular, the health of banking sectors and public finances as well as private
debt and external deficits differ considerably across countries. While being
low for the EU as a whole, financing costs have continued to diverge across
Member States. However, due to the pervasive interconnections within the
EU and especially the euro area, no country is expected to power ahead in a
permanent decoupling.

3

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

The German economy is expected to slow down further in the second half of
2012, reflecting weaker economic activity in export markets and uncertainty
weighing on investment, before accelerating moderately next year, thanks to
relatively robust consumption and benign financial conditions. The projection
for France is for a very modest growth in 2013 as domestic demand is set to
strengthen only very gradually while the contribution of net exports is likely
to remain small. In Italy, the contraction of economic activity is forecast to
last until mid-2013 before domestic demand slowly recovers, helped by the
expected improvement in financing conditions and a return of confidence. As
the Spanish economy is working its way through the rebalancing process,
domestic demand is expected to remain depressed before picking up towards
the end of the forecast horizon, while external trade continues to provide
some relief. Ongoing deleveraging is also set to weigh on domestic demand
in the Netherlands, where GDP growth is expected to remain subdued in
2013 before accelerating somewhat in the outer forecast year.
Among the largest Member States outside the euro area, the United Kingdom
is expected to see an improvement in disposable incomes and financing
conditions, which should allow a gradual return of domestic demand growth
in 2013 and an acceleration in 2014. For Poland, a deceleration from
previous growth rates is projected as external headwinds and the stagnation
in the labour market take their toll.

4

… as adjustment is
gradually proceeding
…

The adjustment of the remaining imbalances is subject to a number of
challenging interdependencies such as the feedback loop between banks and
sovereigns, the impact on domestic demand of simultaneous debt
deleveraging in several sectors and difficult conditions for financing the
necessary shift of resources towards the production of tradable goods and
services. Nonetheless, adjustment is moving ahead, underpinned by a
reduction in domestic demand in deficit countries that is partly cyclical and
partly structural as well as gradual changes in relative costs and prices across
sectors and countries. Progress with adjustment is expected to contribute to
some convergence of growth rates towards the end of the forecast horizon.

… and fiscal
consolidation
advances

Despite the deterioration of the economic situation in 2012, fiscal deficits are
still expected to fall to 3½% of GDP in the EU and 3¼% in the euro area on
the back of consolidation plans implemented in the course of the year. The
available information from budgets for 2013 points to continued, though
somewhat slower, consolidation with headline deficits projected at 3¼% of
GDP in the EU and 2½% in the euro area. A moderate decrease in the pace of
fiscal consolidation is also reflected in the structural improvements of the
budget balance, which in the EU is expected at 1 pp. of GDP in 2012 and
¾ pp. in 2013, and in the euro area at 1¼ pps. and just below 1 pp.,
respectively. The growth effect of a given consolidation effort depends on a
number of factors (such as the composition of the fiscal effort, the credibility
of the adjustment and financing conditions of the private sector), and it may
currently be larger than in normal times in countries hit hard by the
sovereign-debt crisis. The design of fiscal measures as well as their credible
medium-term orientation are crucial to mitigate this impact.

Inflation set to
decrease slowly

Consumer price inflation has persisted at around 2¾% in the EU and 2½% in
the euro area in recent quarters, with energy prices, indirect taxes and
administered prices as main drivers. In very volatile commodities markets,
crude oil prices (in euro) are again close to record highs, while food
commodity prices temporarily surged over the summer as draughts in major
production regions caused supply concerns. Commodity prices are however

Overview

assumed to decrease gradually over the forecast horizon, and their impact on
inflation is projected to decline. Similarly, based on the current information
about budget plans, the fiscal impact on prices should fade. Producer price
developments suggest indeed that inflationary pressures are decreasing.
Looking further ahead, projected GDP growth and wage increases are too
modest to create inflationary pressures. Consumer-price inflation is now
projected to decrease to 2% in the EU and 1¾% in the euro area in 2013 with
a further modest decline in 2014.
Tail risks have receded

Overall, risks to GDP growth appear more balanced than at the time of the
spring forecast, but are still skewed to the downside. While some of the
previously identified risks have materialised, most notably before the summer
the worsening of the sovereign-debt crisis, policy decisions taken over the
past months have also reduced tail risks.
Nonetheless, a resurgent aggravation of the sovereign-debt crisis with grave
consequences for growth and financial stability remains the largest downside
risk. This remains intrinsically linked to the risk of slippage or delay with the
implementation of policy measures agreed at EU/euro-area and MemberState levels. A downside risk also stems from labour markets, where a deeper
drop in employment would weigh on growth prospects going forward. On the
external side, the baseline of a soft patch in global GDP growth could be
challenged by a sharper-than-expected slowdown in emerging market
economies or the materialisation of the "fiscal cliff" in the US with large
confidence spillovers. On the upside, the implementation of recent policy
decisions could lead to financial market stress in the EU fading faster than
projected, and confidence rebounding more strongly, with a positive impact
on the dynamism of domestic demand.
Risks to the inflation outlook continue to be broadly balanced. Inflation could
turn out lower if the large and persistent output gap had a stronger impact
than expected on core inflation. On the upside, further energy-price increases
in an uncertain geopolitical environment and fiscal measures that are not
included in the no-policy-change baseline could lead to higher inflation.

THE EU ECONOMY: SAILING THROUGH ROUGH WATERS

After a tentative stabilisation during the first three months of the year, following a contraction in the
fourth quarter of 2011, the economic situation in the EU remains fragile. Output declined in the period
between April and June and economic activity is expected to be weak in the near future. Alongside
home-grown impediments to growth such as the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area and the
repercussions of external and internal imbalances, the slowdown in the world economy has contributed
to the deterioration.
Against this backdrop, and assuming that policy actions at the European and Member-State level will
continue to rein in the sovereign-debt crisis, thus allowing an easing of financing conditions and a
return of confidence, the EU economy is expected to stabilise at the turn of the year and to embark on a
moderate recovery path thereafter. With strong internal headwinds holding back domestic demand, net
exports are likely to remain the most important growth driver next year. Although external demand is
projected to increase only gradually, coinciding with a gentle reacceleration in global trade, export
growth will be supported by competitiveness gains in some Member States. Further ahead, slowly
returning confidence and easing financing conditions are expected to gradually prop up investment and
private consumption, but weak labour markets and ongoing fiscal consolidation will continue to weigh
on domestic demand over the forecast horizon. Overall, the EU economy is expected to contract by ¼%
this year, followed by subdued annual growth in 2013 (½%) and an expansion of 1½% in 2014 (see
Graph I.1).
Consumer-price inflation in the EU is projected to remain relatively high in 2012 (2.7%), inter alia due
to the impact of fiscal measures, but is expected to abate gradually over the forecast horizon, averaging
2.0% and 1.8% in 2013 and 2014 respectively (see Graph I.2).
Pronounced cross-country divergences will remain a defining feature of the outlook. They span across a
number of dimensions – including financing conditions, the labour market situation and the need for,
and advancement of, private and public-debt deleveraging. Current-account adjustment is forecast to
continue, especially in Member States with large pre-crisis deficits. This adjustment is partly the result
of the cyclical downturn, but is also increasingly supported by the continuing deleveraging of the public
and private sector and structural reforms. The first positive effects of these structural developments on
growth are likely to become visible towards the end of the forecast horizon.
Overall, the central projections foresee a very gradual return to growth, to set in only next year. This
outlook is still surrounded by high uncertainty and subject to substantial downside risks. However, due
mainly to recent policy progress and improvements in financial markets, overall risks are more
balanced than in last spring but are still tilted to the downside. Risks to the inflation outlook appear
broadly balanced.

A MILD RECOVERY AHEAD AMID
CONTINUED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT

Graph I.3:Current-account imbalances, euro area
300

Since the second half of 2011, economic growth
has been weakening in both the EU and the euro
area. In both areas real GDP is around ½% below
its last peak of spring 2011 when a significant
number of Member States had not yet fully
recovered their pre-crisis output levels. In fact,
occasional backslides are not an uncommon
phenomenon
during
post-financial
crisis
recoveries. But at the current juncture, several
Member States, particularly in the euro area, face
structural challenges related to internal and
external
imbalances (1)
alongside
growth
impediments linked to the legacy of the global
financial crisis and compounded by the current
global slowdown.
Internal and external adjustment is advancing

The large internal and external imbalances that
were built up in the years prior to 2007/08 are
being reduced but the adjustment will have to
progress further and needs to be sustained over
time (see also Box I.1). (2) In countries with large
external net liabilities, current-account deficits are
being corrected (see Graph I.3), helped by falls in
wages and relative unit labour costs, even though
the recorded decline in unit labour costs in some
Member States partly results from increasing
labour productivity due to the shedding of lowskilled workers. (3)
In parallel with the adjustment in deficit countries,
the external balances of surplus countries are
declining, albeit at a much slower pace. However,
the increasing weight of domestic demand and the
relatively high wage rises in surplus countries
suggest that the adjustment process within the euro
area is not fully asymmetric.
(1)

(2)

(3)

External imbalances are reflected by unsustainable currentaccount balances, whereas internal imbalances relate to
budget deficits and public debt but also to large debt
overhangs in the private sector.

in the euro area: A model-based analysis, European
Economy, Economic Papers, No. 443, July 2011.

…but it will continue to weigh on short-term
growth.

Balance-sheet adjustments in the household,
corporate and government sector are expected to
shape the outlook over the forecast horizon. (4)
Regaining price competitiveness in the context of a
monetary union implies changes in relative prices
which would induce a shift of resources from the
non-tradable to the tradable sector and the
switching of expenditure to domestically-produced
goods. (5) However, these shifts tend to be
associated with output contractions and rising
unemployment, at least in the short-term, as wages
and prices tend to adjust only gradually. But
ongoing restructuring on the industry level
triggered by structural reforms is expected to lend
additional support to adjustment by strengthening
non-price competitiveness.
Further fiscal consolidation is set to facilitate the
needed reallocation of resources, even though it is
likely to continue to weigh on short-term growth
prospects in several Member States. (6) Fiscal
deficits are being reduced and reforms to the
institutional fiscal framework at both the European

Until 2011 the corporate sector accounted for the major
part of private-sector adjustment in vulnerable Member
States. For an analysis of the drivers of balance-sheet
adjustment in the corporate sector see for example Ruscher,
E. and G. Wolff, Corporate balance sheet adjustment:
Stylised facts, causes and consequences, European
Economy, Economic Papers, No. 449, February 2012.
See Dong, W., The role of expenditure switching in the
global imbalance adjustment, Journal of International
Economics, Vol. 86, No. 2, March 2012, pp. 237-251.
Given that construction and services account for a large
part of public expenditure, cutbacks in government
spending tend to lower the relative price of non-tradable
goods.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

and national level are expected to contribute to
lower structural deficits in the future.
Recent policy measures are easing financial
market stress…

On the policy side, recent measures aimed at
stabilising financial market conditions and
alleviating negative feedback loops between banks
and sovereigns are also contributing to the
adjustment process in vulnerable countries. Policy
measures on the European level, most notably the
decision to move towards a banking union
reflected by the legislative proposal for a single
supervisory mechanism (SSM) for the euro area,
the entry into force of the European Stability
Mechanism (ESM), and the ECB decision to
undertake Outright Monetary Transactions
(OMTs) in secondary markets for sovereign bonds
of euro-area Member States have helped to relieve
market tensions. Conditional on measures
implemented at the national level, these policy
initiatives will also support fiscal consolidation
and private-sector deleveraging. But irrespective of
the progress already achieved on the policy side,
the experience of the past two years shows that
reversals of sentiment can happen very rapidly if
the implementation of measures falters.
…and pave the way for a moderate and multispeed recovery

The gradual reacceleration of the global economy,
easing financial stress and the progressive return of
confidence will allow the euro area and the EU
economy to start growing again in 2013.
Positive results from structural reforms and
internal and external adjustment are expected to
materialise only gradually, but are likely to
become visible towards the end of the forecast
horizon. In particular, sustained gains in
competitiveness and productivity in vulnerable
Member States should lift the EU economy to a
slightly higher growth path. (7)
The divergence in GDP growth rates amongst EU
countries is expected to decrease, but not to
disappear, over the forecast horizon. As a
consequence, countries which recovered relatively
(7)

There is evidence that private-sector deleveraging during
downturns associated with financial crises has a positive
impact on the strength of the subsequent recovery see
Bech, M. L., L. Gambacorta and E. Kharroubi, Monetary
policy in a downturn: Are financial crises special?, BIS
Working Papers, No. 388, September 2012.

quickly after the 2008-09 recession will continue
to outpace countries with below-average growth in
recent years (see Graph I.4).
The expected narrowing of growth differentials
relies on further competitiveness gains in
vulnerable countries and reduced disparities in
financing conditions to the extent that tail risks in
the euro area dissipate.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

A weakening global recovery, …

The global economy has slowed down in the
second quarter of 2012 after solid growth in the
first three months before. On the one hand,
economic activity in advanced economies is still
impeded by the repercussions of debt and financial
crises. In the US, GDP growth decelerated over the
first half of this year, but labour and housing
market developments indicate that it is likely to
pick up at the turn of the year. However, for
growth to be sustained, the brunt of the looming
fiscal contraction will have to be reduced. On the
other hand, economic activity lost momentum in a
number of emerging market economies. Those
economies were increasingly affected by
weaknesses in export markets and lower domestic
demand, partly resulting from policy tightening in
response to increasing price pressures and signs of
overheating in 2011.
Global trade decelerated in the first half of 2012
and lost further momentum in recent months on the
back of weakening economic activity, notably in
the euro area and Japan. Non-EU trade is expected

slow to 4% from 4½% in 2011. Given that non-EU
advanced countries continue on their moderate
expansion path on average, this deceleration is
largely due to the weakening in BRICS countries,
notably Brazil, India and China.
Looking further ahead, non-EU growth is expected
to remain subdued in the first months of 2013 and
to pick up some momentum in the following
quarters. This projection is based on lower growth
expectations than in spring across almost all major
economic regions. Overall, non-EU world GDP is
estimated to expand by 4% in 2013 and by 4½% in
2014.

Looking ahead, high-frequency global indicators
are pointing to subdued global growth in the near
future. In the third quarter, the global composite
Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained at its
three-year low reached in spring (see Graph I.5).
The latest reading suggests a modest acceleration
in economic activity, but the index masks the
diverging trends of manufacturing and services.

fourth consecutive month, global services

After rebounding in early 2012 most commodity
prices decreased in the second quarter of 2012. Oil
prices dropped sharply from their peak in March
2012, as supply concerns eased and global demand
declined. Due to lower oil consumption in the EU
and to a lesser extent in the US and China, average
crude oil (Brent) prices fell below USD 100/bbl. in
June, but peaked again in August reflecting the
Iranian oil embargo as well as supply risks related
to other geopolitical tensions.

On average, prices of most non-oil commodities

remains a drag on confidence and growth and
weighs on the outlook in the near future.
Monetary policy in most advanced economies
remains accommodative and geared to maintain
historically-low interest rates. The US Federal
Reserve announced the third round of quantitative
easing in September, under which it will buy USD
40 bn in agency mortgage-backed securities
(MBS) per month for an unspecified period,
continue lengthening maturities of its debt
holdings under the "Operation Twist" (until end2012) and extended the commitment to keep
interest rates at historically low levels (0 to ¼%) at
least until mid-2015. The Bank of Japan has set an
inflation target of 1% and provided further
monetary stimulus by expanding the size of its
asset purchase programmes in an effort to fight
persistent deflationary trends.
On average, growth in non-EU advanced countries
is forecast to increase by around 2¼% in 2012,
followed by a GDP expansion of 2% in 2013. In
2014, GDP is projected to accelerate slightly to

Despite recent hikes in energy and food prices
global inflation has continued to ease. Across

The short-term outlook for major emerging market

escaped the slowdown in advanced economies,
since domestic demand was not sufficiently strong

Additionally, a number of emerging markets were

producers benefited to some extent from recent oil
price hikes.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

After policy tightening in 2011, monetary and
fiscal policy has again shifted to an expansionary
stance in order to counteract the current growth
slowdown. Economic activity in emerging market
economies (and developing countries) is thus
expected to reaccelerate in the course of 2013 and
to gain further traction in 2014. (9) However, their
contribution to global growth will be probably
lower than previously expected as emerging
market economies may have been growing above
potential for some time. (10) For 2012, GDP is
predicted to grow at a rate of 5%, slightly lower
than forecast in spring. In 2013 and 2014
economic activity is expected to increase by 5¼%
and 5¾% respectively.
As a result of subdued growth in the EU and other
important export markets, output expansion in the
group of acceding and candidate countries (11) in
2012 is expected to decelerate. But in line with the
mild recovery expected to set in next year,
economic activity is to become slightly more
dynamic with growth rates of around 2½% and
3½% in 2013 and 2014 respectively. However, the
aggregate figure masks heterogeneous growth
patterns at the country level.

European Council in June 2012 that outlined
conditions for direct bank recapitalisation by the
ESM and a roadmap for strengthening EMU
governance. Then, the ECB's announcement to
purchase government debt in order to ensure the
functioning of monetary transmission and the
layout of modalities for such actions (OMTs) in
early September exerted a longer-lasting impact on
yields and yield spreads. Benchmark yields moved
up and at both the short and the long end of the
yield curve spreads narrowed considerably. But
despite the announcement of these extraordinary
policy measures, the easing of collateral
constraints and OMTs in particular, and its positive
impact on sovereign yields in vulnerable countries,
conditions in sovereign bond markets remained
exceptionally strained with an elevated volatility of
spreads (see Graph I.8).

FINANCIAL MARKETS IN EUROPE

Narrowing sovereign-yield spreads within the
euro area…

Throughout 2012 varying concerns about the
resolution of the sovereign-debt crisis have shaped
developments in European financial markets. This
was most visible in sovereign-bond yields
increasing substantially for some countries, while
safe-haven capital flows were pushing benchmark
sovereign-bond yields to new historical troughs in
Germany and some other Member States. Since
mid-2012 however, financial market tensions have
started to ease, first following the meeting of the

However, easy monetary conditions and the resulting
historically low level of interest rates in some countries
have raised concerns that households' saving incentives
might be unduly lowered and financial institutions' credit
allocation might prove increasingly inefficient.
For example, medium-term output levels for major
emerging market economies have recently been revised
down, see IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 2012,

… and increasing stock market prices ...

Since late July, stock markets in the euro area have
responded favourably to statements by policymakers regarding their commitment to take the
steps necessary to resolve the crisis and strengthen
financial stability. But market developments also
reflected expectations of monetary stimulus in the
United States, China and the euro area (see
Graph I.9).
These factors offset downward pressures on prices
from the deteriorating growth outlook for both
emerging and developed economies. At the same
time, stock market uncertainty, as measured by
implied volatility, declined. On the forecast cut-off
date of 19 October, the Eurostoxx50 stood 10%
higher than at the end of last year, while the
financial sub-index was up by 11%.

… mirror recent policy decisions.

While the sovereign-debt crisis impacted
negatively on the funding situation of banks,
several policy measures dampened its adverse
effect on the cost and volume of lending to
households. In July, the ECB cut the rate on its
main refinancing operations by 25 bps to a record
low of 0.75%. Also the deposit rate (to 0%) and
the marginal lending facility rate (to 1.5%) were
lowered by the same margin. While the rate cut
reduced banks' borrowing costs with the ECB for
both
new
and
outstanding
long-term
refinancing (12), the cut in the marginal lending
facility rate is likely to be particularly beneficial
for stressed banks.

In the EU banking sector, structural funding and
liquidity problems persist. This is characterised by
difficult market access for several banks and
limited new issuances, which can only partly be
explained by reduced funding needs during the
deleveraging process. As long as an active crossborder interbank market within the EU on a noncollateralised basis has not yet re-emerged, many
EU banks have to rely on short-term funding on a
collateralised basis from national central banks.
This has resulted in a significant increase in the
amount of encumbered assets in the balance sheets
of banks that make extensive use of covered bonds
for mortgage refinancing or rely to a large extent
on funding by the Eurosystem. At the same time,
internal funding has come under pressure due to
the reduced earnings-potential of financial
institutions implied by deleveraging but also by the
need to set up accruals and the reduced level of net
interest and other income.

The aforementioned new ECB bond purchase
scheme is conditional upon an ESM programme
subject to strict and effective conditionality (either
a full adjustment programme or a precautionary
programme such as the Enhanced Conditions
Credit Line). No ex ante quantitative limits are set
on the size of OMTs, transactions will be focused
on sovereign bonds with one-to-three year maturity
and for all future bond purchases the Eurosystem
intends to accept the same (pari passu) creditor
status as private investors. (13)
These measures add to the 3-year longer-term
refinancing operations (LTROs) settled on 22
December 2011 and 1 March 2012 that had already
provided euro-area banks with substantial amounts
of liquidity. The positive impact of these measures
is also reflected by the evolution of the three(12)

standards for loans to enterprises at the euro-area
level in the second quarter of the year compared
with the first quarter and even a deceleration in net
tightening for loans to households. However,
banks' credit standards remained tight in the euro
area. For the period ahead, banks in the euro area
expected a similar degree of net tightening in
credit standards to enterprises and a considerably
smaller decline in net demand for corporate loans
(see Graph I.11).

THE EU ECONOMY

After a temporary stabilisation in the first three
months of 2012, GDP contracted by 0.2% q-o-q in
the second quarter in both the EU and the euro
area. Weaker global growth and the re-escalation
of the sovereign-debt crisis in spring contributed to
the worsening in the economic situation, while
financial markets remained fragile despite the
Eurosystem's longer-term liquidity injections
(LTROs). But economic activity has already been
weakening since the second half of 2011 as the
positive contributions from net exports were
increasingly less able to offset the negative impact
from declining household consumption and
shrinking investment (see Graph I.12).

and a need to correct the high levels of
indebtedness in the private sector. Particularly in
these countries, constraints on the balance sheets
of banks continued to constrain credit supply.
Overall, the widening heterogeneity in credit
conditions across euro-area Member States
remains a major challenge for monetary policy
transmission.

… and differences in financing conditions
across Member States remain substantial.

The sovereign-debt crisis has widened the gap in
financing conditions across euro-area countries. In
particular, non-financial corporations in countries
with stressed sovereign-debt markets tend to face
significantly higher interest rates on loans. This is
particularly relevant for small and medium-sized
enterprises that are less likely to issue corporate
bonds. As a result, the funding capacity of the
private sector, particularly firms in periphery
countries, is considerably impaired (see Box I.2).
In some Member States, firms' abundant internal
sources of financing and shifts from bank lending
to bond issuance in the light of the favourable
financing conditions are also contributing to the
weakness of lending volumes. Moreover, loan
demand remained weak in vulnerable countries,
owing to heightened uncertainty, low confidence

Short-term weakness…

The gradual and fragile recovery in business and
consumer confidence at the beginning of the year
halted in spring and early indicators are now
suggesting a weak second half of the year. In
September, the euro-area PMI Composite Output
Index stood at 46.1, signalling a decline in output
for the eighth successive month. The Economic
Sentiment Indicator (ESI) decreased further in
September in both the EU and the euro area,
falling to its lowest level since September 2009
(see Graph I.13). The observed worsening in
survey indicators is, however, somewhat at odds

Economic developments at the aggregated level

with recent releases of hard data, which seem to
indicate a bottoming-out in the second quarter with
industrial production up by 1% in both the euro
area and the EU in July-August compared to the

On balance, the gradual recovery that was
previously expected to materialise in the second
half of 2012 is likely to be shifted into the next
year. For the year 2012 as a whole, the GDP
outcome is expected to be worse than forecast in
spring, with predicted output contractions of ¼%
and ½% in the EU and the euro area respectively.
…followed by a moderate recovery…

Resting on the assumption that adopted policy
measures to combat the sovereign-debt crisis are
fully implemented at the European and national
level, the EU economy is expected to halt its

downward trend around the turn of the year and to
pick up gradually in the course of 2013. A crucial
prerequisite of the recovery is the stabilisation of
business and consumer sentiment and its expected
positive impact on consumption and investment
over the forecast horizon (see Box I.3). This
notwithstanding, net exports will be the most
visible growth driver in 2013. On the back of a
global economy gaining momentum, Member
States are likely to benefit from the depreciation in
the nominal effective exchange rate in 2012 and
gains in competitiveness. Strengthening external
demand and higher export growth might also
induce positive spill-over effects for gross fixed
capital formation. Furthermore, investment should
benefit from improving business sentiment and
gradually easing financing conditions in vulnerable
Member States. The recovery is expected to gain
further traction over the forecast horizon helped by
abating inflation and its favourable effect on real
disposable income and consumption growth.
However, substantial deleveraging and an anaemic
labour market will continue to weigh on prospects
over the forecast horizon. Overall, GDP in the euro
area is expected to remain broadly unchanged in
2013, while a tepid expansion (½%) is forecast for
the EU.
Further out, moderate GDP growth is forecast for
2014. Slowly improving labour market conditions,
rising purchasing power and higher consumer
confidence should help to prop up household
consumption and shift growth drivers more toward
domestic demand. Moreover, some initial effects

of structural reforms are expected to become
visible in 2014. Overall, real GDP is projected to
grow by around 1½% in 2014. The negative output
gap is expected to widen until 2013 and to shrink
only in 2014. This has to be seen against the
background of low estimates for potential GDP
growth in 2012-13 (around ½% for the euro area
and slightly higher for the EU).

Despite the ongoing adjustment, substantial
structural reforms and some noticeable gains in
competitiveness in several countries with currentaccount deficits, cross-country growth differences
are expected to narrow only marginally over the
forecast horizon. Different economic prospects of
Member States are path-dependent, and countryspecific contributions to real GDP growth in the
EU are to a large part determined by varying
staring points in terms of private and public
indebtedness,
priceand
non-price
competitiveness, the stability of the domestic
banking sector and the prior existence of housing
bubbles (see Graph I.14).
Member States that recovered solidly after the
recession of 2008-09 will continue to outpace
more vulnerable countries given the profound
differences between countries in terms of external
and internal adjustment needs, the labour market
situation, and in their capability to base export
growth on extra-EU demand, while differences in
financing conditions will take time to be reduced.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

last year accelerated in the first half of 2012. In the
remainder of 2012, non-construction investment is
expected to shrink further in line with weak
economic activity and high uncertainty. Alongside
the uncertainty weighing on investment spending
in all Member States, tight financing conditions are
an additional burden to investment growth,
particularly in vulnerable countries. Moreover, a
further decline in capacity utilisation was
registered in the third quarter of 2012 (see
Graph I.15) signalling weak investment dynamics
in the near future. Other downside factors include
very low business confidence, meagre profits
developments in most Member States as well as
companies' deleveraging in vulnerable Member
States.

residential investment (14) and timely indicators
such as building permits do not suggest any
substantial improvement in the near future.
Construction investment is expected to further
decline in 2013 in the euro area and to stabilise in
the EU (see Graph I.16). However, very favourable
financing conditions in terms of historically low
mortgage rates in some Member States, for
example in Germany, are likely to increase the
affordability of housing and support housing
investment. Further ahead, with the detrimental
impact from price corrections in housing markets
waning, construction investment is predicted to
turn modestly positive. However, contractions will
persist in countries facing the strongest housing
market corrections, notably Spain and Ireland.

Given the relatively limited restocking after the
2008-09 crisis and the large negative contributions
from inventories to EU and euro-area GDP growth
since the third quarter of 2011, the scope for
further destocking appears to be narrow at the
current juncture. According to Commission
surveys, companies' stocks are below long-term
averages and slowly increasing which suggests that
the inventory cycle may have turned around.
Therefore, for the second half of the year, the
contributions of inventories to EU and euro-area
GDP growth are expected to be close to zero.
…while adjustment in the housing market are
still weighing on construction investment.

Unlike machinery and equipment expenditure,
investment in construction has witnessed an almost
uninterrupted decline in the EU and the euro area
since 2008. Following the burst of housing bubbles
in several Member States, the ongoing adjustment
in housing markets continues to impact on

Looking ahead, total investment is expected to
pick up as from the beginning of 2013 in the EU
and somewhat later in the year in the euro area, led
by non-construction investment. It should benefit
from higher external demand, but also from
improving business sentiment, easing financing
conditions and a recovery of profit margins.
Moreover, the realisation of investment projects
postponed in the times of elevated uncertainty is
also expected to benefit gross fixed capital
formation. In annual terms, gross fixed capital
formation in 2013 is set to further contract by
about ½% in the euro area and to remain broadly
stable in the EU. In 2014, total investment is
expected to accelerate to 2½% in the euro area and
to 2¾% in the EU.

By the end of 2011, e.g. the Spanish housing market was
still burdened by a stock of 676.038 unsold new housing
units and in the first quarter of 2012 still about 3000 more
units were completed than sold according to statistics of the
Spanish ministry of public works (Ministerio de Fomento).

Private consumption constrained by negative
income and employment developments…

declining for several quarters, and are likely to
remain subdued, as suggested by the Commission
survey on expected major purchases which are at
historically low levels. Finally, consumer
confidence in the EU and the euro area has been
declining since mid-2011 and is now below its
long-term average (see Graph I.17). Overall in
2012, private consumption is forecast to fall by
½% in the EU and by 1% in the euro area.

Private consumption has remained weak since the
beginning of 2011. Muted growth in compensation
of employees, in combination with persistently
high inflation, has been weighing on households'
real gross disposable incomes – the key driver of
private consumption growth in the EU. Likewise,
the high uncertainty related to the euro-area
sovereign-debt crisis has led households to
increase their precautionary savings. These
headwinds are expected to remain in place in the
second half of 2012 and short-term indicators
suggest weak near-term prospects. Growth in retail
trade has been on a downward trend since the
beginning of 2011 and confidence in the retail
sector is at its lowest level since 2009.

…but will start to rebound when adverse
effects fade…

Private consumption growth in 2013 is expected to
remain sluggish or negative in most Member
States. An anaemic labour market and flat income
growth, substantial deleveraging and fiscal
consolidation will continue to weigh on household
consumption. On aggregate, private consumption
in 2013 is expected to contract further in the euro
area and to remain stable in the EU, before picking
up moderately by around 1% in 2014 in both areas,
as real disposable incomes rise and confidence
returns. The assumed return of confidence should
help to lower households' precautionary savings
and the expected moderation in HICP inflation, in
combination with the stabilisation in labour market
conditions in 2014, should support households'
purchasing power.

The recent softening of global growth is likely to
last until the end of the year on the back of the
subdued outlook for both advanced and emerging
market economies. As a consequence, export
growth is set to slow down in the remainder of the
year. Short-term indicators such as Commission
survey data on export orders or the PMI
component for new export orders in the
manufacturing sector continue to decline. For 2012
as a whole, exports are set to grow by 2¼% in the
EU and by 2½% the euro area, compared to 6.4%
and 6.3% in 2011 respectively (see Graph I.18).

Net exports will continue to be the main growth
driver in 2013…

With domestic demand depressed, net exports are
likely to be the key growth driver in 2012 and
2013. After buoyant growth in 2010 and at the
beginning of 2011, export growth has been
decelerating since spring 2011 in line with slowing
world trade. With export growth still exceeding the
increase in imports, net external demand is

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

the course of 2013 and with Member States
benefitting from a lower effective exchange rate
and gains in competitiveness, a gradual rebound in
export growth is expected over the forecast
horizon. Export growth in 2013 as a whole is
predicted to accelerate modestly to around 3¼%.
In 2014, export growth is expected to be more
robust (around 5¼% in both areas), in line with
global demand developments. However, Member
States' individual export performance will to some
extent depend on the elasticities of exports to
specific markets, notably emerging Asia. (15)
The short-term prospects for EU imports are
restrained by weak household consumption and
depressed investment. Import growth in the second
half of the year is forecast to be subdued in the EU
and to remain flat in the euro area. For the year
2012 as a whole, this translates into an unchanged
import volume in the EU and an annual growth
rate of -½% in the euro area. With a strengthening
of the domestic economy, import volumes are set
to grow gradually over the forecast horizon,
averaging 2½% in 2013 in the EU and about 2% in
the euro area. In 2014, import growth is expected
accelerate to 5% in both areas. But despite the
expected strengthening in domestic demand,
growth rates are predicted to fall short of
expansion rates witnessed in the pre-crisis boom
period. This is particularly true for programme
countries and other vulnerable euro-area Member
States.

… reflecting the ongoing adjustment at the
Member State level.

The on aggregate positive current-account balance
for the euro area and the EU as a whole still masks
substantial cross-country differences with some
Member States registering substantial surpluses,
while others are still recording considerable
deficits vis-à-vis the rest of the world. However,
external adjustment is ongoing, especially in the
euro area where the current-account balances in
deficit countries are improving relatively fast (see
Graph I.19). At the outset, these improvements
were mainly driven by lower import growth due to
cyclically weak domestic demand. But external
adjustment is increasingly determined by structural
shifts within vulnerable deficit countries.
Gains in competitiveness, reflected by lower real
effective exchange rates and declines in relative
unit labour costs, which are expected to decrease
further over the forecast horizon, are an indication
that the necessary shift in relative prices in
vulnerable countries is underway and that part of
the adjustment will be sustained when the overall
economic situation improves and domestic demand
recovers. In particular, structurally lower growth in
consumption in vulnerable countries is likely to
prevent import growth from reaching pre-crisis
levels irrespective of the next cyclical upturn.
Graph I.19:Current-account balances,
euro area and Member States
10

Already close to balance in 2011 despite the
negative impact of increasing import prices, the
current account of the euro area is set to register an
expanding surplus over the forecast horizon. The
euro-area balance in merchandise trade (in
adjusted terms) is expected to improve gradually to
a surplus of 1¼% of GDP in 2014, while the EU is
likely to register a mildly negative balance over the
forecast horizon. The EU current-account balance
(in adjusted terms) is to turn slightly positive in
2013 helped by a larger services surplus of around
2% of GDP on average over the period 2012-14 (at
around 1% in the euro area).

Part of the ongoing adjustment can also be
attributed to shifts in investor sentiment. Private
capital inflows to vulnerable countries first dried
up and then moved into reverse ("sudden stop") as
the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area
intensified. However, the disruption of private
capital flows in affected euro-area Member States
has been partly compensated for by other flows

In 2012, labour market conditions in the euro area
and the EU have worsened, reflecting the
deterioration in the overall economic situation
since the fourth quarter of 2011 and heightened
uncertainty. (16) In the year up to August 2012, the
unemployment rate in the euro-area and the EU
increased by 1½ pps. and 1 pp. to 11.4% and
10.5% respectively (see Graph I.20) while the
number of unemployed is about 2.1 million higher
in both areas. The net increase is largely due to
rising unemployment in a few euro-area Member
States where the jobless rate increased sharply.

When coupled with an output contraction high uncertainty
via its adverse impact on hiring may induce higher
unemployment than generally suggested by Okun's law, see
European Commission (DG ECFIN), Labour market
developments in Europe 2012, pp. 11-12.

Since much of the EU labour market adjustment
during the recession in 2008-09 took place through
a reduction in hours worked per person employed
and occurred to a far lesser extent through
reducing staff, employment growth during the
initial recovery has been rather weak. This slow
pickup in employment was interrupted when the
economy slowed in the second half of 2011. Even
though the development in hours worked has been
rather volatile throughout 2011, the initial
employment adjustment occurred at least to some
extent through the reduction in working hours.
Compared to the same period of the previous year,
employment in the euro area and the EU declined
only slightly in the second quarter of 2012 and
remained stable vis-à-vis the first three months of
the year. This suggests that the labour market
adjustment will increasingly occur in terms of
headcount employment.
… with employment developments shaped by
sectoral adjustments …

Across sectors, the weakening in employment in
the euro area has largely affected manufacturing,
but especially sectors which were burdened by
overcapacities such as financial services and
construction. In the second quarter of 2012,
employment in the above-mentioned sectors
dropped at annual rates of 1.0%, 1.2% and 5.3%
respectively. The September readings of the
employment component of the euro-area PMI
point to a further weakening in employment
prospects in manufacturing and services.
Large parts of lay-offs in crisis-hit EU countries
are linked to far-reaching structural adjustments
across sectors. As a result of domestic debt and
banking crises, highly leveraged sectors tend to
experience higher employment volatility due to

23

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

liquidity shocks. (17) When compared with global
economic downturns, the negative employment
impact of these domestic crises tends to be
substantially larger, especially when relatively
closed economies are affected. (18)
… and high unemployment risking to become
entrenched.

Between 2008 and 2011, gross flows between
employment, unemployment and inactivity in
Member States with robust labour markets such as
Germany and Austria resulted in a net inflow into
employment. By contrast, Member States with
persistently low job finding rates, particularly
those involved in a far-reaching adjustment
process, registered intensified job destruction in
2011 which on balance induced a large outflow of
employment and increasing jobless rates.
Moreover, the implied higher share of long-term
unemployment and rapidly rising youth
unemployment has raised concerns that cyclical
increases in joblessness might eventually reduce
employability
and
turn
into
structural
unemployment. According to Commission
estimates, the non-accelerating wage rate of
unemployment (NAWRU), a common gauge of
structural unemployment, has indeed increased
substantially since 2008. Thus, in the absence of
successful adjustment and labour market reforms
the implied rising labour-market mismatch might
induce a structurally higher unemployment rate in
the future. (19)
A bleak short-term labour market outlook …

Looking ahead, the worsening of the economic
outlook does not bode well for EU labour market
prospects. The latest readings of leading indicators
suggest a further weakening of the labour market
situation in the near future. According to
Commission surveys, employment expectations in
the EU and the euro area fell below their long-term
averages in September 2012. This steady
worsening, already observable since spring 2011,

has been most pronounced in the industrial sector,
where expectations have steadily deteriorated in
the EU since April and in the euro area since
January 2012 (see Graph I.21). Companies'
growing reluctance to hire and the need to reduce
staff is mirrored by consumers' unemployment
fears which have increased almost in parallel
during the summer with the sharpest increase
registered in August 2012. Although they are still
substantially below the peaks of spring 2009, they
are also markedly above long-term averages.
Accounting for the usually lagged response of
employment to changes in economic activity the
decline of GDP in the first half of 2012 and the
deteriorated outlook are likely to worsen labour
market prospects in the near future.

… with employment likely to be less resilient
than in the past …

Given that hours worked have not yet recovered
from the contraction in 2008-09, the detrimental
impact of the current slowdown on headcount
employment in EU is expected to be more
pronounced than in the recent past (see Box I.4).
The lack of fiscal space and the ongoing structural
adjustment in some Member States limit the scope
for supportive policy measures, most notably
short-time working schemes, that protected the EU
labour market partly from the impact of the
previous downturn. A modest recovery in
economic activity over the forecast horizon may
help to stabilise the labour market situation at the
end of 2013 and give rise to feeble employment
growth in 2014 amongst reduced uncertainty and
evidence of a firming recovery, while
unemployment rates are likely to remain high over
the forecast horizon.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

… and cross-country disparities are expected
to prevail.

The spread between unemployment rates in
countries with a robust labour market situation and
those in countries facing the highest jobless rates
has steadily increased since 2007. This divergence
is partly due to different institutional settings in
national labour markets which determine the
country-specific absorption capacity vis-à-vis
symmetric and asymmetric shocks. (20) The large
growth differential is likely to entail a further
widening of the already diverse labour market
conditions across EU Member States in 2013 and
which are projected to converge only slightly at the
end of the forecast horizon.
The varying labour market performance across
Member States is also reflected in diverging wage
developments. Some Member States register
significant wage increases which imply a relatively
strong rise in unit labour costs, at least in 2012. By
contrast, wage growth in Member States faced
with substantial internal and external adjustment is
expected to be very moderate or even negative,
thus allowing for a gradual improvement in
competitiveness and employment over the forecast
horizon.
Labour market adjustment in vulnerable Member
States is underway and adopted reforms are likely
to reduce adjustment costs. But this will be a
prolonged process and visible improvements are
not to be expected before 2014, as the necessary
reallocation of resources from the non-tradable to
the tradable sector is also hampered by particularly
weak investment growth. The employment
situation in less vulnerable economies which
proved rather benign during the 2008-09 recession
as companies resorted to labour hoarding and
adjusted working times accordingly is expected to
be comparatively stable. However, with the
exception of some Member States (21) the overall
adjustment at the company level due to the current
slowdown may occur rather through reducing
headcounts than through hours worked.
(20)

(21)

On the role of labour market asymmetries in a monetary
union see Abbritti, M. and A. I. Mueller, Asymmetric labor
market institutions in the EMU and the volatility of
inflation and unemployment differentials, IZA Discussion
Paper No. 6488, April 2012.
For example, in Germany working time accounts are
almost replenished as a result of solid economic growth in
the past two years and further moves toward more flexible
working-time arrangements have extended the scope for
working-hour adjustments.

Looking further ahead, employment is expected to
increase or at least to stabilise by 2014 in all
Member States except for Cyprus and Slovenia.
Unemployment rates are forecast to fall in the
large majority of Member States with the
exception of Belgium, France, Italy, Cyprus,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and
Romania.
Inflation has remained persistent

In the course of 2012, consumer-price inflation
continued to be driven to a large extent by changes
in indirect taxation in several Member States,
volatile oil prices (in particular in euro terms) and
rising food commodity prices. Although oil prices
decreased significantly between spring and the end
of June, they have almost returned to their April
levels (both spot prices and futures). The net effect
of the oil and food price increases combined with
higher indirect taxes (adding up to 0.4 pp. to HICP
in July-August), as well as lagged effects of past
oil-price increases from the first quarter of 2012,
have resulted in inflation in the EU and the euro
area that has been proved more persistent than
expected in the spring forecast. Euro-area headline
HICP inflation remained stable at 2.5% in the third
quarter of 2012 (see Graph I.22), while EU
headline inflation stood at 2.6%.

With weak labour market conditions …

Labour conditions have worsened in the first half
of 2012 and have thus not exerted any noticeable
price pressures. Nevertheless, in the first quarter of
2012, the growth in nominal compensation per
employee – although decelerating – continued to
significantly outpace productivity gains, prompting
a further increase in nominal unit labour costs.
Hourly labour costs rose by an annual growth rate
of 2.0% in the euro area (2.3% in the EU) in the
second quarter of 2012, up from 1.6% (1.5% in the
EU) in the first quarter of 2012.
… producer-price inflation affected by volatile
energy prices…

Price pressures on the producer side have been
easing since the spring of 2011, mainly reflecting
lower energy input prices. Industrial producer
prices (excluding construction) fell below 2% in
the EU and the euro area in mid-2012 and the most
substantial decrease in the first half of this year
was observed for intermediate goods, i.e. at the
earlier stages of the production chain. Similarly,
producer price inflation also fell noticeably for
consumer goods in the same period. However,
annual producer price inflation increased to 2.7%
in both areas in August 2012 on the back of higher
energy prices, suggesting temporarily somewhat
higher inflation pressures from the producer side.
… and well-anchored expectations …

The survey indicators of price developments (both
PMI and ESI components), which signal future
producer-price developments, edged up slightly

Consumers' inflation expectations have been
volatile since the beginning of 2012, reflecting
inter alia the volatility in commodity markets.
They increased again slightly in August and
remained at an elevated level as they tend to be
highly correlated with the observed (currently
relatively high) inflation rates. By contrast,
market-based inflation expectations for the
medium- to long term point to a substantial easing
of inflation going forward, with inflation rates
significantly below the ECB's official target.
However, in times of continued financial-market
turbulences, these indicators should be interpreted
with caution.
… the outlook is for a gradual easing of
inflation.

In 2012, HICP inflation is expected to average
2.7% in the EU and 2.5% in the euro area on the
back of higher energy prices and increases in
indirect taxes in some Member States. Given the
current assumptions for commodity prices and the
lagged effects of the most recent oil price
increases, consumer-price inflation in the euro area
and the EU is predicted to fall below 2% in the
second and third quarters of 2013 respectively.
With rises in labour costs limited by high
unemployment and producers' price-setting power
constrained by subdued consumption growth,
domestic price pressures are likely to recede

further. Annual average HICP inflation in 2013,
also supported by declining commodity prices, is
forecast to decline to 1.8% in the euro area and to
2.0% in the EU. Looking further ahead, the
subdued recovery forecast to set in in the second
half of 2013 and to gain further traction in 2014 is
not expected to raise inflationary pressures, as
output gaps are expected to close only slowly.
Inflation rates across Member States are likely to
converge as the impact from increases in indirect
taxes and administrative prices fades. Overall,
HICP inflation in 2014 is predicted to average
1.6% in the euro area and 1.8% in the EU.

With economic activity forecast to recover
gradually in the course of 2013 and acknowledging
the fact that not all Member States have presented
a draft budget for 2013 yet, general government
deficits are projected to decrease further in 2013.
Notably, the deficit is expected to decline to 2.6%
of GDP in the euro area, while reaching 3.2% of
GDP in the EU.

It is important to note that the HICP inflation
forecast for 2013 and for 2014 in particular, is
subject to the no-policy-change assumption that

General goverment balance (lhs)

Changes in structural balance (rhs)

Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue over
the forecast horizon, yet at a somewhat slower
pace than in 2011 in the face of weaker-thanexpected growth. Compared to the 2012 spring
forecast, the budgetary projections for 2012 and
2013 remain largely unchanged at the euro area
and EU level. As a result of sizeable consolidation
plans implemented by several Member States, the
general government deficit in 2012 is expected to
decline by 0.8 pp. of GDP in both the euro area
and the EU, to 3.3% and 3.6% of GDP
respectively.

In line with the projected moderate pick-up in
economic activity and respecting the no-policychange assumption, the deficit is projected for
2014 to edge down by 0.1 pp. to 2.5% of GDP in
the euro area and by 0.3 pp. to 2.9% of GDP in the
EU (see Graph I.25).

revenue-to-GDP ratio is forecast to average 46.2%
in the euro area and 45.5% in the EU, implying an
increase of around 0.8 pp. compared to 2011 in
both areas. In 2013, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is
projected to rise further in the euro area to around
46.8%, while stabilising in the EU as a whole. In
2014, the revenue ratio is forecast to decline
marginally in both areas. By contrast, the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilise in
both the euro area and the EU in 2012, as slightly
higher interest payments and increased social
transfers in the downturn offset the impact of
discretionary expenditure cuts. Government
spending is projected to start to decline in 2013
and this decline is projected to accelerate in both
areas in 2014, also on account of the gradual
strengthening in the economic recovery (see

continue in 2013, albeit at a decreasing pace. The
slowing pace of consolidation in structural terms is
likely to translate into a somewhat reduced (shortterm) drag of fiscal policy on growth. On the other
hand there is evidence that in crisis periods fiscal
multipliers can be higher than in normal economic
conditions (see Box I.5). In view of the no-policychange assumption, the structural balance is not
expected to improve further in the EU in 2014,
while in the euro area a slight deterioration in
structural terms is predicted.
… whereas debt ratios are expected to
increase further.

Despite the expected decline in most Member
States' headline deficits over the forecast horizon,
government debt ratios in the euro area and in the
EU for the years 2012 and 2013 are projected to
increase. The increase in euro-area government
debt from 88.1% of GDP in 2011 to 92.8% in 2012
is due to a large snowball effect and stock-flow
adjustment. The snowball effect, which includes
the impact of interest expenditure, real GDP
growth and inflation on the debt ratio, is mostly
responsible for the projected further increase in the
debt ratio in 2013 to 94.5% of GDP. In the EU,
general government gross debt is expected to
increase, albeit at decreasing rate, over the forecast
period reaching its peak (88.6% of GDP) in 2014.

The "snow-ball effect" captures the impact of interest expenditure on accumulated
debt, as well as the impact of real GDP growth and inflation on the debt ratio
(through the denominator). The stock-flow adjustment includes differences in cash
and accrual accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other
residual effects.

RISKS

Overall, risks to GDP growth appear more
balanced than at the time of the spring forecast,
though downside risks continue to dominate.
While some of the previously-identified risks have
materialised, most notably the worsening of the
sovereign-debt crisis before the summer, policy

Economic developments at the aggregated level

decisions taken over recent months have also
reduced tail risks.
Despite the recent significant easing of tensions,
financial markets remain vulnerable and highly
dependent on the implementation of agreed policy
measures. Spreads in European sovereign markets
still remain high, and the inter-linkages between
the sovereigns and the banking sector continue to
pose a risk to financial stability. European banks
are also considerably exposed to a further
weakening of the economy as it would reduce their
earnings, limit their debt-servicing capacity and
translate into higher credit risk.
Further downside risks are related to developments
in main partner economies. In China and some
other emerging market economies, unexpectedly
weak data on economic activity indicate that
persistently high growth rates cannot be taken for
granted. The political impasse in the US over the
"fiscal cliff" generates uncertainty globally
through its large potential impact on US GDP
growth, including the risk of a recession in 2013.
Sharp movements in oil prices and weather-related
price hikes for staple foods, meanwhile, illustrate
that commodity markets remain highly volatile.

in combination with Member States' different
geographical orientation of trade or the sensitivity
of their exports to exchange-rate changes. This
notwithstanding, no Member State would be left
unscathed by the realisation of downside risks
given the strong interconnectedness among
European economies.
The substantial uncertainty surrounding the GDP
growth outlook is reflected by a fan chart which is
derived from the probabilities associated with the
different upside and downside scenarios over the
forecast horizon (see Graph I.27). As visualised by
the shaded areas downward risks still dominate,
but to a lesser extent than in the previous forecast
as downside tail risks have diminished.

On the upside, a faster and stronger-than-expected
positive impact of recently announced policy
measures at the European and national level
aiming at resolving the euro-area sovereign-debt
crisis could induce a more broadly-based and
enduring easing of sovereign and bank funding
stress. As a result, business and consumer
confidence should be restored more quickly with
favourable effects on economic activity. A similar
virtuous chain reaction could be initiated, if
structural reforms in vulnerable Member States
were to bear fruit earlier and rebalancing within
the euro area were to proceed faster and more
substantially than expected. Further upside risks
relate to policy actions in the US and some
emerging market economies, where additional
monetary stimulus may support economic activity.
The materialisation of risks to the growth outlook,
whether upside or downside, is likely to have a
differentiated impact across Member States.
Vulnerable Member States, which would suffer
most from a deterioration of financing conditions,
would immediately be affected by a worsening or
easing in the sovereign-debt crisis. A more
diversified picture could also result from the
materialisation of risks to the external environment

Risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly
balanced over the forecast horizon. On the
downside, stronger output contractions and the
resulting increasing economic slack might reduce
price pressures more than currently expected. A
further weakening in the global economy,
associated with a fall in commodity prices, would
also decrease inflationary pressures. The risk of an
area-wide deflation, however, appears remote
despite the possibility that some Member States
could experience negative inflation rates for some
time. On the upside, unanticipated further
increases in indirect taxes and administrative
prices linked to intensified consolidation efforts
and a faster and stronger-than-expected pick-up in
world growth strengthening global demand and
pushing up commodity prices, might additionally
fuel inflationary pressures. Moreover, reintensifying geopolitical tensions that cause abrupt
supply disruptions and a surge in oil prices could
jeopardise price stability in the short-term.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

Box I.1: Ongoing adjustment in the euro-area periphery
The euro-area peripheral economies are undergoing
a profound process of macroeconomic adjustment
and the medium-term growth prospects of these
economies crucially depend on the pace and
smoothness of the correction of their external and
internal imbalances.
Vulnerable
periphery

economies

in

the

euro-area

Even if they share some common features, the
euro-area peripheral countries differ considerably
in terms of their respective adjustment needs. On
the one hand, Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal
used to register very large current-account deficits
that raised doubts on their sustainability. On the
other hand, Ireland, Italy and Slovenia recorded
smaller external deficits, but their governments,
banks and firms have also encountered severe
funding stress. In the case of Greece, Ireland and
Portugal, the adjustment process is supported
through official financing by euro area Member
States (as bilateral loan commitments and loans
from the EFSF) and the IMF, while the EFSF/ESM
provides funds to recapitalise the Spanish banking
system. Cyprus has also requested official
financing, but a specific adjustment programme has
not yet been agreed. In addition, the currentaccount adjustment in these economies has also
been cushioned by the ECB's non-standard
monetary policy measures.

crisis. In 2007, the overall current-account deficits
and surpluses in the 17 Member States that
currently constitute the euro area (around EUR 490
billion in absolute value or 5½% of the euro-area
GDP) were more than three times larger than in
1999. Since then, a substantial adjustment has been
ongoing, with euro-area economies with initially
high current-account deficits accounting for the
lion’s share of the current-account correction. In
2012 however, Greece, Spain and Portugal are still
registering high deficits (see Graph 1) and the
adjustment process is expected to continue well
beyond the end of the forecast horizon in 2014.
Cyclical versus structural factors

Export growth has proven robust in spite of weak
demand in the EU and at the global level. This is
particular true for Ireland as an early adjuster, but
also for Spain, Portugal and Slovenia. Due to
competitiveness gains, export growth is expected to
remain relatively strong over the forecast horizon
and to be the main driver in the external
adjustment. But the reduction in current-account
deficits has also resulted from a marked decline in
imports related to the compression in domestic
demand, in particular in Greece and Cyprus (see
Graph 2).

The convergence of interest rates, diverging unit
labour costs and globalisation-related external
shocks have all contributed to the widening of
current-account deficits in the periphery and to that
of surpluses in the core economies prior to the

This cyclical component implies that imports and
deficits could widen again when growth resumes.
Thus, for the current-account adjustment to be
durable it is crucial that reductions in deficits are
mainly driven by structural factors. Insofar as precrisis growth in the euro-area periphery was partly
driven by excessive credit expansion and inflated
consumption growth linked with exaggerated

Box (continued)

income expectations, a large part of the current
output contractions can be attributed to structural
rather than cyclical elements. While this suggests a
durable correction of current-account imbalances, it
also necessitates far-reaching structural reforms in
order to recapture output losses by increasing
flexibility and productivity and absorbing
unemployed resources in productive uses.
Pace of adjustment

The reduction in current-account deficits is not per
se sufficient to lower net external liabilities,
especially when a contracting GDP aggravates
external debt ratios. To assess the pace of the
adjustment, it is therefore necessary to consider not
only the reduction in current-account deficits, but
also developments in stock variables, like external
debt or international investment positions. Though
the threshold varies from country to another and
over time, the available data suggest that the level
of net external liabilities of a number of vulnerable
economies can be considered as unsustainable.(1)
This is particularly the case for Greece, Ireland,
Spain, Cyprus and Portugal, while Italy and
Slovenia are in a better position (see Graph 3).
Graph 3:Net external liabilities, 2006-14, euro-area periphery

large part, related to market scepticism on the
sustainability of the external position of these
countries and the solvency of the issuing entities.
Therefore the decrease in net external liabilities
since the onset of the crisis may actually
underestimate the aggravation in the external debt.
In the absence of further liability-reducing
valuation changes – an improvement in confidence
may even reverse parts of the latest valuation
changes – the current-account deficits and the low
economic activity predicted over the forecast
horizon suggests that the net liabilities-to-GDP
ratio will barely stabilise in Spain and Portugal,
while it could again increase in Greece. By
contrast, ratios in Ireland and Slovenia are expected
to fall quickly thanks to the projected surpluses,
while Italy's net external debt ratio will remain
stable. However, provided that the fragmentation in
financial markets is overcome, the financing of
these liabilities will become easier.
The large negative net external positions of these
economies together with their unfavourable
financing conditions mean that the net outflow of
primary income (mainly interest payments and
dividends) is set to increase (see Table 1). The
resulting widening in the difference between output
(GDP) and income (GNI) growth implies that in the
euro-area periphery (with the exception of Cyprus)
the contraction in income between 2007 and 2014
is deeper than the reduction in real GDP.

Note: For 2012-14, the net external liabilities were
extrapolated on the basis of the projections for current account
and capital transfers. For Greece, the government debt
restructuring in Q1-2012 was also considered.

The recent decline in net external liabilities as a
percentage of GDP in Greece, Cyprus, Spain and
Portugal has mainly been caused by valuation
effects (and the government debt restructuring in
the case of Greece). In particular, domesticallyissued securities held by foreigners lost market
value, including corporate, bank and sovereign
bonds. The observed valuation changes are, for a

Accordingly, the expected subdued recovery may
not be reflected by higher incomes. This will weigh
on domestic demand and stresses the critical role of
net exports for growth prospects in vulnerable
economies.

domestic equilibriums and imbalances. The

Since 2010, the growth rate of nominal unit labour

below the growth rate in the core surplus
economies. For 2012, the difference is of more than
3 pps. (see Graph 4). When the years 2010-14 are

rates (see Graph 5).

For the structure of production in the peripheral
economies to change and a recovery of their
competitiveness to materialise, there is a need not
only to change relative prices among countries but
also across sectors within countries.
As a general benchmark, the prices of tradables
should fall so that exporting companies are able to
increase their sales abroad and gain market shares.
The extent of the decline in export prices depends
on the relative specialisation of each country and its
size in each market. In so far as the euro-area
peripheral economies are price takers in most
markets, the necessary fall in export prices vis-à-vis
competitors may be relatively small for a certain
gain in market shares. In these cases, the reduction
in labour costs leads to an increase in the trade
margins of exporters, thus pulling resources from
the non-tradable sector. However for this shift to
occur the relative prices in non-tradable branches
within each country should also fall and the
margins in the tradable branches increase.

30

The reduction in ULC in vulnerable countries
relative to the core euro area stems from increases
in productivity, labour shedding, which offsets the
labour hoarding of recent years, as well as
reductions in the nominal remuneration in several
sectors. Moreover, while excessive wage growth in
the non-tradable sector before the crisis put
pressure on the level of remuneration for the

The available evidence so far is not yet conclusive,

many firms in the peripheral countries are currently
facing. However, the pre-crisis trend of strong

horizon. The pace of the correction in relative
prices within each economy depends greatly on the
degree of competition in each domestic market, and
the absence of barriers to the entry and exit of firms
in each sector.

In the current context of still elevated funding
stress in periphery countries the shift of resources
from the non-tradable to the tradable sector may be
constrained as the investment necessary for

Box I.2: Assessing the impact of diverging financing conditions within the euro area
While the economic literature points to an
important role of integrated financial markets in the
smoothing of income shocks and the sharing of
risks in a monetary union, the emergence of
sovereign risks in the euro area has undone part of
the integration accomplished over the last years.
Retrenching cross-border interbank capital flows,
rising home bias in sovereign-bond holdings, as
well as growing divergence of funding costs for
sovereigns and banks provide evidence that
financial conditions within the euro area have
become more fragmented in 2012. Fragmentation
has led to divergent bank-lending rates and lending
volumes across euro-area Member States.
The strong interdependence between banks and
their domestic sovereigns in euro-area countries is
at the heart of the propagation of the sovereign-debt
crisis to private-sector financing conditions. There
is clear evidence of a parallel evolution of
sovereign- and bank-credit default swaps in most
euro-area countries.(1) Since sovereign ratings and
bond yields act as benchmarks for banks' ratings
and medium to long-term funding costs on capital
markets, the divergence in sovereign-risk premia
has translated into differences in banks' financing
costs. This bank-sovereign interdependence is
particularly visible in the case of Italy and Spain.

their home bias in bond holdings, i.e., they hold an
over-proportional large share of domestic sovereign
debt, which has lost in value as the sovereign's
yields increased. In case of a bank becoming ailing,
a highly-indebted sovereign may not be able to
offer financial support, which makes the funding of
banks in vulnerable Member States a more risky
investment.

Moreover, banks in some euro-area countries are
highly exposed to an over-indebted private sector,
increasing the risk of further losses, particularly in
the real-estate segment. Bank financing via
deposits has also been impaired due to significant
deposit outflows from some vulnerable Member
States. In response to more difficult funding
conditions, banks in a number of euro-area
countries started to offer relatively high retail rates
to attract depositors (see Graph 3). In the
meantime, banks in core euro-area countries were
able to reduce deposit rates, making use of the
historically low-interest-rate environment created
by the ECB's accommodative monetary policy
stance and safe-haven capital flows.
Dysfunctional wholesale and interbank markets in
the euro area and significant deposit outflows have
made banks in a number of euro-area countries
highly dependent on Eurosystem funding. Although
the ECB's non-standard measures, inter alia the two
three-year LTROs settled by the Eurosystem in
December 2011 and March 2012, have contributed

Interest rates on bank loans to enterprises show
divergence, with their timing very much
corresponding to the outbreak of the sovereign-debt
crisis in different countries. Greek and Portuguese
rates started to diverge in 2010 while Spanish and
Italian rates started to differentiate from German
and French rates only in late 2011 and in 2012.
Lending volumes have followed similar patterns,
declining in the most fragile euro-area countries
while remaining slightly positive in the core.
The heterogeneity of lending conditions is expected
to have implications for growth divergence because
the banking system acts as main intermediary in
allocating external funds from and to the nonfinancial corporate and the household sector.
Capital-market-based financing is less developed
than for example in the USA, meaning that most
corporates have little alternative to using bank
loans as external funds. Small and medium-sized
enterprises are particularly strongly dependent on
banks' ability to provide loans. The strong
correlation between yields for private- and
sovereign debt observed in many euro-area
countries suggests that the sovereign-debt crisis has
also impacted on market-based financing of the
non-financial sector in the euro-area countries most
affected by the sovereign-debt crisis.
(2)

For an empirical analysis of the link between the
sovereign and the banking sector and lending
conditions, see Albertazzi, U., Ropele, T., Sene, G.
and F. M. Signoretti, The impact of the sovereign
debt crisis on the activity of Italian banks, Banca
d’Italia Occasional Paper no. 133, September 2012.

Whether banks' supply of credit is the main reason
of the observed divergence in credit growth is
difficult to assess. A recent analysis of demand and
supply factors in credit developments points to a
rather equal importance of both in the euro area.(3)
Most recent data from the ECB's Bank Lending
Survey indicates that banks predict demand for
credit to remain very low, with the country
breakdown in line with the observed developments
in actual lending volumes. Low demand for credit
is usually coincides with a negative assessment of
general economic prospects and less so with banks'
curtailing the supply of loans.

The main downside and upside risks for the
economic forecast relate to developments in the
sovereign-debt crisis and are illustrated by
scenarios using the Commission QUEST model.
The largest downside risk relates to a further
escalation in the sovereign-debt crisis which would
amplify risk premia and worsen consumer
confidence. In this scenario it is assumed that a
further increase in sovereign-risk spreads by 300
bps in the most vulnerable countries would lead to
a further divergence in lending conditions between
the core and the periphery (Greece, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland). Corporate risk premia in the
euro-area periphery are assumed to increase by 200
bps while consumer credit is further curtailed. Core
euro-area countries would also be affected through
lower confidence. In this negative scenario, GDP
growth in the periphery would be 2 pps. lower than
in the forecast baseline and 0.4 pp. lower in the
core. An upside scenario assumes a faster
resolution of the sovereign-debt crisis and a gradual
elimination of the divergence in lending conditions
between core and periphery. In this scenario, the
sovereign spreads in the periphery are assumed to
fall by 200 bps lower leading to a 125 bps fall in
private-sector risk premia. The faster resolution of
the sovereign-debt crisis would also have a positive
confidence spillover on core countries. The
resulting GDP growth would be 1.1 pps. higher in
the periphery and 0.2 pp. higher in core countries.

Overall, the fragmentation in financing conditions
is certainly responsible for part of the increased
economic disparities within the euro area. In
response, the ECB has since the beginning of the
sovereign-debt crisis taken non-standard measures
to cope with the dysfunctional transmission of its
monetary policy to the wider euro-area economy.
The recently announced plans for a banking union
aim at breaking the link between sovereign debt
and the banking system, thereby mitigating the
forces behind the fragmentation of the euro-area
financial system. Although alleviating funding and
liquidity tensions in the banking systems, these
measures will not reduce some other important risk
factors related to banks' asset side, i.e. the
possibility of further losses due to exposures to the
private sector, and macro-economic risk will
remain in place.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.3: The role of expectations and confidence indicators in short-term forecasting
Confidence – or the lack of it – is generally
considered as a determining factor of business
cycle fluctuations. This is particularly true at the
current juncture, where a rebound in sentiment in
financial markets and amongst households and
enterprises is seen as a pre-requisite for the
economic recovery. However, confidence is often
considered an elusive concept in the economic
debate partly because it is difficult to measure
empirically and also because there are very
different views on the factors underpinning it. This
box reviews briefly the channels of transmission
from confidence to the real economy and it
evaluates to what extent the future course of the
economy is captured by commonly used confidence
indicators.
How do shifts in confidence impact on the
economy?

There are two main alternative views on
confidence. The first one, relying on standard
economic theory, considers confidence as (rational)
expectations about future development of economic
variables, for example growth or employment. The
literature points to unemployment duration, the
return on stock prices and monetary variables such
as the short-term interest rate as determinants of
consumer confidence and suggests that the
parameters affecting consumer confidence are
strongly changing over time.(1) (2) For the euro area,
there is some evidence that business and consumer
confidence reacts to changes in the euro-dollar
exchange rate, with respondents mainly reacting to
"bad" news.(3) These changes in expectations
impact on the real economy via changes in the
expected present value of investment projects or in
income expectations which will in turn induce
revisions to companies' investment and households'
consumption plans. The second view associates
confidence with a behaviour that is not subject to
rational decision-making but closely linked to the

idea of "animal spirits".(4) According to that
concept, recurring waves of optimism and
pessimism move the economy in an accordingly
favourable or adverse equilibrium. There is indeed
some evidence in favour of this view with respect
to the 1990-91 recession in the US.(5)
Regardless of the abovementioned schools of
thought, sentiment about the future is surrounded
by uncertainty in terms of the dispersion of possible
outcomes. Given the irreversibility of many
investment
decisions,
sharply
heightened
uncertainty may lead to an abrupt drop in
investment expenditures. In such an environment,
the risk of misinvestment and the implied expected
losses appear high, while it seems less costly to
postpone of forego an investment decision.
Similarly, heightened uncertainty about the future
path of the economy and, thus, income prospects
may cause households to delay consumption and
increase their (desired) precautionary savings.
Actual saving rates might not reflect this when falls
in real income oblige them to draw on their savings
to support consumption levels.
In the current context, the changing prospects for a
resolution of the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro
area are reflected in both volatile risk premia in
financial markets and muted confidence amongst
households and companies. Further policy progress
towards a resolution would thus be expected to
stabilise and improve sentiment all-around and
underpin domestic demand.
Interpreting confidence indicators

Whether a survey indicator is in line with the
theoretical concept of expectation depends
essentially on its construction, especially in terms
of the questions underpinning it. In the survey
underlying
the
Manufacturing
Purchasing
Managers' Index (PMI) respondents are asked to
compare the current level of certain firm-specific
variables (e.g. new orders) with their level a month
ago. While respondents' expectations regarding the

future do not feature in this survey, the leading
properties of the PMI may partly reflect the fact
that increases in the economic variables under
investigation translate into economic growth with a
time-lag (e.g. new orders). By contrast, the German
Ifo Business Climate Index is the outcome of
questions concerning firms' current and expected
business situation. Insee's Business Climate
Indicator as well as DG ECFIN's Economic
Sentiment Indicator (ESI) summarise the answers
to questions about respondents' expectations for the
next three months, the current situation and
developments over the past three months.(6) (7) By
incorporating assessments about the past, the
current and the expected situation in the future,
confidence indicators try to strike a balance
between reliability and forward-looking properties.
The ESI combines the balance scores (percentage
of positive answers minus percentage of negative
answers) of 15 questions addressing five economic
sectors (industry, services, construction, retail trade
and consumers), so as to make the indicator
resistant to asymmetric, sector-specific shocks.
Forward-looking questions are the largest group,
accounting for eight balance series, while the
number of questions referring to the present and the
past is at four and three respectively. In line with
expectations, the forward-looking questions are
particularly strong in predicting economic activity:
five out of eight display their highest correlation
with year-on-year GDP growth, when the latter is
shifted one month ahead.(8) The same is true for
only one question on the status quo and for none of
the backward-looking questions. The average
correlation of the forward-looking business survey
questions with one-month ahead GDP growth is
just as high as for the backward-looking questions
in a coincident setting.

The ESI also includes the assessments of consumers,
where the time horizon is 12 months.
For the US, the Conference Board's Consumer
Confidence Index and the University of Michigan's
Consumer Sentiment Index are constructed in a
similar fashion, incorporating questions both about
past and future developments.
To get a granular view of temporal relations between
monthly indicators and quarterly GDP the latter was
transformed to monthly frequency by linear
interpolation.

Its strong correlation with GDP together with its
timely availability makes the ESI a very useful
early indicator.(9) At the same time, the fact that its
leading properties are evident only in the very short
term suggests that the genuine expectations
component is limited.

Despite their good tracking record, confidence
indicators have been criticized based on the
argument that they simply summarise information
contained in other variables. A recent study using
the Commission's consumer survey finds that
consumer confidence has an explanatory effect for
private consumption growth, even when the typical
explanatory variables such as income, wealth or
interest rates are controlled for.(10) Regarding their
forecasting performance, there is evidence that the
predictive ability of confidence indicators varies
but tends to be higher before turning points of the

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.4: Euro-area labour markets: less resilience and more divergence ahead?
At the onset of the crisis, labour markets in most
euro-area countries remained resilient, and
aggregate unemployment was relatively little
affected by the fall in output during the 2008-09
recession, notably in comparison with the US.
Labour hoarding was partly linked to a prompt
adjustment in working hours (see Graph 1).(1) The
output recovery in 2010 was not job-rich, and
employment started falling again in the course of
2011, somewhat earlier than GDP, which declined
in the last quarter of that year. Euro-area
unemployment has been rising almost continuously
since 2009 and is currently at its highest levels
since the introduction of the euro, forecast to reach
11.9% in 2013.

hoarding decisions by firms and the decision to
finance

working
schemes
by
governments. Third, as compared with the onset of
the crisis, the financial buffers necessary to hoard
labour may have narrowed.

What factors are behind the apparent loss of
resilience of the euro-area labour markets during
the current slowdown? Is this a problem common
to the euro area or is it specific to some countries
only? What are the near-term prospects?

A first key reason for the reduced employment
resilience is that the room for adjusting the average
hours worked by employees rather than headcount
employment has become considerably smaller in
most Member States: since 2010, hours worked
have somehow recovered from the trough reached
in 2009, but they have stabilised at a level below
the one prevailing before the crisis. A second
reason is that the heightened uncertainty on the
evolution of the euro area crisis and in particular on
the prospects for a sustainable output recovery
limits the scope for labour hoarding on the part of
employers. Conversely, during the 2008-09
recession there was a widespread concern to avoid
excessive job shedding in light of a likely rebound

These considerations, which hold on aggregate,
need also to take into account that since the start of
the crisis differences across euro-area labour
markets have widened considerably since the start
of the crisis. Since 2008, a major dispersion of
unemployment rates is observed, and a substantial
fraction of the increase in total euro-area
unemployment is being driven by developments in
a few countries, notably Spain (see Graph 2).(2)
Employment has been declining especially in
countries where indebtedness grew faster before the
crisis, and where consequently the need of
deleveraging and adjusting fiscal positions became
stronger.(3)
Most interestingly, these divergent employment
developments are linked not only to different
growth developments across countries, but also to
different employment responses to output. In
particular, the unemployment response to output in
2011 exhibits a large variation across euro-area
countries, with much stronger increases in
unemployment for a given variation in growth in
the countries most concerned by the debt crisis (see
(2)

See European Commission, European Economic
Forecast – Autumn 2010, European Economy, 2010,

In the second quarter of 2007 unemployment rates in
euro-area Member States ranged from about 3.6% in
the Netherlands to a 11.3 in Slovakia, with a standard
deviation of 2.2. In the second quarter of 2012,
unemployment rates were between 4.3% in Austria
and 24.7% in Spain, with a standard deviation of 6.1.

Graph 3). This seems to confirm that the loss in
resilience of the labour market during the current
slowdown is linked to heightened uncertainty on
the economic outlook and reduced financial buffers
to hoard labour, in particular in sectors facing a
structural decline, factors that were present to a
very different extent across the countries of the
euro area.

Moreover, evidence suggests that the matching in
the labour market is worsening. The Beveridge
curve for the euro area has been shifting outward
since 2011 (see Graph 5), indicating that more job
vacancies coexist with a higher unemployment
level. This worsened job matching process is likely
to be driven by differences in the skill composition
of labour demand and supply stemming from an
ongoing restructuring of the economy, which
entails a permanent reallocation of labour across
different sectors of economic activity. Together
with limited geographical mobility, it implies
reduced job finding rates and unemployment
becoming more entrenched. All in all, this evidence
suggests that risks of hysteresis effects could
materialise, with unemployment becoming
persistent even once the economy starts to recover.

In this respect, a number of elements do not bode
well. The duration of unemployment has been
rising in most Member States, with the biggest
increases recorded in Ireland, Slovenia, Spain and
Estonia (see Graph 4). Increases in unemployment
duration are often associated with lower
employability of job seekers (skill losses, stigma
effects) and to an increased risk of job seekers
dropping out of the labour force.

In the light of the large dispersion of
unemployment rates, aggregate employment
developments at the euro-area level will crucially
depend on developments in countries that record
the highest unemployment levels, especially with
regard to wages. Since 2011 real wages have been
growing less than productivity in most, but not all
high-unemployment countries, contributing to a
downward adjustment in real unit labour costs.
Looking forward, wage moderation in the private
sector in countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal
and Greece could be linked, inter-alia, to recently
adopted reforms in the wage setting system, with
expected positive effects in terms of job creation
and unemployment reduction.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.5: Forecast errors and multiplier uncertainty
The current forecast of a 0.4% fall in euro-area
GDP in 2012 is substantially lower than what was
expected even 1½ years ago: our spring 2011
forecast projected a rate of growth of 1.8% for
2012. Such over-prediction of euro-area growth in
recent years has been common to most forecasters,
including other major international institutions. An
analysis presented in the latest IMF World
Economic Outlook argues that past forecast errors
provide evidence that forecasters have significantly
underestimated fiscal policy multipliers.(1)
Without questioning that fiscal multipliers are
probably larger than usual at the current juncture,
this box assesses some of the evidence regarding
forecast errors, focusing only on the euro area, and
argues that much caution is warranted when using
past forecast errors as indirect evidence for the true
size of the fiscal consolidation multiplier. There are
two reasons for that: first, the forecast errors over
the 2010-11 period have been predominantly
underestimations of higher-than-expected growth
in 2010, which were in fact associated with

controlling for increases in sovereign-bond yields
the correlation between forecast errors and changes
in the fiscal stance breaks down.
Fiscal multipliers in structural macroeconomic
models

The general conclusion from macroeconomic
models is that there is no single multiplier. The size
of the multiplier, defined as the change in GDP
following a 1% of GDP change in fiscal deficits,
depends on the composition of the fiscal
consolidation (or expansion), its persistence and the
accompanying monetary and financial conditions.
This finding is common to the models used by
international organisations (see the comparison in
Coenen et al. (2012)).(2) The fiscal multiplier
differs across countries and over time. It is found to
be larger (i) for direct government spending and
targeted transfers (as opposed to tax cuts and
general transfers); (ii) if the share of liquidityconstrained (or 'rule of thumb') and/or credit(1)

constrained consumers is larger; (iii) if nominal
interest rates are invariant, either because they are
at their zero lower bound, or in general for small
economies within a monetary union; (iv) if
economies are less open (unless the fiscal shocks
are synchronised across trading partners); (v) if the
shock is temporary rather than permanent.
In the Commission's QUEST model, multipliers for
temporary fiscal shocks are typically between
0.1-0.4 for tax changes, but in the range of 0.7-1.5
for spending changes when credit constraints are
high and interest rates are at the zero-lower
bound.(3) However, it is generally accepted that the
impact multiplier associated with permanent fiscal
consolidations is substantially smaller than the
multiplier of temporary fiscal contractions, because
of more positive crowding in (confidence) effects
of private consumption and investment associated
with an expected increase in net income.(4) In
QUEST the multiplier for a permanent
consolidation for the EU aggregate in normal
circumstances lies, depending on the instrument,
between 0.2-0.8, and is on average for a balancedcomposition consolidation around 0.4. However,
when interest rates are constrained by the zero rate
floor, and in an environment of global fiscal
retrenchment, as in the current environment, the
average multiplier can rise to 0.5-0.7.
Analysis of forecast errors: distinguishing
between stimulus and consolidation multipliers

Do recent forecast errors really suggest that
forecasters have underestimated the fiscal
multiplier? To answer this question we conduct a
similar exercise as the IMF, and regress the
forecast errors for GDP growth on the forecast of
the change in the fiscal stance. Under rational
expectations, this coefficient should be zero.(5) We
confine our attention to the euro area. This has the
advantage of a 'cleaner' sample: by limiting
ourselves to countries in a monetary union we

revenue and expenditure items on economic activity
can be found in the chapter I.2 "The impact of fiscal
consolidation on Europe's economic outlook" of
European Commission, European Economic Forecast
- Autumn 2010, European Economy 7/2010.
This is a common finding in all structural models in
the comparison exercise reported in Coenen et al.
(2012), pp. 60-65.
The IMF authors find this coefficient to be
between -0.4 and -1.2 and, assuming a multiplier of
0.5 was used in the forecast process, conclude from
this that the actual multiplier lies between 0.9 and
1.7.

remove one source for cross-country multiplier
heterogeneity, i.e. differences in the exchange-rate
regime. A second advantage is that we can interpret
the results better for individual countries.
It is useful to start with a closer look at the forecast
errors. Graph 1 takes the Commission's spring 2010
forecast and shows the GDP forecast errors for the
years 2010 and 2011 for the euro-area Member
States. As is clear from this graph, there was no
systematic overestimation of growth, but in fact
forecast errors were predominantly positive, i.e. the
Commission underestimated growth, in particular
in 2010. For the euro-area aggregate, growth turned
out 1.0 pp. higher than was forecast in 2010, and
only -0.1 lower in 2011.

Looking at the actual fiscal stance in Graph 2.b in

The Commission's forecast uses a no-policy-change
assumption in the forecast process for outer years.
Only those policy measures that have been publicly
announced, are fully credible and known in sufficient
detail are taken into account in the forecast. In times
of consolidation when measures have not been fully
approved yet at the time of forecast publication, this
may lead to a positive bias in the growth forecast for
outer years.

Note: change in the structural fiscal balance as a percentage of

Stimulus measures in the second group in 2010 are
associated with large positive forecast errors for
these countries. As the impact multiplier associated
with temporary fiscal contractions/expansions is
substantially larger than the multiplier of
permanent fiscal consolidations, combining
countries in group 1 and 2 biases the estimate of the
permanent consolidation multiplier in an upward
direction.

concerned the multipliers of temporary expansions

The largest forecast error is for Greece, which is
the country that also has undertaken the largest
consolidation efforts. However, one should be
careful drawing general conclusions from the case
of Greece about the size of the multiplier for
permanent consolidations. Just after the finalisation
of the spring 2010 forecast, Greece entered an
EU/IMF programme while at the same time the
euro-area sovereign-debt crisis started to escalate.
Later on, serious doubts emerged whether the
consolidation measures undertaken would be
sufficient to permanently reduce sovereign debt, as
manifest in rising government-bond yields (to
above 35% at the end of 2011). A sovereign-debt
restructuring eventually took place in February
2012, resulting in private investor losses. Thus, the
Greek case cannot be considered as a consolidation
associated with increasing private sector
confidence, a precondition for consolidations being
less damaging to growth prospects in the short run

When one shifts the analysis one year forward and
considers the forecast errors made in spring 2011
for 2011 and 2012 (current forecast), the sample no
longer includes countries undertaking stimulus
measures, as all Member States have been
tightening their fiscal stance. Graph 4 shows the
results for this analysis, where the forecast error
(forecast revision in the case of 2012) for real GDP
growth during 2011-12 is regressed on forecasts of
fiscal consolidation for the same period that were
made in early 2011. Although errors in the spring
2011 forecast are much larger than in 2010, we find
the coefficient on planned fiscal consolidation to be
(7)

A more negative growth impact relative to initial
conditions would of course not imply that growth
would have been higher without consolidations, as
the counterfactual would have been worse.

It is important to separate the effects of fiscal
consolidations from other factors related to the
sovereign-debt crisis. In principle, the forecast error
for GDP growth can be written as a function of the
forecast error of all variables which have an impact
on GDP plus differences between the actual
multipliers of the explanatory variables and the
values assumed in the forecast. Like the IMF, it is
assumed here that major divergences between
actual and assumed elasticities could only occur for
the multiplier of fiscal consolidation. We limit
ourselves to only two observable explanatory
variables for GDP growth, namely fiscal
consolidation and changes in sovereign-risk
perception (expressed by government-bond
yields).(9)

R²

Table 1 shows estimation results for the unexpected
output loss associated with a 1% of GDP expected
fiscal consolidation, for the full sample of euro-area
countries.(10) While in the estimation without any
control variable the coefficient on the forecast of
the fiscal stance is negative and highly significant,
it becomes smaller and statistically not significant
when sovereign yields are added as control
variable. The fact that the estimate for the forecast
of the fiscal stance is smaller when the change in
sovereign yields is included suggests that the
Commission's forecast of the fiscal stance (in
spring 2010) and the subsequent change in the bond
yields are correlated. A plausible explanation,
which applies especially to highly indebted
countries, is that financial markets regarded the
expected path of fiscal consolidation as insufficient
to guarantee government solvency and reacted with
a more adverse risk assessment. In this case, the
negative coefficient for the fiscal stance in the first
regression should not be interpreted as an
underestimation of the fiscal multiplier but rather
as capturing a negative response of investors to
possibly insufficient fiscal effort in countries with
severe debt problems.

Sovereign-debt problems have been a dominant

and end-2009. Sample: euro-area countries (16 observations), excluding Estonia.

No strong conclusions should be drawn from these
regressions based on a small number of
observations, except that they underline the
importance of separating the effects of fiscal
consolidations from other factors related to the
sovereign-debt crisis. Changes in sovereign-risk
perceptions are equally likely to be important
factors explaining past forecast errors as largerthan-expected
multipliers
from
fiscal
consolidations.
Concluding remarks

The evidence in this box shows that the link
between past forecast errors and planned fiscal
consolidations is not robust and should not be taken
as indirect proof for a larger consolidation
multiplier. While it is generally accepted that fiscal
multipliers for permanent consolidations are higher
now than they would be in 'normal' circumstances,
due to higher credit constraints and interest rates
constrained at the zero-interest-rate floor,
separating the effects on economic activity of fiscal
consolidations from other factors related to the
sovereign-debt crisis is important. Taking into
account the temporary nature of the stimulus in
countries like Germany and excluding the special
case of Greece, the evidence is consistent with an
average multiplier smaller than one.
When discussing the negative short-term output
costs of consolidation it is important not to lose
sight of what the counterfactual would be. For the
most vulnerable countries, exposure to financial
market pressures means there is no alternative than
to pursue consolidation measures. The alternative
of rising risk premia and higher borrowing costs
would be worse for these countries, and
consolidations are needed to restore fiscal positions
and put debt projections back on a sustainable path.
In general, a case-by-case approach to
consolidation is warranted, whereby the speed of
fiscal adjustment should be differentiated according
to country-specific fiscal and macro-financial risks.

Economic developments at the aggregated level

Box I.6: Some technical elements behind the forecast

The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
19 October. The forecast incorporates validated
public finance data as published in Eurostat's News
Release 149/2012 of 22 October 2012.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 4 and 17 October) were used for
exchange and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption as regards exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.29 in
in 2012 and 1.30 in 2013 and 2014. The average
JPY/EUR rates are 101.7 in 2012, and 101.9 in
2013 and 2014.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based.
Short-term interest rates for the euro area are
derived from futures contracts. Long-term interest
rates for the euro area, as well as short- and
long-term interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro-area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are expected to be 0.6% on average in
2012, 0.3% in 2013 and 0.5% in 2014 in the euro
area. Long-term euro-area interest rates are
assumed to be 1.5% on average in 2012, 1.7% in
2013 and 2.0% in 2014.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 112.5 USD/bbl in 2012,
109.1 USD/bbl in 2013 and 103.1 USD/bbl in
2014. This would correspond to an oil price of 87.5
EUR/bbl in 2012, 84.3 EUR/bbl in 2013 and 79.6
EUR/bbl in 2014.

Budgetary data

Data up to 2011 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission on
1 October and validated by Eurostat on 22 October
2012. Eurostat has withdrawn a specific
reservation, expressed in April 2012, on the data
reported by Ireland, relating to the fact that
restructuring plans of Allied Irish Banks and Irish
Life & Permanent (in 2012 renamed as Permanent
TSB) were not yet finalised. The Central Statistics
Office of Ireland and Eurostat have examined
updated restructuring plans sent to the EU
Competition authorities. These plans form a
suitable basis for partitioning the July 2011
injections in Allied Irish Banks and Permanent
TSB into deficit-increasing and non-deficit
increasing components. This has been implemented
in revised data reported by Ireland. Eurostat has
withdrawn a specific reservation, expressed in
April 2012, on the data reported by Ireland, relating
to the statistical classification of National Asset
Management Agency Investment Limited (NAMAIL). On the basis of documents provided by the
Central Statistics Office of Ireland, NAMA-IL is
majority privately-owned, following the sale by
Irish Life of its stake in NAMA-IL to a private
investor. This is a necessary condition for a special
purpose entity to be classified outside the General
Government sector, pursuant to Eurostat’s decision
of 15 July 2009 on public interventions during the
financial crisis.
Eurostat is no longer amending the deficit and debt
data reported by the United Kingdom with respect
to public financial defeasance structures, as the UK
Office for National Statistics has reclassified
Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock Asset
Management to the General Government sector, in
line with the financial defeasance chapter of the
Manual on Government Deficit and Debt.
For the forecast, measures in support of financial
stability have been recorded in line with the
Eurostat Decision of 15 July 2009.(1) Unless
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned,
capital injections known in sufficient detail have
been included in the forecast as financial
transactions, i.e. increasing the debt, but not the
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and
deposits are not included as government
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have
been called on at the time the forecast was

finalised. Note, however, that loans granted to
banks by the government, or by other entities
classified in the government sector, usually add to
government debt.
For 2013, budgets adopted or presented to national
parliaments and all other measures known in
sufficient detail are taken into consideration. For
2014, the 'no-policy-change' assumption used in the
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures
that are known in sufficient detail.
The general government balances that are relevant
for the Excessive Deficit Procedure may be slightly
different from those published in the national
accounts. The difference concerns settlements
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA).
According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No.
2558/2001), swap- and FRA-related flows are
financial transactions and therefore excluded from
the calculation of the government balance.
However, for the purposes of the excessive deficit
procedure, such flows are recorded as net interest
expenditure. European aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2012-14 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans). To ensure
consistency in the time series, historical data are
also published on the same basis. For 2011, this
implies a debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area which
is 0.7 pp. (0.5 pp. in the EU) higher than the
consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 149/2012
of 22 October 2012.

46

General government debt projections for individual
Member States in 2012-14 include the impact of
guarantees to the EFSF,(2) bilateral loans to other
Member States, and the participation in the capital
of the ESM as planned on the cut-off date of the
forecast (subject to approval).
Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally (by
up to ±0.1 pp.). The calculation of potential growth
and the output gap does not adjust for working
days. Since the working-day effect is considered as
temporary, it should not affect the cyclicallyadjusted balances.

Fiscal consolidation amid a subdued growth outlook
The economy is at a standstill …

Belgium's export-led recovery, which started in the
second part of 2009, came to a halt in mid-2011.
While activity resumed in the first quarter of 2012,
it declined sharply again in the second quarter: the
slow-down in global activity coupled with
uncertainties linked to the sovereign-debt crisis
and negative confidence effects resulted in a
contraction of 0.5% q-o-q. For the second half of
the year, economic activity is projected to remain
anaemic, with quarterly growth figures stagnating,
implying that for the year as a whole GDP is
expected to decrease by 0.2%.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)

GDP growth is set to turn positive in 2013 and
strengthen to 1.6%, slightly above potential, in
2014. (23) Indeed, due to the high degree of
openness of the Belgian economy, the current
slowdown in world trade is likely to delay the
recovery until the first half of 2013, when demand
for exports is expected to pick up again.
Concomitantly, the gradual resolution of the
sovereign debt crisis would restore household and
business confidence, timidly pushing up domestic
demand. Private consumption is expected to
increase only modestly in 2013, given rising
unemployment, weak disposable income growth,
and the stabilisation of the saving rate. Finally, a
still fragile financial sector will not foster domestic
demand, although it should not represent a drag on
growth either. In 2014, confidence is expected to
strengthen, while the unemployment rate should
broadly stabilise and disposable income is

car plant, announced after the cut-off date of the forecast, is

projected to increase further. Against this
background, domestic demand is expected to
contribute by more than 1 pp. to growth. In
parallel, imports will accelerate, but with exports
solidly recovering from mid-2013, the current
account should still improve slightly, attaining a
surplus of around 1% of GDP. Hence, net exports
will contribute positively over the forecast horizon,
mainly due to the dynamism of the services
balance. However, there will be no gains in market
share due to losses in cost competitiveness.
Private investment became negative this year due
to increased uncertainty about economic prospects
and a capacity utilisation below its long-term
average. Besides a decline in the demand for
credit, recent data also points to a tightening of
credit conditions for companies. In 2013 and 2014,
business investment is projected to gradually
accelerate, in line with the improvement in
confidence. In 2012, the negative developments in
household real disposable income have weighed on
demand for mortgages and construction
investment. From 2013 onwards, housing
investment should recover. Against the
background of the 2012 local elections, judging
from past experience, public investment is
projected to have remained upbeat in 2012 but to
drop by about 10% in 2013.
There are important downside risks to this growth
scenario. Apart from the general risks related to
the international economic environment and the
sovereign debt crisis, the impact of further
budgetary consolidation measures may delay the
improvement in domestic demand. On the other
hand, the budgetary consolidation could further
reduce interest spreads while confidence may
improve faster than expected in view of the longterm benefits of healthy public finances.
…resulting in a deterioration of the labour
market and a slowdown in inflation

In view of the weak economic environment, job
creation is projected to have stagnated in 2012 and
to accelerate only moderately over the forecast
horizon. This will be insufficient to offset the
dynamic growth in the labour force, and
consequently the unemployment rate is forecast to
rise, from 7.2% in 2011 to 7.8% in 2014, even if
contained by government measures such as

Member States, Belgium

subsidised service cheque jobs. Inflation has
remained relatively high at 2.6% in 2012 due to a
rise in oil prices, which tend to have a larger
impact on inflation in Belgium than on average in
the euro area. Under the current oil-price
assumptions, inflation is expected to slow down to
1.8% in 2013 and 1.6% in 2014, tempering also the
impact of the automatic wage indexation
mechanism on unit labour costs.

(0.2% of GDP), that had been announced but not
yet specified by the cut-off date of the forecast.
Under the no-policy-change assumption, i.e.
without the additional measures for 2012 and
without a 2013 budget which was also not yet
available, the deficit would start to rise again in
2013, despite the projected acceleration in growth.
This is in part explained by the many one-off
measures in the 2012 budget (about ½% of GDP).
A further rise in the deficit is forecast in 2014,
although better economic conditions and the
impact of recent structural reforms are expected to
curb the deterioration. In structural terms, the
deficit is projected to have declined in 2012 by
about 0.7 pp. of GDP (after having deteriorated by
0.1 in 2011), to remain broadly stable in 2013.

…while improvements in public finances are
not yet durable

The national authorities made a commitment to
reduce the general government deficit from 3.7%
of GDP in 2011 to 2.8% of GDP in 2012. The
2012 budget (revised in March) contained
substantial consolidation measures in order to
address the deterioration in economic conditions
and the rising trend in public expenditure,
especially on health care and pensions. In the
meantime, the economic situation has further
deteriorated. So far, (cash-based) fiscal revenues
remain rather dynamic, but a slowdown towards
the end of the year is expected. All in all, the
general government deficit should be 3.0% of GDP
in 2012. This figure does not yet take into account
the additional measures, of around EUR 800 mn

The general government debt reached 97.8% of
GDP in 2011. In 2012, the debt ratio is projected to
rise just below 100% of GDP. Under the current
growth and deficit projections, it continues to rise
slightly over the forecast period. Moreover, the
large contingent liabilities stemming from the
guarantees given to financial institutions and
possible recapitalisation needs represent a risk for
public finances.

Domestic demand sustaining growth
Domestic demand compensating for exports

GDP growth has decelerated to below 1% in
annual terms in the first two quarters of 2012 from
1.7% in 2011. The initial phase of the economic
recovery over 2010-11 was characterised by strong
exports, while domestic demand remained weak in
the aftermath of the boom-bust cycle. Data for the
first half of 2012 indicate a change in this pattern,
with domestic demand taking over as the main
growth driver, while net exports turned negative. A
recovery in private consumption was the main
factor behind this, along with growth in
inventories. After three years of strong contraction,
investment activity also appears to be stabilising
over the first half of 2012, supported mainly by
public projects and some recovery in FDI,
especially in the energy sector.
GDP growth to pick up gradually

The recent growth pattern is forecast to continue,
with domestic demand leading the recovery. Net
exports are expected to contribute negatively to
growth in 2012 and 2013 and less so in 2014. In
spite of an adverse economic setting in the EU and
an overall weak labour market in Bulgaria, GDP is
projected to grow by 0.8% in 2012, 1.4% in 2013
and 2% in 2014, supported by a stable overall
domestic economic environment and relatively
strong public finances upholding consumer
confidence. In addition, recent monthly data from
the banking sector suggest a downward trend in
both deposit and lending interest rates. Lower
lending rates are expected to support a modest
growth in credit with a possible lagged effect on
consumption.
Household consumption is forecast to recover
further in 2013-14, assuming a continuous increase
in real incomes and a gradual recovery in
household confidence. Investment is expected to
be initially supported by public sector projects
funded by the EU. Going forward, private sector
investment is also expected to pick up from the
current relatively low post-crisis levels, in line
with the economic recovery. Export trends are
forecast to follow the expected gradual recovery in
EU markets in 2013. Given the high import
content of Bulgarian domestic consumption and
investments, the current account is forecast to slide
into a deficit of 2½% of GDP by 2014.

Risks related to this baseline scenario seem
broadly balanced. On the downside, a reversal of
the current positive momentum in household
consumption in the face of continued euro-area
turbulence is the major risk. On the upside, exports
could develop more favourably if the past trend of
gains in global market shares resumes.
Weak labour market, but rapid wage growth

The employment level fell by 4.2% in 2011, even
with real GDP having turned positive in that year.
In 2012, employment is forecast to decline by a
further 2%, before stabilising in 2013 and turning
to slight growth in 2014. Declining employment
also reflects a strong decline in the labour force on
account of negative demographic trends.
Unemployment is expected to increase from 11.3%
of the labour force in 2011 to 12.7% in 2012 and to
remain broadly unchanged over the forecast
horizon. The protracted weakness in the labour
market could lead to rising long-term
unemployment and structural skill mismatches.
At the same time, growth in wages and unit labour
costs is foreseen to remain relatively strong.
Wages are being pushed up by wage convergence
pressures from the lowest levels in the EU,
impacted by emigration. Also, mounting labour
market mismatches would lead to wage pressures
in line with the expected pick-up in economic
activity, even with a relatively high unemployment
rate.

Member States, Bulgaria

Inflation to level off after a peak in mid-2012

domestic demand and imports. Moreover, the
government took an important step forward in
improving tax compliance by linking all retailers'
cash registers online to the National Revenue
Agency as of April 2012. Similar measures were
also taken to increase compliance with excise and
import taxes.

Inflation accelerated over 2012, especially in the
third quarter, reflecting hikes in global energy,
food and some administrative prices. Nevertheless,
core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed
food prices) remained more moderate, slightly
above 1% y-o-y. Assuming a stabilisation of global
energy and food prices going forward, headline
HICP inflation is expected to level off at 2.6% in
2013 and 2.7% in 2014. At the same time, core
inflation is projected to pick up to some extent
given the rise in unit labour costs, the steady
recovery in household demand and the ongoing
convergence of domestic prices towards EU
averages.

The fiscal deficit is set to remain at 1.5% in 2013,
and to slightly improve to about 1% of GDP in
2014. Even though the favourable revenue trends
are expected to continue in 2013, expenditure is
also expected to increase substantially. The
forecast takes account of the measures included in
the government's 2013 draft budget proposal
presented to the parliament in early October. Most
notably, it foresees an increase of pensions by
9.3% as of 1 April 2013. Overall, the budget
implies a neutral fiscal stance in 2013 and 2014,
with the structural deficit estimated to remain
broadly stable at slightly below 1% of GDP.
General government gross debt is envisaged to
increase from around 16½% of GDP in 2011 to
18½% of GDP in 2014.

Fiscal position to stay relatively strong

The general government deficit is set to narrow
from 2% of GDP in 2011 to 1.5% in 2012. The
first half of 2012 was marked by exceptionally
strong revenue collection, primarily on account of
VAT revenues, which were boosted by strong

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
Low consumption weighs on the economy
The Czech economy entered recession in the
second half of 2011. Based on the contraction in
the first two quarters of 2012 and a deteriorating
outlook, real GDP is expected to fall by 1.3% for
the year as a whole. Against the background of
continuing fiscal consolidation and increased
economic uncertainty, weak domestic demand is
expected to act as the main drag on growth in 2012
despite easier financial conditions. Real GDP
growth is projected to bottom out in 2013 but is
expected to remain below potential also in 2014.
From contraction to subdued growth

In the first half of 2012, household consumption
posted a record decline of -2.8%, the strongest
decrease since 1996. Real disposable income
contracted due to sluggish growth in wages and
elevated inflation, fuelled by an increase in the
lower rate of VAT from 10% to 14%. At the same
time, household savings rose in anticipation of
further fiscal retrenchment. On the back of the
worsening situation in the labour market,
household consumption is expected to stall in 2013
and recover somewhat only in 2014. However, the
forecast does not include the revenue consolidation
measures for 2013, rejected by the Parliament and
awaiting new discussion which would further
weigh on consumption. Fixed capital formation is
expected to provide a negative contribution to
growth in 2012. Construction investment fell
considerably in the first half of the year and the
low number of new building permits and the still
subdued volume of public investments do not
augur well for a quick recovery in this sector.
However, since both domestic demand and foreign
demand remain weak and capacity utilisation is
below its long-run average, even lower investment
activity is considered a negative risk to the
forecast.
The slowdown in the key EU trade partners is
projected to impede growth in Czech exports in
2012 despite sizeable market share gains in nonEuropean economies. Both export growth and
potential output growth are expected to remain
below their pre-crisis levels as the inflow of
export-oriented foreign direct investment has
substantially eased. The rate of growth of imports
is also forecast to decelerate, given the high
import-intensity of exports and the lacklustre
performance of domestic absorption. However, net

54

exports are likely to remain relatively strong over
the forecast years and the improved trade balance
is expected to be reflected in a further shrinking of
the current-account deficit.

GDP (y-o-y%)

Inflation is projected to reach 3.6% in 2012 before
falling well below 2% in both 2013 and 2014.
High inflation in 2012 is predominantly driven by
the hike in the lower VAT rate, higher energy and
food prices, and continued deregulation of rents.
The forecast includes the unification of VAT rates
(currently at 14% and 20%) into a single 17.5%
rate planned for 2013. This should have a broadly
neutral impact on inflation. While the effects of the
bad harvest in 2012 on food prices are expected to
persist into 2013, energy inflation is projected to
slow down over the forecast horizon. Prices of
goods (excl. food and energy) are likely to
continue to fall in view of the tight competition on
domestic retail markets, thus keeping overall
inflation subdued.
The labour market has so far been spared from the
full impact of the recession due to the willingness
of firms to cut working hours rather than jobs.
However, the unemployment rate is expected to
peak at 7.3% in 2013, up from 6.7% in 2011, and
to ease only gradually as long-term unemployment
is likely to increase.
Persistent public deficits

After the sizeable reduction achieved in 2011
partly on account of a significant drop in
investment, the general government deficit is
expected to increase slightly to 3.5% of GDP in
2012. The deterioration in the deficit outlook

Member States, The Czech Republic

reflects the worsening of macroeconomic
conditions. Currently available data reveal major
revenue shortfalls compared to the budget, in
particular from VAT and excise duties (around
0.5% of GDP), mirroring weak private
consumption. Savings are expected on the
expenditure side, mainly in interest payments and
intermediate consumption but these will only
partly compensate for the loss in revenue.

income tax. The deficit projection also excludes
the revenue-decreasing impact of the planned
introduction of the fully-funded pension pillar
(0.2% of GDP), as its launch in 2013 is still
uncertain. The structural balance is expected to
deteriorate slightly in 2013 to 2½% of GDP.
The projected moderate improvement of the
general government balance in 2014 is driven
predominantly by more favourable macroeconomic
conditions. This is based on a no-policy-change
assumption and includes only further across-theboard cuts in government consumption at the
central level (0.3% of GDP). The debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to increase over the forecast
horizon, reaching around 48% of GDP in 2014.

Despite
the
expected
improvement
in
macroeconomic activity, the general government
budget is projected to remain broadly unchanged,
reaching 3.4% of GDP in 2013. While the draft
2013 budget includes a package of expenditure and
revenue-side measures amounting to net savings of
around 1.4% of GDP, the forecast only takes into
account the expenditure-side measures, notably a
freeze in public sector wages, across-the-board
cuts in government consumption at the central
level and lower indexation of pensions. On the
revenue side, the forecast is based on the already
adopted unification of both VAT rates. The
revenue-side measures (0.7% of GDP), recently
rejected by the Parliament and awaiting new
discussion are not included in the forecast. The
revenue package comprised an increase in both
VAT rates as well as in excise duties and personal

The fiscal forecast is subject to two major risks.
The adoption of the law on financial compensation
to churches, still under discussion in Parliament,
would imply a one-off increase in the deficit by 1.5
pps. of GDP in the year of its entry into force.
Furthermore, problems in the administration of EU
funds at national level entail that part of the
advance financing from domestic sources will not
be fully reimbursed, which will mostly affect the
deficit in 2012.

4. DENMARK
Muted growth in a phase of adjustment
After a year of export-driven growth of 0.8% in
2011, during which domestic demand contributed
negatively to economic activity, the prospects for
Danish exports are significantly more subdued this
year as a result of the slow and protracted recovery
in Europe and the slowdown in emerging markets.
At the same time, the associated uncertainty in the
international environment has resulted in tightened
credit conditions in Denmark, thereby adversely
affecting the propensity of businesses and
households to invest and consume. In addition,
consumption and investment are dampened by the
need for deleveraging in the private sector –
especially among households – as a result of the
rise in debt levels during the housing bubble and
the period of excess demand preceding the crisis.
Nevertheless, domestic demand is expected to be
the main growth driver this year and next, while
exports should gradually gain strength towards
2014 in line with rising demand from Denmark's
main export partners. Domestic demand is set to be
sustained by a number of government initiatives in
2012 and 2013, including the "kick-start" stimulus
package, the pay-out of voluntary early retirement
pension (VERP) contributions, the tax reform
agreed in spring, and a temporary modification of
depreciation allowances for certain investments.
Overall, GDP is expected to rise by 0.6%, 1.6%
and 1.3% respectively over the forecast horizon.
Downside risks to domestic demand

The total amount of the payout of VERP
contributions to households by 1 October 2012
was larger than anticipated, and the associated
increase in disposable income should provide a
boost to private consumption in the remainder of
this year and into next year. The projection for
private consumption in 2013 is also underpinned
by an increase in disposable income as a result of
the recent tax reform, and – as the need for
deleveraging is gradually reduced and the situation
in the labour market improves – private
consumption should continue to grow at moderate
pace in 2014.
Public investment and initiatives in relation to the
"kick-start" stimulus package are assessed as being
broadly implemented, albeit somewhat lower than
planned and subject to downside risks. In 2014, as
the temporary stimulus falls out, public investment

56

is expected to drop. Continued excess capacity and
tight credit conditions are likely to continue to
dampen private investment somewhat. At the same
time, however, the increased incentives introduced
by the government to bring forward investment to
this year and next are expected to prop up
investment – although there is a high degree of
uncertainty about the extent to which the more
favourable tax treatment of write-offs will be
decisive for the private sector. Overall, total gross
fixed capital formation is forecast to accelerate
throughout this year and next before slowing down
in 2014.
As in 2011, public consumption this year appears
to be lower than the amount budgeted, probably
reflecting the recent years' initiatives to reinforce
expenditure control. Thus, public consumption is
expected to be raised accordingly next year and in
2014, bringing it into line with the planned
amounts, and to contribute moderately to growth.
Adjustment in employment soon over

Overall, private employment and unemployment
have stabilised since the beginning of 2010, and
the moderate output growth has been achieved by
an increase in labour productivity towards the precrisis level. Although the downward adjustment in
employment is considered to be largely over, the
expected growth rates will be enough to ensure a
small rise in private employment only in 2014.
Nevertheless, total employment is set to increase
already from next year onwards, as public
employment should rise in line with public
consumption. Unemployment is expected to
remain stable in 2012-14.
Improvements in cost competitiveness…

Wage growth is expected to be below that of
Denmark's trading partners during the forecast
horizon, and real unit labour costs are set to
decline further as productivity growth continues to
catch up to its pre-crisis trend. An expected
depreciation of the real effective exchange rate,
especially in 2012, will also contribute to an
improvement of Denmark's competitive position.

Member States, Denmark

sustain export growth – at a moderate level – in
2012 and 2013. In 2014, as the economic cycle
gains more momentum, Denmark is again set to
lose export market shares. Import growth is set to
decrease in 2012 before picking up considerably in
2013 and subsequently to show a moderate
development in 2014 in line with final demand.

are
only
partly
counterbalanced by higher expected revenues from
tax on pensions in 2012 than in 2011. In 2013, the
deficit is reduced, as the budgetary effect of the
one-off payout of VERP contributions falls out. At
the same time, the tax reform agreed in spring
contributes positively to the budget balance,
including a one-off revenue of DKK 5 billion from
capital pension taxation according to government
estimates. This revenue estimate is very cautious,
and the government budget balance for 2013,
expected at -2% of GDP, may surprise on the
upside.

… but export growth likely to be subdued

The improvement in cost competitiveness,
however, is likely to only partly restore the
cumulative loss in competitiveness that has taken
place over the last decade. Hence, the relatively
favourable development in export goods growth in
the second quarter of 2012 and in recent months
probably rather reflects the large share of noncyclical goods in Danish exports which should

5. GERMANY
Robust consumption despite uncertain environment
Economic activity to regain momentum in the
course of 2013

After a slight decline in the fourth quarter of 2011,
German GDP rebounded at the beginning of 2012.
An expansion of 0.5% q-o-q (seasonally and
working-day adjusted) in the first quarter was
followed by lower growth of 0.3% q-o-q in the
second quarter. Growth in the first half of the year
was driven by both consumption and exports,
while the contribution of gross fixed capital
formation was negative.
The weakening of growth is likely to continue in
the second half of the year. Although recent data
on industrial production and firms' still-favourable
assessment of the current business situation
suggest that a moderate expansion of GDP has
taken place in the third quarter, expectations of a
further flagging of growth in the fourth quarter are
underpinned by business expectations below their
long-term average, slightly negative export
expectations and an apparent fall in industry orders
after their slight recovery in the preceding quarter.
This reflects the weakening of economic activity in
important trading partner countries as well as
uncertainty related to the euro-area crisis, which
weighs on investment.
Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the German
economy remain intact. Financing conditions are
relatively favourable and German firms are
benefitting from their strong competitive positions
as well as the regional diversification of trading
partners. Moreover, domestic demand should
continue to be underpinned by both consumption
and housing investment, which are in turn
supported by robust labour market conditions and
low interest rates. Thus, along with dissipating
uncertainty, economic growth is expected to regain
momentum in the course of next year, returning to
its medium-term trend and partly closing the
negative output gap in 2014. After a moderate
growth rate of 0.8% in both 2012 and 2013, GDP
is projected to expand by a healthy 2.0% in 2014.
Robust labour market and low interest rates
promoting private consumption

Employment growth is projected to continue over
the forecast horizon, while the downward trend in
unemployment is expected to stall. The still-robust

58

labour market, combined with significant wage
increases, should bolster private consumption.
Indeed, income expectations and the propensity to
buy have remained resilient, although employment
growth has decelerated for some months and
economic sentiment has deteriorated. Furthermore,
low interest rates stimulate private consumption
and housing investment. As of next year, private
consumption growth is expected to exceed the rise
in disposable income, which is partly slowed down
by progressive income taxation, implying a return
in 2013 to the downward trend in the savings rate
observed in recent years.

Uncertainty restraining investment

Investment slumped during the first two quarters
of 2012. Prevailing uncertainty appears to have
increased the reluctance of firms to invest in
machinery and equipment, in particular. However,
financing conditions are favourable and the
realisation of postponed investments in replacing
or upgrading production equipment is likely to
become more urgent. Although below-average
capacity utilisation suggests a limited need for
expansion of production capacity in the short term,
firms are reported to be planning investments in
changing and expanding their product range,
which are likely to be implemented once
uncertainty
dissipates
and
the
external
environment improves. In contrast, the prevailing
uncertainty seems to be fostering housing
investments, which are expected to continue
growing vibrantly. Overall, after declining by
1.2% in 2012, investment is set to regain
momentum and to grow by 1.9% in 2013 and 4.1%
in 2014.

Member States, Germany

Consumption supporting imports

The uncertain external environment is increasingly
expected to take a toll on exports, as suggested by
recent surveys indicating subdued export
expectations. Export growth is expected to halve in
2012, while picking up pace again in the
subsequent years along with reviving economic
activity in trading partner countries both within
and outside the euro area. While weak exports and
equipment investment will affect imports of related
intermediate and capital goods, robust private
consumption should underpin imports. The
expected reacceleration of exports and investment
over the forecast horizon will give an additional
boost to imports. Hence, import growth is
projected to outperform export growth in 2013 and
2014. Import prices should increase at a slower
pace due to declining energy prices. Yet, the
worsening of the terms of trade is expected to
continue, although at a slower rate, since exporters
may have less scope to pass on the projected rise in
unit labour costs. This implies that profit margins
should decline further and that Germany's current
account surplus should continue to diminish over
the forecast horizon.
Employment growth decelerating

After a marked rise in employment since 2010, the
pace of the increase has subsided in recent months.
Recruitment plans of businesses have become
more cautious in light of the subdued growth
outlook for the coming months. However, although
declining, the number of registered vacancies and
employment plans of companies do not appear to
be low. Moreover, during the deep recession of
2008-09, firms used flexible working time
arrangements to retain qualified staff, which has
allowed them to react flexibly to both the sharp
slowdown in demand and the subsequent quick
recovery. In the coming quarters, firms are
expected to make use of this flexibility once again,
implying a reduction in working time and leaving
scope for a small expansion of employment by
0.2% in 2013, after 1.1% in 2012. In the course of
2013, working time is projected to recover. The
rise in employment has been accompanied by
increased net immigration and a further
improvement in labour force participation in recent
quarters. Although the waning labour demand
should slow down the net inflow of immigrants
from other EU Member States, it is likely that
labour supply will slightly outperform labour
demand next year, implying an increase of 0.1 pp.
in the unemployment rate. In 2014, employment

growth should accelerate once again and the
unemployment rate should return to its level of
2012.
Wages growing, inflation edging lower

Social partners have recently agreed wage
increases that will raise pay by about 5% over their
duration. Given the gradual implementation of pay
settlements, increases in negotiated wages in 2013
are expected to be more pronounced than this year.
In addition, employees received large bonuses in
2012. These have been used by firms to establish a
better link between wages and the business
situation, with a view to increasing flexibility and
competitiveness. The robust labour market
suggests a continuation of significant wage
increases over the forecast horizon, following an
extended period of wage moderation during the
last decade. Bonuses are also expected to top up
wages, in particular once economic activity regains
momentum after the current slow-down. However,
the increase in compensation per employee will be
lowered by a reduction in the pension contribution
rate this and next year, leading to a steeper rise in
projected growth rates from 2.6% in 2012 to 3.1%
in 2014. The increase in employment is forecast to
exceed output gains in 2012, which leads to a rise
in unit labour costs of 2.8%. For the remainder of
the forecast period strengthening productivity
growth is expected to narrow the gap to growth of
labour compensation to 1.5 pps. in 2014.
The rise in excess capacity is likely to temporarily
narrow producers' scope for passing-on higher
wages to consumers, which should in turn limit
price pressures. Overall, an increase in core
inflation from 1½% to 2% over the forecast
horizon is projected. The recent impact of rising
energy prices on consumer prices is considered to
be temporary. The contribution of energy to
inflation is expected to fall once again, despite an
increase in the surcharge on electricity prices for
feeding-in renewable energy. Headline inflation is
therefore forecast to remain below 2% as of next
year, after 2.1% in 2012.
Approaching a balanced budget

Despite the moderate growth outlook, the general
government deficit is projected to drop to 0.2% of
GDP in 2012. This is partly due to the revision of
the 2011 deficit from 1% of GDP to 0.8% of GDP.
In addition, revenues are likely to increase more
strongly and expenditure somewhat more slowly

59

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

than earlier forecast. In particular, the robust
labour market and significant wage increases have
boosted payroll-tax revenues. The phasing-out of
the remaining stimulus measures is estimated to
contribute around 0.4% of GDP to consolidation in
2012. On the other hand, the projection takes
account of lower revenues due to a reduction of the
pension contribution rate by 0.3 pp. this year and a
further 0.7 pp. to 18.9% in 2013, as well as
additional expenditure resulting from the agreed
wage increases for the public sector at federal and
municipal levels for 2012 and 2013. In contrast,
the tax reform proposed by the federal government
to reduce fiscal drag has not been taken into
account, since no political agreement has been
reached so far. In line with the growth outlook and
the relatively favourable labour market projections,
the general government budget is forecast to
remain unchanged at a deficit of 0.2% of GDP in
2013 and to be balanced in 2014. Accordingly, it is
estimated that the structural general government
budget balance is projected to turn into a small
surplus of about ¼% of GDP in 2012 and to
broadly stabilise thereafter.

Bank and a second transfer of impaired assets from
WestLB to its "bad bank" ("Erste Abwicklungsanstalt") will impact on gross debt, which is
projected to rise by 1.2 pps. to 81.7% of GDP in
2012. Further on, gross debt is projected to drop to
80.8% of GDP in 2013 and to 78.4% of GDP in
2014 due to the denominator effect of GDP
growth. The on-going winding-up of "bad banks"
could further reduce the debt stock.

Returning to balanced growth
Export growth expected to regain momentum

Strong domestic demand and favourable labour
market developments are the main growth drivers
in 2012. Although Estonia's economy relies
heavily on the Nordic countries, which seem to be
resilient in the sovereign-debt crisis, some growth
momentum was lost due to a weakening external
demand and exports. Therefore, economic growth
is forecast to slow down to 2.5% in 2012 from
export-led 8.3% in 2011.

reinforced in 2013 as export possibilities improve.
Backed by low interest rates and a recovering
lending activity, the private-sector deleveraging is
coming to a halt, but the high loan stock will likely
remain a drag on credit growth.
In 2013, Estonia’s 3.1% GDP growth is expected
to be balanced and converge to its long-term
average trend by 2014 (4%). Based on the
recovery in its main trading partners, Estonia’s
export growth is supporting domestic demand.
Graph II.6.1:Estonia - GDP growth and contributions

The high volatility and contraction in export and
industrial production volumes in this year mainly
reflected a sharp fall in electronics exports, as
global uncertainty rose and demand for specific
high-tech communication devices declined. Reexports of mineral products added to the export
volatility. These two volatile components aside,
export growth remained positive and reached
11.5% y-o-y in August. The increasing importance
of Russia as a trading partner in recent months has
partly stemmed from one-off factors, e.g. re-export
of machinery and oil transit. Nevertheless, the
relatively good economic performance of Russia,
along with the country's recent accession to the
WTO, is expected to have a longer-term positive
effect on Estonia’s foreign trade. Seasonallyadjusted manufacturing output has been improving
steadily since April and picked up pace to 2%
m-o-m in August. A positive outlook for export
growth is also supported by firms’ sentiment
which is still above its long-term average.
Strong consumption and public investment
supporting growth …

With an improving labour market situation and
strengthening consumer sentiment, retail trade
registered a steady growth of close to 7% y-o-y in
the past few months. In addition, the planned
increases in different benefits and pensions in 2013
should support the ability of poorer households’ to
cope with high inflation and uphold consumption.
Investment activity has been very strong, with high
public investments. This is expected to continue to
end-2012, when the majority of projects financed
through the revenue from the sale of excess
greenhouse gas emission certificates will be about
to end and EU funding-related projects are
completed. Corporate investment is expected to be

… in an improving labour market …

The unemployment rate (age group 15-74)
declined rapidly and significantly to 10.2% in the
second quarter of 2012 from 13.3% one year
earlier. The labour force participation ratio
remained historically high and is assumed to
increase further due to changes in the age
structure. Employment has been growing rapidly at
about 3.7% in recent quarters and is forecast to
continue growing, mainly in the sectors servicing
the domestic market. However, employment
growth appears to be temporarily slowing, feeding
into a decelerating nominal wage growth at 5.0%
y-o-y on average in the second quarter of 2012.
Wage growth is expected to remain at around 5.4%
in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 - levels moderate for
Estonia - with real wage growth increasingly
positive at 1.4% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.
Vacancy rates are again high, pointing to growing
skills mismatches and, possibly, low labour market
mobility. The unemployment rate has already
dropped to the NAWRU, supporting a sizeable
monthly wage increase in construction in the
second quarter of 2012, but below productivity
growth. In manufacturing, wage growth outpaced
productivity growth, reducing thereby companies'

phenomenon is expected to disappear soon, when
global demand and exports start growing again.

investment projects related to the sale of excess
greenhouse gas emission certificates should alter
the balance in the second half of the year and a
deficit of 1.1% of GDP is expected for 2012 as a
whole. This, however, is considerably better than
the targeted deficit of 2.6% of GDP.

…with slowly declining inflation

The 12 month-average inflation rate stabilised at
around 4.4% in early autumn as food prices started
to pick up again and higher energy prices kept
heating and transport prices up. Inflation in 2013
will be affected by several administrative changes:
the full opening of Estonia's electricity market and
higher transfer fees, increases by 5-6% in alcohol
and tobacco excises and the introduction of free
public transport in Tallinn. Overall, declining
global commodity prices in 2013 and 2014 is
assumed to ensure that inflation continues its slow
decline. Finally, as wage growth is moderating in
the second half of 2012 and core inflation remains
tamed, there is no short-term risk of excessive
wage inflation.

After 2012, one-off expenditure factors will scale
down and the budget deficit is expected to improve
to 0.5% of GDP in 2013. The fiscal position is
projected to turn into a surplus of 0.3% of GDP in
2014. The unfreezing of the public wage bill with a
planned wage increase of 4.4% for civil servants,
along with a pension increase of 5% and a cut in
the unemployment insurance premium by 1.2 pps.
to 3%, as stated in draft 2013 state budget, will add
pressures to the budget balance. Local elections in
October 2013 might have an impact on public
expenditure.
Net of cyclical factors and one-offs, the general
government deficit is expected to reach -0.4% of
GDP at the end of 2012 and to revert to a surplus
of 0.2% of GDP in 2014. The general government
debt will increase over the forecast horizon from
6.1% of GDP in 2011 to 11.2% in 2014, mostly
owing to the EFSF and ESM contributions.

Public finances in order

With strong tax revenue collection and a budget
close to balance in July, the fiscal outcome in
Estonia has been better than expected in the first
half of this year. However, large scale one-off

The road to recovery is still challenging
Global slowdown

hits

nascent

export-led

The expansion of the Irish economy moderated in
the first half of 2012 to 0.5% compared to the
same period in 2011, following real GDP growth
of 1.4% in 2011. Net exports continued to be the
sole growth engine, as all subcategories of
domestic demand shrunk on the back of sustained
household and public sector deleveraging and
weak labour markets. More positively, the orderly
adjustment of the Irish economy was recently
rewarded with improved market sentiment in the
form of declining sovereign-bond yields, which
enabled the sovereign to resume debt issuances.
On balance, 2012 real GDP growth has thus been
marked down only marginally to 0.4%. Weakening
trading partner demand is expected to weigh more
heavily on the external sector during 2013, which
together with lack of support from the domestic
economy is forecast to result in a more moderate
expansion in 2013, with growth at 1.1%.
Domestic demand remains subdued due to
deleveraging and fiscal consolidation

A further contraction across all domestic demand
components is envisioned for the rest of 2012.
Private consumption and investment are expected
to decline at moderating rates in 2013-14, as the
debt overhang is being addressed and the outlook
for the construction sector remains bleak. While
fiscal multipliers are low in the very open Irish
economy,
the
planned
continued
fiscal
consolidation will subtract from GDP growth
during the forecast period. Domestic demand is
expected to return to positive growth in 2014 after
six years, led by the private sector.
External imbalances are falling, though the
backdrop has deteriorated

Export growth moderated in the second quarter of
2012 after a relatively strong expansion in the first
quarter. Expected surpluses in both the services
and goods trade balances by end-2012 are
projected to outweigh a likely increase in net factor
income outflows, and push up the current-account
surplus further to 2.3% of GDP. Competiveness
indicators are expected to improve in 2012 and
throughout the forecast period, albeit at a more
gradual pace than during the first years of the

crisis. Export demand is anticipated to be hurt by
the worsening euro area and UK outlook in 201314 but helped somewhat by the relative resilience
of the US economy. The current-account surpluses
are therefore forecast to continue growing during
the period.
Labour markets remain weak, moderating
inflation

The labour market deteriorated further during the
first half of 2012, with employment falling by
1.8%, mainly reflecting public sector layoffs and
retirements. Due to migration-driven falls in the
labour force, the fall in employment did not fully
translate into increased unemployment, which
increased somewhat compared to the 2011 average
to 14.8%. Only small increases in employment are
expected in 2013-14 as growth will be driven by
the relatively capital-intensive export sector.
Unemployment is expected to decrease very
gradually and hence be increasingly long-term in
nature. HICP inflation surprised on the upside
during the first half of 2012 due to relatively
strong increases in energy, administered and
services prices, and the end-year inflation forecast
has been revised upwards to 2%. These effects are
expected to peter out and inflation to decline
gradually to 1.4% in 2014.
Broadly balanced macroeconomic risks

Downside risks stem from the uncertain external
outlook, especially trading partner demand,
although the Irish export sector decoupled
successfully during the first years of the crisis.
Expiring patents could however reduce growth in
chemical exports. There are downside risks to
private consumption from further falls in real
estate prices, but also upside ones given substantial
pent-up demand if precautionary savings decline
and financing conditions ease, facilitating balance
sheet repair and credit flows.
Fiscal pressures increase

The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio stood
at 13.4% in 2011 (including 4.3% of GDP of oneoff banking support measures). The 2012 fiscal
deficit is now estimated at 8.4% of GDP. Central
government cash data through September shows
strong tax revenue performance offsetting some

expenditure overruns, mainly in social and health
services. While renewed effort and additional
measures should contain the slippages in the health
sector, some overruns in unemployment benefits
and social contributions would persist.

forecast includes the planned fiscal adjustment of
3.9% of GDP over the two years, of which onethird is on revenue side and two-thirds on
expenditure. Moreover, the 2012 expenditure
overruns in health sector (0.3% of GDP) will be
fully corrected by structural measures. The
structural balance adjustment is lower than the
nominal adjustment, due to low potential growth as
the economy undergoes structural changes. Lower
real economic growth weakens the fiscal position,
though this is somewhat offset by more favourable
price developments.

The government debt-to-GDP ratio increased from

8. GREECE
Fiscal consolidation in the midst of internal adjustment
The grip of recession extends to 2013

The provisional national accounts data release of
September confirms that the Greek economy
remains in deep recession. GDP fell year-on-year
by 6.3% in the second quarter which, after a fall of
6.5% in the first quarter, suggests a yearly decline
of 6.0% in 2012 as a whole. The contraction is
expected to extend into 2013, a sixth year of
recession, and its main drivers remain broadly
unchanged. First, household disposable income
keeps shrinking in response to rising
unemployment and downward wage adjustment in
both the private and public sectors. Second,
savings measures introduced to contain the fiscal
imbalances reinforce the contraction of domestic
demand. Third, investment activity remains
heavily subdued due to restrained access to credit
and the uncertainties that remain after the political
tensions around the double elections in spring
2012. In addition, exports dynamics affected by
weakening external demand are insufficient to
counter recessionary pressures in Greece.

Growth recovery to surface in 2014

The turning point of the recession is expected in
the second half of 2013, leading to moderate GDP
growth of 0.6% in 2014. This projection relies on
the return of confidence and investment, boosted
by the implementation of reforms under the
economic adjustment programme, as well as
progress with major projects co-financed by EU
funds. The drag exerted by consumption, heavily
affected in 2013 by the fiscal consolidation, is
projected to fade. The economic rebound is
expected to be reinforced by strengthening net
exports driven by subdued imports and a

continuous improvement in the balance of trade in
services. The current-account deficit is expected to
move closer to sustainable levels, reaching around
5% of GDP in 2014.

The recovery rests on the crucial assumption of
timely and rigorous implementation of the
adjustment programme. Substantial uncertainty is
associated with the forecast with significant risks
on both sides related to the impact of the
consolidation effort on economic sentiment, the
speed and success of structural reforms, the pace
of competitiveness and productivity gains, the
extent of price adjustment and its impact on
disposable income, and the strength of the external
environment.
Labour market continues to undergo painful
adjustment

The labour market continues to suffer from the
prolonged contraction in economic activity.
According to the Labour Force Survey, in the
second quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate
rose to over 23% (compared with slightly above
16% in the corresponding quarter of 2011) and
employment fell to around 53% of the working age
population (a decrease of 8.7% compared to mid2011). The labour market is expected to bottom
out in 2013 and recover only slowly thereafter,
with the unemployment rate at around 22% in
2014. In the medium term, the fall in the
unemployment rate should gain momentum,
reflecting structural labour market reforms aimed
at promoting flexible forms of employment and the
decentralisation of wage negotiations.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

Continued wage reductions set to eventually
be reflected in price declines

projected to decline to 6.8% of GDP from 9.4% of
GDP in 2011, in spite of the stronger-thanexpected recession. Interest expenditure as a share
of GDP is projected to decline by 2 pps. in 2012,
reflecting the debt relief provided in the context of
approval of the second programme in March 2012.
The government aims to achieve a primary budget
balance in 2013. Based on the current projections,
this would require additional measures of around
5% of GDP, which are being adopted with the
2013 budget. This would reduce the government
deficit to 5.5% of GDP. The consolidation effort
will lead to an improvement in the structural
balance, from close to -5½% to ½% of GDP from
2011-14. Gross public debt is projected to increase
to 176.7% of GDP in 2012. This is 16 pps. higher
than foreseen in spring, reflecting revisions to
nominal GDP, lower growth and privatisation
proceeds and other stock flow adjustments. The
debt ratio is projected to rise to 188.4% of GDP in
2013, mainly on account of the sizeable nominal
contraction of the economy and to peak in 2014 at
188.9%. Thereafter it is expected to fall at an
accelerating pace, supported by stronger nominal
GDP growth and an improving budget balance.

Extensive labour market reforms and the severity
of the current economic contraction continue to put
significant downward pressure on wages.
Compensation per employee fell by 3.4% in 2011
and is projected to fall further, by 6.8% in both
2012 and 2013. These developments have already
contributed to a moderation in consumer prices in
the last two years and this trend has continued in
the first three quarters of this year. For 2012
overall, the headline HICP inflation rate is forecast
at around 1.1%. In 2013 and 2014, prices are
forecast to actually fall, reflecting wage
developments with some lag. Overall, the passthrough from wages to prices is, however,
expected to remain moderate. Persistent product
market imperfections, but also the need to rebuild
profits to strengthen the financial position of
companies and to support investment, mean that
cost-reductions are not fully passed on to
consumers. Administered prices and indirect taxes
(inter alia, on electricity, water and heating oil
consumption) are also set to increase further.
Clear progress in reducing the fiscal deficit

In 2012, the general government deficit is

9. SPAIN
Deep adjustment continues
Rebalancing is underway in the midst of
recession

The adjustment of the large external and internal
imbalances built up in the years prior to the crisis
is holding back economic growth in Spain and has
led to very high unemployment. The sizeable stock
of private sector debt is prompting deleveraging
among households and non-financial corporations.
It also implies a profound shift in the composition
of GDP growth away from domestic demand.
Unemployment remains stuck at very elevated
levels and is set to increase further. Public
finances, which suffered a significant deterioration
in the wake of the crisis, need to be brought back
onto a sustainable path. Ambitious fiscal
consolidation plans are being put in place but are
weighing on the short-term growth outlook. The
correction of these imbalances will affect domestic
demand adversely over the forecast horizon,
although a gradual improvement is expected in
2014, under a no-policy-change assumption.
Resilient exports should continue to provide some
cushion to otherwise very weak economic growth.

construction and real estate sector is expected to
keep credit flows to the real economy constrained,
contributing to the weakness of private
consumption and investment.
Pressures on the sovereign have abated recently
due, to a large extent, to the OMT (Outright
Monetary Transactions) announced by the ECB.
However, uncertainty remains elevated and
financing conditions are subject to considerable
strain. In parallel to fiscal consolidation, the
Spanish authorities are implementing a
comprehensive programme of structural reforms,
which includes an ambitious labour market reform
that was adopted in February and slightly modified
in July 2012. An additional structural reform
package was announced in September 2012.

Real GDP is expected to contract by around 1½%
both in 2012 and 2013. Spain entered its second
recession since 2009-10 in the fourth quarter of
2011. Growth is expected to remain negative well
into 2013. The main factors behind the expected
contraction in economic activity in 2012-13
include further deterioration in the labour market,
deleveraging of the private sector, fiscal
consolidation, and tight credit conditions – all set
in the context of the ongoing crisis in the euro area
and somewhat weaker external demand.
Recurrent problems in some of the Spanish banks,
struggling to deal with a large stock of impaired
real estate related assets, eventually led the
Spanish government to apply for external financial
assistance for the recapitalisation of financial
institutions from the European Financial Stability
Facility
(EFSF).
The
Memorandum
of
Understanding (MoU) was signed on 23 July and it
was agreed that up to EUR 100 billion will be
made available by the EFSF for restructuring and
recapitalisation of Spanish banks. This programme
is expected to have a positive impact on the
stability of the financial sector in Spain. However,
in the short term, the necessary adjustment in
credit growth following the boom and bust of the

Domestic demand remains subdued

Private consumption is set to act as a drag on
growth over the forecast horizon, with some
positive growth expected only in 2014. In 2012,
private consumption will be particularly subdued
due to record high unemployment, ongoing
household deleveraging and the binding credit
constraint. Households' disposable income is set to
decline significantly due to a fall in the
compensation of employees and an increase in
income taxes. In addition, households' wealth will
be reduced given an expected further fall in house
prices. These trends will be further magnified by
higher inflation, reducing real disposable income
in 2012 and 2013. The saving rate is expected to
decrease to less than 9% - a level that is well
below the historical average of 11% - as
households try to smooth their consumption and
their ability to save is constrained by falling
income levels.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

Investment, particularly investment in equipment,
is set to decline given the unfavourable economic
outlook, high corporate indebtedness, excess
capacity and difficult access to credit. Business
confidence in industry is very low and the main
component of overall investment continues to be
replacement investment. All in all, corporations are
expected to increase their net lending position, also
on the back of improving profitability, thus
increasing the potential for accelerating the
reduction in accumulated debt. The adjustment in
the housing market is still ongoing, with the fall in
house prices accelerating in 2012. The cumulative
fall in house prices has reached 28% in nominal
terms and 36% in real terms since the peak in
2007. Further adjustment is expected given the
remaining large stock of unsold houses. Nonresidential construction is expected to decline,
driven mostly by fiscal consolidation and, to a
lesser extent, by lower corporate investment.
Public consumption is also projected to fall,
reflecting the impact of fiscal consolidation at all
levels of government.
Net exports continue to support growth

Export growth is expected to remain robust over
the forecast horizon and should gather pace after a
somewhat weaker 2012. Declining unit labour
costs (ULC) and improving product and regional
diversification have allowed Spain to increase its
export market share – a trend that is expected to
continue over the forecast horizon. This is
important to achieve a further reduction in the high
external deficit. As a result of very weak imports,
which are due to subdued domestic demand, and
relatively resilient exports, Spain's trade balance
has significantly improved and is expected to
record a surplus in 2012. These trends have led to
an accelerated correction in the current-account
deficit, which is expected to be in balance by 2013.
However, the high dependence of the Spanish
economy on energy imports and the high and
increasing interest burden may constrain the
necessary improvement of the current account.
Employment getting worse before it gets better

The labour market situation deteriorated further
and the unemployment rate reached 24.6% in the
second quarter of 2012. The recent labour market
reform allows firms greater flexibility to adjust
wages and employment (including working hours)
to their specific economic situation. However,
given the current weakness of the Spanish

68

economy and a relatively short time span since its
entry into force, it may take some time before the
first positive effects become manifest. So far, the
adjustment in employment continues to take place
through the reduction in the number of workers
rather than a reduction in working hours. Unlike
before, permanent employment is now being
affected as much as temporary employment. The
rise in unemployment affects all branches of
activity. Moreover, the duration of the crisis has
led to an increase in long-term unemployment. In
the second quarter of 2012, it reached more than
50% of total unemployment, twice its 2008 level.
Wage growth moderates while inflation picks
up

In spite of the weakness of the Spanish economy,
inflation accelerated and reached 3.5% in
September. However, this acceleration was
predominantly driven by exogenous factors:
energy prices pushed up by hikes in oil prices and
discretionary measures, such as the increases in copayments for medicines, higher VAT rates, higher
university tuition fees and an increase in electricity
and gas prices. The effects of these discretionary
measures are expected to be visible in year-on-year
growth rates of prices until the last quarter of 2013.
Wage growth is expected to be much more
moderate than in the past, reflecting a positive
impact of the recent labour market reform, paving
the way to a faster recovery in employment. The
combination of moderate wage growth and
sustained improvements in productivity is
expected to reduce real ULCs over the forecast
horizon, enabling Spain to regain some of its lost
competitiveness.
Fiscal consolidation to intensify in second half
of 2012

Fiscal consolidation hardly advanced in the first
eight months of 2012. Planned expenditure cuts
seem to be on track, but broad-based revenue
shortfalls, higher interest payments and rising
social transfers almost offset these improvements.
Following further fiscal consolidation measures
presented in July, including an increase in VAT,
the elimination of the 2012 Christmas bonus in the
public sector and some measures on the corporate
tax side at the central level, there should be
significant fiscal tightening in the second half of
the year. This is also likely to be the case at
regional government level, where expenditure cuts
in education are expected to kick in. For the year

Member States, Spain

as a whole, the general government deficit is
therefore expected to narrow to about 8% of GDP,
or about 7% of GDP – whereby 1% is entirely due
to bank recapitalisation.

6.4% of GDP, due to the expiry of some of the
measures introduced in 2012.
Over 2011-14, virtually all of the improvement in
government net lending stems from lower
expenditure, with the effect of discretionary tax
hikes just offsetting revenue losses due to the
recessionary environment and the ongoing
structural shift away from a tax-rich growth pattern
based on domestic demand. Overall, risks are tilted
to the downside. In addition to yet uncertain exact
amount of bank recapitalisation, the less tax-rich
growth composition could lead to lower-thanexpected revenues.

In 2013, the general government deficit is expected
to narrow further, thanks to further discretionary
measures more than offsetting the impact of the
continued recession. The July 2012 fiscal package
contained some elements that are expected to have
their major impact in 2013, such as the VAT hike.
The 2013 Budget Bill presented to parliament in
September contained further consolidation
measures, mainly on the expenditure side.
Together with consolidation efforts at regional and
local levels announced in the 2013-14 budget plan
presented in August, these measures are expected
to generate a net fiscal consolidation of about 1%
of GDP. Thus, the general government deficit is
forecast to reach around 6% of GDP in 2013. In
2014, the expiry of some of the measures
introduced in 2012, such as the income tax hike, is
roughly offsetting the planned consolidation
included in the 2013-14 budget plan. Despite the
fact that output and employment is expected to
return to positive, albeit weak, growth, the general
government deficit is expected to deteriorate to

The structural balance is expected to improve from
-6¼% of GDP in 2012 to -4% of GDP in 2013,
before deteriorating again in 2014 to -5¼% of
GDP. Large public deficits, negative or low
nominal GDP growth and high interest rates on
government borrowing are likely to result in the
government gross debt rising from 69.3% of GDP
in 2011 to more than 97% of GDP in 2014. Oneoff effects of the payment of arrears to suppliers
and a contribution to EFSF/ESM funds add to an
increase in general government debt in 2012.

One more year of flat growth before recovery
Deteriorated

the

The French economy has slowed down amid the
economic contraction in the euro area in 2012, but
has fared better than many of its European peers
thanks to relatively resilient domestic demand and
in spite of disappointing exports. However, after
three quarters of stagnating GDP and historically
low levels of corporate profitability, prospects for
an imminent recovery have waned. Entrepreneurs,
whose confidence has suffered, are expected to
scale down their investment and employment plans
in the short term. Deteriorations in the business
climate and in the labour market point towards a
persistent stagnation or small contraction of
activity in the second semester of 2012. Private
consumption is not expected again to play its usual
role as the main driver of growth, although it
remains stable enough to prevent a contraction in
GDP for the year as a whole. Overall, with 0.2%
annual GDP growth in 2012, the French economy
is forecast to remain anaemic.
The recovery is expected to be slow in 2013, with
a modest increase in GDP of 0.4%. Firms are
forecast to limit employment creation in order to
maintain their profitability and productivity.
Unemployment and tax rises are likely to weigh on
households’ purchasing power and will keep
confidence low. As a result, private consumption is
expected to decrease while the still dynamic public
consumption is set to contribute positively to GDP
growth.

Activity is set to gradually gain momentum in
2014. Confidence is projected to improve
gradually in line with the expected fading of the
euro-area sovereign-debt crisis and some
improvement in the country's fiscal position.
Households are set to reduce their relatively high
savings, private companies are forecast to
accelerate their investment spending, and external
demand is foreseen to strengthen. GDP growth is
therefore projected to increase to 1.2% in 2014,
slightly above potential growth.
Persistent rise in unemployment

Employment decelerated sharply in the first half of
2012. The unemployment rate reached 10.3% in
the second quarter, against 9.6% one year before.
In the current context of stagnating economic
activity and rigid nominal wages, employers are
likely to focus on restoring productivity, to the
detriment of job creation. As a consequence,
unemployment is expected to continue to rise to
10.7% in 2013 and to stabilise at this level in 2014.
Unemployment and tax rises to hold back
private consumption and recovery in 2013

New taxes introduced by the government in its
2013 budget have been targeted towards highincome households, with a specific focus on the
10th decile of the income distribution, which has a
lower propensity to consume. The impact on
consumption is therefore expected to be lower than
would be the case with a broad-based tax increase.
However, persistently rising unemployment is
likely to weigh on consumption.
To smoothen consumption, households are
expected to decrease their saving rate in 2012 and
2013. Some positive developments can also be
expected from the foreseen decline in inflation that
would mitigate losses in real income. All in all,
household consumption is projected to stagnate in
2012 and to decrease by 0.1% in 2013. The
stabilisation of the labour market, together with a
further reduction in the saving rate, is projected to
lead to an acceleration of private consumption in
2014.

Member States, France

No pick up in investment in the medium term

Downward risks prevail

Although credit conditions appear relatively
favourable, the conditions for a rapid pick-up in
investment do not yet seem to be met. Three
quarters of flat economic growth and the enduring
deterioration in the profit margins of non-financial
companies, which reached a low point in 2011, are
likely to have significantly dented entrepreneurs’
confidence and expectations. Weak demand, both
from domestic and foreign agents, will continue to
prevent firms from significantly restoring
investment in 2012 as well as 2013.

Beyond the risks associated with the general
economic environment, specific downward risks
relating to the French economy weigh on the
potential recovery.

Increasing confidence of firms is projected to start
to drive a gradual recovery from the second
semester 2013 onwards. A modest virtuous cycle
would be engaged in 2014, with gradual increases
in aggregate demand resulting in a partial catch-up
in investment. After the slight restocking observed
in the first semester 2012, the level of inventories
should stabilise over the forecast horizon.
External trade driven by a slowdown in imports

The development of French exports is expected to
remain somewhat weaker than contained world
demand as the persistent deterioration in external
competitiveness observed over the last ten years is
not likely to be reversed in the medium term.
French companies are set to continue to lose export
market shares.
In spite of the weakness of external demand, the
deceleration of imports in 2012 and 2013 is
expected to lead to a significant positive
contribution of net exports to GDP growth (0.4 and
0.3 pp. in 2012 and 2013 respectively). In 2014,
the external contribution to growth is expected to
drop to zero, in line with a gradual economic
recovery and the concomitant increase in imports.
Decreasing inflationary pressures

Past increases in energy prices have contributed to
maintaining a relatively high level of inflation in
the first semester of 2012 despite the slowdown of
economic activity. In the second semester, oil
prices are assumed to stabilise and inflation to be
unchanged at 2.3%. In 2013 and 2014, the inflation
rate is expected to decrease to 1.7% for both years
on the back of high unemployment and weak
economic growth.

Although a number of uncertainties related to the
financial sector have been lifted, the impact of
stronger capital requirements of banks could have
a stronger-than-expected adverse impact on new
lending. Constrained credit growth could limit
investment and the pace of recovery. Finally, less
dynamic exports cannot be excluded if
competitiveness deteriorates even more than
currently expected.
Fiscal challenges still remain

In 2012, the general government deficit is set to
reach 4.5% of GDP, in line with the official target
(revised from 4.4% in the stability programme)
and down from 5.2% last year. The authorities
secured this by adopting additional consolidation
measures in July to compensate for worsening
growth and lower-than-expected tax elasticities.
Together with previously adopted measures, the
effort on the revenue side now represents around
1% of GDP, partly offset by weak economic
growth. The rise in expenditure is projected to
remain below historical levels, with central
government spending decreasing in real terms and
an only subdued rise in social benefits. Savings
come from cuts in the wage bill (freezing base
wages, replacing only half of retiring central
government civil servants), a freeze on transfers
from central government to local authorities, an
only partial indexation of some social benefits (e.g.
family and housing), and a tighter healthcare
spending norm. Furthermore, the 2010 pension
reform, which included a gradual increase of the
minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full
pension age from 65 to 67, is gaining momentum.
In 2013, the deficit is set to further decrease on the
back of the measures already adopted and those
presented in the draft budget which aims at 3% of
GDP. Additional revenues (1.4% of GDP) are
planned to be mainly raised by increasing the
personal income tax on high incomes, reducing
corporate income tax credits, increasing donation
and inheritance taxes, abolishing tax and social
security exemptions on overtime, increasing social
levies on employee savings schemes as well as on
capital income and gains, and creating a dividend
tax. Current expenditure rules (central government

71

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

and healthcare) are renewed and this will
contribute to maintaining an only subdued increase
in spending. On the other hand, the fact that GDP
will again grow significantly below its potential
will have a negative impact on the headline deficit.
Overall, the deficit is expected to reach 3½% of
GDP in 2013. The difference with the official
target
mainly
stems
from
divergent
macroeconomic scenarios, the one underlying this
forecast being less benign. A somewhat lower
impact of revenue measures compared with the
official estimates, notably concerning the fight
against tax evasion and the reduction of corporate
income tax credits, and slightly more dynamic
public expenditure also play a role.
Under the usual no-policy-change assumption, the
deficit is forecast to remain unchanged in 2014.
The tax burden is expected to stabilise, while
public expenditure is set to accelerate somewhat,
notably with healthcare spending savings
remaining to be specified.

Positive risks to this scenario mainly relate to this
year's budgetary outcome that might turn out better
than currently targeted. Indeed, whereas a full
execution has been assumed in this forecast, the
deficit targets were overachieved both in 2010 and
2011 (whereas there were slippages in the previous
years at the level of general government). On the
negative side, a comparatively low tax content of
economic activity and a higher than currently
expected negative impact of some court decisions
cannot be fully ruled out at this stage.
The debt ratio, which will reach 90% by the end of
2012, is expected to continue to rise over the
forecast horizon on the back of still high expected
deficits. The public loan launched in 2010 (the socalled "investissements d'avenir" programme,
notably consisting in public investment) is set to
have only a marginal impact.

Overall, this implies a cumulated improvement in
the structural balance of around 2½% of GDP in
2012-13, followed by a marginal deterioration in
2014.

11. ITALY
Uncertainty and tight financing conditions delay recovery
A deep recession in 2012…

In 2012, the Italian economy is expected to
contract by 2.3% on the back of a sharp fall in
domestic demand, especially in investment.
Uncertainty in financial markets remains elevated,
continuing to affect economic agents' confidence
and their investment and spending decisions.
Furthermore, the protracted euro-area sovereigndebt crisis has exerted significant upward pressure
on interest rates. In the context of a fragmented
financial sector across national borders, this has
fed into funding pressures in the banking sector
and tighter financing conditions for the private
sector. In turn, credit tightening may amplify the
dampening impact of the sizeable fiscal
consolidation on domestic demand. Finally, the
deteriorated external economic environment has
tapered the expansion of exports, even though the
trade balance is set to return to positive territory in
2012 as imports decline significantly.
…followed by a tepid recovery

Under the assumption of a gradual normalisation
of financial market conditions and reduced
uncertainty, the pace of contraction of economic
activity is set to decelerate in the second half of
2012, following two consecutive quarters of real
GDP growth at -0.8%. Economic activity is
expected to start growing again as from the second
half of 2013, but at a very subdued pace. For 2013
as a whole, private consumption is set to contract
further and return into positive territory only in
2014, in line with real disposable income
developments. Investment in equipment is
expected to recover faster, as financing conditions
and confidence improve, while the correction in
the construction sector is forecast to continue into
2014. The expected acceleration in Italy's export
markets and the euro depreciation that occurred in
2012 are set to lead to stronger export growth in
2013, in particular towards non-EU trade partners.
Depressed domestic demand would continue
curbing imports in 2013, while in 2014 their
rebound is expected to outpace growth of exports
due to the recovery in domestic demand, in
particular for investment in equipment.
Overall, the trade balance is set to remain positive,
also thanks to the assumed reduction in oil prices
over the whole forecast horizon. Therefore, the

current-account deficit is forecast to narrow to less
than ½% of GDP over 2013-14.

Higher unemployment and wage moderation

On the back of the ongoing recession, the
unemployment rate is expected to increase by over
2 pps., entering double-digit territory, in 2012, and
by another percentage point over 2013-14. This
trend continues to be mainly driven by an
expanding labour force. Two major factors can be
held to explain the significant increase in labour
market participation since mid-2011. On the one
hand, more individuals, in particular women and
young people, are now impelled to look for jobs as
households' disposable income falls. On the other
hand, the recently adopted pension reforms are
pushing older workers to remain in the labour
market. Moreover, after increasing slightly in
2011, headcount employment is expected to
decline in 2012 and 2013, even though job losses
in 2012 are held back by some labour hoarding by
firms.
Hours worked are projected to fall significantly
more in 2012-13, and recover relatively faster in
2014, owing to the firms' increased use, during the
recession, of the wage supplementation scheme
and part-time work. When measured in terms of
full-time
equivalent
employment,
labour
productivity is projected to fall in 2012, and start
increasing again, but only moderately, in 2013-14.
Wages in the private sector are expected to grow
below inflation over the forecast horizon, while
public sector wages continue to be frozen. As a
result, nominal unit labour costs are forecast to
accelerate in 2012, increasing by more than 2%,

73

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

before slowing down below 1% over 2013-14.
Taken together with the depreciation of the
nominal effective exchange rate in 2012, Italy is
expected to recover some cost competitiveness
over the forecast horizon, in particular vis-à-vis its
non-EU trade partners.

transfer expenditure. On the capital side, direct
investment and transfers are both expected to
contract significantly, but the reduction in total
capital expenditure is tempered by the proceeds of
the sale of broadband licences, which are recorded
as negative capital asset sales in 2011.

Indirect taxes and oil prices shape inflation
developments

Despite the expected large contraction in domestic
demand, revenues are projected to rise
substantially as a share of GDP in 2012, by 2 pps.
from 2011, thanks to the adopted discretionary
measures. The increase in the standard VAT rate
(from 20% to 21%), in excise duties on fuel and
especially in taxation on property enacted in 2011
are anticipated to more than offset the fall in tax
revenues entailed by both the negative income
dynamics and the large fall in consumption,
notably of tax-rich durable goods. At the same
time, the expiry of one-off taxes in 2012 is bound
to reduce the capital revenue intake relative to
2011.

Annual HICP inflation remained above 3% in the
first three quarters of 2012 due to higher oil prices
and the increases in excise duties on fuel and the
standard VAT rate that were enacted in 2011.
Annual inflation is expected to ease at the end of
2012, thanks to the favourable base effect. A
further 1 pp. increase in the standard and reduced
VAT rates scheduled for July 2013 will push
prices up again in the third quarter of 2013.
Inflation is expected to go well below 2% in the
second half of 2014 due to the assumed decline in
oil prices and reduced pressure from labour costs.
Fiscal consolidation continues only until 2013

Despite the sharp economic downturn, the general
government deficit is projected to narrow to 2.9%
of GDP in 2012, from 3.9% in 2011, and to 2.1%
in both 2013 and 2014. The projected increase in
interest expenditure over the forecast period
reflects the sharp increase in the sovereign-risk
premium in the second half of 2011, as well as an
increasing debt. It implies that the primary surplus
improves more significantly than the overall
general government balance, on the back of the
sizeable consolidation measures adopted in 2010
and 2011: from 1% of GDP in 2011, the primary
surplus is set to reach 3.7% in 2014.
In 2012, total primary expenditure is expected to
decline slightly year-on-year (for the third year in a
row) thanks to the expenditure saving measures
adopted since May 2010, including in the context
of the spending review in the summer 2012. The
public sector wage bill has been significantly
restrained through a 4-year freeze in wages and a
quasi-total suspension of new hires. In addition,
intermediate consumption has been cut at both
central and local government levels. Social
transfers are projected to increase only mildly:
while the number of pensioners continues to rise,
the pace of increase is set to continue declining
thanks to the enacted pension reforms.
De-indexation of higher pensions in 2012 and
2013 also contributes to the moderation of social

74

The structural adjustment in 2012 is estimated at
nearly 2¼ pps. of GDP for the overall balance and
around 2¾ pps. for the primary balance.

In 2013-14, the forecast incorporates the
expenditure savings enacted in the summer 2012
and with the 3-year draft budget law (Legge di
Stabilità 2013-15) adopted by the government in
October. These savings are also intended to
finance part of the repeal of the VAT rates'
increase legislated in December 2011. Current
primary expenditure is projected to rise only
marginally in nominal terms in 2013, but to
resume growing at a faster pace in 2014 as the deindexation of higher pensions expires. Capital
spending is set to continue falling in 2013 and then
recover slightly in 2014. Total primary expenditure
in nominal terms is thus expected to decline for the

fourth consecutive year in 2013 and increase
slightly in 2014. By contrast, interest expenditure
is set to continue increasing, although at a slower
pace than in 2012 due to the assumed
normalisation in financial markets and the
levelling-off of the debt-to-GDP ratio.

revenues is projected to decelerate as no further
discretionary increase in taxation is planned. As a
share of GDP, total revenues are expected to peak
in 2013 and decrease somewhat in 2014.
The structural balance is expected to improve
further in 2013 – by around 1 pp. of GDP – and
achieve a budgetary position close to balance.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the
structural balance is anticipated to depart from this
position in 2014. The structural primary surplus is
estimated to rise to above 5% of GDP in 2013 and
broadly stabilise in 2014.

The draft budget contains a number of measures on
the revenue side. In a second move aimed at
lessening the VAT rates' increase that was
legislated in December 2011, the standard and
reduced rates are now set to increase by 1 pp. as
from July 2013. The further temporary increase in
excise duties on fuels that was enacted in the
summer 2012 is made permanent, while a new tax
on financial transactions is introduced. This,
together with the full coming into force of the
increase in property taxation enacted in 2011, is
expected to boost indirect tax revenues in 2013. By
contrast, despite the increase in the tax base,
revenue from direct taxes is set to remain stable.
Tax rates on personal income up to
EUR 28,000 per year are reduced by 1 pp., while
some tax expenditure is cut. Moreover, the tax
incentives on performance-related pay are
prolonged. In 2014, the increase in current tax

Gross government debt is projected to increase
significantly as a share of GDP in 2012 and 2013,
mainly due to the fall in real GDP and the impact
of the financial support to other euro-area
countries. The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to start
decreasing in 2014, as macroeconomic conditions
improve and the primary surplus increases further.
The proceeds expected by the government from
the planned privatisation programme over 2013-15
(1 pp. of GDP per year) are not included in the
forecast, as at the cut-off date the details needed to
estimate its impact had not yet been spelled out.

12. CYPRUS
Deep recession to prevail over the forecast horizon
Rapid deterioration in economic activity

The weakness of economic activity seen in the
second half of 2011 is expected to intensify in
2012, when the Cypriot economy is projected to
contract by 2.3% against the background of
unwinding imbalances and widespread loss of
confidence among economic agents. The fiscal
consolidation effort that has been pursued, the
rapid deterioration in labour market conditions,
and the high degree of economic uncertainty have
together weighed heavily on private consumption.
In addition, the tightening of credit conditions has
aggravated
the
unfavourable
economic
environment while weak confidence has amplified
the drag on investment activity. Adverse
developments in the external environment,
particularly in Greece, and the sustained volatility
in European financial markets have affected
Cyprus predominately via developments in the
financial sector.
The economy is projected to contract by 1.7% in
2013, due to further declines in domestic
consumption, as well as in government and private
investments. Economic activity is expected to
contract further by 0.7% in 2014 with domestic
demand shrinking further and net exports still
marginally supporting growth. Traditionally the
main driver of growth, domestic demand is set to
contract over the forecast horizon driven by
markedly weaker consumer confidence and lower
household disposable income, which stem in turn
from the effects of fiscal consolidation and the
worsening labour market outlook. Investment is
projected to decline in view of the difficulties in
accessing credit and the high level of corporate
indebtedness. In spite of the reconstruction work at
the electricity power plan and the private
investment in a new oil storage facility,
construction activity is expected to continue to
shrink strongly in 2012 and 2013. Although
construction indicators suggest that the correction
should persist in 2014, this is expected to be at a
milder pace reflecting the general level of
economic activity in the economy as a whole.
On the other hand, the external sector is expected
to provide a positive contribution to growth for the
whole forecast period. In particular, imports of
both goods and services are set to decline
considerably against a backdrop of weak domestic

76

demand. Exports are expected to fall moderately in
2012, while the projected economic performance
of Cyprus' major trade partners suggests a gradual
increase in exports of both goods and services in
2013 and 2014. In services, both tourism and
business services continued to perform well in
2012 and this trend is expected to continue in the
coming years. In particular, revenues from tourism
are expected to continue to rise. This reflects a
projected increased flow of arrivals from Russia
and new destinations helped by government
policies promoting tourism, and from tourists'
concern over stability in competing Mediterranean
tourist destinations. Exports of transport services
are expected to shrink, while financial and other
business services will stagnate over the forecast
horizon in view of worsen business confidence.
Overall, the current-account deficit is expected to
narrow gradually over the forecast horizon in spite
of a deterioration of the income balance.

Worsening labour market conditions

Employment is expected to worsen in 2012 and
subsequent years, reflecting the slowdown in
economic activity. Job losses are particularly
prominent in labour-intensive sectors such as
construction and trade. The unemployment rate
would remain on a strong upward trend, rising
from 7.9% in 2011 to 12.1% in 2012, and is likely
continue to increase further in 2013 and to be close
to 14% in 2014. Given the unfavourable labour
market conditions and the effects of fiscal
consolidation, wage growth is expected to be
negative. In particular, the freezing of public sector
wages until 2014 should affect wages in the
economy as a whole.

conditions, and lower productivity. Furthermore,
any worsening of the economic situation in Greece
remains a significant downside risk for Cyprus as
well as any further needs of recapitalisation for the
domestic banks.

HICP inflation is projected to decline to 3.2% in
2012 on the back of weaker domestic demand and
the fading-out of the base effect of the electricity
prices increases in 2011 despite increasing oil and
commodity prices and of VAT standard rate by
2 pps. With domestic demand remaining subdued,
the effect of the VAT increase and the projected
decline of oil and commodity prices, headline
inflation is projected to ease further to 1.5% in
2013 and to 1.3% in 2014.

Fiscal and financing imbalances prevail

The general government deficit is set to narrow to
5.3% of GDP in 2012. Should no further measures
be adopted, the deficit will rise further to 5.7%
GDP in 2013 and to 6% in 2014. The downgrading
of the government sovereign to non-investment
grade raised yield spreads to prohibitive levels,
with the government covering its financing needs
through short-term borrowing from the domestic
market. The government's participation in the
recapitalisation of a commercial bank (which was
unsuccessful in implementing its capital
enhancement plan) is expected to increase the
general government debt significantly from 71.1%
in 2011 to about 90% of GDP in 2012. In view of
shrinking economic activity, the government debtto-GDP ratio is projected to reach 96.7% in 2013
and 102.7% in 2014. The fiscal imbalances are set
to persist despite the significant consolidation
effort pursued in 2012.

Significant downside risks exist

Cyprus requested external financial assistance
from the EFSF/ESM in view of the challenges
facing the economy. Under the no-policy-change
assumption (the draft 2013 Budget not yet
available), significant downside risks are present
for the current account, public finances, and the
financial
sector,
testing
the
economy's
sustainability. Failure to raise the required capital
and to put policies back on a sustainable path
could dramatically worsen the outlook and
reinforce the negative loop of lower liquidity,
higher indebtedness, worsening labour market

13. LATVIA
Growing fast again
Economic performance beats expectations

After acute boom and bust periods, the Latvian
economy is again the fastest growing in the EU. In
the first two quarters of 2012, real GDP surged by
5.5% y-o-y and 4.6% y-o-y in seasonally-adjusted
terms. Recent retail and industrial sales, as well as
confidence surveys, suggest continuous strong
performance on the domestic market, while export
expansion is somewhat weakened by lower
external demand. Full-year growth is therefore
expected to slow to 4.3% in 2012 and 3.6% in
2013, albeit still outpacing all other EU Member
States. Risks are on the upside in 2012, as
indicated by the latest monthly indicators, and
broadly balanced in 2013. In 2014, growth is
projected to accelerate to 3.9% on expectations of
better external demand.

down triggered by external demand but there were
also signs of expanding import substitution.
Inflation slows as expected

In line with the spring forecast, inflation slowed in
the course of the year, due mainly to the
moderation in the price of energy and food
commodities. As of July 2012, the headline index
(HICP) even dropped slightly below initial
expectations as authorities decided to cut the
standard VAT rate to 21% from 22%. The annual
average inflation is now projected at 2.4% in 2012
and 2.1% in 2013. Core inflation is set to move at
similar rates as energy and food commodities are
not seen as inflation drivers over the forecast
horizon. In 2014, HICP is forecast to rebound
slightly to 2.3% over improved growth prospects
in Europe.

On the demand side, investments and private
consumption were the major growth drivers in the
first two quarters of 2012. Investments in fixed
assets rose by annualised 39% and 20.5%
respectively, benefiting from high profits in the
corporate sector and needs of capacity and
technology upgrades after the steep contraction in
2008-09. Private consumption increased by
annualised 5.4% and 7.2% in the first two quarters
paced by lower debt service costs of households,
lower saving propensities, employment and wage
growth, and substantial reduction in net
emigration. On the supply side, construction and
manufacturing were the best performers in the first
half of the year with annualised real growth rates
of 25.2% and 12.3% respectively. Tourism,
information technologies and transportation also
rose at above-average rates. In manufacturing,
exporters retained high growth despite some slow-

Unemployment dropped only marginally, to 16.1%
in the second quarter of 2012 relative to 17.1% a
year earlier, according to Eurostat data for the age
group of 15-74. After a continuous contraction in
previous years, labour supply stabilised in the first
half of 2012 as discouraged persons returned to the
labour market and the flow of net emigration
declined significantly. Employment is expected to
rise by 1.8% in 2012 but its impact on the jobless
rate is partly offset by the increase in the overall
number of job seekers. Taking into account all
these factors, the year-average unemployment is
projected to drop further to 15.2% in 2012, 14.3%
in 2013, and 12.7% in 2014.
Foreign-trade gap widens over strong demand

The foreign-trade deficit continued to expand in
2012 as domestic demand, especially for
investment goods, rose at a high rate. However,
exports grew slightly faster than imports in real
terms in the first half of the year and the speed of
deficit widening slowed. After an upward revision
in the current-account deficit to 2.4% of GDP in
2011, projections point to a relatively modest
expansion in the following years, bringing the
deficit to about 3.5% of GDP in 2014. Non-debt
transfers in the capital account are expected to
fully offset the current-account gap and to keep the
country's net lending position broadly stable.

to be reached in 2016 – will reduce government
revenue by around 0.5% of GDP. In addition,
revenue is negatively affected by the VAT and
personal income tax cuts described above. At the
same time, decisions that restrict social benefits –
notably the continuous suspension of pension
indexation – coupled with a limited and targeted
increase in public wages would ensure some
improvement in the ratio of general government
deficit to GDP. The outlook for 2014 is based on
the no-policy-change assumption, while it reflects
decisions currently in force, notably further
reduction in the personal income tax, as well as the
expected resumption of pension indexation from
late 2014. The risks to the outlook for public
finances include on the upside a possibility of
better tax revenue due to higher tax elasticities, as
the share of undeclared economic activity
diminishes, and on the downside a growing
pressure to increase spending after years of fiscal
consolidation. The structural balance is projected
to deteriorate by ¼ pp. of GDP in both 2013 and
2014. The government debt-to-GDP ratio is set to
rise over the forecast period, as the authorities
accumulate assets for large repayments due in
2014-15.

Public finances reflect the recovery

The
sound
macroeconomic
developments
substantially improve the outlook on public
finances. However, several decisions taken in mid2012 have an impact on the short and mediumterm outlook. Firstly, the VAT rate was cut by 1
pp. from July 2012 and the personal income tax
will be reduced by 1 pp. as of 2013, 2 pps. as of
2014, and 2 pps. as of 2015. Secondly, the
Parliament passed a mid-year 2012 supplementary
budget in September, increasing revenue and
expenditure targets by 1.6% and 1.4% of GDP
respectively, including more effective use of EU
structural funds. As a result, the projected 2012
deficit drops by less than what the revision in the
macroeconomic outlook implies, from 2.1% of
GDP in the spring forecast to 1.7%. The structural
balance nevertheless continues improving in 2012.
The 2013 draft budget adopted by the government
on 25 September aims at a general government
deficit of 1.4% of GDP. The partial restoration of
contributions to the mandatory fully-funded
pension pillar – to 4% of gross wages from the
current reduced rate of 2% against the target of 6%

14. LITHUANIA
Growth continues at a slower pace
Low confidence affects domestic demand

Lithuania's economy remained resilient to adverse
external developments in the first half of 2012,
although persisting uncertainty started to weigh on
the sentiment of economic agents. After strong
economic growth of 5.9% in 2011, domestic
demand has started to lose momentum. Yet it is
expected to remain the principal growth driver
over the forecast horizon.

GDP (y-o-y%)

In the first half of 2012, private consumption grew
by 6% y-o-y, supported by a recovering labour
market and reduced debt-servicing costs. At the
same time, low business confidence acted as a drag
on investment, which slowed to 4.6% y-o-y.
Adverse developments in the external environment
as well as the temporary closure of an important
oil refinery had a negative impact on trade. Real
imports grew by mere 1.4% y-o-y while exports
grew by 4%. These developments led to a
slowdown of real GDP growth to 3% y-o-y.
For the remainder of 2012, high-frequency
indicators suggest sustained output growth, with
domestic demand as the main driver, although at a
slower pace. Even if credit is available in principle,
companies are expected to continue delaying
investment. This can be explained by a persistently
weak external environment and to a lesser extent
by political uncertainties in the wake of October’s
general elections. Lithuania's real GDP is forecast
to grow by 2.9% in 2012, with some upside risks
as underlined by the latest monthly indicators. An
expected stabilisation in the euro area and a slight
pick-up during the second half of 2013 will have a

80

positive impact on trade, improve confidence of
businesses, and give impetus to private investment.
Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1% in 2013,
with broadly balanced risks. Public investment is
assumed to continue growing steadily over the
forecast horizon, supported by EU co-financed
projects. The economy is forecast to grow closer to
its potential in 2014, by 3.6%, reinforced by
accelerating consumption.

Employment continued to grow across all sectors
in the first half of 2012 and the unemployment rate
decreased to 13.3%. However, no significant
improvement is expected in the coming months, as
companies delay hiring on the back of low
business confidence. Employment growth is set to
accelerate towards the end of the forecast horizon
when business sentiment improves as the Eurozone
recovery gains some momentum. However, the
unemployment rate is likely to remain at double
digit levels, thus limiting prospects for nominal
wage growth. Real wages are still declining and
are expected to stabilise only at the end of 2013.
Inflation keeps moderating

Inflation (HICP) started to fall in 2012, reflecting
weaker growth in food and energy prices.
Domestic price pressures remained moderate, on
account of slower domestic demand growth and
limited wage growth. However, several
administered prices increased. In September 2012,
12-month average inflation stood at 3.4%,
decreasing from the annual average of 4.1% in
2011. 12-month average core inflation remained
stable at 2.4%. HICP is expected to inch down
only marginally, to 3.1% in 2013 and 3.0% in
2014. The impact from lower commodity prices is
projected to be counterbalanced by further planned
administered price increases in 2013 and to some
extent inflation pressure coming from the
recovering labour market in 2014.
Current-account deficit after revision

The revised current-account deficit was 3.7% of
GDP in 2011 (instead of 1.6%). The deficit
narrowed to 2.3% in the first half of 2012 mainly
due to an improvement in the trade balance. This is

Member States, Lithuania

expected to reverse progressively throughout the
forecast horizon as domestic demand regains
momentum. Consequently, with relatively stable
positive current transfers and negative income
balance, the current-account deficit is projected to
reach 3.0% of GDP in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014.

rights fell considerably short of expectations.
In the absence of a draft budget for 2013 due to
general elections, the general government deficit
forecast is based on a no-policy-change
assumption and only takes into account measures
already adopted by the government. These are in
particular the public sector wage freeze, and an
increase in excise duties on gasoline and cigarettes
that more than compensate the extension of
reduced VAT rates for transport and media.
Additionally, the deficit of the social insurance
provider SoDra is projected to further decrease on
the back of an improved performance of the labour
market and reduced pension payments due to
gradual increase in retirement age. The general
government deficit is thus forecast to drop to 2.8%
of GDP in 2013.

Fiscal consolidation continues

In 2011, Lithuania's general government deficit
had narrowed to 5.5% of GDP and is forecast to
reach 3.2% in 2012 on the back of a stronger-thanexpected economy and continued fiscal restraint.
While revenues are close to plan, expenditure is
lower than projected. The structural deficit is
estimated to decrease from 4.9% of GDP in 2011
to 2.7% in 2012 and further to 2.1% in 2013-14.
The 2012 budget contains substantial cuts in
expenditure, with spending on goods and services
and social benefits declining. The public sector
wage freeze has been maintained for a third year.
Some temporary measures limiting the growth of
social benefits have been made permanent. Social
security pensions, cut at the beginning of the crisis,
have been brought back to pre-crisis levels.
Non-tax revenues included dividends from
state-owned enterprises whereas sales of carbon

General government debt is set to increase from
38.5% of GDP in 2011 to 41.6% at the end of 2012
and to stabilise slightly above 40% by the end of
the forecast horizon. The debt hike in 2012 can be
explained by a loan to the deposit insurance
company following the bankruptcy of the Snoras
bank and pre-financing for major bond redemption
in early 2013.

15. LUXEMBOURG
Approaching a crossroad
Economy weaknesses at play

After growing by 2.9% y-o-y in 2010, economic
output decelerated to 1.7% in 2011 and the
slowdown continued in the first half of 2012, with
GDP expanding by 0.1% and 0.4% q-o-q in the
first and second quarters, respectively. Although
growth is still more dynamic than in the euro area,
the deceleration could be rather of a structural
nature, for an economy until now almost spared
from the crisis.
The economy is heavily reliant on the financial
service and steel industries at a time when both are
sailing across turbulent waters. While the financial
services sector continues to show a positive
although weakening trend, manufacturing, and in
particular steel production is on a clearly declining
path since the second quarter of 2011. Since then a
number of important iron and steel plants closed
partially. In contrast, the retail and other services
sectors showed some resilience.

growth from the second quarter of 2013 onwards,
resulting in a 0.7% growth in 2013 on average.
Again, the expansion will be exclusively supported
by domestic demand, while contribution of net
exports is expected to become flat, after being a
drag on economic output since 2008. Financial
services should start to benefit from the progress
made to overcome the sovereign-debt crisis, but
over the forecast horizon this sector is not
projected to return to its pre-crisis dynamism. The
limited fiscal consolidation measures contained in
the draft budget are also expected to exert some
downward pressure on growth.
In 2014, GDP is projected to grow by 1.5%, a
faster pace than in 2013 but still far below its precrisis rates. The main contribution to growth will
again come from domestic demand, while the
external balance is also expected to contribute
positively, for the first time since the outbreak of
the worldwide economic and financial crisis.
The main downside risk for this growth scenario
lies in the export performance of financial services,
which would be heavily affected should further
unrest hit financial markets worldwide.
Price pressure set to decline

Growth expectations for 2012 have been lowered
compared to the spring forecast and output is now
expected to slightly increase by 0.4%. During the
first part of the year, weak domestic demand was
counterbalanced by the external sector, with
imports falling at a faster pace than exports. In the
second half of the year GDP is estimated to show a
broadly flat profile in line with the weak
performance of the euro area, Luxembourg's
principal export market. The catalyst for a return
of activity is expected to be external demand, with
net exports progressively diminishing its negative
contribution to growth over 2013. Increasing
confidence should support a gradual return of

82

After peaking at 3.7% in 2011, HICP inflation is
expected to slow down to 2.9% in 2012. It has
been driven upwards by rising prices for oil and
other raw materials. The dampening effect on
inflation exerted by less dynamic oil prices in 2013
and 2014 will partially offset in 2013 by the
planned rises in administered prices. Inflation is
expected to decrease to 1.9% and 1.8% in 2013
and 2014, respectively. The national index (NICP),
which has a lower weight for oil products, is
expected to fall from 3.4% in 2011 to 2.7% in
2012 and to 2.2% in 2013 and 2014.
Job creation to slow down

Job creation in Luxembourg was substantial in
2011 despite a slowdown towards the end of the
year. However, this employment increase of 2.9%
has not been sufficient to bring down the
unemployment rate, which stabilised just above
5% in the first half of 2012. Job creation is
expected to decelerate to around 1.9% in 2012,
moving the unemployment rate to 5.4% on
average. With economic growth only slightly

Member States, Luxembourg

positive over the forecast horizon and the
adjustment of employment still ongoing, slow job
growth will continue throughout 2013 and 2014.
This, together with a still strong increase in active
population, will translate into a higher
unemployment rate of 6.4% in 2014. The
agreement with the social partners signed on
January 2012 to limit the automatic indexation to
2.5% up to 2014 will temper wage growth over the
forecast horizon. On the whole, wages per head are
now expected to increase by 2.2% on average in
2012 and 2013, then to accelerate to 3.2% in 2014.
Public finances hardly improve in the coming
years

The general government deficit came out at 0.3%
of GDP in 2011, which is better than expected.
This is the combination of the accumulation of
pension reserves in the social security subsector
while there is a deficit of 2.8% at the level of the
central government. In the first half of 2012
revenues have been affected by the weak
performance of financial sector activities, which
contribute to around 25% of fiscal revenues. On
the other hand, expenditure on government
consumption is rising autonomously. These two

factors will lead to a steady increase in the general
government deficit to close to 2% in 2012. The
implementation of the fiscal measures announced
by the government in the 2013 draft budget is
expected to curb the evolution of expenditure and
boost revenues. For 2013 the general government
deficit is therefore projected to decline to 1.7% of
GDP. In 2014, as the projected acceleration in
revenues supported by higher growth will not
completely offset the rising trend of government
expenditure, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
increase marginally. The structural balance
estimated to around ¼% of GDP for 2011 is
projected to deteriorate to around 1% of GDP in
2012 and broadly stabilise there over the forecast
horizon.
Public debt fell from 19.2% of GDP in 2010 to
18.3% in 2011. Given the rising central
government deficit the debt-to-GDP ratio of the
general government is expected to steadily
increase from 21.3% in 2012 to 26.9% of GDP in
2014. The increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is
partly due to the contribution of Luxembourg to
the EFSF and ESM disbursements.

16. HUNGARY
Fiscal challenges amidst subdued growth prospects
From recession to a slow recovery…

After a recession in 2012, a weak recovery is
expected for 2013 and 2014. The economy is
characterised by weak potential growth, partly
caused by policy uncertainty and increasingly
distortionary taxes, most notably very high extra
burdens on the financial sector.
While GDP expanded by 1.6% in 2011, the
Hungarian economy entered into recession in the
first half of this year. Negative GDP growth rates
were caused by a large drop in domestic demand.
Investment has declined for the fourth year in a
row to a historically low rate if compared to GDP.
Partly on account of decreased savings, household
consumption remained relatively resilient to
tightened fiscal policy. From the production side,
GDP has been dragged down by exceptionally
weak agricultural output as a result of a drought.
GDP is expected to decline by 1.2% on average in
2012, due to shrinking domestic demand and
slowing export markets. A moderate growth in
exports cushions the contraction in domestic
demand. Exports, which remain the only demand
component to grow on an annual basis, are
projected to expand at around 2%, well below the
2011 rate. In addition to weakening export
markets, this can also be explained by the higher
sensitivity of certain manufacturing sectors to the
global slowdown. The production in a new car
plant with very large capacity is however set to
help keeping exports in a positive territory.
Although the contraction is expected to ease off in
the second half of the year, domestic demand is
projected to fall by 2.6% on a yearly basis. As
most recent indicators suggest, household
consumption is expected to react more to falling
disposable income than in the first half of the year,
and investment is also expected to decline further
as a result of tight lending conditions and
economic uncertainty regarding both domestic and
export markets.
In 2013, a weak recovery is expected to be
primarily driven by improving export markets, but
increasing production in the recently installed car
production facilities might contribute to stronger
export growth. Therefore a rise in market share is
projected. While government consumption will
broadly stagnate, domestic demand is expected to

84

slightly decline on account of a moderate fall in
investments and a steeper one in household
consumption. An improvement in quarterly rates
of private investment is expected to result from
better performance of export markets, but overall
lending conditions are expected to remain
relatively tight. As a result of declining real
income of households, private consumption is
expected to diminish further in the first half of
2013.
Overall GDP growth of around ¼% is projected
for 2013, with an acceleration to around 1¼% in
2014. Growth in 2014 is expected to be more
broadly based than in the year before. A further
improvement in export markets and a strengthened
capacity of newly installed car production facilities
contribute to a pick-up in exports, and domestic
demand is expected to grow to ½%. While looser
lending conditions are expected to support
investment somewhat, increasing employment and
moderating inflation is likely to support
consumption growth.
Risks to growth are on both sides. On the one
hand, tighter than assumed financial conditions can
lead to a weaker-than-projected growth over the
forecast horizon, while more resilient employment
growth can pose an upside risk to consumption and
GDP.
…labour market outcomes are improving
slightly

Labour market conditions are expected to timidly
improve but to remain weak. As a consequence of
government measures targeted at raising
participation, the activity rate is projected to grow
continuously. Despite this rise, unemployment is
set to remain broadly stable as employment is
projected to show an unequal, though continuous,
increase. While in 2012 the key factor behind
employment growth would be increased
participation in public work programmes, the
importance of private sector employment is
expected to increase throughout the whole forecast
period. This is likely to occur mainly in the SME
sector, partly due to targeted government
measures, most notably the Job Protection Act
(JPA). The decrease in GDP and concomitant
increase in employment would result in a rapid
increase in real unit labour costs in 2012.

Member States, Hungary

However, real unit labour costs are expected to fall
by more than 3% in 2013, in line with the
substantial
decrease
of
social
security
contributions (JPA).
Inflation remains high on account of
government measures and increasing food
prices

In 2012, inflation is forecast to remain stubbornly
high. In addition to indirect tax hikes (e.g. excise
duty hikes on tobacco in February, July and
December), this is explained by a pick-up in food
inflation due to unusually dry weather conditions.
New sectoral taxes, further indirect tax hikes as
well as the prolonged effect of agricultural prices
on processed foods are likely to affect also the
inflation figures over the next years. Consequently,
inflation is expected to remain well above the
central bank's target of 3% in 2013, while
gradually abating toward this level in 2014.
Government deficit is expected to rise above
3% of GDP by 2014

The official deficit target for 2012 was revised
from 2.5% of GDP to 2.7% of GDP, but the
forecast shows an outcome of 2.5% of GDP. This
forecast accounts with one-off revenues of 0.9% of
GDP stemming from the extraordinary sector
taxes, the take-over of further private pension
assets and the sale of telecommunication licences.
It also integrates a number of saving measures of
0.4% of GDP announced in October 2012 as well
as the activation of the bulk of contingent
expenditure cuts.
For 2013, a deficit of 2.9% of GDP is projected.
This forecast incorporates, inter alia, higher
expenditure of line ministries contained in the draft
2013 budget compared to the 2012 Convergence
Programme by more than ½% of GDP (which
contribute to putting the expenditure ratio on an
increasing path in this forecast), and the tax cutting
measures included in the JPA with a net budgetary
impact of around ¾% of GDP. It also takes into
account the elements of the fiscal corrective
packages announced by the government in two
steps in October 2012 that are sufficiently detailed.
Among others, they include: an increase of the
financial transaction duty on the financial sector
and the Treasury, as well as the postponement of
the decrease of the extraordinary tax on financial
institutions in place since 2010 and of the
introduction of the new compensation scheme in

the education sector. According to the
Commission, the net effect of these corrective
packages is estimated to be around 1½% of GDP,
also including negative growth effects. These latter
are relatively limited in the short run but will
increase substantially over time.
The difference between the government's new
2013 deficit target and the Commission's deficit
projection reflects several elements. First, the
Commission's
more
conservative
growth
projection results in a lower revenue forecast of
close to ¼% of GDP. Second, additional revenue
from enhanced tax administration is highly
uncertain and only a small part of it (0.1% vs. the
planned ½% of GDP) can be taken into account.
Similarly, lower expenditure in light of a potential
financial assistance programme with the EU and
the IMF (altogether amounting to ½% of GDP
according to the government) cannot be integrated
in this forecast given the considerable uncertainty
in this respect. Third, slippages of ½% of GDP are
anticipated in view of implementation risks related
to selected saving measures, notably in the
pharmaceutical, transport and education sectors.
Finally, a number of expenditure items were not
incorporated in the government's forecast, such as
the compensation of the loss of the central bank
incurred in 2012; these also contribute to the
different fiscal outlook by ¼% of GDP.
The projected deficit is contained by the
assumption that the extraordinary reserve buffer of
1¾% of GDP, which the government has included
in the 2013 budget, will be fully used to offset
expected slippages.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

The deficit is expected to rise to 3½% of GDP in
2014. This mainly reflects the new compensation
scheme in the education sector and the increasing
interest expenditure. Moreover, the forecast also
assumes that an expected loss of close to ½% of
GDP of the central bank in 2013 needs to be
compensated in 2014. These negative effects are
foreseen to be only partly off-set by the positive
impact of the economic recovery and the expected
additional gains from structural reforms.

excluded. In addition, a potential adverse decision
of the European Court of Justice on the
extraordinary tax of the telecom service providers
introduced in 2010, could also result in
considerable one-off expenditure. Finally, next
year's loss of the central bank is highly uncertain
and therefore poses a further risk for the 2014
budget balance.
In 2012, the improvement in the structural balance
of around 2¼% of GDP is forecast to overcompensate the sharp deterioration in 2009 and
2010 so that over the period of 2009 to 2012 a
structural adjustment of ½% of GDP is expected.
Following a further improvement of ½% of GDP
in 2013, the structural deficit is expected to
increase again by around 1% of GDP in 2014.

The baseline scenario is subject to considerable
risks. First, recent legislative changes have
constrained the borrowing capacities of
municipalities; therefore a potentially more
favourable budget balance of the sector can be
expected than in the baseline. Second, increased
government efforts to whiten the economy can
result in higher revenues than assumed. Moreover,
the appropriate substantiation and implementation
of structural reform measures could result in
further savings. On the other hand, the increase of
the yields on the public securities cannot be

The debt-to-GDP ratio is anticipated to improve by
3 pps. in 2012 to below 79%, largely thanks to the
revaluation of the foreign exchange denominated
part of the public debt by a strengthened forint. In
2013 and 2014, it is forecast to gradually decrease
further to around 77%.

17. MALTA
Resilient labour market underpins gradual demand recovery
Economic recovery following the recession lost
momentum

The impressive rebound in 2010, from the
recession in 2009, lost steam in 2011. The
weakening in economic activity was particularly
pronounced at the end of 2011 and the beginning
of 2012 when the economy was reported to have
slipped back into technical recession.
Economic growth rebounded in the second quarter
of 2012 and soft indicators suggest it is still
picking up in the second half of the year. For 2012
as a whole, real GDP is forecast to expand by 1%,
driven entirely by net exports, which benefit from
improved external competitiveness and a
remarkably resilient tourist sector. These
developments are projected to result in a marked
improvement in the current-account balance,
which is forecast to reach a surplus of around 2%
of GDP, after having recorded a deficit for over a
decade. On the downside, domestic demand,
including inventories, appears to be rather weak
and is forecast to be a drag on growth in 2012.

Real GDP growth is projected to pick up in the
outer years of the forecast horizon. While it is
projected to remain slower than the pre-crisis
period, reaching 1.6% in 2013 and 2.1% in 2014, it
will still outpace the euro-area average.
A gradual recovery in domestic demand is
projected to underpin the expansion in economic
activity in 2013-14. Investment is projected to

continue recovering slowly on the back of EUfunded projects, given the approaching end of the
2007-13 programming period, as well as the
construction of the electricity interconnector with
Sicily. Furthermore, domestic banks are expected
to remain well-capitalised and therefore wellpositioned to finance higher credit demand by the
corporate sector. The investment-to-GDP ratio,
however, is expected to remain relatively low
compared to the pre-crisis years.
Household consumption is projected to slowly
recover in 2013-14, mostly on the back of a
resilient labour market and higher disposable
income. Employment is expected to increase over
the forecast horizon, albeit at somewhat more
subdued rates compared to 2010-11. Average
wages are also set to continue growing, partly
boosted by the mandatory wage indexation,
particularly in 2013, and partly reflecting a
composition effect, as new jobs are likely to be
created in high-skilled occupations. Risks to the
projections are broadly balanced and relate to the
ability of the labour market to support a recovery
in consumer confidence, as well as to the
economic performance in the main trading
partners, namely the euro area and South-eastern
Asia.
HICP inflation climbs back above euro-area
average

HICP inflation is projected to average 2.9% in
2012, slightly higher than in 2011. The
acceleration is largely due to the tourist sector
where price growth was more dynamic than
expected.
Thereafter, HICP inflation is forecast to moderate
to 2.2% in 2013-14. Deceleration in 2013 is
projected to reflect more moderate price dynamics
in the services and food sectors. Energy inflation is
forecast to strengthen under the assumption of an
increase in electricity prices. Moderation in energy
and food price dynamics in 2014 is forecast to be
offset by recovering services inflation, thereby
keeping overall HICP constant. HICP inflation in
2012-14 is projected to slightly outpace the
average for the euro area.

In 2011 the general government deficit narrowed
to 2.7% of GDP, from 3.6% in 2010, mainly
driven by higher revenue from the extension of the
2010 scheme for the collection of income tax and
social security contributions' arrears.

In the absence of consolidation measures, as the
budget had not been presented before the cut-off
date, the deficit in 2013 is expected to widen. The
current revenue ratio is projected to decline
slightly, as the increase in tax revenue related to
the pick-up in economic activity only partly
compensates for the disappearance of the one-off
revenue projected for 2012. Primary current
expenditure is forecast to drop by 0.3 pp. of GDP,
reflecting a continuation of the tight recruitment
policy in the public sector as well as lower
dynamics of social transfers from the gradual
impact of the 2006 pension reform. Net capital
expenditure (including the planned additional
equity injection into Air Malta of 0.6% of GDP) is
expected to grow by 0.5 pp. of GDP. In 2014, the
deficit is projected to narrow, also due to a lower
equity injection into Air Malta.

In 2012 the deficit is projected to narrow slightly,
to 2.6% of GDP, while the primary surplus is
projected to increase by 0.2 pp. of GDP. The
forecast includes the impact of the measures
adopted with the 2012 budget and the January
review of spending allocations. As economic
growth in 2012 is driven by net exports, the current
revenue ratio is projected to increase only slightly
compared to 2011 despite, among others, measures
to increase VAT revenue collection. Primary
current expenditure is set to rise by 0.6 pp. of
GDP, on the back of higher social transfers and
subsidies to the national energy company
(Enemalta), while continued hiring restrictions in
the public sector will help contain growth in the
wage bill. Despite dynamic direct investment and
the planned equity injection into Air Malta, the
ratio of capital expenditure to GDP is set to
decline, on account of the proceeds from the
concession fee on the local lottery operator, which

After improving by 1 pp. of GDP in 2011, the
structural deficit is set to stabilise in 2012 and, on
a no-policy-change basis, to improve by ¼ pp. of
GDP in 2013 and by ½ pp. of GDP in 2014. The
main downside risk to this scenario is related to the
possible need for additional subsidies to Enemalta.

18. THE NETHERLANDS
Slowly emerging from the doldrums
Contraction in GDP in 2012

After a short-lived contraction in the second half of
2011, the Dutch economy experienced a recovery
in the first half of 2012, with two quarters of
positive quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2%. This
recovery was mainly driven by net exports and
accumulation of inventories. Exports rebounded
strongly, with quarter-on-quarter growth averaging
more than 2%. Conversely, internal demand
excluding inventories remained weak in the first
half of the year. Consumption expenditure of
households has been decreasing now for six
consecutive quarters in, and has fallen to 2003
levels. Over the year as a whole, it is forecast to
fall by 1.2%. Several factors account for this
protracted decline. Consumer confidence is at very
low levels in the wake of continued uncertainty
about global developments, expectations of future
house price declines and domestic policy plans, in
particular regarding the housing market. Growth in
real disposable income has been subdued, partly
due to consolidation measures, and lower house
price induced capital losses, with a negative
feedback to private consumption.
Investment also continued to decrease in the first
two quarters of the year, following three
consecutive quarters of negative growth in 2011.
This is mainly the result of investment in
construction, notably housing, which is estimated
to post a sharp drop of 8% in 2012. With
households holding back on housing investment
decisions, the stock of unsold homes is rising and
the number of building permits issued is at
historically low levels. Investment in equipment
has been slowing down considerably, in view of
the low capacity utilisation rate (which is below its
long-term average) and weakening economic
prospects. Investment in transport equipment
increased strongly in the second quarter of the year
due to the anticipated rise in taxation of new cars.
In the second half of 2012, economic growth is
expected to slow down again as a result of the
combined effect of continued weakness of internal
demand and the adverse impact of the current
global trade downturn. Overall, real GDP growth
is forecast to turn negative at -0.3% in 2012.

Domestic demand set to remain weak,
entailing a modest recovery in 2013 and 2014

Growth is forecast to recover gradually in 2013 to
0.3%. This is due in particular to supportive trade
developments, since domestic demand is expected
to remain depressed into 2013. Domestic demand
should begin to pick up gradually in the second
half of the year, thus supporting a moderate pickup in 2014, with real GDP increasing by 1.4%.

GDP (y-o-y%)

With almost all determinants of household
consumption proving unsupportive, consumption
expenditure is expected to remain negative at
-0.8% in 2013, while turning slightly positive only
in 2014. Among the main determinants, real
disposable income is likely to stay subdued over
the forecast horizon. Real disposable income is
weighed down by a higher tax burden, including
the increase in VAT rates from 19% to 21% as of 1
October 2012, as well as lower employment and
strong wage moderation in the public sector
(excluding health care). Wage increases in the
private sector should continue to be moderate as
labour market developments are set to remain
subdued over the forecast horizon. In addition,
pension premiums will be increased and secondpillar pension payouts will be cut as of 2013 to
restore the coverage ratios of pension funds, which
are at historically low levels. In addition, a large
number of households, which have purchased a
home since the middle of the early 2000s, have
negative (home) equity and may adjust by
increasing their precautionary savings in a period
of rising unemployment.

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

With consolidation measures also affecting
expenditure, government consumption is forecast
to continue to decrease by -0.5% in 2013, after
-0.1% in 2012.
Following the marked decline in 2012, gross fixed
capital formation is forecast to fall, although less
sharply, by 1% in 2013. Business investment is
expected to remain weak in 2013. Both the private
and the public sectors are expected to continue to
reduce investment in 2013, albeit at a slower pace
than in 2012, with investment in housing
construction falling by 3% in 2013. Only in 2014
is a moderate recovery expected, supported by
better economic conditions and prospects.
Net exports are expected to contribute positively to
economic growth throughout the forecast period.
This is not driven by gains in competitiveness, as
in 2013 and 2014 a loss of exports market share is
foreseen. Instead, this is rather the result of very
sluggish import growth driven by weak internal
demand. The projected rise of the current-account
surplus is thus predominantly the result of
depressed internal demand.
The risks to this macroeconomic scenario are
predominantly on the downside. A steeper fall in
house prices would weigh on private consumption
and investment and additional consolidation
measures in the outer year of the forecast could
negatively impact on domestic demand. On the
other hand, a bottoming-out of house price
developments and clarity on future housing
policies could improve consumer confidence and
increase transactions in the housing market.

Rising unemployment

The labour force is expected to increase by 1.3% in
2012, as losses in family disposable income have
pushed second-income earners to enter the labour
market in the first half of 2012. Over the forecast
horizon, these developments are expected to ease,
although small increases in the labour force are
projected for both 2013 and 2014. Total
employment should decrease by a slight 0.2% in
2012, and decrease further by 0.6% in 2013. The
unemployment rate is foreseen to continue to edge
higher, to 5.4% in 2012 (after 4.4% in 2011), 6.1%
in 2013 and 6.2% in 2014. The expected increase
in unemployment results from a combination of
weak current and expected internal demand with
only a gradual pick-up in economic activity, which
would lead to a reduced recourse to labour
hoarding.
Deficit falling up to 2013

After years of low inflation at around 1%, inflation
– as measured by the HICP index – accelerated to
2.5% in 2011, mainly as a result of increases in
energy and processed food prices. In the first four
months of 2012, inflation stood at around 2.9%,
but has since declined to around 2.5% and is
expected to stand at 2.8% for the year as a whole.

In 2011, the general government deficit fell to
4.5% of GDP, after 5.1% in 2010. It is expected to
improve further to 3.7% of GDP in 2012, in light
of consolidation measures that mainly increase
revenues. Government revenues are expected to
increase mainly because of higher tax rates (2 pps.
increase in the standard VAT in the third quarter of
the year and an increase in the taxation of banks).
Expenditure, in particular that related to long-term
care, is also expected to increase, though at a
slower pace than revenues. On the other hand,
interest expenditure is expected to fall further, due
to historically low interest rates.

Looking forward, the disinflationary effects of
weak domestic demand and decreasing oil prices
are outweighed by the lagged upward pressures
from the increase in the standard VAT tax rate. As
a result, inflation is likely to fall only marginally to
2.4% in 2013 and to ease further to 1.6% in 2014.

Despite weak economic activity, the deficit is
expected to fall to 2.9% of GDP in 2013 in light of
additional consolidation measures, again mainly on
the revenue side, and a strong increase in social
contributions. These projections take into account
the budget for 2013, including the amendments

Inflation driven upwards in 2012, but cooling
down in 2013 and 2014

90

In 2012 and 2013 wages are forecast to increase
almost in line with inflation (supported by the
prolonged wage freeze in parts of the public
sector), but increases in employers' social security
contributions, mainly due to policy measures, will
put upward pressure on labour costs. As a result,
nominal unit labour costs are expected to increase
by 1.3% in 2013, after 2.4% in 2012. Wage
increases in 2014 are expected to be well above
inflation, also due to a catching up of salaries in
the public sector with private sector wage growth.

deficit to 3.2% of GDP. This also reflects the fact
that the caretaker government planned to partly
offset the rise in indirect taxes by a decrease in
direct
taxes
without
defining offsetting
consolidation measures. At the cut-off date of the
forecast, the new government had not been formed
and the plans for 2014 and beyond were therefore
not known.

deficits, bilateral loans to programme countries,
EFSF and ESM disbursements and the modest
economic outlook.

19. AUSTRIA
A gradual return to normality
A short-lived upswing in early 2012

In the first quarter, GDP growth reached 0.5%,
underpinned by net exports on the demand side
and manufacturing on the supply side.
Employment growth remained dynamic. Real
labour incomes of households posted an increase
of 1.2% year on year, after stagnating in 2011 due
to higher inflation. Both consumer and business
sentiment showed signs of recovering.
In the second quarter manufacturing value added
slowed down. While export growth was sustained,
it was largely neutralised by an increase in
imports. GDP grew by only 0.1%. Hiring in
manufacturing ceased, while sentiment indicators
embarked on a downward path. Profits and
investment growth weakened. Despite increases in
real incomes and employment, consumer demand
stalled.

Gradual recovery in 2013

Economic activity is set to remain weak in late
2012 and well into 2013. Sentiment has fallen
below its October 2011 low. This is likely to deter
an upswing in investment and consumption. They
are expected to start strengthening only later in
2013. GDP growth is projected at just 0.8% in
2012 and below 1% in 2013 before regaining
momentum in 2014 as confidence is rebuilt. Net
exports are foreseen to be an important driver of
growth, although their relative weight is likely to
be less in 2014 as an expected pick-up in domestic
demand induces stronger import growth.

92

Private consumption is set to stay sluggish in the
upcoming quarters, since a rapid recovery of
household confidence is unlikely. Employment
growth is slowing and the unemployment rate has
reached 4.5% in August 2012 – 0.7 pp. higher than
a year earlier. Negotiated wages rose by 3.4%
year-on-year in the third quarter of 2012. This
limits the scope for employment gains in 2012.
Manufacturers' orders weakened further in 2012
and capacity utilisation stayed flat. Thus
investment activity is unlikely to pick up
significantly in the near future.
The balance of risks seems neutral to mildly
positive. While downside risks stemming from
weaker foreign demand cannot be discounted,
Austrian exporters could well benefit from
improving import demand in neighbouring
countries. Consumption may surprise on the upside
as the trends in unemployment are associated with
rising labour supply and are not a threat to the
currently employed. Real wage growth is likely to
stay positive. The corporate sector has
accumulated significant savings over the recent
years and should not have financing difficulties,
provided companies keep cost pressures at bay.
Private credit growth has weakened but remained
positive and financing conditions are relatively
favourable.
Headline inflation has declined from 3.9% y-o-y in
November 2011, to 2.8% in September. There was
major disinflation in energy and food prices in the
first half of 2012 as well as a deceleration of core
inflation (HICP excluding energy and unprocessed
food) until September when both core and headline
inflation picked up by 0.5 pp. Inflation is expected
to stay just below 2% in 2013-14, assuming further
disinflation of energy prices and contained
inflationary pressures in line with an only gradual
recovery of demand.
Fiscal consolidation continues, but at a slower
pace

Fiscal consolidation in 2012 will be hampered by
past and new measures for the banking system. On
top of budgeted capital transfers to ÖVAG and KA
Finanz, of 0.6% of GDP in 2012, additional
support is required for Hypo Alpe Adria bank and
to a lesser extent for KA Finanz. Although its

Member States, Austria

impact risks to be higher than expected, part of the
cost (0.2% of GDP) is projected to arise in 2012,
while the remainder (0.7% of GDP) will be borne
in 2013. As a result, the general government deficit
is projected to edge up to 3.2% of GDP. The
combined effect of discretionary measures
approved in March and better-than-expected tax
revenues has helped contain the rise in the deficit.

Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in
2014 and the deficit is projected to decline to 1.9%
of GDP due to an acceleration of economic activity
and the impact of the stability package approved in
2012. Two thirds of the consolidation for 2014
would come from savings on the expenditure side.
After an estimated increase from 74.6% of GDP in
2012 to 75.9% of GDP in 2013, the debt ratio is
projected to decrease to 75.1% in 2014.

For 2013, despite weaker GDP growth, the decline
in the deficit below 3% seems secure. Most of the
consolidation measures for 2013-14 have been
approved already before the 2013 Budget. On the
revenue side, consolidation is mainly based on a
change in real estate taxation (0.1%) and the
closing of loopholes in VAT collection (0.1%). For
2013 the government relies on a tax repatriation
agreement with Switzerland, whose effect may
turn out lower than government projections. On the
expenditure side, the bulk of the consolidation is
expected through reductions in pensions and
unemployment allowances (0.3%) and savings in

freeze for civil servants. Additional spending on
universities (0.1%) will partly offset some of the
expenditure cuts.

Growth slows down as domestic demand falters
Economic activity loses steam

After a continued rebound in 2011 driven by a
revival of international trade, inflows of EU funds
and an improving labour market, economic growth
decelerated to 3.1% y-o-y in the first half of 2012.
Activity was mainly driven by a positive
contribution of external trade and, to a lesser
extent, by weakening domestic demand. In
particular, worsening financing conditions,
stabilising company profits and deteriorating
demand prospects limited the expansion of private
investments. At the same time, public outlays
peaked in the first quarter of 2012 when major
transport infrastructure projects were completed,
resulting in a slowdown in public investment
thereafter. Private consumption remained sluggish,
as labour market prospects worsened and
consumer moods deteriorated, while fiscal
consolidation was a drag on public spending.
Exports remained relatively robust, not least as a
lagged effect of the deprecation of the currency in
2011, while restricted domestic demand limited
growth of imports.
In the second half of 2012, the Polish economy is
expected to continue its slowdown. Weaker
external demand is set to hamper export growth. In
addition, a further deterioration in consumer and
producer confidence is projected to limit private
investment expenditure, employment growth and
private consumption. These developments are
expected to result in real GDP growth slowing to
1.8% y-o-y in the second half of the year, leading
to an annual growth of 2.4% in 2012.
Private demand growth falters as sluggish
external demand prospects and stagnating
labour market take its toll

The fallout from the global slowdown and
deteriorating domestic moods are expected to
shape the prospects of the Polish economy over the
forecast period. The economy is likely to face
external headwinds reflected in sluggish domestic
demand growth in 2013 and a marginal rebound is
anticipated only in 2014. Real GDP is therefore
forecast to increase by 1.8% in 2013 and 2.6% in
2014. In 2013, the contribution of domestic
demand to growth is likely to be seriously
hampered by weaker labour market conditions,
worsening consumer and producers' sentiment and

94

slowing inflows of EU funds. In 2014 private
investment and private consumption are expected
to inch up against the background of a reviving
global environment.
Public investment growth is set to turn negative, as
major infrastructure projects were finalised in the
beginning of 2012 and further public spending is
expected to be curbed due to fiscal consolidation
needs and the end of the EU financial perspective
for 2007-13. Private gross fixed capital formation
is forecast to slow in 2013 after a temporary
rebound in 2011-12. In particular, the corporate
sector is set to delay investments as a result of
uncertain demand prospects and weakened global
sentiment. However, the expected improvement in
external demand in 2014 is likely to revive private
investment as large and medium-sized companies
have sufficient cash at their disposal and credit
supply is set to accelerate.

Sluggish real wage growth and marginally positive
employment growth is not likely to strengthen
disposable income and fuel strong private
consumption growth. Moreover, consumer
confidence, which is expected to wane further,
might result in increased household savings
constraining domestic demand as well. Only
towards the end of the forecast horizon improving
labour market conditions, recovering confidence
and cuts in VAT rates are set to result in an
accelerating private consumption.
The impact of external trade on growth is likely to
be positive, though declining, over the entire
forecast horizon. Decelerating external demand is
set to hamper exports, yet the slump in domestic

Accelerating domestic demand, however, is
expected to stimulate imports, partly outweighing
stronger exports.

external demand and falling confidence are
forecast to freeze employment growth, especially
in construction, in 2013. It is set to rebound
moderately in 2014 on the back of an improving
global outlook, leading to a marginal fall in the
unemployment rate to 10.3% (from 10.5% in
2013) at the end of the forecast horizon.

The current-account deficit improved in 2011 to
4.5% of GDP, following a stronger increase in
exports than imports due to a depreciating
currency. This trend is expected to continue, with
the current-account deficit reaching 3.7% of GDP
in 2014. This is a result of depreciation and
sluggish domestic demand growth limiting trade
deficits and moderate increases in current
transfers, somewhat counterbalanced by the
growth of income transfers linked to increased
holdings of sovereign debt by foreigners.

Inflation bound to decrease

This scenario is subject to broadly balanced risks.
On the upside, a stronger-than-expected
depreciation would further boost exports and
enhance import substitution. On the downside,
more profound deterioration in business and
consumer confidence could adversely affect
private investment and consumption.

HICP inflation, driven up to 3.8% in 2012 by the
depreciation of the zloty, high commodity prices
and the impact of the increases in administered
prices, is set to reverse to 2.6% in 2013, mainly on
account of base effects, moderate growth of
domestic demand and contained wage pressure. It
is expected to moderate further to 2.4% in 2014,
reflecting lower commodity prices, relatively weak
domestic demand and cuts in indirect taxes. After
some acceleration over 2010-11, limited labour
demand is expected to lead to some moderation in
nominal labour unit costs in 2012-13, improving
export prospects. Looking ahead, the modest pickup in the economic activity and gradual
improvement of employment prospects are likely
to fuel moderate wage growth in 2014, affecting
unit labour costs.

Credit growth remains sluggish despite strong
financial position of banks

Fiscal consolidation continues at a slowing
pace

Poland's banking sector has continued to increase
its profitability and capital adequacy in the first
half of 2012. Aggregate capital adequacy ratio for
the financial sector grew to 13.9% at the end of
August 2012 (compared to the 8% regulatory
threshold set for individual banks) and net profits
increased by 2.5% y-o-y over January-August
2012. However, credit growth, especially for
households, remained lethargic as banks reacted to
the tightened supervisory framework and the
relatively high share on non-performing loans in
the consumer credit segment (18.3%) Going
forward, credit regulations and an uncertain
demand outlook might induce banks to remain
cautious in their lending activities, which
ultimately prevent credit supply to support private
consumption and investment.

After the peak at 7.8% of GDP in 2010, the general
government deficit started to decrease in 2011,
when it fell sharply to 5%; it is projected to
continue to fall over the forecast period, albeit at a
slowing pace.

Labour market revival moderates

Despite an expected rise in employment of 0.3% in
2012, the unemployment rate is set to moderately
increase to 10.1%, as labour supply growth
outstrips employment growth. Deteriorating

In 2012 the deficit is expected to decrease to
slightly below 3.4% of GDP due to the 2011
package of structural consolidation measures, as
well as measures included in the 2012 Budget
Law. On the revenue side, these measures include
a change to the pension system consisting of the
retention of part of the pension contribution
previously earmarked to the private schemes in the
first public pillar, a temporary (3 years) increase in
the VAT rate (by 1 pp.) and in excise duty on
tobacco (by 4 pps.), the abolition of some VAT
and excise duty exemptions and a freeze in
Personal Income Tax (PIT) thresholds. Those
reforms were complemented in 2012 by a 2 pps.
increase in disability contribution rate, an
introduction of a tax on copper and silver
extraction and further minor changes in excise
duty regulations. As a result of those measures and

95

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

additional windfall revenues from dividends of
state-owned companies, revenue-to-GDP ratio is
projected to increase from 38.5% in 2011 to 39.4%
in 2012. On the expenditure side, structural
measures which have remained in force from 2011
include: an expenditure rule limiting growth in all
newly enacted and existing discretionary
expenditure items to 1 pp. over the inflation rate, a
further freeze in the wage fund of public sector
employees and some minor cuts in social spending.
These measures have been complemented by a
decrease in complementary direct payments to
farmers in the framework of the Common
Agricultural Policy. Moreover, after the peak in
first quarter of 2012, the government sharply cut
public investment expenditure. Consequently,
public investment spending is forecast to fall in
nominal terms and the overall expenditure-to-GDP
ratio to decrease from 43.5% in 2011 to 42.8% in
2012.

pension contributions retained in the public pillar
will start to decrease in accordance with the
original schedule (from 5.0% to 4.5% of gross
wages). The main structural measures decreasing
expenditure are a further freeze in the wage fund
of public sector employees and the start of a
gradual increase in retirement age. The headline
deficit is expected to fall to 3.0% due to slowing
but positive GDP growth and a further sharp
decrease in public investment.
Given the structural character of most
implemented reforms and a negative but relatively
stable output gap, the structural deficit is set to
follow the path of the headline deficit, falling from
5.0% in 2011 to 1.7% in 2014.
Thanks to the appreciation in the zloty's exchange
rate, the further reduction in the headline deficit
and the government's prudent debt management
strategy, the general government debt is projected
to fall from 56.4% in 2011 to 55.5% in 2012.
Subsequently, it is forecast to slightly increase to
56.1% in 2014. The projected debt figures are,
however, subject to considerable uncertainty due
to high exchange-rate volatility affecting the debt
valuation.

In 2013, the deficit is expected to continue to fall.
On the revenue side, the main deficit-reducing
measures include revenues from CO2 emission
rights auctions, a further increase in excise duty on
tobacco by 5 pps., a continued freeze in PIT
thresholds and other changes in PIT and Corporate
Income Tax (CIT). On the other hand, the share of

Faster-than-expected rebalancing towards net exports
Swift rebalancing of the economy

In the first half of 2012, real GDP fell by 2.8%
y-o-y, in line with the spring forecast. While
domestic demand deducted 7.1 pps. from growth,
net trade added 4.3 pps. due to the buoyancy of
exports which grew by 6.1% despite a worsening
external environment. Following a period of
stabilisation in the first half of this year, economic
sentiment fell markedly across the board in
September, with service-sector confidence hitting a
record low.

investment growth rates as of mid-2013 is
maintained. Negative carry-over effects will also
affect the annual growth of other domestic demand
components. Continued weak domestic demand is
likely to weigh on employment in 2013 and the
unemployment rate is expected to peak at above
16%. Stronger employment gains are expected
only in 2014, when the economy is set to gain
traction due to accelerated export activity. As a
result of ample slack in the economy, price
pressures should remain weak even when the
economy is on a recovery path in 2014.
Graph II.21.1:Portugal - Current-account balance

A strong fall in unit labour costs this year is
expected to boost external price competitiveness
and export market shares, partly compensating for
the deteriorating external environment. Exports are
therefore forecast to rise by about 4½% in this
year, well above what might have been expected
from the strength of external demand. Domestic
demand is expected to shrink further due to the
effects of fiscal consolidation and the continued
weakness of the labour market. Overall, a 3.0%
fall in real GDP is foreseen for this year,
unchanged from the fifth Programme review
projections and slightly below the spring forecast.
Unemployment is set to rise further in the
remainder of the year, reaching an average of
15½% of the labour force in 2012. HICP inflation,
which is strongly affected by increases in indirect
taxes and administrative prices, is expected to
remain on a downward path, and to average 2.9%
in 2012.
Economy to emerge from recession in 2013

The growth outlook for 2013 has worsened since
the spring forecast, with additional budgetary
consolidation weighing on domestic demand and a
further downward revision of external demand
curbing exports. Private consumption is set to
suffer from the projected fall in disposable income
following the increase in personal income tax in
2013, and is now forecast to decline by 1¾% in
2013 (down from -1% in the spring forecast). The
sharp contraction in domestic consumption should
have an adverse impact on gross fixed investment,
which is projected to decline by 4½% in 2013. The
marked downward revision compared to the spring
forecast is mainly due to the negative carry-over of
the large drop of investment in the second quarter
of 2012, although the assumption of positive

The external balance should move into positive
territory already in 2012. However, the adjustment
of the current-account balance will be slower due
to further expected rises in the primary income
deficits linked to the still-very-high level of
foreign indebtedness. The current-account deficit
is projected to reach 1½% of GDP in 2014, down
from 10% in 2010.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to
the downside. Continued tensions in the euro area
and particularly neighbouring Spain have the
potential to spill over to Portugal through the trade,
financial market or confidence channels. There is
also a heightened risk of adverse macro-fiscal
feedback loops, as the composition of the fiscal
adjustment has moved strongly towards the
revenue side.

budget in 2012. Moreover, the fall in per capita
income has led to a shift to lower personal income
tax brackets and tilted consumption towards less
tax-yielding goods. By contrast, expenditure is
developing favourably, particularly on the public
wage bill. Moreover, lower net interest payments,
the reprogramming of EU structural funds and,
possibly, one-off revenues from an airport
concession should partly offset revenue losses.

side, further decreases in the wage bill and
intermediate consumption and a reduction in
expenditure on social transfers. On the revenue
side, the measures include a structural reform of
the personal income tax through a reduction in the
number of tax brackets and the introduction of a
special surcharge, increases in excise duties and
the reduction of tax expenditure. The 2013
consolidation effort is now strongly tilted towards
the revenue side, and downside risks to fiscal
projections may arise from a stronger-thanexpected deterioration of domestic demand that
could reduce the expected yield from the measures.

For the remainder of the year, the government is
taking additional measures to constrain the 2012
deficit to 5.0% of GDP, including the freezing of
some not-yet-initiated investment projects and
frontloading some of the 2013 budget measures.
There are, however, downside risks to the fiscal
projection, namely the classification of the sale of
the airport concession as a deficit-reducing
measure by the statistical authorities and possible
delays in the implementation of the additional
measures.

The 2014 fiscal projections include the authorities'
commitment to adopt expenditure-reducing
measures amounting to 1¾% of GDP. A detailed
plan will be presented during the next Programme
review and this will be fully specified in the 2013
Stability Programme. The budget deficit is
projected to reach 5.0% of GDP in 2012, 4.5% in
2013 and 2.5% in 2014. The adjusted fiscal path
would ensure a steady decline of the debt-to-GDP
ratio over the medium-term after peaking slightly
below 124% of GDP in 2013.

Additional consolidation efforts of about 3% of
GDP will be adopted in 2013 to meet the 4.5% of
GDP deficit target. The draft budget submitted to
parliament includes, inter alia, on the expenditure

Modest recovery ahead
Subdued growth in 2012

GDP growth for 2012 is forecast to be relatively
subdued at about 0.8%, with domestic demand as
its main driver. Harsh winter conditions dragged
down economic activity in the first quarter (0.1%
q-o-q) but growth recovered in the second quarter
(0.5% q-o-q) due to robust investment and private
consumption. However, the severe summer
drought, waning consumer confidence and
renewed difficulties in absorbing EU funds point
to a bleaker outlook. Weak economic activity is
expected to depress import demand, keeping the
current-account deficit broadly stable. Risks to
growth continue to be tilted to the downside in
2012 but become more balanced over the forecast
horizon. The main country-specific downside risks
in 2012 relate to: (i) continuing domestic political
uncertainties that could increase financing costs
and hold back investment; and (ii) a higher-thanexpected impact of the drought on agriculture.
Growth to recover modestly in 2013 and to
accelerate in 2014 as structural reforms pay off

In 2013, GDP growth should recover to 2.2%.
While investment is the main component behind
growth, it is projected to slow down compared to
2012 due to depressed activity in the rest of the EU
and domestic uncertainties. Credit activity is
forecast to improve only modestly as banks
continue to deleverage after a long period of
deteriorating asset quality. Private consumption
growth is expected to accelerate, although it will
be held back by continuing needs for repairing
households' balance sheets and by tight consumer
credit lending standards. In 2013, unlike in 201012, government consumption is expected to deliver
a marginal positive contribution to growth on
account of public sector wage increases. Finally, in
line with the projected modest domestic demand
recovery, the current-account deficit is forecast to
widen slightly, to 4.2% of GDP. For 2014, growth
is expected to accelerate to 2.7% as the effects of
the reforms implemented in labour and product
markets start kicking in.
Inflation boosted by food prices

After temporary downward pressure on headline
inflation in the first half of the year, HICP inflation
increased to 5.4% in September due to rising food

prices and pass-through effects associated with the
leu's exchange-rate depreciation. Inflation is
currently projected to increase in the remainder of
2012 and to exceed the NBR's CPI inflation target
(3% ± 1 pp.) for end-2012. In line with the planned
price deregulation of both retail and wholesale
sectors, energy prices are expected to exert upward
pressure on inflation over the forecast horizon.
Food prices will remain elevated in the first part of
2013 in view of a negative base effect. Given the
weak economy, wage pressures are likely to
remain subdued although public sector wage
increases may partially spill over into private
sector wages. Conversely, a slower-than-expected
recovery in the economy would have
disinflationary effects. Going forward, annual
inflation is currently projected to average 4.9% in
2013 and 3.3% in 2014.
Labour market remains weak

While employment growth turned positive in the
second quarter of 2012, job creation is forecast to
remain subdued in 2012 due to the difficult
economic climate and to recover only modestly
over the forecast period. This would not be enough
to significantly reduce unemployment, which is
projected to remain above 7% throughout the
forecasting period. Real wage growth is expected
to turn positive in 2012. To recover earlier cuts,
public sector nominal wage growth is set to
outpace private sector wage growth in both 2012
and 2013. Private sector average compensation
growth is assumed to be anchored at around 4%
per year, reflecting the modest economic recovery
but also recent labour market reforms allowing for
a better alignment of wage growth with
productivity developments. In 2012, unit labour
costs are expected to accelerate due to lower
output growth, while slowing down over the
forecast horizon on account of stronger economic
growth and prudent wage policies.
2012 deficit below 3% of GDP

The budget deficit is projected to decrease to 2.8%
of GDP in 2012 from 5.5% in 2011 due to
continued fiscal consolidation including through a
continued freeze in pensions, the introduction of a
new social assistance code, cuts in other social
benefits and increases in excises. Since the spring
2012 forecast, the authorities have taken decisions

99

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

related to wages and health contributions for
pensioners, which increase the deficit. However,
they have compensated for this additional increase
through a mix of savings from the National
Programme for Infrastructure Development (PNDI
which consists of a series of infrastructure works
mainly related to water and sewage systems) and a
reduction in the stock of payables by using revenue
from the claw-back tax to pay down bills in the
pharmaceutical sector.

payments directive starting in March.(25) For 2014
the deficit is expected to decrease to 2% of GDP
under a no-policy-change assumption. The
structural deficit is projected to improve
throughout the forecast horizon from close to -2%
of GDP in 2012 to -1.0% of GDP in 2014. After
increasing further to 34.8% of GDP in 2013 from
34.6% in 2012, Romania's public debt is expected
to start to stabilise in 2014 following several years
of rapid growth during the crisis.

Budget deficit to be reduced further in 2013
and 2014 but risks remain

The main risks to the budget over the forecast
horizon relate to: (i) possible financial corrections
linked to the absorption of EU funds or the
financing from the national budget of priority
projects; (ii) a renewed accumulation of arrears,
especially at local government level; and (iii) lack
of progress with restructuring state-owned
enterprises that could result into renewed pressure
on the budget in future years.

The deficit is forecast to decrease to 2.4% of GDP
in 2013 under a no-policy-change assumption (as
no draft budget is yet available), which includes
the full impact of the rise in public sector wages.
The government is also expected to foresee 0.2%
of GDP in funding for the contracts that were
signed under the PNDI programme. It will also
have to ensure the necessary funding in the
healthcare sector that will allow it to comply with
the EU late

(25)

According to the EU late payments directive all new
contracts signed after March 2013 will have to be paid by
the public administration within 60 days in the healthcare
sector and within 30 days in the other sectors. Currently
payment delays in the healthcare sector stand at 210 days.

23. SLOVENIA
Deleveraging needs delay recovery
Economy back in recession

Slovenia has slid back into recession, with strongly
negative growth in mid-2012. This forecast
predicts that the downturn will continue well into
next year, yielding real GDP declines of 2¼% in
2012 and 1½% in 2013 followed by a return to
modest growth of some 1% in 2014. This
protracted weakness of the economy subdues
inflation, wages and credit growth and pushes the
current account further into surplus. However, cost
competitiveness largely remains to be reestablished and the weak economy also hinders
fiscal adjustment and balance sheet repair and
pushes the unemployment rate to 9½% by 2014.
The current downturn is affecting all domestic
demand components. Gross fixed capital formation
has remained strongly negative, particularly in
construction. The inventory cycle has again turned
negative, weighing on growth, and there has been a
significant fall in private consumption, related in
part to lower new car purchases and dented
consumer confidence. These trends have
suppressed imports, more than offsetting the fall in
exports caused by the international environment
and yielding a positive contribution to growth from
net exports.

expected to bring the unemployment rate to around
9¼%. Inflation is expected to fall from 2¾% in
2012 to 2¼%. Falling commodity prices, static
nominal wages and reduced inflationary pressure
from depressed demand will be partially offset by
higher taxes.
Going into 2014, domestic demand is projected to
stabilise, while the pull from net exports continues
to decrease, combining to produce a return to
modest growth. With domestic demand stuck at a
low level, inflation is projected to fall to 1½%.
The banking system remains fragile despite the
second recapitalisation of the largest bank in June.
With funding conditions remaining tight, banks are
reducing their exposure to the over-indebted
corporate sector. This forecast assumes broadly
unchanged credit conditions with the real economy
feeling little additional impact from the peak in
sovereign funding stress in the third quarter of
2012. The forecast stabilisation of gross fixed
capital formation in 2013 is clearly subject to
downside risk in this respect.
Government deficit ratio reduced, but debt still
to exceed 60% of GDP in 2014

The deficit is forecast to decline from 6.4% of
GDP (including one-offs from capital support
operations equal to 1% of GDP) in 2011 to 4.4%
of GDP in 2012 as a result of the 2012
supplementary budget, which cut public sector
wages for the first time and reinforced restraint in
social transfers and intermediate consumption. Net
capital expenditure was cut also compared to the
realised expenditure for 2011. The tax system has
been made more growth friendly with a gradual cut
in the corporate income tax rate and more generous
investment and R&D allowances.

Net exports

The stabilisation in the international environment
from 2013 is expected to trigger stronger growth in
export volumes, but this is not enough to overcome
weak domestic demand. Gross fixed capital
formation remains particularly weak, despite an
assumed acceleration of EU structural funds
absorption. A 1¾% drop in employment is

The deficit for 2012 is forecast to be slightly
higher than the 4.3% of GDP projected in the
spring forecast mainly because of higher
compensation of employees and intermediate
consumption.
The 2013 deficit projection at 3.9% of GDP
incorporates the full-year impacts of the May 2012
consolidation package and the draft two-year
2013-14 budget adopted by the government on 4
October. The parliamentary approval of the budget

101

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

is expected in late November. On the expenditure
side the budget introduces additional cuts in the
wage bill, prolongs the freeze in the indexation of
pensions and incorporates effects of the draft
pension and labour market reforms. Improved
absorption of EU funds at the end of the current
Multiannual Financial Framework underpins a
rebound in net capital expenditure. On the revenue
side, taken together higher indirect tax revenue
from the narrower scope of the reduced VAT rate,
higher environmental charges and new financial
services tax and higher excise duty rates more than
offset the further 1 pp. reduction in the corporate
income tax rate and the increased threshold for the
personal income tax bracket taxed at 41%.

public investment.

In 2014, the deficit is projected at 4.1% of GDP.
Except for a drop in the corporate income tax rate
of 1 pp. to 16%, the draft budget proposes no other
discretionary measures on the revenue side.
Consequently, tax revenues are forecast to move in
line with the tax base. The forecast incorporates
rising interest expenditure, due to larger debt and
higher interest rates, higher social transfers from
growth in the number of pensioners and higher

The deficit and debt projections are subject to risks
from extensive state guarantees, the recent bank
recapitalisations and possible further capital
support operations of loss making state-owned
enterprises. Finally, as the measures in the draft
2013-14 budget were not yet approved by
parliament and subject to negotiations at the cutoff date, they are subject to risk, particularly as
regards the overall composition of the package.

After deteriorating in recent years, the structural
balance is projected to markedly improve in 2012
and 2013 as the output gap widens and the nominal
deficit is reduced. However, in 2014 the increased
headline deficit in combination with forecast real
GDP growth running above potential would cause
the structural balance to deteriorate again.
Gross government debt stood at 47% of GDP in
2011. The debt ratio is projected to increase over
the forecast horizon to some 62% of GDP in 2014,
mainly as a result of persisting primary deficits,
rising interest rates and subdued GDP growth.

Economy still resilient but losing pace in 2013
A supply shock spurs growth in 2012

Following one of the fastest recoveries from the
financial crisis in the euro area, GDP growth is
forecast to decelerate only slightly to 2.6% in
2012. From the supply side, GDP growth will be
almost entirely driven by a positive supply shock
in the automotive industry. With past investment
reaching the production phase, the production of
passenger cars increased by more than 50% in the
first half of 2012, accounting for more than a third
of the increase in total exports. Excluding the
automotive sector, the rest of the economy
stagnated in the first half of the year. The
construction sector, in particular, showed signs of
weakness, with value added and investment both
dropping by more than 10% during the first half of
2012. A strong base effect, tightening credit
standards and persisting uncertainty about the
external environment are exerting a drag on private
investment. In the absence of a major improvement
in the labour market, real household disposable
income is set to continue to fall and – together with
persistently low consumer confidence – to have a
negative effect on private consumption.
Gradual switch in the engine of growth from
exports to domestic demand

External demand has been the main engine of
growth since the economy emerged from the crisis.
Exports growth markedly accelerated in the first
half of 2012, leading to a sizeable increase in
export market shares in spite of weakening global
trade. With production capacity in the car industry
expected to reach full potential by the third quarter
of 2012 and recent high-frequency indicators
pointing to decreasing orders, a temporary
slowdown in export growth is foreseen in 2013,
followed by a subsequent pick-up in 2014 on the
back of more robust growth in external demand.
Under the assumption of a tangible yet moderate
impact of the recently approved consolidation
measures on corporate investment, it is envisaged
that fixed capital formation will progressively
increase its support to growth. This projection
hinges on the implementation of announced
investment in equipment in the automotive
industry in 2013 and an acceleration of drawing
from EU funds to finance large infrastructure
projects in 2014. After four years of stagnation,

consumption is expected to increase moderately in
2013 as households partly draw down savings and
real disposable income improves slowly. The latter
should become the main driver of a more
substantial pick-up in consumption in 2014. As the
upswing in domestic demand is projected to only
partly offset the deceleration in net export growth,
GDP growth is forecast to decelerate to 2% in
2013, also on account of the significant
consolidation effort taking place in this year. A
rebound in GDP growth to 3% is foreseen for 2014
as a result of an upturn in global growth and
renewed consumer and investor confidence
underpinned by the positive cyclical lift.

The labour market remains sluggish

Despite the strength of the post-crisis recovery, the
economy did not grow fast enough to significantly
reduce the unemployment rate, which currently
stands around 14%, some 5 pps. above the precrisis level. Given the expected slowdown in
economic activity in 2013, the labour market is
likely to remain sluggish in that year, with a
moderate pick-up in employment emerging only in
2014. As a result, productivity growth is forecast
to remain positive. Wage pressures should remain
rather muted throughout the forecast horizon
keeping unit labour costs in check.
Inflationary pressures easing in 2013

After rebounding in 2011, HICP inflation is
forecast at 3.7% in 2012 largely driven by a
continuing increase in energy and commodity
prices and by a pick-up in the prices of non-energy
industrial goods after years of stagnation. Barring
higher-than-expected rises in energy and
commodity prices, inflation is set to decelerate to

103

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

close to 2% in 2013, and stabilise thereafter on
account of subdued domestic demand pressures
and the petering-out of strong base effects from
previous shocks.

Based on the 2013-15 draft budget, a major
improvement in public finances is projected for
2013, with the headline deficit reaching 3.2% of
GDP. Revenues are the main driving factor of the
adjustment. In addition to the measures entering
into force in 2012, the government adopted an
increase in the corporate income tax from 19% to
23%, introduced a new 25% tax bracket in the
personal income tax on higher incomes, adjusted
tax regimes for self-employed and atypical work
contracts (i.e. workers 'by agreement'), unified and
increased maximum assessment bases for social
contributions and increased administration fees.
The impact of the revenue package in 2013
amounts to some 1.2% of GDP. The forecast also
incorporates a part of envisaged savings on the
public wage bill and investment. The structural
balance should reach 3¼% of GDP in 2013. Under
the no-policy-change assumption, a slight
improvement is projected for 2014, reflecting
mainly the acceleration of economic activity and a
more tax-rich GDP growth composition. The
public debt ratio is expected to increase by some 5
pps. to 56% of GDP in 2014.

Fiscal consolidation set to resume in 2013

The strong expenditure-based budgetary effort
observed in 2011, which curbed the headline
deficit by almost 3 pps. to 4.9% of GDP, did not
continue in 2012. The deficit is estimated to
remain close to 5% of GDP. Substantial shortfalls
in VAT, excise duties and income tax collection on
the revenue side, coupled with higher-thanbudgeted growth in expenditure on healthcare and
subsidies are partly mitigated by higher collection
of social contributions and lower-than-expected
spending on pensions. In addition, it is estimated
that revenue measures adopted during the summer
of 2012 – including a reduction in the contribution
rate for the fully funded pillar in favour of the
PAYG scheme, a broadening of the base of the
bank levy introduced in January, an additional oneoff bank levy for the last quarter of 2012 and a
special levy for companies operating in a regulated
environment – will also help contain the deficit.

Growth losing pace, but labour market remaining strong
Slow recovery in sight after weak 2012

After a strong first quarter mainly driven by
private consumption, growth turned negative in all
demand components in the second quarter of 2012.
Growth perspectives for the second half of the year
look grim, with slow world growth weighing on
exports and domestic restructuring impacting
investments and production. This is expected to
result in a near standstill, with the Finnish
economy posting growth of just 0.1% for 2012.
During 2013 and 2014 confidence is expected to
gradually return, resulting in a slowly picking up
recovery. Private consumption will experience a
dip in the first quarter of 2013 due to the planned
VAT increase, but will return to, albeit slow,
growth afterwards on the back of stable disposable
income despite slightly rising unemployment
figures. Although the restructuring of exportoriented industries will take time, export growth is
expected to pick up again as imports recover in the
main EU trading partners. For investments and
imports, the rebound starts in the second half of
2013. Financing conditions for investments remain
adequate, since Finnish banks benefit from good
credit ratings and sound liquidity positions.
Risks to the outlook are slightly tilted downwards,
with major challenges stemming from the ongoing
restructuring in certain industries, notably the
electronics
sector,
which
could
impact
employment and export performance more than
projected.
Domestic-demand-driven growth to continue

Household consumption in the first quarter of 2012
was supported by temporary factors, such as the
payment of one-off bonuses in early 2012. Car
sales increased in the first quarter by 34% y-o-y
due to increases in the car registration tax that took
effect in April. This increase in consumption was
offset by a drop of equal size in the second quarter.
The consumption outlook for 2013 is influenced
by the announced 1 pp. VAT increase and by
increases in income taxation. While households
might advance some purchases from 2013 to 2012
and hereby boost consumption in the last quarter of
2012, consumption growth will be affected in 2013
by slow growth in real disposable income and

reaccelerate again in 2014. Real disposable income
growth is affected by the wage agreement for 2012
and 2013, setting moderate wage growth,
combined with an effective income tax increases
stemming from the non-adjustment of wage
brackets. Household savings are expected to
stabilise around 8.2% of disposable income, below
the levels of 2009-10, thanks to the gradual return
of consumer confidence.
Trade balance set to decline slightly

With exports declining in 2012 and thereafter only
marginally improving over the forecast horizon, a
return to a positive trade balance is not in sight.
Imports are expected to decline less than exports in
2012, while picking up again in 2013-14 driven by
moderate private consumption and investments
growth in 2014. As a result, the external balance of
goods and services is set to remain negative and to
continue on a downwards trend from 2012 to 2014,
albeit at a slower pace than in recent years.

Labour market is set to remain relatively strong

The fluctuations in GDP did not substantially
affect the labour market in the first half of 2012,
where employment and unemployment have
remained stable. The effect of sluggish growth on
the labour market is felt more clearly in the second
half of 2012, resulting in an increase in
unemployment. Finnish employers are expected to
reduce the use of temporary layoff support in the
remainder of 2012 and to resort to permanent
payroll cuts. This can be explained by generally
low expectations regarding growth perspectives in
the near future – the same factor that explains the

105

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

drop in investments. Over the forecast period, the
total labour force will remain stable, with a small
ageing-related decline in working age population
offset by an increase in the activity rate.
Unemployment is forecast to increase to 8% in
2013 and to remain around the same level in 2014.

finances. The central government deficit is the
main source of the general government's deficit.
Government revenues increase in 2013 on account
of the 1% VAT increase and the effective increase
in income tax, as tax brackets will not be adjusted
for inflation. The government is benefiting from
exceptionally low interest rates in financing its
borrowing needs. In addition to tax increases,
central government expenditure does not grow in
real terms in 2013 as system of expenditure
ceilings is used.

The collective wage agreement for 2012 and 2013
provides for moderate wage growth. However, the
increase in unit labour costs is not corrected as
wages continue to grow faster than productivity.

Central and local government finances will remain
in deficit over the forecast period and social
security funds will continue to be in surplus. The
general government deficit is expected to worsen
in 2012 compared to 2011 due to slower than
expected growth, but to decrease in 2013 and 2014
on account of adjustment measures undertaken by
the government and accelerating growth. The
structural budget balance follows the same pattern.
Gross debt is forecast to continue to grow and
reach 55% of GDP in 2014.

Prices stabilising in 2013-14

Inflation is set to reach 3% in 2012, incorporating
an upward push from increases in indirect taxes.
Despite the VAT increase of 1 pp. in 2013,
inflation is set to recede to 2.5% in 2013 and 2.2%
in 2014. The collective wage agreement for 2012
and 2013 has only a limited impact on inflation.

26. SWEDEN
Slowdown but no recession
A stronger-than-expected recovery in early
2012

In 2010 and 2011, the Swedish economy enjoyed
very strong growth, with a GDP growth rate of
6.1% in 2010 and 3.9% in 2011. In the last quarter
of 2011, the economy contracted by 1.1% in the
wake of the euro-area sovereign-debt crisis and
global slowdown. However, growth returned in the
first half of 2012 at a surprisingly strong level,
triggered by resilient household consumption,
investment as well as net exports. GDP grew at
around 0.7% q-o-q in the first two quarters.
Growth to stall in the second semester but
good prospects for 2013-14

The second half of 2012 is likely to be
characterised by stagnation. Industrial confidence
has dropped notably since April, reflecting
decreasing new domestic orders and the expected
effect of the strong krona on Swedish exports.
While capital formation was held up by strong
equipment investment in the first half of the year,
currently more cautious companies are likely to cut
back on their investment plans in the coming
months, adding to continuously declining
construction investment. Financing conditions
remain favourable, supported by low domestic
policy rates and wide access to foreign funding for
Swedish banks. During 2013, as uncertainty
subsides and interest rates stay low, investment is
expected to pick up strongly to compensate for
relatively low investment levels in previous years.

and diversified export market, which extends
beyond Europe. Nevertheless, the strengthening of
the currency by 10% against the euro and 3% in
nominal effective terms over the last year is likely
to sap prospects for Swedish exports in the coming
period. Increasingly important exports of services
will likely be less affected by the currency
appreciation than merchandise exports. Overall,
exports are expected to expand only mildly in 2012
and regain dynamics in 2013 and 2014 in the wake
of higher demand mainly from the euro area.
Overall, annual GDP growth is forecast to
decelerate to 1.1% in 2012 before picking up to
1.9% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014.
The labour market has been stable over the last
year, with solid employment growth and the
unemployment rate hovering around 7.5%.
Nevertheless, most recent indicators, such as the
companies' hiring plans, point to weaker
developments in the labour market in the coming
months. Only in the second half of 2013, is
employment
expected
to
resume;
the
unemployment rate will start to decline gradually
to fall below 7% at the end of the forecast horizon.

Households still remain relatively optimistic,
encouraged by a rise on the stock market during
the summer, stable house prices and decreasing
mortgage rates. Real income growth is sustained
by real wages, which continue to grow at a solid
pace of 2-2.5% a year supported by low inflation.
In the coming months, household consumption is
likely to be hampered by the labour market
weakening in reaction to sluggish growth. In 2013
and 2014, households are expected to increase
their consumption gradually in response to an
improving labour market and expansionary fiscal
policy, which is likely to target household income,
in particular in the election year 2014.
Swedish exports have so far been rather resilient to
the euro-area recession, benefiting from a large

HICP inflation is forecast to increase from 1% in
2012 to 2% at the end of the forecast horizon.
Inflation has been very low over the past year
(between 0.5 and 1%), reflecting low capacity
utilisation and the strong krona. It is likely to pick
up once the downward pressure from krona
appreciation has eased and the economic activity
strengthens. Declining commodity prices will
prevent inflation from rising more markedly. Wage
pressures are expected to remain low, as the new
wage bargaining round in early 2013 is likely to

result in similar wage agreements as the round
concluded in 2011-12 (2.4% increase over a year).

lending and house prices. As Swedish households
are rather sensitive to mortgage rates, three
successive repo rate cuts have already resulted in a
slight revival in the housing market. Krona
exchange rate developments represent another risk
both to the GDP and inflation forecast.

Country-specific risks have subsided

The Swedish economy has shown a certain
detachment from economic developments in the
euro area, in particular as far as the trading channel
is concerned. However, risks related to a possible
contagion through the financial channel remain
important. While the Swedish banking sector
appears rather resilient, its heavy reliance on shortterm financing makes it vulnerable to potential
funding halts in case of a larger disruption in the
financial market.

Government finances to remain close to
balance despite fiscal stimulus

The general government balance was in surplus of
0.4% of GDP in 2011. With the slowdown in
economic activity, it is likely to end in balance in
2012. In 2013, it is likely to deteriorate further to a
deficit of about 0.3% of GDP due to fiscal stimulus
as announced in the 2013 draft budget of about
0.5% of GDP, and higher pension payments. The
stimulus partly extends into 2014 when the
government finances are set to return to a surplus
of 0.4% of GDP on account of higher growth. As a
result of the stimulus, the structural balance is
estimated to deteriorate from 0.6 to 0.3% of GDP
between 2012 and in 2013, but it is forecast to
improve to 0.7% of GDP in 2014. Higher growth
and planned privatisation projects should add to a
further decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio
from 37.4 to 34.1% over 2012-14.

As regards the housing market, concerns about a
more pronounced price correction have also
weakened. House prices have been broadly stable
over the last year, despite escalating uncertainties
related to the sovereign-debt crisis, economic
contraction and higher mortgage rates in the
second half of 2011. At present, risks related to the
housing markets are more balanced. While the
sovereign-debt concerns and weak global
economic outlook have a clear discouraging effect,
expansionary monetary policy since late 2011 is
likely to provide an impetus for rising mortgage

27. THE UNITED KINGDOM
Subdued growth amid continuing uncertainty
Growth outturn unexpectedly weak

The UK re-entered a recession, technically
speaking, in the first quarter of 2012 as this was
the second consecutive quarter of negative growth
(-0.3%). This was exacerbated in the second
quarter of this year with a further decline of -0.4%
over the previous three months, driven in large part
by the impact of an extra bank holiday in June to
celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.
It had been foreseen that net exports would play a
stronger role in 2012, given the relatively weak
currency. However, this did not come to fruition.
Exports fell in the first two quarters of 2012, by
-1.6% and -1.1%, respectively. Furthermore,
imports actually increased by 1.4% in the second
quarter and thus were a key factor in pulling down
growth. Investment (GFCF) had picked up in the
first quarter of the year but dropped back
substantially (-2.7%) in the second. Likewise,
consumption had shown signs of recovery in the
preceding quarters but fell in the second quarter by
0.2%.
Outlook for growth remaining subdued

The survey indicators, PMIs for manufacturing,
services and construction, had shown signs of
improvement in August but both manufacturing
and services declined in September to 48.4 and
52.2, respectively, whilst the construction PMI
edged slightly upwards to 49.5 but remained below
the 50 benchmark which is indicative of growth.
The outlook for the remainder of 2012 remains
bleak with negative growth of -0.3% forecast for
the year as a whole. The following year should see
a marginal improvement to growth of 0.9%, as
rising wages and low stable inflation stimulate
consumption somewhat, along with increases in
investment and net trade towards the latter part of
the year. This strengthening trend is forecast to
continue in 2014 with growth expected at 2.0%.
Consumption improving

Consumption growth has been extremely weak,
declining in four of the last six quarters. The main
reason had been low wage growth coupled with
exceptionally high inflation, which peaked in
September 2011. However, owing to recent rises in
employment and declining inflation throughout
2012, consumption may finally give the economy a
much-needed injection in 2013 and 2014, though
initially at a low magnitude.
The household saving rate had been on an upward
trend as households were deleveraging but this is
likely to reverse somewhat as real wages increase,
household balance sheets strengthen and
uncertainty falls. The saving rate is forecast to fall
from 6.1% in 2012 to 5.8% in 2014.
Investment held back by uncertainty and
funding constraints

A rebound is expected in the third quarter of 2012
as a result of temporary factors, namely the
reversal of the effect of the additional holiday in
the previous quarter but also a small boost from
the Olympics. However, the outlook for growth
remains very weak in the short term with the main
risks to the macroeconomic forecast stemming
from weaker-than-expected consumption and
investment, and increased turmoil in the euro area.

Private investment has so far failed to stimulate
growth despite the large corporate surplus.
However, much of this may be in the hands of
extraction companies who do not necessarily
invest specifically in the UK. It appears that the
uncertainty in the economic outlook is holding
back investment decisions with credit constraints,
mainly for SMEs, also curtailing activity.
In fact, the flow of credit has remained tight since
spring as lending to non-financial corporations
continued to retrench and credit growth to

109

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

households remained anaemic. While the latter is
partially motivated by the ongoing deleveraging
process of households, interest rate spreads for
corporate and private sector loans remain elevated
and high bank wholesale funding costs continue to
constrain the supply of credit. Overall, low credit
availability continues to weigh down on growth
prospects, even as the demand for credit remains
weak in some sectors.
The effect of the recently-introduced credit easing
measures is expected to continue to pass through to
the real economy in the coming months and should
contribute towards improving access to finance. In
particular, the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS),
introduced in July 2012, is expected to ease credit
conditions to the private sector by incentivising
banks to increase their lending and may have
contributed to a recent increase in mortgage loans.
Additionally, the quantitative easing programme
will have increased to GBP 375 billion
(approximately 25% of GDP) by November 2012,
when it may be expanded further in face of weak
internal demand prospects. There is also a nonnegligible probability of a cut in the official bank
rate from 0.5% to 0.25% that is currently priced
into the markets until 2014.
Private investment is thus forecast to gather
momentum in 2013 and 2014, by 2.9% and 4.6%
respectively, as credit availability improves and
uncertainty diminishes.

Employment remaining resilient

Employment has been surprisingly robust in recent
quarters despite the fall in economic growth. After
peaking at 8.4% in the final quarter of 2011, the
latest quarterly data showed the unemployment
rate at 8.0% in the second quarter of 2012,
followed by a further slight fall to 7.9% in the
three months to August.
The public sector continues to shed workers, with
employment falling for the eleventh consecutive
quarter by 235,000 to 5.66 million in the second
quarter of 2012. Private sector employment
increased by 471,000 over the quarter and stood at
23.9 million in June 2012. Even after taking into
account the possibility of data revisions, this
phenomenon is hard to explain. Productivity has
fallen sharply given the weak growth experienced
over this period. There is likely to be some degree
of labour hoarding, as wage growth has been very
low over the past year. Also, there has been an
increase in part-time and self-employment, some
of which is likely to be involuntary. However,
neither of these fully explains the productivity
puzzle and, given the subdued growth prospects, it
is unlikely that employment can continue to
remain so buoyant in the upcoming quarters.
Therefore, unemployment is forecast at 7.9% in
2012 and 8.0% in 2013, before falling back in
2014 to 7.8% as growth improves.
Inflation on track to reach 2% target

Net exports negatively affecting growth

Notwithstanding its recent stronger stance, sterling
remains at a relatively low value. However, it is
increasingly unlikely that net trade will give a
positive contribution to growth this year and it will
remain subdued next year. Expectations that net
exports would play a major role in the UK's
economic recovery were disappointed as the
difficulties in the euro area, the UK's largest export
market, constrained exporting possibilities.
Exports to non-EU countries increased by 9.2% in
the 3-months to August compared with the same
period in the previous year but this was from an
extremely low base. The outlook for net exports is
weak in the short term as uncertainty in the UK's
main trading partners remains high. Therefore, net
exports are forecast to contribute negatively (0.7%) to growth in 2012, with marginal positive
contributions of 0.3% and 0.5% in 2013 and 2014
respectively, as the euro area stabilises.

110

After having peaked at 5.2% in September 2011,
inflation continued to ease as expected throughout
2012 on the back of weak internal demand,
negative real earnings growth and lower
contributions from externally generated price
pressures on energy, food and other consumer
items. In September, HICP inflation stood at 2.2%.
Inflation is expected to continue to fall to stabilise
around the Bank of England’s 2% target by the end
of 2013. Inflation performance has recently
benefited from the fact that the energy price rises
in 2011 have dropped out of the annual
comparison since September. The volatility in
agricultural commodity prices is expected to pass
through to final consumers with a lag, with the
benefits of the recent fall in food prices to reach
households in 2013. However, the government
decision to increase university tuition fees, from
October, and fuel duty in January 2013 will
marginally add to inflation, as will the utility price
rises announced by a part of the energy industry.

Member States, The United Kingdom

Overall, the picture for the medium term is of
subdued domestic price pressures due to a
continued weakness in internal demand and
earnings growth, as well as significant labour
market slack. Easing external pressures, including
the effects of a stronger sterling and the limited
ability of producers to pass on increases in input
prices, should also contribute towards keeping
inflation on a downward trend, even as a timid
recovery and the effects of further monetary
stimulus present themselves.

it appears that the government may miss its
national debt target, of having debt fall as a share
of GDP by 2015-16, if no new measures are
introduced in the Autumn Statement on
5 December. The UK government's fiscal mandate
requires that the cyclically-adjusted current budget
be on track to be in balance by the end of a rolling
five-year forecast period. This period currently
ends in 2016-17, outside the forecast horizon.

Consolidation continuing despite headwinds….

The deficit is estimated at 5.8% of GDP for the
financial year (FY) 2012-13, which is reduced by
the inclusion of a one-off Royal Mail pension fund
transfer worth 1.8% of GDP. On a no-policychange basis, the deficit is forecast to increase to
6.9% in 2013-14 before falling back to 5.6% in
2014-15. The structural balance is forecast at
-4.6% in 2014-15. The debt ratio for FY 2012-13
is forecast at 89.1% of GDP and is expected to
increase to 93.0% in 2013-14 and 94.5% in
2014-15.

The UK government has continued its fiscal
consolidation plan without any major changes to
the general thrust of the strategy. Some minor
adjustments had been made by substituting current
for spending for capital spending, while remaining
within the same expenditure envelope. Recent
public finance data has been poorer than the Office
for Budget Responsibility's projections, mainly
due to lower corporation tax receipts rather than
large increases in expenditure, and may overshoot
the borrowing target for this financial year if it
continues on its current trajectory. VAT and workrelated receipts have remained on target, thanks to
the relative strength in the labour market. Overall,

… while debt and deficit figures stay elevated

28. CROATIA
Little growth but some fiscal consolidation
Still no recovery

Following a temporary stabilisation in 2011,
Croatia is currently experiencing its second dip in
economic activity since the onset of the crisis in
2008. Real GDP contracted by 1.7% y-o-y in the
first half of 2012. The monthly data on retail trade,
industrial production, construction activity and
registered unemployment suggest, on balance, that
economic activity has stagnated or softened a little
further in the third quarter in seasonally adjusted
terms. Tourism showed gains compared to an
already good season in the preceding year. On the
other hand, an extreme summer drought is likely to
exert some drag on economic output.
Reflecting the ongoing recession, the labour
market has seen further declines in employment
and a rising jobless rate. Although underlying
inflationary pressures have remained relatively
low, headline inflation rose to 5.0% in September
as a consequence of a higher food prices, a VATrate hike in March, and increases of administered
prices on the back of higher energy costs. The
current-account deficit has remained relatively low
at around 1% of GDP.

Economic headwinds dampen outlook

The Croatian economy continues to face both
cyclical and structural headwinds. Contracting
economic activity in many EU Member States in
2012, not least among some of Croatia's most
important trading partners, is affecting the
domestic economy. International competitiveness
has proved insufficient to prevent a decline in
export market shares in recent years. Weak labour

114

market conditions continue to exert downward
pressure on incomes and spending. The high level
of indebtedness of households and companies and
their need to deleverage are weighing on domestic
demand. Credit conditions remain relatively
unfavourable. Consumer and business confidence
is suffering from the uncertainties originating in
the international environment. There has also been
little progress in lowering deep-seated structural
obstacles to growth.
Looking forward to the next two years, it is
expected that economic activity will receive
support from the investment side. The government
is promoting capital spending by state-owned
enterprises, particularly in the energy and transport
sectors. Even in 2012, such investments are set to
increase by a quarter, which is containing the
decline in overall capital formation in the economy
this year. They are expected to pick up further over
the rest of the forecast horizon. At the same time,
private investments should be stimulated by
Croatia's accession to the EU in mid-2013.
In the second half of 2013 the more cyclical
headwinds from the external side should lessen,
allowing a modest acceleration in real exports.
Export growth is, however, projected to remain
below the growth of export markets, implying a
continued loss of market share. Rising exports, in
combination with growing investments, will result
in increasing employment and incomes and,
ultimately, consumer spending in 2014. On the
other hand, it is expected that general government
will detract slightly from GDP growth in the
context of continued fiscal consolidation. Imports
should accelerate more strongly than exports, not
least because investments have a relatively high
import content in Croatia. This implies that net
exports will subtract from GDP growth already in
2013 after having provided an offset to faltering
domestic demand throughout the recession.
Overall, the upturn of economic activity will
remain very subdued.
A sluggish macroeconomic performance

The forecast projects that real GDP will shrink by
1.9% in the current year. In 2013, the investment
boost will be offset by the drag from continued
declines in consumer and government spending
and rising imports. The net result is projected to be

Acceding Countries, Croatia

Fiscal deficit projected to decline

stagnation (± 0% growth). In 2014, however, the
balance of the various contributions to GDP
growth turns positive, with an annual growth rate
of 1.4%. The risks to this growth forecast are
mainly on the downside in line with the overall
forecast for the EU economy. The general risk
related to international financial markets is
exacerbated by the risk of credit restraint as a
result of bank deleveraging.

Fiscal policy has, to some extent, contained the
negative budgetary consequences of the continuing
recession.
Total
expenditure
of general
government is projected to be slightly lower in
nominal terms in 2012 while the tax measures in
the spring, including the 2-percentage-point
increase in the general VAT rate, and an apparent
improvement of tax compliance are increasing
revenues. Consequently, the fiscal deficit is
projected to shrink from 5.1% of GDP in 2011 to
4.4% in 2012. Although the government has not
yet proposed the state budget for 2013, the forecast
projects the fiscal deficit to narrow gradually by
0.5 pp. over the next two years as the government
reins in expenditure in the framework of Croatia's
Fiscal Responsibility Law. General government
debt is projected to continue its steady increase
since the beginning of the recession to just above
60% of GDP in 2014. This incorporates the reattribution of the debt of the state-owned shipyards
to the government accounts in 2012 in the context
of their privatisation.

Reflecting the GDP growth path, employment will
continue to fall in 2013 before starting to increase
in the following year. Since the labour supply is
declining structurally, the unemployment rate
should already decline marginally next year.
Despite some disinflationary effects from the large
slack in resource utilisation, the annual average
rise in consumer prices is projected to remain
above 3% next year. This is partly due to a high
carry-over effect from 2012, but also based on the
expectation of further increases in administered
prices and some VAT adjustments in connection
with EU accession. In 2014 the inflation rate is
projected to decline to around 2%. The currentaccount deficit is forecast to increase to around 2%
of GDP in 2014 in the wake of rising investment
activity and the return to consumption growth.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
From a moderate recession to an investment driven recovery
Weaker economic activity in first half of 2012

In the first half of the year, economic output was
about 1% lower than a year before, reflecting
lower exports but also a larger share of imports.
Private consumption rose by about 0.7%, while
public consumption dropped by 2%. In contrast,
gross capital formation was 11% higher than a year
before. As a result of high import content of capital
formation, imports rose by 2.7% in real terms,
which together with declining exports resulted in a
negative contribution of net-exports by more than
3 pps. However, this dataset might be subject to
substantial revisions, once more complete
information is available. High-frequency data for
the first eight to nine months of 2012 point to
continued weak growth. However, sustained
capital inflows in the form of worker remittances,
income from cross-border trade, foreign loans but
also higher FDI inflows provide important support
for economic activity.
The trade deficit rose by ¾ pp. of GDP in the first
half of 2012, while worker remittances further
increased to about 10% of the estimated full-year
GDP, which resulted in a lower current-account
deficit at about 2% of GDP, compared to 4% the
year before. Inflows of foreign direct investment
were very weak at the beginning of the year, but
recovered later on, bringing FDI inflows to about
1¾% of GDP, compared to 2¾% the year before.
Foreign-exchange reserves continued to improve
towards the end of 2011, benefitting from higher
inflows of current transfers and FDI.
Inflation picked up in mid-2012, reaching more
than 5% in September and bringing average
inflation for the first nine months to 2.8%, clearly
above the Central Bank's inflation target. The main
factors for the strong increase were agricultural
products, but also housing, textiles and energy.
The labour market experienced a weak first quarter
and a slightly better second quarter, resulting in
largely unchanged unemployment rate in the first
half of 2012, at 31.4%, compared to 31.5% the
year before. Youth unemployment continued to
increase slightly, reaching 54.9% of the age
group's labour force.
Public finances registered a significantly weakerthan-expected revenue performance. In response to

118

underperforming revenues, the authorities revised
the deficit target from 2.5% of GDP for 2012 to
3.5%. The deficit target for 2013 is also 3.5% of
GDP.
External sources support domestic economy

During the forecast period, sustained current
transfers, a largely externally financed fiscal
impulse and FDI inflows are likely to prevent a
sharp recession in an otherwise difficult
international environment. In the second half of
2012, economic activity is expected to return to
positive growth rates, partly benefitting from a
base effect but also due to the positive effects of
recent foreign investments. This could bring
annual growth into positive territory, although still
below 1%. In 2013 and 2014, stronger investment
and private consumption, should help to reach
slightly higher growth rates. The completion of
some export-oriented FDI projects, should allow
market-share gains in 2013 and 2014. This,
together with a somewhat more dynamic
international environment, should allow reaching
GDP growth of slightly below 2% in 2013 and
more than 2% in 2014.
Inflation is expected to decelerate in 2013,
following high price rises in 2012, but – on the
back of stronger growth – to accelerate again in
2014.

The trade deficit is likely to rise. The high import
content of investment will lead to rather strong
import growth, which will more than offset higher
exports, resulting from market share gain as a
result of increased FDI inflows. The surplus in
private current transfers is expected to return from
its current exceptionally high level of nearly 20%
of GDP towards its longer-term average. This will
contribute to a widening of the current-account
deficit, from around 3½% of GDP in 2012 to 5½%
in 2013 and 6½% in 2014.

General government deficit

The debt ratio is expected to increase further,
reflecting subdued nominal GDP growth, slightly
rising debt financing costs and higher primary
deficits. Envisaged additional investment projects,
such as plans to improve the country's transport
infrastructure or to modernise the countries' ageing
energy production facilities, could lead to a further
increase in the debt ratio.

We do not expect the deficit to go below 3%
before 2014, as the authorities remain committed
to meet their recently revised deficit target of 3.5%
in 2012 and 2013. Given the governments'
medium-term strategy of increasing spending for
public investment, the authorities will have to
maintain their policy of containing spending for

30. ICELAND
Recovery on track amid risks and uncertainties
Economic recovery settled in early 2012 ...

Economic recovery has taken hold in Iceland with
real GDP up by 2.6% in 2011, following a drop of
4% a year before. In the first half of 2012, the
economy continued to grow, at 2.4%, based on
robust domestic demand. Net exports continued to
be a drag on growth as import growth outpaced
export growth. High-frequency indicators suggest
a mixed picture. Consumer confidence indicators
rose for sixth months in a row in September and
tourism has performed exceptionally well during
the summer. But payment card turnover suggest
some mild moderation of private consumption in
the third quarter.
… and is likely to continue over the forecast
horizon…

The economic outlook has somewhat improved
compared to the spring forecast. Private
consumption growth is set to accelerate in 2012,
benefiting from high wage growth, an increase in
employment, improved confidence levels as well
as rising asset prices. Household spending
continues to be supported by temporary measures,
such as one-off debt relief, extraordinary mortgage
interest allowances and withdrawals of savings
from voluntary pension schemes, but these effects
are likely to fade out. Therefore, the forecast
projects private consumption growth to moderate
in 2013, before it accelerates again in 2014,
primarily due to wage settlements.

15

...but risks and uncertainties remain elevated

Overall, the forecast projects domestic demand to
remain the main driver of growth, while the
contribution of net exports is set to remain
negative. Average growth over the medium term is
expected to remain at around 2.5-3.0%. Downside
risks would mainly result from remaining balance
sheet vulnerabilities in both the corporate and the
household sectors, as well as the challenging
global outlook. Moreover, the Icelandic economy
is currently shielded by extensive capital controls
and their removal remains a huge challenge going
forward.

Graph II.30.1:Iceland - GDP growth and
contributions

Labour market conditions are improving…

pps.

Iceland has seen a jobless recovery in 2011, but in
early 2012 labour market conditions started to
improve, and the level of total employment rose by
about 1% y-o-y in the first half of the year. The
unemployment rate was recorded at 7.2%, a
significant improvement compared to the rate of
8.2% in the same period of 2011. The forecast
assumes that labour demand will increase as
economic activity remains relatively robust.
Average employment is set to rise by a little more
than 1% p.a. over 2013-14. This will support a
gradual further reduction of the unemployment rate
to around 5.5% - still high for Icelandic standards.

Investment spending has been stronger than
expected in the first half of 2012, but this was
largely due to unusually strong investments in
ships and aircraft. For the year as a whole, total

120

investment growth is expected to moderate, since
investments for some big projects are being
delayed. The forecast assumes, however, that some
long-planned investment projects in the energyintense and maritime sectors will eventually start
to materialise in the second half of 2013.
Investment growth is thus foreseen to accelerate in
2014. However, downside risks are clearly related
to the possibility of more vocal domestic
opposition to FDI and a lower risk appetite by
foreign investors should global uncertainties
persist or aggravate. Total exports are projected to
strengthen due to higher fishing quotas, an
improved outlook for the aluminium sector and a
flourishing tourism sector. At the same time, the
growth in imports remains strong, since production
and consumption rely heavily on imports.

Candidate Countries, Iceland

…but inflationary pressures remain

current account is likely to remain broadly
unchanged, hovering around a zero balance.

In reaction to rising inflation in 2011 and early
2012, monetary policy has been gradually
tightened between August 2011 and June 2012.
Annual inflation has come down from the 2012
peak of 6.5% in April to 4.3% in September.
However, inflation pressures remain elevated due
to robust domestic demand, higher capacity
utilisation and the potential for rising wage
pressures, in particular in the export sectors. Also,
a weaker-than-expected exchange rate is likely to
push import prices up and boost inflation
expectations, which are already high. The forecast
assumes that annual inflation remains considerably
above the Central Bank's inflation target (2.5%)
over the forecast period.

Reducing public debt remains a challenge

The 2012 budget targets a reduction of the general
government deficit to 1.4% of GDP, to be
supported by new consolidation measures of
around 1.7% of GDP with most of the adjustment
on the revenue side (1.2% of GDP). However,
compared to initial plans, some fiscal loosening
materialised on the expenditure side and 2012
spending is projected to exceed budget plans. In
our forecast a continuation of gradual deficit
reduction over 2012-14 is expected. The general
government debt-to-GDP ratio will start to decline
in 2012 and fall below 90% of GDP by end-2014.
The fiscal scenario remains subject to downside
risks. Implementing expenditure restraint has
become more challenging following years of fiscal
adjustment and new expenditure pressures are
mounting, also in view of the general elections in
spring 2013. Risks are also related to contingent
liabilities. More specifically, the government may
need to inject additional capital into the lossmaking housing financing fund.

Trade surpluses slowly eroding

The surplus in goods and services trade has
recently narrowed, due to stronger merchandise
imports. In view of recovery, the forecast projects
this trend to continue, albeit at a slower pace, since
exports are gaining some strength as well. The
current-account deficit is expected to remain in the
range of 7-8% of GDP. A large part of the deficit
accounts for net income from banks in winding up
proceedings. Corrected for these, the "underlying"

Seeking the restoration of the lending channel
Recent developments

In 2011 the economy expanded faster than
expected, by 3.2% in real terms. Growth was
driven by the recovery of exports as well as by the
expansion of private consumption, notwithstanding
an 11% annual contraction in bank lending. On the
production side, value added was driven in 2011
by double digit growth rates in trade, agriculture,
manufacturing and construction.

pps.

The unemployment rate continues to be high,
although very slowly declining below its current
ratio of 20%. Although investments in construction
and tourism will have a positive impact on
employment, this impact will be reduced by a still
substantial share of seasonal jobs. Overall, the
improvement of occupation rates will have a
moderate impact on wages, as public sector
salaries remain subject to fiscal discipline.

presenting encouraging results. However, meagre
employment rates, combined with negative real
growth of wages, are limiting private consumption.
Meanwhile, budget consolidation efforts will
continue withholding government consumption,
further contracting public spending in real terms.
The formation of fixed capital will be financed to a
large extent by foreign investments in a few
mature projects. On the external sector, net exports
contribution is expected to remain negative.

Further deterioration in net exports and industrial
output brought GDP down by -0.9% y-o-y in the
first half of 2012. The negative impact of harsh
winter conditions in the first quarter of 2012
resulted in an annual contraction in GDP in real
terms of -2.4%. The economy avoided entering
into technical recession after recording positive
annual growth of 0.3% in the second quarter,
sustained by two-digit growth of retail sales as
well as the stagnation of imports.
An episode of sluggish growth

Following the weaker-than-expected outlook for
the global economy and the protracted euro-area
sovereign-debt crisis, there will not be any
recovery of credit activity in Montenegro in 2012.
The restoration of the lending channel is expected
to take place in 2013, with a more noticeable effect
on consumption and domestic investment a year
after. Notwithstanding, positive albeit sluggish
GDP growth could still be expected for 2012 as
preliminary results from the tourism industry,
which has a substantial impact on private domestic
demand, are positive. In addition, some sectors like
transport, chemicals or pharmaceutical are also

122

Consumer price inflation accelerated in 2012 and it
is expected to average 4% by year's end. Apart
from oil and food price dynamics, the increase also
reflects several tax rises on alcoholic beverages,
electricity, as well as on coffee, tobacco and
carbonated drinks. Once the base effect of these
one-off tax increases fades out, the gradual
recovery of domestic demand should not exert
strong inflationary pressures and consumer price
inflation may come under 3% in the second half of
2013. The expected moderation in international
energy prices in the mid-term should also support
price stability.
The current-account deficit recorded some
deterioration in the first half of 2012 driven by the
widening trade deficit. Exports of goods will
stagnate in 2013 and 2014, as the major metal
exporter halved production in mid-2012 and its
future remains quite uncertain. The contraction of
merchandise exports will be partially balanced by
the better performance of services, and tourism in
particular, as well as some contributions from steel
and electricity. Yet, the slow but gradual
acceleration of domestic demand, and in particular
of investment (FDI), may also result in higher
imports flows, leading to an overall negative
contribution of net exports.
Two major risks remain. One is related to
international financial markets and access to

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

external financing, not only for domestic banks
and the sustainability of the external accounts, but
also for financing the general government deficits.
The second risk concerns the future of the highly
indebted aluminium plant, which could threaten
the stability of public finances given the exposure
of the government through state guarantees and
partial ownership.

taking place on both current and capital spending.
Public spending levels are set to remain flat in
nominal terms, although some recovery in fiscal
revenues could be expected in 2013, notably on the
second half, as the real sector regains some access
to bank credit. However, after several years of
budget restrictions, capital spending could record
some positive growth in 2014. Overall, the
contribution of public consumption is expected to
remain negative in real terms in 2013 and
marginally positive in 2014.

Overall, growth will decelerate faster than
expected in 2012 before rebounding in 2013 when
bank lending may start supporting private
consumption and investment.

In the third quarter of 2012 the public debt reached
50% of GDP. The external debt is predominant,
accounting for three quarters of total indebtedness.
Public debt should further increase to some 52% of
GDP by end of 2012, driven by general
government financing needs and one state
guarantee disbursement. Public debt is foreseen to
rise further in 2013 as persistent budgetary
financing needs are covered by loans extended by
international financial institutions. The recovery in
primary surpluses will partially reduce financing
needs in 2014, gradually stabilising public debt,
but on condition that further contingent liabilities
do not materialise or very large capital investments
are not financed through public debt.

The lengthy redressing of public finances

After recording a consolidated cash deficit of 3.7%
of GDP in the first half of 2012, the budget
execution presented positive balances in July and
August bringing the cumulated cash deficit down
to 2.5% of GDP in the first eight months of 2012.
Several revenue items still continued to
underperform, although, these are being offset by
the improved collection in corporate as well as
personal income taxes and social security
contributions. While total revenues are coming in
line with the plan, further consolidation is still

Recession followed by a sluggish recovery
Back in recession...

Economic activity deteriorated sharply in early
2012, with negative growth rates of -2.5% y-o-y in
the first and -0.8% y-o-y in the second quarter.
Both domestic demand and net exports contributed
negatively to growth. In line with the steep
economic decline, labour market indicators
reached ten-year lows, depressing private
consumption. The significant increase in
government expenditure in the first half of the
year, linked to the May elections, temporarily
boosted public consumption. It also supported
relatively buoyant growth in imports, while
exports were strongly hit by severe weather
conditions in the winter.
The forecast projects a significant drop in output
by 1.6% in 2012, mainly as a continuation of
supressed private consumption and a negative
contribution from external trade. Household
consumption, in particular, is expected to remain
weak this year. Strong increases in real wages in
the first half of 2012 are expected to decelerate
rapidly by the end of the year, and, coupled with
shrinking employment and lower remittances
inflows, are projected to result in a real drop in
private consumption. Increased indirect taxation
(mostly due to a VAT hike from 18 to 20%) in the
last quarter is expected to weigh heavily on
consumption, with its full impact felt in 2013.
Public consumption growth is forecast to stay
positive in 2012 as government expenditure
growth is set to be tamed only as of next year. In
an overall uncertain environment and with falling
FDIs, investment is expected to be sluggish and to
have minor impact on growth. Net imports are
likely to be affected negatively by a severe
summer drought, which impacted heavily
important crops. However, exports are expected to
be boosted in the last quarter of the year by the
opening of a large-scale automotive factory,
underpinning also a significant export expansion in
2013.
...followed by sluggish growth

Domestic demand is expected to further fall in
2013, mainly as a result of fiscal consolidation
measures. However, strong increases in net exports
and base effects are set to lead to a limited
economic recovery of 1.5%. Higher inflation and

124

taxation are expected to undermine household
income and, together with further reduction in
employment, are projected to bring another drop in
private consumption. Public consumption is
forecasted to turn negative as well, following
increased fiscal pressures. Private investments are
expected to start recovering but only slowly, as
capital inflows remain subdued and companies
continue to face liquidity problems. The
contribution from domestic demand is projected to
become positive only in 2014. However, real GDP
growth is likely to be constrained to 2.0%, as
public consumption continues to pull it down and
net imports’ contribution to growth turns negative
again as a result of a recovery in imports and the
expiration of base effects on the export side.

Employment is set to continue falling in 2012 and
2013, albeit more moderately than in previous
years, before turning around in the last year of the
forecast. Unemployment is expected to peak in
2013 and to remain high in 2014 as well. The lack
of vigorous job creation is likely to persist as one
of the key policy concerns.
Unfinished external adjustment...

The overall uncertainty in the pre-election period,
the unchecked fiscal expansion and deteriorating
external imbalances led to a depreciation of the
dinar, which has lost about 10% of its value
against the euro since the beginning of 2012. The
external adjustment is far from finished, with
current-account deficits forecasted to remain at
double-digit levels.

Candidate Countries, Serbia

In view of the severe drought, insufficient
competition, potential further weakening of the
dinar, increased indirect taxation, and the need to
adjust upwards administered prices, short-term
inflation pressures are likely to be acute,
countering disinflationary effects from the weak
domestic demand. Over the forecast period,
inflation is expected to remain volatile, most of the
time outside the Central Bank target band.

to a pre-election surge in expenditure. In
September, the Parliament adopted a rebalancing
of the 2012 budget, targeting a consolidated deficit
of 6.7% of GDP. The measures are mainly on the
revenue side, as a number of - mostly indirect taxes have been increased. On the expenditure
side, the major short-term savings are to come
from lower indexations of public sector wages and
pensions. However, in 2012 these savings are
projected to be more than offset by an increase in
other discretionary expenditure.

forecast

In view of the low economic growth and difficult
labour market situation, fiscal adjustment is
foreseen to be challenging. As a result of the
consolidation measures taken in late September
2012, the budget deficit is expected to come down
significantly to 4.2% of GDP in 2013 and to fall
again, at a slower pace, in 2014. Still, budget
deficits are projected to remain high, above the
levels targeted in the draft medium-term fiscal
strategy and the draft 2013 budget, and
government debt is set to continue increasing
above 60% of GDP. Therefore, additional
consolidation measures may be needed to further
reduce deficits and comply with the fiscal
responsibility legislation.

Growth slows down significantly

The annual rate of real GDP growth slowed
steadily from 11.9% in the first quarter of 2011 to
3.1% in the first half of 2012. GDP growth is

Private consumption

Gov. consumption

Investment

Private consumption growth is expected to slow
sharply in 2012, owing to a strong base effect from
the 2011 spending surge, slower employment
growth, decelerating credit growth and the impact
of a weaker lira on demand for imported consumer
goods. Under the assumptions that the exchange
rate of the lira stabilises, monetary policy is not
tightened more rapidly than currently priced in by
financial markets and consumer confidence stops
falling, private consumption growth should pick up
from 0.4% in 2012 to 2.0% to 2013 and 3.5% in
2014.
Public consumption growth is expected to slow
down moderately, from 4.5% in 2011 to 3.7% in
2012, before it picks up to 5.3% in 2013 and 6.6%
in the election year 2014. The government is
expected to hold down the deficit via higher
revenue rather than constraining spending.
After rebounding in 2010-11, gross fixed
investment growth is forecast to slow down in
2012 due to base effects and lower external and
domestic demand growth, but it should pick up
again in 2013-14 as business sentiment improves
and economic conditions stabilise.
The weakness of import demand and the strength
of export growth in the first half of 2012 suggest

126

that the economy may be rebalancing faster than
previously projected. Exports growth (goods and
services) is foreseen to outpace import growth in
2012 and 2013, resulting in a positive contribution
to GDP growth from net exports, compared with
negative contributions in 2010-11. In 2014,
imports are forecast to increase broadly in line
with domestic demand, and as a result, the
contribution of net exports to growth would turn
negative again.
Fiscal policy remains relatively tight

The government is expected to keep fiscal policy
relatively tight, out of concern about the growing
current-account deficit, a wish to maintain a low
level of public debt and a preference for private
sector-led growth. Nevertheless, weakening
economic activity will increase the government's
desire to maintain some flexibility in its
management of the public accounts, in particular in
2013 and 2014, in view of the elections, so as to
support growth in output and jobs, in so far as it is
able to do so without damaging investor
confidence.

General government deficit (lhs)

In view of the weaker economic activity and the
diminishing impact of temporary revenue streams

government is expected to edge up from 2.4% of
GDP in 2012 to 3-4% of GDP in 2013-14, election
years. The government debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to decline from around 40% of GDP at

forecast to fall from 6.7% in 2011 to 2.3% in 2012
and between 1% and 2% in 2013-14. The fall in
the unemployment rate is expected to continue but
its pace is declining. The unemployment rate is
projected to fall from 8.8% in 2011 (EU definition)
to 7.5% in 2012, and about 6-7% in 2013-2014.

Inflation trickles down

On the back of positive base effects in the final
months of 2012, inflation is forecast to slow from
8.9% at the end of 2011 to 8% by late 2012 and
5.8% in 2014, compared with a Central Bank
target of 5% ±2 pps. for both years. In the course
of 2013 inflation is expected rise temporarily due
to recent hikes in administrative prices and taxes,
before easing in 2014.

External imbalances narrowing

The rapid increase in Turkey's current-account
deficit in 2010-11 has raised serious concerns
about its sustainability. Driven by a credit-fuelled
rise in import demand and higher oil prices, it
reached 10% of GDP in 2011. It is expected to
remain relatively large but should ease for most of
2012-14 to levels around 7% of GDP, primarily
owing to slower domestic demand growth. Weak
GDP growth in the EU, Turkey's largest export
market, is expected to continue to curb growth in
external demand for Turkish goods and services.

Job creation slows down

In tandem with the growth slowdown, job creation
is likely to be weaker. Total employment growth is

Subdued growth amid looming fiscal uncertainties
Growth stuck in low gear

Following a robust performance in late 2011 (1.0%
q-o-q in the last quarter), the US economy
decelerated in the first half of 2012 – as a
disappointing first quarter (0.5%, q-o-q) was
followed by an even weaker second quarter (0.3%)
and activity indicators for the third suggest only a
minor up-tick in growth dynamics. While some
improvements can be discerned in certain sectors,
the economy continues to be held back by a
number of external and domestic factors.
Uncertainty remains a key issue for businesses and
households – especially in light of the upcoming
elections – as no political agreement on the
pending "fiscal cliff" of scheduled tax increases
and spending cuts (short-term) or a fully-fledged
fiscal consolidation strategy (medium and longterm) is yet in sight.

2010. Following readings of just above 8% in the
first eight months of the year, the unemployment
rate dropped to 7.8% in September, the lowest
since January 2009. Improvements were also
registered in the share of the long-term
unemployment which dropped to 40.0% in August
(40.1% in September), a near-three-year low, and
the employment rate which edged up to 58.7% in
September, the highest since May 2010. However,
the activity rate of the population (the share of the
labour force in total population) declined to a
three-decade low of 63.5% in August and was little
changed in September – signalling a structural
dimension to the current labour market weakness.
The housing market appears to be on a path of
steady improvement, with home prices (CaseShiller 20-city Index) rising continuously for the
six straight months to July and showing positive
year-on-year dynamics in June and July (+1.2) for
the first time since September 2010. Both
construction activity and home sales continue to
rise robustly, albeit from very depressed levels.
While recent improvements are unquestionable,
activity and sales are still a fraction of their precrisis levels and the sector's contribution to GDP
(positive for five quarters now) remained well
below 0.1 pp. on average in the first and second
quarter.

Tentative job creation, ambiguous sentiment
and improving housing market

Looming policy uncertainty seems to weigh
heavily on spending and investment. Private
consumption slowed to 0.4% q-o-q in the second
quarter (from 0.6% in the first) and is likely to
remain soft until the end of the year given weak
income growth and changeable labour market
developments. Non-farm job creation has been
rather volatile in 2012. After posting a very strong
first quarter (225,700 monthly average) it slowed
to 66,700 in the second quarter to pick up again to
145,700 in the next, aided by the strongest
quarterly government employment growth since

130

Consumer confidence rebounded in late summer
(after bottoming out in July/August), on improving
labour and housing market conditions along with a
stock market rally that lifted most indices near
their pre-crisis highs in October. Reflecting these
improvements,
the
Reuter's/University
of
Michigan Sentiment Index has been rising since
August - driven largely by expectations - to reach
the five-year high of 83.1 in October.
On the other hand, sentiment among businesses
remains subdued following the deep plunge it took
over late spring/early summer on growing
domestic fiscal uncertainty and euro-area concerns.
The ISM Manufacturing index stayed below 50
from June to August signalling contraction – for
the first time since mid-2009 to rebound to 51.5 in
September on better new orders and employment
outlook. The non-manufacturing ISM Index, on the
other hand, rebounded from the 30-month low of
52.1 registered in June and showed gains in the

Other non-EU Countries, The United States of America

three months that followed to reach 55.1 in
September.
Reflecting the uncertain outlook, business
investment has weakened considerably over the
past four quarters, as firms, in particular from
sectors more dependent on government orders, put
their investment plans (and capital goods orders)
on hold until the fiscal uncertainty dissipates.
Private non-residential capital formation slowed to
0.9% q-o-q in the second quarter, compared to
4.4% in the third quarter of 2011 and the weakest
since the first quarter of 2011. Core capital goods
orders (non-defence, excl. aircraft) confirm the
slowdown going forward with the three-month
growth momentum weakening to a three-year low
of -5.1% in August.
Fiscal drag and monetary push

Fiscal policy remains contractionary. The second
quarter of 2012 was the eighth consecutive quarter
to post contraction in government consumption
and investment. At the federal level, tighter fiscal
policies are confirmed by the final budget data for
the fiscal year 2012 (ending in September), which
showed a considerable narrowing of the fiscal
deficit (-7.0% of GDP vs. -8.7% in 2011) – a result
of both higher revenues and somewhat lower
spending. By contrast, faced with the sub-par
recovery and weak job creation, the Fed decided to
loosen monetary policy further and launched the
third round of quantitative easing (QE3) on 13
September. Under this programme, the Fed will
buy USD 40 bn in agency mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) per month until the labour market
outlook improves "substantially"; continue the socalled Operation Twist (26); and extend its forward
guidance on monetary policy by six months
committing to the "exceptionally low" federal
funds rate (0% to ¼%) until at least mid-2015.
Fiscal challenges cloud the outlook

Despite the weak first half of the year, an outsize
carry-over effect from the robust fourth quarter of
2011 growth means that real GDP for 2012 as a
whole is nevertheless expected to expand
moderately at 2.1% (up from 2.0% projected in the
spring forecast). The estimate for 2013 is also
revised up slightly from 2.1% to 2.3% and growth
in 2014 is projected to strengthen to 2.6%.

Fiscal policies remain the primary source of
uncertainty over the forecast horizon. In the short
run the upcoming "fiscal cliff" of tax increases and
spending cuts (worth 4.5-5.0% of GDP) scheduled
to kick in on January 1, 2013, interacts with the
expiration of the debt ceiling in early 2013 and a
looming government shut-down after March 2013.
The primary assumption underlying this forecast is
that policymakers will manage to avert both the
"fiscal cliff" and the government shut-down as
well as raise the debt ceiling – regardless of the
outcome of November elections. However, due to
the time constraint and inherent ideological
differences between the two political camps, the
related agreement is likely to be a series of
temporary fixes and extensions rather than the
"grand bargain" paving the way to a fully-fledged
medium-term consolidation plan. Based on past
efforts and experiences, committing to such a plan
is likely to take more time and partisan bargaining
to come up with a mutually acceptable mix of
reforms to entitlement spending, spending cuts in
other areas (e.g. defence) and a major overhaul of
the current tax code including, inevitably, revenue
increases.

At this juncture, it is assumed that last-minute
temporary solutions put together by policymakers
around the turn of the year will reduce the 2013
fiscal tightening to about one-quarter of the
4.5-5.0% of GDP scheduled to occur in 2013 under
current law. This implies a fiscal consolidation of
about 1.2% of GDP (slightly down from the SF)
that will come predominantly from partial
expiration of scheduled tax cuts and lower thanscheduled spending reductions.

consolidation and a positive effect of QE3. While
the impact of the latter is not expected to be either
quick or large, additional easing may help boost
market and business sentiment as well as firm
recent improvements in the housing sector. To this
end, the Fed's actions are likely to further lower
mortgage rates, spur home buying and thus provide
an additional boost to property prices. This may set
off a virtuous circle of higher spending –
associated with home-buying but also through the
wealth effect as households' net worth increases.

the US outlook will remain unaddressed.
Risks still tilted to the downside

Risks to the outlook continue to be tilted to the
downside. Domestically they are linked to the risk
of excessive consolidation in the short run ("fiscal
cliff") which – if not averted in time – could throw
the US economy into recession (27) and derail the
fragile global recovery. Domestic and global
confidence may again suffer if a damaging
political stand-off over fiscal policies is repeated,
for example during the next debt ceiling debate or
negotiations on the extension of tax cuts and the
automatic spending cuts ("sequester") in early
2013. Any negative signals from the political scene
related to these debates may also further weaken
financial markets' confidence in the feasibility of
the necessary medium-term fiscal consolidation.

For 2014, GDP growth is expected to accelerate to
2.6% – in line with the overall improvement in
global activity and trade and the consolidation of
positive developments in the domestic market
(housing, labour market). Regarding fiscal
policies, the baseline scenario is similar to that for
2013 and involves partial agreements on selected
policies rather than addressing the fiscal
sustainability with a coherent and fully fledged
consolidation programme. Therefore, only gradual
improvements in the fiscal position of the US are
expected within the forecast horizon (by 1.2% and
1.1% of GDP in 2013 and 2014, respectively).
This will not be enough to reverse the increasing
trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio and hence the
principal medium and long-term concern dimming

(27)

Forecasts of the GDP contraction depend on the estimate of
the associated fiscal restraint and related fiscal multipliers
and range from -0.5% (CBO) to roughly -2% (investment
banks) in calendar year 2013.

Recovery stalling after the solid first half of 2012
Short-lived
outlook

growth

followed

by

uncertain

After contracting in the first half of 2011 after the
effects of the March 2011 triple disaster, Japanese
GDP grew for four consecutive quarters, bringing
y-o-y growth in the second quarter of 2012 to
3.2%. However, the recovery is likely to be
interrupted in the second half of 2012 due to a
deteriorating global outlook.
Until mid-2012, growth had been driven by private
consumption, which was up by 3.7% y-o-y in the
first quarter of 2012 and by 3.5% y-o-y in the
second quarter of 2012. The spurt in consumption
was made possible by pent-up demand, the
temporary the re-introduction of purchase
incentives for eco-cars and a number of product
innovations in consumer electronics. All these
elements have subsequently dissipated. In addition,
recent
wage
developments
have
been
disappointing. For the rest of the year a decline in
private consumption is therefore to be expected.
Public investment has been the second pillar of the
strong growth in the first half of 2012.
Reconstruction efforts intensified at the beginning
of 2012 and public investment grew by 3.6% q-o-q
in the first and by 1.8% q-o-q in the second quarter
of 2012. It is projected to slow down in the second
half of 2012 because of delays in approval of the
deficit-financing bills in the upper house.
Government consumption grew strongly (1.1%
q-o-q) in the first quarter of 2012 and edged up
(0.2% q-o-q) in the second quarter. Looking ahead,
some payback and the effects of expenditure
restraint are likely to cause a slight decline in
government consumption in the second half of
2012.
Private non-residential investments have not yet
recovered from their steep declines in 2008 and
2009 and are more than 15% below their peak.
They increased by 5.5% q-o-q in the final quarter
of 2011. After a decline (-1.6% q-o-q) in the first
quarter of 2012 non-residential investment
increased again (1.4% q-o-q) in the second quarter.
For the second half of 2012 private non-residential
investment is expected to decline. Several factors
are holding back a recovery. First, the strong yen
hampers exports and profit prospects of export

oriented companies. Second, the slowdown in
China and other Asian markets and the weaker
prospects of exports to Europe hold back
investments. Third, financing conditions are easy
and credit available, while real interest rates are
too high in an environment where profit prospects
are subdued. Fourth, deflation has not been
overcome and domestic growth prospects remain
subdued.
Net exports made a strong negative growth
contribution (-0.9 pp.) in 2011. They did not
contribute to growth in the first half of 2012 and
are expected to give a slight negative contribution
to growth in the second half of 2012. The main
reason for this development is higher energy
imports. The strong yen and lately the slowdown
in large parts of Asia as well as the escalation of
tensions with China and to a lesser extent with
Korea are also likely to negatively affect exports.
Outlook for 2013 and beyond

Given the expected growth profile in 2012, the
carry-over for 2013 will be negative. As a result
growth for the calendar year is likely to be weak
although the q-o-q growth is expected to be fairly
positive in most quarters of 2013. Two major
factors should support growth in 2013. First, there
will probably be no further autonomous factors
driving up imports. Second, in the second half of
the year some front-loading of private
consumption is anticipated due to the consumption
tax hike scheduled for April 2014. For the same
reason, private consumption is also expected to be
weak in the second and third quarter of 2014. The
last consumption tax hike from 3% to 5% in 1997
already led to a front-loading of consumption.
Non-residential investment is expected to grow
moderately in 2013 and beyond. Despite
headwinds due to deflation and the global
economic situation an improvement of export
prospects and of sentiment for manufacturing
companies are expected to lift non-residential
investment in 2013 and 2014. In addition,
investment in energy efficiency could drive
investment

electronics possibly send Japan's exports down.
Consumption could be weaker than expected in
case the debate about welfare reform and the
looming loss of purchasing power due to the
consumption tax hike results in a higher saving
rate.

36. CHINA
Mixed signals for the short term, while structural challenges remain
A faster than expected slowdown

China's growth has slowed more rapidly than was
anticipated in the spring forecast, with growth rates
of 8.2%, 7.6% and 7.4% (y-o-y) over the first three
quarters of 2012. Weakness has been seen in both
internal and external demand. Growth in exports
and imports has ground to a halt in recent months,
with year-on-year growth rates dropping to close
to zero. Growth rates for domestic industrial
production, retail sales and fixed asset investment
all declined fairly steadily through the first half of
the year.
The slowdown was partly a response to a
deliberate policy of monetary tightening during
2011. China raised policy rates five times between
October 2010 and July 2011 to counter a steady
increase in inflation, and to dampen credit growth
and property prices in an overheating real estate
sector. The RMB real effective exchange rate was
also allowed to appreciate by around 7% during
the course of 2011. These measures largely proved
effective. Consumer price inflation fell back
sharply, from a peak of 6.5% in July 2011, to just
below 2% in September 2012. Real estate
investment and property prices fell as the domestic
real estate bubble deflated.

pick-up in credit growth. However there are no
clear signs as yet of any significant bounce back in
activity. PMI readings remain weak, while
producer prices have turned deflationary,
suggesting significant pressure on profitability in
industrial sectors. While a relatively "soft landing"
is not out of reach for the Chinese economy, the
recent data only provides a limited case for
optimism.
The external outlook

The external sector seems unlikely to contribute
greatly to Chinese growth in the near term. The
effective exchange rate of the RMB has been
relatively stable through 2012, while the outlook
for China's main export markets is that growth will
remain subdued, and that export growth will
therefore remain modest. Falling domestic
producer prices may allow for some capture of
market share, but structural factors – including the
rise of other low cost producers in the region – are
working against China in this respect.
Graph II.36.1:China - Trade growth
100

y-o-y%

80
60
40

It seems likely that the pace of the slowdown was
faster than the Chinese authorities had expected.
Trade growth has proved surprisingly slow, and
there has been a protracted weakness across a
range of economic and sentiment indicators, with a
sequence of weak PMI readings to go alongside
below-consensus data readings through much of
the first three quarters. In June, the People's Bank
of China introduced the first cut in headline policy
rates for three years, followed by a further cut in
July, together reducing headline rates by 50 bps.
There has also been an acceleration by the
National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC) of approvals for infrastructure
investment.
Is a stabilisation of growth in sight?

Despite the string of disappointing data, there are
some tentative signs of stabilisation of growth.
Retail sales and fixed asset investment have seen
their year-on-year growth rates stabilise over the
last 2 to 3 months. There has also been a slight

The domestic outlook

Given the weakness of external demand, and likely
sluggish demand from the domestic private sector,
the current outlook for China largely hinges on
whether reported measures to accelerate public
investment projects, and some targeted fiscal
measures directed towards consumers, will prove
sufficient to generate a substantial improvement in
domestic prospects. In recent weeks the NDRC has
approved a number of infrastructure projects,
reportedly worth around 2.5% of GDP. These are
not entirely new projects, but their accelerated
approval is expected to help underpin a

135

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

stabilisation of growth through to the end of this
year. Consumer spending should also prove fairly
resilient. Real interest rates have risen as inflation
has dropped back, which raises returns to
households, who keep a substantial part of their
wealth in the form of bank deposits. Together with
the continued steady growth of wages, this should
prevent a sharp slowdown in consumption
spending. For these reasons growth is expected to
be around 7.7% in 2012, with a similar level of
growth for 2013 and 2014.
Risks to the outlook

There remain downside risks from the US fiscal
cliff, or a worsening of the euro-area economic
outlook. However, the most critical determinants
of Chinese growth in the short term are likely to be
internal. The relatively low weight of consumption
demand in the economy means that domestic
developments remain heavily dependent on more
idiosyncratic components of demand. At some
point a sharp structural break in investment may
arise, driven by profitability concerns. The forecast
does not incorporate a sharp fall in investment

demand over the forecast horizon, but rates of
investment close to 50% of GDP cannot be
sustained indefinitely without raising the prospects
of a substantial squeeze on profits. An additional
structural issue is the sustainability of local
government finances which are currently partly
dependent on asset sales.
The Chinese government retain room for
manoeuvre to counter negative shocks with a
budget deficit below 2% of GDP. The imminent
leadership change in party leadership in November
this year may affect the size and scope of any
policy responses.
The forecast for 2013-14 suggests that China may
be in the process of making a step shift to a
materially lower growth rate than the past decade.
Such an adjustment to a lower trend growth rate is
likely to prove beneficial, provided it is the
product of a significant rebalancing of the
economy away from an overreliance on
investment, and towards higher levels of
consumption and more emphasis on less resource
intensive and capital intensive economic growth.

37. EFTA
Resilience put to the test
Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein(28)
continue their remarkable resilience to the euroarea sovereign-debt crisis. That is not to say that
the crisis has no effect on the economic outlook,
on the contrary. There is a fall-out in external
demand from the euro area and there has been an
impact on economic sentiment, in particular in
Switzerland. However, the impact has not been as
severe as the strong ties with the European Union
would suggest. This resilience was identified in the
spring forecast to have a common origin in
exceptionally low domestic interest rates linked to
the safe havens status of these countries and their
ability to tap into demand from new growth poles.

For both Switzerland and Norway, domestic yields
continue to be very low in a context of a strong
currency. Domestic demand is supported both
directly through lower lending rates for corporates
and households and indirectly through the wealth
effect. The benefit of export diversification
towards new markets is waning for Switzerland as
the economic growth of the emerging economies is
also coming under pressure. Norway's exports are
still boosted by oil prices at an elevated level
which also have strong impetus on domestic
demand through the investment in the oil sector.
As a consequence, Norway's business cycle is
(28)

Although Switzerland and Liechtenstein are two separate
countries and there are important differences between
them, in terms of economic development they are highly
comparable and in this forecast Liechtenstein is taken as
part of the forecast for the Swiss economy. The economic
outlook for Iceland is discussed separately because of its
candidate country status.

decoupling from the euro area whereas
Switzerland's business cycle cools down.
Swiss business cycle cools down

The Swiss economy continues to outperform the
euro-area economy in spite of its high dependency
on the economic developments in the euro area.
The safe-haven status of Switzerland has led to
capital inflows, which resulted in a fall in domestic
yields that supported domestic demand both
through lower borrowing costs and an increase in
asset values (including real estate). Swiss exports
are concentrated in a few categories with a low
price elasticity which helps to offset part of the
pressure from appreciation. For instance, in the
export of financial services the competitive edge of
Switzerland lies not only with its solid banking
history and large global banks but also with bank
secrecy and tax advantages. In goods trade, the
Swiss also have a competitive edge in some niche
markets with a remarkable contribution by
commodity traders like Vitol, a global player, to
Swiss economic strength.
Irrespective of its competitive edge, Switzerland is
neither immune to economic developments in the
EU nor to developments in the rest of the world
economy. With the strength of the recovery outside
the euro area waning, its exports are coming under
pressure as is becoming increasingly visible in the
declining contribution of net trade to economic
growth. For the rest of 2012, the Swiss economic
outlook is clouded by the effect of external
developments on foreign demand.
Domestic demand will continue to provide the
main thrust to the Swiss economy throughout 2012
supported by very low interest rates, which also
are a consequence of the financial turmoil outside
Switzerland, and an inflow of high wage earners.
These factors will continue to drive domestic
demand albeit at a diminishing rate as the safe
haven effect on domestic demand wanes. By then,
however, the fundamentally strong position, like in
the labour market, of the Swiss economy will help
drive the economy.
The positive growth surprises in the fourth quarter
of last year and the first quarter of this year are
signs of the volatility that the Swiss economy is
confronted with. Also, because of the statistical

137

European Economic Forecast, Autumn 2012

effect these positive surprises will support the
annual growth figure this year. At the same time,
the disappointing GDP figure in the second quarter
(-0.2% q-o-q, 0.5% y-o-y) warrants a more sober
outlook for the Swiss economy for the rest of the
year. It has confirmed our expectations in spring
that net exports turn into a drag on GDP growth
throughout 2012. Already, labour market reports
have become less positive although the 2.8%
unemployment rate in September seems to indicate
mostly friction unemployment.
As the world's recovery again accelerates in 2013
and pressure will come off the Swiss franc, the
Swiss economy will see its external demand rise
for both its high value added export products and
the more basic industries. This should increasingly
provide impetus to economic growth going into
2014 when economic growth is foreseen at slightly
above potential.
The strong Swiss Franc issue

The Swiss franc has traded mostly close to the 1.20
ceiling against the euro since its introduction by
the Swiss National Bank in September 2011.
However, the Swiss franc depreciated significantly
in real effective terms since the Swiss National
Bank (SNB) given the euro’s generalised weakness
between March and July against major currencies
(JPY, USD, GBP). Nonetheless, the franc will
continue to play a significant safe-haven role as
proved by the significant capital inflows into
Switzerland. The fact that the exchange rate has
stayed very close to the lower bound of 1.20 shows
that renewed upward pressure remains an
important risk.
As a consequence of the high-valued Swiss franc,
prices have been under downward pressure
regardless of robust domestic demand. For 2012, a
small decline in the general price level is expected.
This is particularly visible in the core inflation
which will support real disposable income. In the
coming two years, as monetary conditions are
expected to gradually return to normal, inflation
should rise again to moderate levels.
There are two major risks to the outlook for the
Swiss economy. A first risk is the development of
an asset bubble, in particular in housing, as a
consequence of yields persistently below the
equilibrium level. Such an asset bubble would
affect bank balance sheets and could create
financial instability. A second risk is a sudden

138

reversal in external financial conditions, like an
evaporation of the safe haven status, which would
lead to a sharp depreciation of the Swiss franc and
difficulties for the SNB to undo its loose monetary
policy in time. In this rather unlikely scenario,
inflationary pressures would increase, eroding real
disposable income while the associated lower real
interest rates would drive an unsustainable increase
in households' net wealth. Again, this would entail
risks for Swiss financial stability.
Norway's business cycle decouples

Domestic demand is fuelling growth in the
Norwegian economy, helped by favourable
domestic conditions and a thriving oil sector.
Strong wage and employment growth, along with
very low inflation and interest rates, are currently
boosting consumer purchasing power. Private
consumption growth in the first half of 2012 was
very high (2% on the second half of the previous
year, seasonally, adjusted). Moreover, higher level
of disposable income and expectations for
continued strong labour market ensure sustained
consumption growth in 2012 and into 2013. Higher
interest rates and a moderation of employment
growth are forecast to slow down consumption
growth gradually in 2013 and 2014.
Gross fixed capital formation gained momentum in
the second quarter of 2012. An appreciating krone,
coupled with higher profitability in the off-shore
sector due to high oil prices, is increasingly
attracting international capital flows. The resulting
exceptionally strong growth in Norwegian oil
investment is projected to slow down during the
forecast period, but it will remain high, provided
that high oil prices and low interest rates are
sustained.
Export growth is expected to recover, despite the
strong exchange rate, aided by strong growth of
hydrocarbons exports and Norway's relatively low
reliance on Europe for them (Norway's oil exports
are in excess of 40% of total exports, half of which
are absorbed by the EU). However, stronger
imports, in line with growth of domestic demand,
are expected to limit the external sector's
contribution to GDP growth.
GDP growth above trend and inflation below
target: room for monetary policy?

The krone appreciation and resulting lower import
prices have kept inflation low, registering only

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

0.6% on average during the first seven months of
2012, despite high global energy costs, strong
economic growth and rapid wage growth. The
strong krone is expected to keep inflation below
1% in 2012. In subsequent years, as global
prospects improve and pressures on the krone ease,
the central bank is expected to raise interest rates
in response to Norway's domestic imbalances:
rapid increases of house prices and credit.

stay below the central bank's target of 2.5%.
However, too sharp interest hikes might only
strengthen the krone to levels that would cause
inflation to drop further below target.
Downside risks to the outlook for Norway

Turmoil in financial markets of other advanced
economies could raise capital flows into Norway
causing a further appreciation of the krone while
pushing the domestic interest rate below
equilibrium levels. This would enhance risks of
asset bubbles, which are especially worrisome for
the property markets where prices are already high,
and are mirrored in high indebtedness of
households. On the other hand, a possible sharp
escalation of the euro crisis and a new financial
crisis could result in much tighter credit standards,
which is one of the main risks to the Norwegian
economy.

Whereas strong production growth is expected in
the years ahead, no major labour shortages are
foreseen thanks to high immigration flows, except
for anecdotal shortages in some skilled areas.
Consequently, wage growth should not pick up
sharply, but still remain relatively high during the
forecast period.
While economic strength and high wage growth
continue, inflation is forecast to gradually increase
throughout the forecast period, yet it is expected to

Continuing on a moderate growth path
Russia recovered well from the global economic
crisis, posting real growth rates above 4% since
2010. In 2011, real GDP grew by 4.3% y-o-y.
Growth was particularly strong in the third quarter
(5.4%, y-o-y) and last quarter (4.9%).

100

In the first quarter of 2012, annual GDP growth
was 4.9% y-o-y and moderated to 4% y-o-y in the
second quarter. However, this comparative good
performance is mostly due to the carry-over from
the last semester of 2011. Quarter-on-quarter, the
economy grew only 0.6% (seasonally adjusted) in
the first quarter of 2012 and 0.1% in the second.
Despite slow recorded growth in the first part of
2012, the unemployment rate continued to
decrease and in July reached its lowest level
(5.4%) since 2009. Industrial production from
January to July 2012 was on average 3.2% above
the level of the previous year, but dropped in
August to 2.1%, mostly because of slowing growth
in manufacturing.

Exports of natural gas are contracting

After contracting in volumes and growing in
values during most of 2011, exports of crude oil
and oil products increased both in volumes and
values in the first quarter of 2012 and remained
stable in the second quarter.
Exports of natural gas contracted in the first half of
2012 both in values and volumes, reflecting lower
demand from main trading partners and a drop in
prices after the peak of the last quarter of 2011.

Private consumption grew by 1% (seasonally
adjusted, q-o-q) in the first quarter of 2012 and by
1.2% in the second quarter. Investment spending
grew by respectively 2.8% (seasonally adjusted,
q-o-q) in the first quarter of 2012, and by 2.9% in
the second.

Reflecting also these patterns, export volume
growth will be limited to 3.6% annually in 2012.

At the same time, the trade balance decreased by
-5.5% q-o-q in the first quarter of 2012 and -5.8%
in the second quarter, reflecting the overall drop in
exports by 1.4% (seasonally adjusted) in the first
half of 2012, and the growth of imports by 2.2%
(seasonally adjusted) in the same period.

In 2012, headline inflation remained subdued until
May (3.6% y-o-y), but subsequently picked up
(September 6.5% y-o-y) on the back of the hike in
food prices caused by droughts in Russia and the
USA, and of increases in tariffs. The Central Bank
of Russia publicly stated already in August that

respecting the inflation target range of 5-6% for
2012 will be difficult and lent strength to this
concern by increased its refinancing rate by 25bps
to 8.25% in September.

This budget incorporates the rule linking
expenditure to oil prices, resulting in further fiscal
consolidation and a progressive, albeit slow,
reduction in non-oil deficits. The non-oil budget
deficit is set to remain high in 2012 (around 11%
of GDP) and it is expected to decline to around
10% in 2013 and 8.5% in 2014.

Fiscal consolidation continues and non-oil
deficit is set to slowly diminish

The Russian federal budget was in surplus in 2011
(0.8% of GDP), for the first time since 2008. It
remained in surplus also in the first half of 2012.
Although oil and gas revenues decreased slightly
because of the decline in oil prices, an increase in
non-fuel revenues more than compensated for this
loss. Fiscal policy for 2013-15 will be based on a
new fiscal rule, which limits budgetary spending in
line with movements in oil prices.

Looking forward

The Russian economy is forecast to continue on a
moderate growth path at a rate of 3.7% in 2012,
revised upward from 3.6% in the spring forecast.
GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 3.9% in 2012
and 4% in 2014.
Export volumes are expected to increase in 2013
(4.5% y-o-y) and 2014 (5.3% y-o-y), reflecting
improvements in the global economic outlook,
while domestic demand and imports will grow at a
slower
pace,
partly
reflecting
a
less
accommodating fiscal stance.

In September, the Finance Ministry released the
new draft general budget for the period 2013-15.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG
ECFIN) produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fullyfledged economic forecasts twice a year : in the spring and in
the autumn. These forecasts cover the principal macroeconomic
aggregates for the Member States, the candidate countries,
the European Union as a whole, the euro area and the
international environment. Interim forecasts, updating the outlook
for the seven largest Member States, EU and the euro area,
are presented in between the fully-fledged forecasts.
2. Data for 2012, 2013 and 2014 are forecasts.
The source for all tables is the European Commission,
unless otherwise stated.
Historical data for the Member States are based on the European
System of Accounting (ESA 1995). Most Member States have
now introduced chain-linking in their national accounts to measure
the development of economic aggregates in volume terms.
For the USA and Japan the definitions are as in the SNA.
3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4. In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.
5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential
output as estimated via a production function, where the increase in
the capital stock and the difference between actual unemployment
and the NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 22-26, 28 and 32-33 are based on
full-time-equivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Germany,
Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands
report FTE data (taken together, these countries represent
over 80% of euro-area GDP and more than 60% of EU GDP). In the
absence of FTE data, employment is based on numbers of persons.
In the calculation of EU and euro-area aggregates, priority is given to
FTE data, as this is regarded as more representative of diverse
patterns of working time.
7. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates.
World GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS).
In the tables on world trade and international payments, the
aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.

Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis
third countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of
the individual countries in the EU or the euro area. However,
intra-EU or intra-euro-area balances are non-zero because of
reporting errors. The creation of the internal market in 1993
reduced border controls and formalities, and accordingly the
scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage. Typically,
intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU exports,
leading to an overestimation of the surplus. For the past the
"adjusted" balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB
estimates for the euro area. For the future, they are ECFIN's
forecasts based on the extrapolation of the discrepancies
observed in 2011.
8. With respect to the 12 RAMS (recently-acceded Member States),
which are currently in a transition phase, the quality of statistical
data may not always be directly comparable to most EU15
Member States.
9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA17 (BE,DE,EE,IE,EL,ES,FR,IT,CY,LU,MT,NL,AT,PT,SI,SK,FI)
Acceding countries :
Croatia.
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Iceland, Montenegro and Serbia.
Potential candidates :
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Asia :
All countries in that region except Japan and
the Asian MENA countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
