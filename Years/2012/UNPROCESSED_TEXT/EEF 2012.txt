onomic and Financial Affairs
 A recovery is on the horizon, but it will be a 
long and stony road
 before the EU economy reaches 
sustained 
growth. Following the escalation of the sovereign
-debt crisis in the second half of 2011, the 
EU economy has entered a shallow recession in the fourth quarter. Since then, we have seen tentative 
signs of stabilisation. Yet, as the outlook for the EU econom
y is slowly improving, the situation remains 
extraordinarily fragile, and the risk of a renewed aggravation of the crisis is still present. The ebbing of 

the greatest 
financial market s
tress 
creates
 the opportunity for policy
-makers to focus on measures to
 underpin the strength of the expected recovery and the growth potential. 
 In late 2011, a sharp drop in the supply of credit threatened to turn into an outright credit crunch
 that 
would have strangled the real economy. However, this has been avoided, larg
ely thanks to the 
exceptional liquidity provision by the Eurosystem. By reducing bank funding stress, it has prepared the 

ground for easing tensions across a broad range of financial market segments in the first months of 

2012. Business and consumer sentim
ent, which deteriorated sharply in the second half of 2011, has 
stabilised at low levels, but is not trending upwards, yet. A return of confidence is a precondition for the 

dynamics of recovery to unfold. The recent improvements have been underpinned by a 
number of 
complementary policy measures at EU and Member State level. 
Member States have adopted additional 
measures to reduce their vulnerabilities. Large firewalls have been agreed to contain possible contagion, 
and the euro area has strengthened its ins
titutional framework and its surveillance tools. Finally, bank 
recapitalisation is progressing. 
However, renewed market volatility in recent weeks is a reminder that 
the stabilisation cannot be taken for granted yet, and 
that 
the pernicious interaction bet
ween weak 
sovereigns, weak banks and weak GDP is still among the biggest risks to the outlook. 
 Past experience shows that recoveries from financial crises are not only slow and uneven, but also often 

subject to episodes of renewed weakness and financial m
arket stress. The legacy of the Great Recession 
in 2008
-09 and the sovereign
-debt crisis imply a very gradual recovery for the EU economy 
characterised by growth below potential over most of the forecast horizon, insufficient employment 
dynamics and persis
tent growth differentials across Member States.
 Major policy challenges remain, in order to consolidate the recent stabilisation, solidify the basis of the 
recovery and strengthen the growth potential of the EU economy as well as its capacity to resorb 
imb
alances. The crisis is fuelled by concerns about the sustainability of sovereign debt that has been 
rising faster than GDP. Avoiding a relapse into the crisis therefore requires not only crisis resolution 

tools and fiscal adjustment, but also bolstering th
e structural underpinnings of growth. Concretely, the 
tasks ahead include, but are not limited to: firstly, using the window of opportunity provided by the ECB 
liquidity injections to further strengthen bank balance sheets and thus allowing the banking sec
tor to 
underpin the recovery of the real economy; secondly, a combination of fiscal consolidation and 
structural reforms to safeguard debt sustainability where it is menaced. Budgetary policy should be 

differentiated according to Member States' fiscal spac
e and financial vulnerabilities, and should be 
designed and implemented in a way that minimises the short
-term negative impact on growth. 
Moreover, structural reform is needed to help the adjustment of existing internal and external 
imbalances which has pr
ogressed over the past two years and prevent the re
-emergence of persistent 
imbalances in the future. The EU has equipped itself with rich tools for enhanced surveillance and 
policy response. Now it has to use them. 
  OVERVIEW
   1 Renewed tensions in
 sovereign
-debt 
markets, h
igh 
oil prices and
 decelerating 
world output growth 
have all contrib
uted to a
 sharp loss of confidence 
towards the end of 2011
 and the subsequent output contraction in the EU. 
Strong policy actions and major advancements in the EU 
institutional
 framework have averted a far worse outcome and brought about an easing of 
finan
cial market tensions as well as a stabilisation in confidence at the 
beginning of 2012. However, 
looming uncertainty about economic prospects
, re-ignited 
stress 
in sovereign
-bond markets and concerns about the banking 
sector 
are still weighing on 
economic 
and 
financial conditions
, albeit with 
large cross
-country divergences.
 Financial market conditions in the first months of this year have improved 

markedly as 
sovereign
- and bank
-funding stress ha
ve eased
 and 
the 
prospect
 of a credit crunch 
has largely dimi
nished
, main
ly 
thanks
 to non
-standard 
monetary policy measures, most notably the Eurosystem's long
er-term 
refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012. 
However,
 renew
ed uncertainty about fiscal developments
 in some Member States 
amid 
a worseni
ng growth outlook and still fragile banks 
have recently again 
increased the 
strain on sovereign
-bond yields of 
concerned
 Member States 
and
 affected 
several other 
financial 
market segments. Credit growth to the 
non
-financial private sector is still subdued 
and is not e
xpected to pick
-up in 
the short 
term
. Credit 
supply 
conditions 
remain tight, in spite of some recent 
encouraging signs, while
 credit demand from private households and firms
 remains limited as both borrowers and lenders are engaged in a process
 of 
gradual deleveraging which is expected to continue throughout the forecast 

horizon. 
 Outside the EU, g
lobal growth has 
lately 
shown signs of 
reacceleration. The 
US recovery seems to 
have gained some mom
entum in the second half of 
2011, reflected by stronger consumption growth and milder fiscal 
consolidation
 (implying a public debt level of 112% of GDP in 2013)
, while 
labour market prospects appear to be more uncertain. In
 Japan
, the post
-disaster recover
y is set to continue on the back of investment. Overall, 
growth in emerging market economies is expected to remain robust, 
notably 

in China, 
but to moderate slightly over the forecast horizon. Global trade has 

decelerated in 2011 driven by single events su
ch as disasters in Japan, but 
also by geopolitical tensions and 
the 
turmoil in sovereign
-debt market
s in 
Europe. In line with global GDP, world trade is projected to grow only 

moderately in 2012, before embarking on a more dynamic growth path in 

2013. Incr
eased energy prices are weighing on growth, but going forward, 
crude
-oil prices are assumed to stabilise and gradually decrease over the 
forecast horizon. 
 After negative growth rates in the last qua
rter of 2011, 
a GDP contraction
 is 
forecast also for the beginning of this year in the EU and the euro area. Both 

zones have thus entered a technical recession. 
The EU economy is set to 
register a weak first half year with quarterly growth rates around zer
o or 
slightly negative in 
the majority of 
Member States. While 
some 
leading 
indicators are 
suggesting
 a mild and short
-lived recession, recent survey and 
hard data do not indicate 
the start of the recovery, yet.

 A mild recession with

the offing
 â European Economic Forecast, Spring 2012
   2 Projections have been substantially revised 
downward for 2012
 as a whole
, and to 
a lesser extent for 2013
, compared with last autumn.
 However, 
compared with the February interim forecast, the picture remains unchanged 
for this year, when
 GDP in the euro area is expected to undergo a slight 
contracti
on of 0.3% and to remain 
stable
 in the EU. In 2013, economic 
activity is projected to increase by 1.0% in the euro area and by 1.3% in the 
EU
. The forecast mild recovery is predicated on a 
return of confidence
, and 
thus on the assumption that the
 challenge
s faced by the euro area, notably the 
still on
-going sovereign
-debt crisis and the fragile state of the EU banking 
system, will 
be 
successfully and sustainably overcome.
 Overall, domestic demand i
s unlikely to support GDP growth in 2012, 
as the 
process of deleveraging continues across the sectors of the economy. Banks 

need to further strengthen their balance sheets and tight credit conditions are 

expected to weigh on consumption and investment. Pri
vate investment is 
currently still contracting and 
is expected to be a drag on GDP in 2012
. It
 is 
forecast to rebound gradually and bolster economic growth in 2013 

benefiting from the export
-led rebound, low financing costs and the fading of 
uncertainty ab
out business 
prospects
. Private consumption will continue to be 
restrained by high unemployment, slow growth of real incomes and high 

precautionary savings
 as well as high household debt
 in a number of Member 
States
. With the expected return of confidence,
 labour market conditions 
stabilising and real 
disposable 
income growth 
supported by 
abating 
inflationary pressures, private consumption is set to reaccelerate gradually 

from the second half of 2012 on and expand further in 2013. 
By contrast, 

public consum
ption is expected to shrink in 2012 
and 2013 
against the 
background of 
continuing 
fiscal consolidation needs
 to ensure public debt 
sustainability and restore confidence. The necessary fiscal consolidation is set 
to restrain economic activity in the short r
un. However, the appropriate 
choice of fiscal measures and their credibility can limit the adverse short
-term impact on growth. Overall, domestic demand is expected to take over 
from net exports as the main driver of the recovery in 2013, on the back of 

restored business and consumer confidence and rising real disposable 
incomes.
 Against the backdrop of the expected 
acceleration
 in global growth and 
recent depreciation of the euro effective exchange
-rate,
 an increase in
 export 
growth is forecast for the second half of 2012 and 
in 
2013. But the extent to 
which Member States are likely to benefit from a more dynamic global 
economy will depend on their regional and product specialisation and their 

competitive
ness positions. By contrast, import growth will be restrained by 
weak domestic demand in 2012, but is forecast to become more buoyant 

thereafter, 
in line with the improving economic situation. On balance, net 
exports of goods and services are expected to s
upport economic growth over 
the forecast horizon.
 The 
consolidated
 current
-account balance is 
predicted
 to 
gradually improve over the forecast horizon
 in the euro area and the EU.
 At Member State level, 
the structural adjustment 
needs resulting from 
internal and
 external imbalances that characterised the run
-up to the global 
economic crisis
 have already triggered a substantial rebalancing of external 
positions.
 Initially, the larger part occurred through ba
lance
-sheet adjustment 
in the private sector of deficit countries and there are indications that at least 

part of the observed rebalancing has been structural rather than merely 
cyclical. C
onsolidation 
in the public sector is contributing to lower net 
borr
owing, while the reassessment of risks and growth perspectives in deficit 
countries should keep interest rates at elevated levels and exert pressure for 
Lingering uncertainty 
weighing on domestic 
demand in 2012
 â â but a positive 
contribution from the 
external side
 External adjustment at 

Member State level 
on

 Overview
   3 continuing rebalancing. Changes in relative prices and 
improvement
s in competitiveness 
are supporting t
he reallocation of productive resources to the 
tradable sector in deficit countries
. Finally, the on
-going structural reforms 
will contribute to the external rebalancing process
. Within the euro area, 
Member States with current
-account surpluses have exper
ienced a reduction 
of these surpluses over the 
past years
. But further gradual adjustment is 
expected to be uneven across surplus countries
 over the forecast horizon.
 Diverse external positions and structural 
conditions have contributed to the 
large cross
-country disparities
 that emerged during the Great Recession. 
Differentials in fiscal consolidation needs, domestic 
financing costs
, and the
 banking sector's capacity to extend credit
 as well as different labou
r market 
situations accentuate this 
heterogeneity.
 After a flat first quarter, economic activity in 
Germany
 is forecast to gain 
momentum over the forecast horizon, with domestic demand bolstered by 

very favourable financing conditions for firms and househo
lds and a robust 
labour market.
 Output
 in 
France
 is predicted to 
expand at a 
moderate pace
, as 
more buoyant private consumption growth is 
hampered
 by unfavourable 
labour market conditions. In 
Italy
, GDP 
growth 
is 
expected to be anaemic 
over the forecast ho
rizon, as the economy has to cope with structural 
impediments and related high unemployment and its direct exposure to 
sovereign and bank funding stress. 
Spain
 is projected to remain in recession 
until the end of 2012
 as the Spanish economy faces a still i
ncomplete 
adjustment of the housing market and in external competitiveness, a fragile 

banking sector, important fiscal consolidation and very high unemployment. 

The 
Dutch economy
 is 
forecast
 to return to slightly positive growth rates only 
at the end of 20
12, as rising external demand is expected to in
creasingly 
off
set the decrease in private consumption.
 Among the three euro
-area 
programme countries, the 
Irish economy
 is expected to gain momentum over 
the forecast horizon on the back of gains in competiven
ess and a slowly 
stabilising labour market. Reflecting the adjustment process to regain 

competitiveness and rein in budget imbalances, GDP in 
Greece
 is forecast to 
contract substantially in 2012 and to stabilise in the following year. Output in 
Portugal
 is expected to shrink considerably in 2012, followed by moderate 
growth in 2013.
 As regards the largest Member States outside the euro area, 
the 
UK economy
 registered negative growth rates at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 
2012, mainly due to weak priv
ate consumption. With 
a pick
-up in
 real wage 
growth and more robust external demand expected toward the end of 2012, 
later followed by investment, GDP expansion is set to become increasingly 
dynamic over the forecast horizon.

 is set to register the 
highest 
economic growth in the EU in 2012 despite a moderate slow

keep the pace in 2013. Domestic demand is projected to remain the ma
in driver of growth, with private consumption giving more and more way to 

investment.
 Regarding non

(post

Romania

Latvia
 is expected to expand over the forecast horizon. By contrast, economic

 European Economic Forecast, Spring 2012
   4 Employment growth 
has 
turned negative, 
bringing up 
the unemployment rate
 in the EU to above 10% in early 2012
. The overall deterioration masks 
substantial cross
-coun
try 
differences
 where increasing employment levels 
and gradually declining unemployment in 
some countries sharply contrast
 with 
a rapid
 deterioration in the labour market performance in vulnerable 
Member States. Leading indicators suggest 
a weak 
outlook fo
r the 
EU 
labour 
market
, with the recession 
set to 
increase unemployment in the near term. 
Unlike 
in 
2009, 
strained public budgets and reductions 
in public sector 
staffing
 are likely to weigh further on overall employment prospects. In 2013, 
the subdued rec
overy and positive effects of labour market reforms are 
expected to translate into a slight increase in employment in the
 EU
. Consumer prices in 2011 were mainly driven by the pass
-through of rising 
global commodity
 prices and, in some Member States, by increases in 
indirect taxes and administered prices. HICP inflation temporarily exceeded 
3% in 2011,
 but began to recede in the light of a weakening economic 
environment. The easing in commodity prices as indicated by
 commodities 
futures toward the end of this year and relative weak economic activity 
should lower consumer
-price inflation further.
 A faster decline in inflation 
rates is precluded by fiscal measures adopted in several Member States, most 

notably increases
 in indirect taxes and administered prices. The return of 
subdued growth in late 2012 and 2013 is not expected to contribute to price 

pressures, in particular since output gaps are 
expected to narrow 
very slowly 

in the EU and the euro area. HICP headline i
nflation is forecast to stay close 
to 2% in 2013 in the EU and the euro area.
 Notwithstanding worsening economic prospects in the course of last year, 

aggregate public finance conditions in the EU and the euro area impro
ved 
significantly in 2011. On the back of further fiscal consolidation measures 
combined with a
n expected 
gradual economic recovery, budget deficits are 
expected to continue to decline throughout 2012 and 2013
. The overall deficit
 in the EU is set to decre
ase
 from 
4Â½% of GDP in 2011
 to some 3Â½
% in 
2012 and, at unchanged policies, further to 3Â¼% in 2013. The deficit reduction in 

2012 is underpinned by sizeable fiscal measures, while the fiscal stance 
underlying the forecast in 2013 is broadly neutral.
 Govern
ment debt
-to-GDP ratios are forecast to increase in most EU Member 
States over the forecast horizon. In the euro area, increasing interest 
payments and low growth are contributing to push up debt ratios. The 

aggregate debt ratio of the EU is forecast to re
ach 86% of GDP this year and 

87% of GDP 
in 2013
 (slight 
upward revisions relative to the autumn 
forecast). The corresponding euro
-area figures are 92% and 93%.
  The outlook 
continues to be
 surrounded b
y high uncertainty. While some 
risks identified in earlier forecasts have eventually materialised, 
such as 

continued stress in sovereign
-debt markets in some countries, entering a 
recession, or a lower momentum of global growth, the tail risks have been 
reduced thanks to substantial policy agreements and bold policy measures. 
On balance
, the risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. 

The forecast crucially depends on the policy assumption that crisis
-related 
challenges are successfully addre
ssed.
 The 
largest 
downside risk 
remains 
an escalation of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
 in the euro area
. A re

be a major issue within and outside the EU, consolidation measures 
in 2013 

which are not included in the central 
forecast 
scenario 
due to the no

 assumption could have an additional impact on demand. 
The

possibly weigh on growth more strongly than currently envisaged.

 On the upside, 
the 
policy measures taken to address the sovereign

might lift confiden
ce faster and entail an earlier return to recovery than 
expected. Furthermore,
 a stronger than expected rebound 
in the global 
economy, in particular stronger growth dynamics in emerging market 
economies, would boost EU exports more than forecast in the cen
tral 
scenario.
 Risks to the inflation outlook appear broadly balanced. On the downside, a 

more profound than expected recession in the EU may put further downward 

pressure on prices, while any attempt of competitive devaluations outside the 

EU could constr
ain import prices. On the upside, a stronger
-than
-expected 
rebound of the world economy or intensifying geopolitical tensions could 

trigger a new oil
-price surge and lift inflationary pressures. Higher wage 
increases

-up of 
liquidity may also potentially contribute to 
somewhat 
higher consumer
-price 
inflation.

level
   THE EU ECONO
MY: FROM RECESSION T
OWARDS A 
SLOW RECOVERY
    9 1. OVERVIEW
 In spring 2012, the EU economy is undergoing a 
period of output contraction. The oil
-price 
increases, the slowing global output growth, and 

the loss of confidence in an intensifying European 

sovereign
-debt crisis have weighed heavily on 
the 
EU economy, in particular towards the end of 

2011. Despite these encumbrances the decline in 

economic activity has been mild. Due to an array 

of important policy decisions, advances in the 

institutional set
-up, additional structural reforms, 
and unconv
entional monetary support, a sharp 
decline in economic activity has been avoided. But 

real GDP growth will remain almost flat in 2012 

(see Graph 
I.1
). With transitory shocks waning and 
confidence rebounding, the return to subdued 

economic growth is forecast for 2013.

 In the first three months of 2012, tensions in financial markets had eased in the wake of policy decisions 
and unconventional liquidity provision; confidence had stopped deteriorating; and develo
pments in the 

external environment w
ere
 perceived as better than expected. Against this background hopes have 
emerged that the EU economy has turned the corner, will exit quickly from the current recession, and 
start to head towards recovery. 
 In spring 20
12, however, the EU economy is not out of the woods. It continues to suffer from the impact 
of both the Great Recession of 2008
-09 and the European sovereign
-debt crisis. Output is shrinking, 
unemployment is rising, and consumer
-price inflation is above lo
ng-term averages. The EU is faced 
with the need to complete the adjustment of internal and external imbalances, to repair financial sectors 
and to achieve sustainable public finances. The expectation that further efforts are needed in these areas 
cast shad
ows over the outlook for the real economy. The situation remains fragile. The most recent 
financial
-market tensions are evidence of this. 
 Looking ahead, achievements in a number of policy areas and the assumption that the sovereign
-debt 
crisis will be suc
cessfully handled lie behind the expectation of increasing investor and consumer 
confidence and the return to a recovery path. This will need some time, however, in particular in an 
environment with moderate global trade and output growth. In 2012 real GDP
 is expected to stagnate in 
the EU and decrease in the euro area. In 2013, with confidence rebuilding, a more favourable external 
environment, and improved real income growth, economic growth is expected to accelerate to moderate 
levels in the EU (1Â¼%) and
 in the euro area (1%). This corroborates the view that recoveries following 
financial crises are subdued. The expansion will be too moderate to lower unemployment over the 
forecast horizon. This limits inflationary pressures so that consumer
-price inflati
on is expected to be 
mainly driven by the pass
-through of energy prices and indirect taxes. Substantial macroeconomic 
differences across Member States are expected to persist with fiscal challenges and the sovereign
-debt 
crisis becoming important determina
nts of the differences.
 The economic outlook remains surrounded by high uncertainty although tail risks appear smaller than 
in autumn last year. While risks to the growth outlook remain skewed to the downside, risks to the 
inflation outlook are broadly bal
anced.
 European Econom
ic Forecast, Spring 2012
   10 Most Member States 
have 
entered 
or are moving 
into
 recession in 2011/12. Looking beyond the 
quarterly p
rofile, negative annual GDP growth 
rates are expected in 
2012 in 
eight Member States 
(see Table 
I.1
, for assumptions see Box 
I.5
). Going forward, based on the as
sum
ption
 that the 
euro area will successfully handle crisis
-related 
challenges
, a return of confidence over the course 
of 
2012 is expected.
 The positive impact on 
domestic demand components is expected to 
become strong enough to pull the economy out of 
recession later in 2012.
 But only a few Member 
States should have their 
pre
-crisis levels of per
-capita GDP reached in 2012 (see Map 
I.1
). In 
2013, private consumption and investment are set 

to pick up. Also supported by a positive 
contribution from net trade, the EU economy is 
expected to follow the 
path of subdued growth it 
had already entered during the 2009
-11 recovery.

EU, which came in slightly higher than expected in 

the autumn. Increases in indirect taxes and

contribution (about Â½ pp.).
 Going forward, the assumed
 moderation in 
commodity prices and base effects of past 

increases contribute to the expected decline in 
headline inflation. The economic slack limits 
inflationary pressures so that HICP inflation is 

expected to fall back in 2012 to an annual average 

of ab

the EU and the euro area but also for most Member

to slightly below 2%. However, this forecast 
hinges on the no

additional fisca

that are not yet fully known would raise inflation 
rates if passed on to consumers.
 2. PUTTING THE FORECAST
 INTO 
PERSPECTIVE
 From a subdued recovery after the Great 
Recession â
 Up to mid
-2011, the pattern of the economic 
rec
overy had been characteristic of a recovery 
following a downturn with a financial crisis at its 

origin.
(1) It had been more subdued and sluggish 
than other recoveries (see Graph 
I.3
), held back by 
weak private demand and tight cre
dit conditions. 
In principle, a temporary slowdown in economic 
activity, such as the one observed in the second 
quarter of 2011, is not unusual during such a 

recovery. A soft patch had already been observed 

in 2010, but in 2011 the loss of momentum in the 
                                                           (1) See European Commission (DG ECFIN),

out to be stronger than expected in the autumn of 

last year.
 Putting this into perspective usually 
requires an examination of long historical series. 
For the EU economy such a massive data

economic aggregates. Nevertheless, the EU 
forecast resembles some of the stylised features 

described in recent crises

 sharp increases in oil prices (see Box 
I.1
), public 
finance concerns and the
 rating downgrade in the 
US, disruptions to supply chains by Japanese 
disasters in March and the flooding in Thailand in 
December, but 
it was 
mainly the negative impact 
of the sovereign
-debt crisis in Europe 
that 
derailed 
the recovery. The tightening of fi
scal policy also 
weighed on economic growth. Concerns about 

public finances, the stability of the banking sector 
and the functioning of the 
Economic and 
Monetary 
Union
 (EMU),
 harmed
 confidence 
of consumers 
and businesses.
 Sovereign
-yield spreads responded 
increasingly to changes in perceptions about the 
state of public finances. Bank
-funding markets 
became impaired
, raising fears of a banking crisis. 
The deteriorating economic outlook amplified 
adverse feedback loops between the financial 
sector, public fin
ances and the real economy, 
which 
further 
worsened the situation. And 
concerns spread to a wider range of countries over 

the second half of the year.

costs, partial exclusion from foreign capital

 markets, and declining foreign trade 
flows were 

key channels through which the sovereign
-debt 
crisis affected output.
(3) By the end of the year, the 
EU and the euro area as a whole had entered a 

period of contraction. 
 The shift of focus that characterised 2011, from 

banking sector problems t
owards sovereign
-debt 
issues, has been identified as a typical feature of 

deep financial crises.
(4) But last year, shortcomings 
in the institutional set
-up of EMU intensified the 
impact on the real economy. This was the starting 

point for policy initiative
s aiming at a completion 
of the governance structure in EMU (including for 

instance the "Six pack" and the "Macroeconomic 

Imbalance Procedure").
 â until decisive policy decisions stopped the 
decline â
 At this crucial crossroad for the EU economy,
 a multifa
ceted policy response
 helped avoiding an 
imminent credit crunch and contained financial 
turmoil. In particular, non
-standard monetary 
policy measures in the euro area played a key role 

in buttressing confidence in the banking sector (see 

Box 
I.2
). Followin
g policy
-rate cuts in November 
and December, additional liquidity at long 

maturities enabled euro
-area banks to cover the 
large funding needs that were coming up in early 
2012. 
Banks
 used some of the liquidity to purchase 
higher yielding sovereign bonds, d
riving down 
yields. Other measures taken at the EU level 
included the announcement of a fiscal compact, 

and a strengthening of the
 crisis facilities 
(European Stability Mechanism
 and the 
European

continued in 2011. 
The bursting of the house price bubble, sharp falls

   13 accumulation in the public sector, readjusting 
towards lower levels of debt (deleveraging) in the 

private and the public sector came to the fore. 

While the link between gross debt and economi
c growth appears to be ambiguous, a reversal of the 

increase in net debt has been identified as 
conducive to economic growth. 
 In the private sector a deteriorating economic 
outlook, tighter credit standards and heightened 

uncertainty speeded up deleveragi
ng.
(5) The impact 
was felt much more strongly in Member States 

with high debt levels creating headwinds to their 

economic growth.
(6) In countries strongly affected 
by the crisis, access to long
-term debt became 
more difficult for banks, reflecting their ho
lding of 
domestic sovereign debt as well as exposure to 
domestic households and companies.
(7) As a result, 
firms in these countries face tighter credit 
constraints, which do not bode well for their 

investment decisions.
 As regards public debt, the EU and t
he euro area 
debt
-to-GDP ratios had approached 90%, which in 
studies had been identified as a crucial threshold 

lowering economic growth for rather long 

periods.
(8) The extent to which the necessary fiscal 
consolidation hampers 
also 
growth, can be shown 
to depend on the composition of measures and the 
credibility of the adjustment path (see Box
 I.4
). As regards private consumption, the direct impact 

of forcing credit
-constrained households to reduce 
their indebtedness is accompanied by an indirect 

effect vi
a precautionary savings, which 
unconstrained households make to have a buffer 
against future shocks. Both effects work together 
                                                           (5) For developments in the euro area, see ECB, Corporate

 â and laid the foundations of the path t
owards 
a slow recovery â
 While the immediate crisis response helped to 

avert a deep recession, the build
-up of confidence 
among consumers and investors also laid the 

foundations for an exit from recession and a return 
to a slow recovery. The fading away of
 some 
global headwinds, in particular the stabilisation in 
commodity prices and its impact on real disposable 

incomes should help the EU economy to turn the 

corner. The key role that regaining the confidence 

of the private sector will play in lifting the 
economy towards recovery is in line with historical 
evidence. The limited speed of the expected 
recovery resembles the experiences of the 2009
-11 recovery. It indicates that the intermediation role 

of the financial sector remains disrupted. What 

makes the p
rojected 2012
-13 recovery different is 
the intensity of consolidation efforts as well as the 

strengthened policy framework. On
-going 
deleveraging and consolidation may also 
contribute to explaining the differences across 
economic areas (see Graph 
I.4
) in terms of growth 
speed.

   14 origins of the crisis, 
for instance by sharply falling 
house prices, experienced much slower recoveries 

than others. 
Moreover the strong rebound in world 

trade in 
2010 helped more export
-oriented 
countries to recover 
more quickly
. With time 
passing by and the world trade rebound
 slowing 
these 
initial drivers 
lost relevance, but at the same 
time 
fiscal consolidation measures became an 
increasingly important factor 
in short
-term growth 
prospects. Since many of the underperformers 
also 

had 
larger consolidation needs, their economic 
growth slowed further. Moreover, some of the fast 

growers, for instance Germany, had more solid 
fiscal positions and benefited from low financing 
costs. 
These differences are aggravated by 
repercussions of the sovereign
-debt crisis on 
financing conditions 
in Member States.

2009-11 recovery, in particular as measured by

also observed in other regions

 3. THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONM
ENT
 An improving global environment â
 Although global economic growth has been 
negatively affected by uncertainties surrounding 
sovereign
-bond markets and weak demand in 
Europe la
st year, recent global economic 
developments reveal some encouraging signals. 

The US economy continued its solid growth in the 
last quarter of 2011, supported by improved
 labour 
market conditions and rising confidence. Most 
emerging market and developing e
conomies, 
though expected to grow slightly more slowly than 

last year, seem to be more resilient than three years 

ago, as more robust domestic demand partly 

offsets weaker export growth. But volatile and 
elevated oil prices put a strain on the world 
econom
y and pose a risk to global growth.
 According to preliminary estimates, annual growth 

of 
world GDP 
(excluding the EU)
 fell to 4.2% in 
2011 from 5.7% in 2010. In the third quarter of 

2011 global growth rebounded, led by the Japanâ¢s 

post
-disaster recovery an
d upbeat economic 
activity in the US. World growth decelerated in the 

last quarter of 2011 (to 0.5% q
-o-q) when positive 
developments in the US and China contrasted with 

weaker growth in most other regions, more 

adversely affected by the euro
-area sovereig
n-debt 
crisis and growing global stability concerns.
 Global trade
 growth decelerated substantially in 
2011 (from 14.9% to 5.6% according to CPB 

estimates), partly reflecting a return to a long
-term 
growth pattern. Simultaneously, such factors as: 

weakening
 economic activity in Europe, disasters 
in Japan and the flood in Thailand, and, to a lesser 
extent, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and 
North Africa, negatively affected global trade 

dynamics last year. Most recently trade momentum 

(3m
-on-3m movi
ng average) has been 
strengthening to 1.4% in February 2012 compared 

to 0.7% in January 2012.
 Looking ahead, high
-frequency global indicators 
are upbeat and suggest 
that 
the 
on-going
 recovery 
in the world economy 
will
 continue in the nearest 
future. The gl
obal all
-industry Purchasing 
Managersâ¢ Index (PMI) bottomed out in October 
2011, but 
expanded in early 2012. 
The latest 
reading points to less buoyant conditions, but 
the 
index 
has 
remained above the no
-growth threshold 
for both ma
nufacturing and service s
ectors.

 Against this background, non

expected to grow at an almost unchanged 4.1% in 
2012. At a disaggregated level, an improved 
economic outlook for the US and 
Japan is 
accompanied by a combination of unchanged 

forecasts and downward revisions in most other 

regions on the account of possibly stronger

up marginally 
to 4.3% from 4.2% in autumn. 
 â weighed down by fragile financial markets 
and volatile oil prices.
 Following a decline in the second half of 2011, 
most 
commodity prices
 returned to an upward path 
in early 2012, partly reflecting a more positive 

global outl
ook. Oil prices have been leading the 
rebound. The price of crude oil peaked at 

USD
 126/bbl in mid
-March (the highest since mid
-2008) and increased by some USD 16/bbl in the 

first quarter of 2012. The oil price hike has been 

both demand
- and supply
-driven 
(see Box I.1). 
While the gradual strengthening of the world 

economy since late 2011 has exerted a positive 

impact on oil demand, geopolitical tensions in 
some oil
-producing countries have sharply 
increased uncertainty and added markedly to price 
pressures.
 This is reflected in higher oil
-price 
assumptions than in the autumn forecast. Prices of 

other commodities have diverged from oil prices 

and stand markedly below the levels seen in the 
first half of 2011. On an annual basis they are 
assumed to decline gra
dually in 2012 and increase 

mildly in 2013.

   16    Box I.1: 
Oil-price increases and their macroeconomic impact on the EU economy
The increase in oil prices in 
the first months of 
2012
 has emerged as a significant downside 
risk to 
the global
 and the EU 
economic recovery
. Against 
this background, this box pr
esents the 
macroeconomic impact of rising oil prices on the 
basis of model simulations (
using the 
Commission's QUEST model).
 The price of 
crude 
oil 
peaked at

. in 
mid
-March (the highest since mid
-2008) and 
has 
risen by 
some 
USD
 16/bbl.
 in the fi
rst quarter of 
2012
. The assumption on oil prices in 2012 is 
12.6
% higher in this forecast 
than in
 last
 autumn (in 
US 
dollar 
terms). 
This increase reflects 
positive 
excess demand
 in 2010 and 2011
. Demand rose 
steadily in the second half of 2011
, driven by 
the 
US, Japan and most emerging economies. On the 
supply side, weakness in non
-OPEC output 
coincided with geopolitical tensions in many OPEC 
producers, including the recent political crisis 
related to Iran's nuclear programme. This sharply 
increased uncert
ainty regarding future supply and 
added to price pressures. However, the tight 
situation in oil markets may be easing gradually 
over the remainder of the year. The International 
Energy Agency estimates that production in 
Saudi 
Arabia,
 despite running at a 
30-year high,
 can still 
expand sustainably by about 12% (or roughly 6% 
of the total OPEC crude oil output) and non
-OPEC
 extraction should recover in the remainder of 
2012.

 additional revenue may in turn be invested abroad 
or lead to an increase 
in their imports. From the oil
-importing country's perspective, 
an increase in oil 
prices affect
s both
 the
 demand
- and 
the 
supply side 
of the economy. On the demand side, 
an increase in 
energy prices leads to a loss
 in real income
, as demand for energy is relatively inelastic
 in the 
short run. It also 
affects consumers' 
and firms' 
spending on goods and services other than energy. 
Supply
-side effects arise from the use of oil as an 
input factor in the production process. With limited 
short
-term substitution possibilities, an increase in 
the price of oil inputs increases pr
oduction costs 
and affect
s prices and output
.  The d
ependency of the EU economy on imported 
oil has increased
 over the last decade
. In 2009, net 
imports covere
d 84% of EU
 oil consumption 
compared to 
73% in 1999. Oil production in
 the EU 
decreased by 42% in
 the same
 period. Oil 
consumption and imports to the EU have slightly 
decreased, partially due to energy efficiency 
measures, but in spite of energy savings, 
the 
EU 
oil
-import bill increased considerably in the last 
decade due to higher oil prices.
 Net oil
 imports 
amounted to 
EUR 
275

 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   17 Non
-EU f
inancial markets
 remain fragile, highly 
influenced by EU developments. Benchmark 
yields across major advanced economies remain at 

low levels. Many Eastern European and candidate 
countries in p
articular are experiencing credit 
tightening as Western European banks reduce 
exposure to that region. Despite the improved 

liquidity situation in the euro area, disinvestments 

of foreign banks, including cutbacks in trade and 
project financing, repatriati
on of capital and profits 
as well as subsidiaries sell
-offs, remain an 
imminent risk for emerging economies.
 On the back of renewed concerns related to the 
European sovereign
-debt crisis, 
capital flows to 
emerging markets
 weakened considerably, putting 
dow
nward pressure on equity and exchange rates 
in those countries in late 2011. Exchange
-rate 
volatility has remained high since spring 2011 

amid a general flight to safety; most currencies in 
emerging markets have weakened considerably. 

On the other hand, e
xcessive demand for the 
Japanese and Swiss currency has led their 

respective central banks to respond in order to 
stem their rapid appreciation.
 The US and Japanese economies likely to 
rebound this year
 â Turning to non
-EU economies, following 
the 
weak 
per
formance of the 
US economy
 in the first half of 
2011, growth accelerated in the second half of the 
year, reflecting stronger private consumption, 
rising confidence, improving labour market 
conditions and positive stock
-market 
developments
. As a result, GDP
 growth
 for the 
year as a whole
 came in at 1.7%
. Looking ahead, 
the central scenario sees growth at 2.0% in 2012, 

0.5 pp. higher 
than in the 
autumn forecast. The 
upward revision stems partly from higher
-than
-Box (continued)
  energy production sectors.
(2) The model captures 
both supply and demand channels as energy serves 
as an input 
to the production process and is 
consumed directly by households.
 The 
scenario 
shows the impact of a severe disruption in oi
l production
 that 
leads to a persistent
 increase in the 
price of oil of 
USD 
20/bbl.
 Overall, demand
- and 
supply driven oil
-price increases have different 
macroeconomic impact.
 Oil
-price changes 
associated with higher global demand, the main 
driver behind 
in the last year, may have choked off 
some of the additional growth, but 
they 
are less 
adverse than sup
ply
-driven oil
-price increases.
(3) This supply shock has negative implications for 
growth in the EU. Output falls
 by 
0.4% in the first 
year and by a furth
er 
0.3% in the second year. 
Unemployment rises by 
0.3 pp. after two years 
while prices rise as costs of higher oil prices feed 
through into higher energy prices and raise costs 
for firms.
  This scenario assumes that monetary policy would 
respond as in "nor
mal times". At the current 
juncture, with interest rates close to their zero 
lower    bound,  monetary   policy   may   be   more

 accommodative to inflationary pressures and raise 
interest rates by less. Another crucial factor is the 
degree to which hi
gher energy prices lead to a 
wage
-price spiral. While automatic wage 
indexation schemes were a common feature in past 
decades, wage setting has become more

assumes 
that

 The 
econ

of oil

to be linear in the short run, as, 
given limited

price
 changes. But if oil prices were to increase 
dramatically, 
they
 would enter uncharted territory 
and
, if s

effects 
may turn out to be larger.
 While the table shows the average effect on growth 
in the EU as a whole, the macroeconomic impact of 
higher oil prices will differ across countries as oil
-dependency varies. 
 Oil

ducing countries with a 
smaller net oil

 The economic outlook is still largely 
overshadowed by the fragile state of the EU 

banking sec
tor. Despite the tentative stabilisation 
of bank
- and sovereign
-funding conditions in the 
first months of 2012, looming uncertainty about 

EU economic prospects and re
-sparked sovereign
-funding strains in some vulnerable Member States 

continue to weigh on f
inancial markets. In the 
short term, the adverse feedback loop between 

economic growth and budget consolidation has 

further taken its toll on sovereign
-bond markets 
and the nexus between sovereign
- and bank
-funding stress has lingered on.
 The Eurosystem's 
3-year longer
-term refinancing 
operations (LTROs) in December 2011 and 

February 2012 have averted the imminent threat of 

a credit crunch caused by banks' high redemption 

needs against the backdrop of very thin markets for 

bank bonds. The LTROs have conside
rably eased 
banks' liquidity and funding constraints and 
somewhat reduced tensions in sovereign
-debt 
markets. 
 In addition, a more dynamic global economic 
environment has supported a tentative rebound in 

asset markets. However, recently flared
-up stress 
in the sovereign
-funding markets of some Member 
States, reinforced by further sovereign 

downgrades, and the high volatility in global asset 

markets clearly demonstrate that conditions are 

still far from normal and that fickle financial 

markets are still pron
e to adverse market news and 
confidence shocks.
 Sovereign
-bond markets remain strained 
despite recent stabilisation â
 The sovereign
-bond yields of most euro
-area 
Member States declined considerably in the first 

months of 2012, supported to a large extent b
y the 
extraordinary liquidity injections by the 
Eurosystem, which have been partly used by 
Spanish and Italian banks in particular to increase 

bank holdings of domestic government bonds. 

Thus, yields continued the rather uniform decline 

that set in in late
 2011. But investors seem 
increasingly focused on differences across 
vulnerable Member States (see Graph 
I.8
). Economic developments at the aggregated level

operation carried out in end
-January 2012 together 
with the favourable troika review, was regarded as 
a positive sign that Ireland will be able to return to 

market financing. On the o
ther hand, Spanish 
sovereign yields have increased markedly over the 

past weeks on the back of a deteriorating economic 

outlook and concerns about public finances and the 

Spanish banking system. Italian sovereign yields 

have also risen recently, partly inf
luenced by 
developments in the Spanish bond market. In 

Portugal, yields peaked in late January 2012 amid 
speculation that sovereign debt might be subject to 
restructuring, but tensions have eased considerably 

since then. In these markets, the recent declin
e of 
German benchmark yields towards euro
-era record 
lows contributed to the widening of spreads.
 â while the rebound in equity markets has 
been only relatively short
-lived.
 Equity and corporate
-bond markets have gradually 
recovered over the last couple of
 months, 
supported by several successful sovereign
-bond 
auctions in Europe and an improvement in the 
international macroeconomic outlook, but the 

subsequent stock
-market rally has proved to be 
relatively short
-lived. Equities rallied from mid
-January 2012 
to the end of March, with banking 

shares among the best performers. However, risk 
sentiment was dented by renewed concerns about 
euro
-area and global prospects, and, as a 
consequence, global stock indices have lost 

ground. In Europe, the Eurostoxx50 only s
lightly 
exceeds its level at the end of last year, while the 

financial sub

developments suggest that firms may at least to 
some extent be able to substitute bond financing 
for bank lending. However, defa
ult risk has 
increased recently, as indicated by the renewed rise 

of the iTraxx indices since mid
-March.
 Bank funding conditions have eased since the 
beginning of 2012 â
 On the back of the LTROs and other non
-standard 
policy measures interbank market condi
tions have 
eased gradually since the start of this year. The 
three
-month Euribor fell below 0.75% from about 
1.60% in the autumn of 2011.
 The implied rate on 
Euribor futures contracts expiring in June dropped 

to 0.70%, on the expectation that abundant 

liqu
idity is likely to push Euribor rates further 
down. The 3
-month Euribor
-OIS (overnight index 
swaps) spread, a measure of banks' reluctance to 
lend to each other, narrowed quite significantly, to 
below 40 bps, down from almost 100 bps at the

 â but credit growth to the private sector 
remains subdued.
 In bank loans to the non
-financial sector, improved 
refinancing conditions have not yet translated in
to 
more robust credit growth (see Box I.2). However, 
recent data on loan developments in the euro area 

showed signs of stabilisation in January and 

February, albeit at low levels. The steep decline in 
lending at the end of 2011 had been mainly driven 
by a 
cutback on short
-term loans.  Loans to the 
non
-financial private sector rebounded in January 
and decreased only marginally in February, after 

having plummeted in December 2011. 

Notwithstanding banks' reduced funding strains, 
the annual growth rate of loans
 to non
-financial 
corporations and households has further 
moderat
ed in the first months of the year
 (see Graph

Besides the peripheral euro

Central and Eastern European (CEE) Member 

States may also be vulnerable to funding tensions 
in the euro area. For most countries in the
 CEE 
region the share of credit supply provided by euro
-area banking groups is significant, which makes 

their economies particularly sensitive to 

deleveraging decisions by parent entities.
 A recovery shaped by adverse credit 
conditions â
 The April 2012 ECB
 Bank Lending Survey (BLS) 
provided evidence of a substantially decreased net 
tightening of credit standards in the first quarter of 

2012, driven by lower funding pressures and 
reduced balance
-sheet constraints. Credit 
conditions tend to have improved more
 for small 
and medium
-sized than for larger companies. 
European banks expect a further decline in the net 
tightening of credit conditions in the coming 

months (see Graph 
I.12
). Credit standards are expected to be broadly neutral 
for non
-financial corporations in the second 
quarter at the euro
-area aggregate level, but 
heterogeneity across countries is likely to remain 
pronounced. Moreover, the uncertainty 

surrounding the European economic outlook and 

the EU banking system also see
ms to have 
impacted on credit conditions in countries outside 
the EU and on loans to non
-financial corporations 
with significant exposure to European economies, 
regardless of the location of the firm.

 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   21 â and subdued credit demand from the 
private sectorâ
 These adverse developments have fed the debate 
about a creditless recovery
(12) which is typically 
associated with preceding cr
edit booms, banking 
crises, and impaired financial intermediation. 

However, at the current juncture weak credit 

growth is also likely to be a demand
-side 
phenomenon. According to the recent Bank 
Lending Survey, loan demand from households 
and non
-financial
 corporations further substantially 
declined in the first quarter of 2012; it is expected 

to remain flat for loans to households, but to turn 

slightly positive for non
-financial corporations in 
the second quarter (see Graph 
I.12
). Although the 
process of balance
-sheet deleveraging by private 
non
-financial companies is already underway in 
some Member States, as indicated by the declining 

ratio of company loans to nominal GDP, on an 

aggregate basis the level of corporate indebtednes
s remains historically high.
(13) Households are also 
moving towards a stabilisation of their debt ratios 

which implies that, together with the current 

cyclical weakening in several euro
-area Member 
States, credit demand by the private household 

sector is li
kely to be subdued over the next 

quarters.
 âwhile the prospect of deleveraging is 
weighing on the banking sector.
 Even though the stability of the European banking 
sector has clearly improved and short
-term funding 
tensions have eased following the Eurosys
temâs 
liquidity injections, banks remain under pressure to 
strengthen their balance sheets in the face of a 
series of challenges. Most prominently, these 

challenges relate to structural funding imbalances 

and to stricter prudential requirements.
(14) In 
cont
rast to their US counterparts and partly due to 
each financial market's specific characteristics,
(15) European banks as a whole still have a marked 
                                                           (12) For a discussion on creditless recoveries, see Abiad

whilst US banks can sell some part of their

funding than banks in other jurisdictions. 

Therefore, concer
ns are being voiced that at least 
part of banks' balance
-sheet adjustments may be a 
result of a considerable deleveraging.
(16) Banks can 
reduce their leverage either by increasing their 

capital or by decreasing their holdings of (risky) 

assets, with fundame
ntally different economic 
consequences. The detrimental way of 

deleveraging would be through a severe reduction 

in credit supply.
(17) The main objective of the supervisory actions 

initiated so far in Europe is to increase the 
financial system's resistance t
o shocks by 
increasing capital ratios in conjunction with the 
longer
-term funding 
support provided either 
directly by the Eurosystem or indirectly through 

state guarantees
. While it may be true that banks 
are in the process of shedding non
-core assets with
 some impact on credit supply, at least in the short
-term, there is no clear
-cut evidence so far that an 
excessive or disorderly deleveraging process with 

disruptive consequences for the real economy
 has 
become imminent.
                                                            (16) For example, t
he IMF reckons that banks in Member States 
face substantial deleveraging over the next two years (see 
IMF, 
Global Financial Stability Report
, April 2012).
 (17) Not all asset reduction measures have the same economic 

impact. Unloading remain
ing toxic assets to make room in 
balance sheets for other activities or 
divestments
 reallocates risks to other players and may be positive to the 

economy.

At the end of 2011, slowing economic growth and 
adverse feedback loops
 between

 exacerbated vulnerabilities in 
the EU financial sector, r
esulting in the closure of

for banks

 As banks were under

 due to

 The 
main objective of the 
non

 monetary polic
y measures 
has
 been 
to ensure the proper functioning 
of the monetary policy transmission channel
. The 
ECB
 has focused its support on the banking sector
, given the central role it plays in financial 
intermediation 
and monetary policy transmission 
in 
the eur
o area.
 The liquidity provided by the LTROs to the 
banking sector has induced a significant expansion 
in bank reserves, which is expected to ultimately 
improve banks' capacity to provide loans to firms 
and households. Yet, it is still too early to 
fully 
assess the impact of the recent three
-year LTROs 
on credit flows to the real economy in the euro 
area, given that
 credit growth 
tends to re
spond 
to 
liquidity injections 
with 
some
 lag
, particularly in a 
still highly uncertain 
environment
. But 
the analysis 
of 
the
 various 
transmission 
channels
 through which 
non-standard measures 
are likely to
 affect overall 
financial conditions (e.g. interest rates and asset 
prices
, risk premia and 
banks' 
liquidity conditions
 and 
balance
-sheet composition)
, could provide 
tentati
ve evidence on the positive effects of 
LTROs.
(2) In fact, s
everal 
financial 
indicators 
suggest that 
there 
was 
a significant improvement 
in the 
functioning of some financial market segments 
following the LTROs
. Banks'
 funding
 strains 
eased 
considerably
, as 
central bank 
financing
 compensated for banks' 
disrupted
 access to 
wholesale or interbank 
markets 
(liquidity channel).
 In addition, t
he LTROs
 decreased
 the liquidity 
premium of 
holding the safest

in the face of tightening mar

 conditions. 
They

credit growth is likely to be limited in the medium 
term.
(3) According to the ECB
's April 2012 Bank 
Lending Survey (BLS), the net tightening of credit 
standards by euro
-area banks 
to 
non
-financial 
corporations and 
households 
declined substantially
 in the first quarter of 2012. Looking ahead, euro
-area banks expect a 
slight
 further 
decline in net 
tightening in credit standards for loans to non
-financial co
rporations
 and a broadly unchanged 
level for consumer credit.

 However
, conditions in some euro
-area financial 
market segments have not yet fully normalised. 
Interbank market trading volumes 
still
 remain 
subdued, with some banks relying exclusively on 
Eurosystem liquidity. Securitisation markets 
remain weak
, as some segments of sovereign and 
private 
bond markets 
are still
 impaired. As
 the 
recent increase
s in sovereign
-bond spreads in 
several euro
-area Member States and equity market 
declines have clearly demonstrated, 
the LTROs are 
no panacea for the resolution of the sovereign
-debt 
crisis and 
the 
str
uctural problems in the banking 
sector. On the contrary, 
reducing 
some banks'
 dependency o
n central bank financing 
and the 
weakening of the interlinkages between 
Member 
States' 
weak public finances and vulnerable 
banking sectors 
will require significant 
restructuring efforts
 and
 public finances 
that 
are 
kept 
on a sustainable track.
 Turning to the policy risks, there are concerns that 
the 
ECB
's non
-standard 
measures may contribute to 
reducing the incentive for banks to strengthen their 
balance sheets
, which 
might support credit 
flows 
in 
the 
very 
short
-term, but 
which is likely to imply 
constrained lending 
further 
down the road. The 
question of the "exit strategy" from the substantial 
LTRO funding at the three
-year horizon (or earlier, 
thanks to the flexibilit
y foreseen for early 
repayment) and the return to market financing (also 
with longer maturities) will need to be addressed. 
Besides, the current low interest rate environment, 
a weak business cycle, and depressed collateral 
values 
may 
lead some banks
 to postpone loss 
recognition
, thus constraining lending 
potentially 
even further
 if interest rates rise or 
if 
macroeconomic conditions 
continue to 
deteriorate
. Notwithstanding the positive effects
 of LTROs
, bank 
loan
 supply to the private 
non-financial 
sector 
depends on a range of factors
, including 
risks and 
returns, access to market finance and 
the fulfil
ment 
of regulatory requirements
. This 
raises the question 
of 
whether recent 
shifts
 in banks
' funding 
composition
s towards
 higher 
dependence
 on central 
bank li

will impact 
on the credit

   24 On-going deleveraging operations and 
recapitalisation efforts by banks have already 
reduced the scope of the necessary balanc
e-sheet 
adjustment
 to some extent. In the same vein, recent 
assessments by the ECB
(18) and the European 
Banking Authority (EBA)
(19) suggest that further 
balance
-sheet adjustments will predominantly 
occur via recapitalisation and that the necessary 

remaining 
deleveraging would be rather smooth, 
with only a limited risk of disruptive cutbacks on 

loans to the private sector.
 Furthermore, the impact on growth will also 

depend on companies' ability to substitute other 

sources of financing for bank loans. Several l
arge 
non
-financial corporations still have at their 
disposal substantial unused credit lines and cash 

cushions created since the 2008
-09 liquidity 
shortage and they are increasingly able to tap the 

bond markets directly given that their credit ratings 

are 
in some cases even more favourable than those 
of their lenders. However, the fact that corporate
-bond issuance is still a relatively limited source of 

overall corporate funding in the EU and the strong 
reliance of small and medium
-sized enterprises on 
bank
 lending highlight the stability and strength of 
the banking sector as an important precondition for 
a self
-sustained recovery.
 5. THE EU ECONOMY
 From a mild recession â
 On the back of a number of shocks in 2011, the EU 

economy entered a period of contract
ion at the end 
of 2011. The sharp increase in oil prices, a 

slowdown in the world economy, and, last but not 
least, the negative impact of the escalation of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis in several Member States 
resulted in a sharp deterioration of the economi
c situation towards the end of 2011. The shocks took 

their toll in an environment of bank deleveraging 
and fiscal tightening. With negative real GDP 
growth rates in both the EU and the euro area (see 
                                                           (18) ECB, Common equity capital, banks

in aggregate, the shortfalls are expected to be

an additional 26% of the capital surplu

 primarily through direct capital measures (i.e. capital 
raising, retained earnings and conversion of hybrids to 
common equity), while changes to risk

account for 23% of the capital improvement. The measures 
are viewed as h

Real GDP, EU without euro area
 While the first quarter of 2011 saw by far the 

strongest economic growth in the EU and the euro 

area since the downturn in 2008
-09, the EU 
economy slipped closer to recession in the second 
half of the year and finally GDP finally contracted 

in the fourth quarter (by 0.3% q
-o-q in both areas). 
It was the first output decline since mid
-2009. Since the transition from recovery to recession 

took pla
ce over the course of the year, in 2011 as a 
whole, real GDP still grew by 1.5% in both the EU 

and the euro area.
 The breakdown of GDP by demand components 

indicates that the contraction in the fourth quarter 

was driven by weak domestic demand and changes 

in inventories, whereas net exports made a positive 

contribution (see Graph 
I.16
). Domestic demand 
became a more apparent drag on growth as a result

    26 Survey data in the first quarter of 2012 pointed to 
some stabilisation in economic activity at a low 

level, while distinct signs of a recovery were still 

missing.
  The 
Economic Sentiment Indicator
 (ESI) 
stabilised in the first quarter of 2
012, but 
remained below its long
-term average. Up to 
April, the decline in the ESI unwound gains in 
the preceding months. In particular, industry 
sentiment deteriorated in April, declining in the 

EU and the euro area to the lowest levels since 

the Great Re
cession. Services sentiment had 

been slightly more resilient as the sector is less 

sensitive to cyclical factors.
  The 
PMI Composite Output index
 improved in 
the first quarter in the EU (from 48.1 to 50.7) 

and in the euro area (from 47.2 to 49.6), but 
remai
ned close to the no
-growth threshold with 
substantial differences across countries. And 
within the first quarter the strongest increase 

and the highest readings were recorded in 
January, suggesting that purchasing managers 
had been slightly overoptimistic 
about the 

rebound at the turn of the year. This view was 

confirmed by the deterioration that followed up 

to April, signalling deeper contraction in 

business activity in the second quarter.

  In 
April
 2012, the 
National Bank of Belgium's 
business barometer
, which has in the past 
anticipated euro
-area developments rather well, 
dipped
 slightly 
for the second
 consecutive 
month. 
 Overall and independent of small 
and mostly 

temporary differences in indicators, the short
-term 
outlook for domestic demand does not look 

promising. The most recent readings have 
attenuated expectations that improvements in early 
2012 could start to lift the economy back to 

recovery. Unce
rtainty remains high, motivating 

consumers and investors to postpone spending 

decisions. In addition, the weak labour market 

conditions and unfavourable developments in real 
incomes do not bode well for an expansion. With 
the quarterly profile of GDP growt
h in 2011 giving 

a carry
-over of 0.0% in the EU and 
-0.2% in the 
Economic developments at the aggregated level
   27 euro there is also no support from last year's 
economic growth. All in all, EU GDP is expected 

to stagnate in 2012, while output in the euro area is 

forecast to shrink (
-0.3%). 
 â heading tow
ards a slow recovery â
 In the second half of 2012, important policy 

decisions in the euro area that have already helped 

to avoid a sharp decline in economic activity in the 

past months, should help to further restore 
consumer and investor confidence. The a
ssumed 
gradual return of confidence can be expected to 

exert an increasingly positive impact on private 

domestic demand. Credible fiscal consolidation 

measures and structural reforms should support 

this development. And the moderation in 
commodity prices, 
lowering inflationary pressures 
is forecast to impact positively on real incomes. 

Investment could benefit from very low long
-term 
interest rates. Given that many spending decisions 

have been postponed in recent months, these forces 

should be strong enough
 to result in a rebound of 
economic activity in the second half of 2012 in 

both the EU and the euro area.
 â and subpar economic growth in 2013...
 Rebounding domestic demand and, to a gradually 

decreasing extent, support from the external side 

are expected 
to stimulate economic activity in the 

EU and the euro area in late 2012 and 2013. 
Increased economic confidence and higher real 
disposable incomes are expected to be the driving 

forces behind the rebound in private consumption. 

The improved outlook for dem
and and increased 
investor confidence should also push equipment 

investment. In addition, the realisation of delayed 
investment projects from times of elevated 
uncertainty and relatively favourable financing 

conditions exert positive influence on gross fix
ed 
capital formation. Overall, it is expected to grow 

more strongly in 2013 than in any of the preceding 

recovery years, while private consumption is 
forecast to grow nearly as strongly as in 2010, the 
year with the highest growth rate since 2007.
 Once eco
nomic activity gets traction, the labour 
market situation should stabilise, but given the 

lagged response of job creation to output 
developments, a more substantial improvement in 
employment can only be expected for the end of 

the forecast period. This mod
est improvement 
corresponds to the projection of rather subdued 

economic growth towards the end of the forecast 
horizon. In 2013, at growth rates of about 1Â¼% in 
the EU and 1% in the euro area, the recovery of 
GDP is expected to be very similar to the one 
that 

followed the recession in 2008
-09. The fact that 
even these moderate growth rates would benefit 
from a positive carry
-over from 2012 (0.3 pp. in 
the EU, 0.1 in the euro area) illustrates how 
subdued the growth dynamics are.
 Recent experience of failed
 hopes of broadening 
and strengthening of the 2009
-11 recovery raises 
the question as to whether the expected recovery 

will be more sustainable this time. Past evidence 

suggests that for a recovery to become sustained, a 

transition is necessary from the ac
tual triggers of 

the initial upswing into more permanent growth 

drivers, in particular among the domestic demand 
components. In that respect, the interaction of 
strengthening private consumption and recovering 

gross fixed capital formation is expected to b
e a 

key mechanism in the dynamics of the recovery. 

Its characteristics will depend on the degree of 

stabilisation and improvement in the labour 

market, which itself hinges on improvements in the 

functioning of European labour markets. Recent 
and planned st
ructural reforms
(20) appear to 
provide more solid foundations for such 
developments and thus for a more sustainable 

recovery than three years ago.
 â with macroeconomic cross
-country 
differences persisting.
 No Member State has been immune to the shocks 

that 
hit the EU economy, but some have proven 
more resilient. And, not surprisingly, most of the 

countries that had already performed better during 
the recovery remained the strongest.

      28 Therefore those countries that had contributed 
massively to GDP growth in the EU during the 

upturn, in particular Germany, the UK, Poland and 

France, are expected to remain key contributors 
(see Graph 
I.19
), while some, pa
rticularly Italy and 
Spain, are expected to deliver negative 

contributions in 2012.
 Cross
-country growth differences were one of the 
key features of the recovery in 2009
-11. They were 
caused, inter alia, by diverse starting positions in 
terms of private in
debtedness,
(21) bursting asset 
price bubbles (housing market), banking sector 

health, and the solidity of public finances. But 

competitiveness and export structures (product 
composition, export destination) also played a role. 
And, following the trade colla
pse of 2008, the 
strong rebound in world trade impacted differently 

on countries, allowing those with export
-oriented 
economies and strong competitiveness to grow 

faster than others. As a result, only the fastest
-growing countries, for instance Sweden, Pol
and 
and Germany, were able by 2011 to reach output 
levels above those of the pre
-crisis period.
 In the near term, substantial differences are 
expected to persist across Member States. Leading 

indicators, such as the ESI and the PMI, support 

this view (see 
Graph 
I.20
). Most countries 
recorded declines in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 
a rebound in the first quarter of 2012. But in the 
euro area, only a few countries were markedly 

above the no
-growth threshold.

deteriorated again in the second half of 2011. 

Compared to the first half of the year it stagnated 

in the EU (0.1%) and declined in the euro area 

(-0.5%). Uncertainty acted as a major drag on 
investment decisio
ns. Other downside factors were 
declining capacity utilisation, meagre profit 

developments, tight credit conditions, and 

companies' deleveraging. The breakdown of 

investment indicates that mainly equipment 

investment weakened in the second half of 2011, 

whereas construction investment has remained on 
the weak side already since the onset of the crisis.
 â with equipment investment mirroring the 
overall economic situation â
 Equipment investment, which accounts for roughly 
one third in gross fixed capital form
ation, had 
rebounded strongly after the 2008
-09 recession, 
but slowed in 2011 due to weaker current and 
expected demand. Overall, the investment cycle of 
the 2009
-11 recovery was rather short and 
moderate.
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   29 In early 2012, the near
-term outlook for equipment 
investment 
is weak 
since 
companies have lowered 
their production expectations in line with falling 
capacity utilisation
 (see Graph 
I.22
); u
ncertainty, 
albeit at a s
lightly lower level, remains a 
substantial drag to investment decisions. 

Moreover, s
lowing activity put
s pressure on profits 
and reduces margins, indicated by changes in the 

ratio of the GDP deflator and unit labour costs
. In 
addition, in several Member St
ates equipment 
investment is still influenced by tightened 
financing conditions and companies' deleveraging. 

The impact of bank deleveraging on companiesâ¢ 

financing of equipment investment depends on the 

availability of other funding options, such as 

corpo
rate bonds.

 Overall, housing investment is expected to shrink

 The slowdo

then, the inventory cycle had broadly followed

inventories had negatively
 contributed to economic 
growth since companies lowered stocks amid a

conditions. With the start of the recovery, growth 

in domestic demand benefitted from a temporary

1.00.80.4         Economic developments at the aggregated level
   31 investment for the current period of weak 
economic 
activity is that stocks were already 
relatively low when growth slowed in mid
-2011. 
The adjustment towards lower warranted levels 
can therefore be expected to matter mainly for the 
build
-up of stocks. This view is corroborated by 
results from the Commissio
n surveys. The 
assessment of stocks in industry rose in the second 

half of 2011, but has already fallen in the first 

quarter of 2012. In terms of national account data, 

the negative contribution of inventories is therefore 

expected to be rather small in 20
12 in both the EU 
and the euro area.
 Private consumption, currently restrained by 
weak disposable incomes, â
 Private consumption, the largest GDP component, 
had been one of the key drivers in the initial phases 

of the 2009
-11 recovery in the EU and the eur
o area. In 2010, the annual rate of growth stood at 

around 1% in both areas, but in 2011 th

A key reason for weak consumption growth has 

been the large squeeze on real gross
 disposable 
incomes (see Graph 
I.25
), attributable to muted 
growth in compensations alongside high inflation.
  On the nominal side, growth in 
compensation 

was held down in 2011 by a slowdown in 

employment growth. The recent deteri
oration 
in labour market conditions resulted in 
shrinking employment and more moderate 

increases in compensation per employee than 

previously expected. Moreover, 
transfers
 declined against the background of
 intensified 
fiscal consolidation. 
Non
-labour inco
mes
, which include profit income, continued on their 

upward trend but growth was less dynamic tha
n at the onset of the recovery.
  The 
purchasing power
 of nominal incomes was 
curtailed by the direct and indirect impact of 

last year's increases in food and en
ergy prices. 
This cut out a substantial amount of nominal 
increases so that real disposable incomes 
almost stagnated.

  Private wealth
 remained constrained by weak 
financi
al and housing market developments 
after the 
financial crisis
 had wiped out a 
substantial part of the net worth of debtors. 
This resulted in tight borrowing constraints and 
lower liquidity, which forced some households 

to cut back on consumption. This cons
umption 
channel of financial crises had particularly 

strong negative effects in countries with highly 

leveraged households. The decline in interest 
rates in the second half of 2011 lowered the 
costs of servicing this debt, but the willingness 

of households
 to take on debt remains limited
. Developments in the saving rates of households 

are another key determinant of private 
consumption growth. Increased uncertainty can be 
expected to have raised precautionary 
savings
 by 
households.
(23) Via this channel, the e
scalation of 
the euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis in 2011 
impacted negatively on consumers' spending 

patterns. Changes in income distribution may have 
been another factor pushing up the average 
household saving rate. Recent evidence of a more 
                                                           (23) Analyses conducted for the Great Recession provided 
evidence of this feature, see e.g. Mody, A., F. Ohnsorge

   32 unequal income
 distribution in the EU

 ... and deliver stronger contributions to GDP 
growth in late 2012 a
nd 2013.
 Further on, private consumption is expected to 
benefit from growing real disposable incomes and 

consumer confidence. With labour market 

conditions stabilising and nominal compensation 
increasing moderately, nominal disposable income 
growth should 
return to positive territory in 2013. 

The moderation in HICP inflation should lift 

households' purchasing power and real disposable 

income. To what extent this will translate into a 

strengthening of private consumption growth 
depends, among others, on the 
spending patterns of 
households engaged in deleveraging processes. 

Increases in taxes and cuts in public expenditure 

may slow the reduction of the debt overhang. In 

2013, the saving rate is expected to remain broadly 

unchanged in the EU and the euro area. 
Thus, the 

stimulus to spending would mainly come from a 

moderation in consumer
-price inflation and its 
impact on real incomes. Overall, in 2013, private 
consumption is expected to rebound moderately.
 The weakness in aggregate private consumption in 
the EU 
conceals 
substantial cross
-country 
differen
ces. A
mong the largest Member States, 
Germany, France, Poland and the UK are expected 
to record above
-average growth rates in 2012
-13, 
whereas in other countries private consumption is 
set to shrink (Spain, Italy,
 and the Netherlands). In 
2013, an increase in the growth rate of private 

consumption is expected in all Member States 

except Denmark, Estonia and Finland.
 â whereas public consumption remains weak.
 In line with fiscal consolidation, public 

consumption is 
forecast to decrease in most 
Member States. In 2011, consolidation efforts had 

already pulled down public consumption to slight 
contraction in the EU and in the euro area. In the 
euro area, the three programme countries as well 

as Cyprus, Slovakia and Spai
n recorded declines of 
more than 2 pps. 
 Over the forecast horizon, enhanced fiscal 
consolidation efforts are expected to lower 
government consumption (
-0.8% in the euro area 
and 
-0.5% in the EU in 2012). In 2013, 
government consumption is expected to cont
inue
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   33 to fall
 modestly in the EU at an annual rate of 
0.1% and to stagnate in the euro area. This forecast 
for 2013 should be seen against the background of 

the no
-policy
-change assumption, which could 
imply that a number of consolidation measures are 

not y
et factored into this forecast as they do not
 yet 
meet the conditions for being fully accounted for. 

The impact of fiscal retrenchment on economic 

growth will depend on a number of factors, 

particularly on the composition of expenditure 

cuts, their impact 
on consumer confidence and the 

response of monetary policy (se
e Box I.4
).(26) Positive growth contributions from net exports 
in 2011 and over the forecast horizon â
 In 2011, with the growth of exports exceeding that 
of imports, net trade contributed positiv
ely to 
economic growth in the EU and the euro area. The 

normalisation of world trade growth after the 

extraordinary preceding year and the slowing in 

world output growth lowered export growth, but 
the deterioration in the economic situation in the 
EU, in p
articular the weakening of domestic 
demand, weighed strongly on imports. Over the 

forecast horizon, the outlook for the export and 

import growth of goods and services implies a 

continuation of positive growth contributions of 
net trade.
 â as exports grow s
olidly â 
 In 2011, growth rates of goods and services 
exports almost halved in both the EU and the euro 

area. Market shares increased for a second 

consecutive year, with the weaker euro lending 
support to price competitiveness of euro
-area 
exporters.
 Surve
y indicators (see Graph 
I.27
) point to 
improvements in the short
-term outlook for EU 
exports. But continued bank deleveraging puts 
trade finance at risk.

                                                           (26) While monetary policy close to the zero bound may 
suggest relatively large multipliers (se

determinant of exports during the crisis, see e.g. Amiti, M.

 To wh
at extent Member States share this 
development depends on their geographical and 

product specialisations, as well as on their 
competitive position. In countries where exports 
are directed in a large part towards emerging 

markets, the negative impact of the
 slowing of 
world trade had already been less severe given the 

relatively robust output growth in the emerging 

economies. These countries are also expected to 
benefit from the expected rebound in global trade, 
in particular as their exports of capital good
s, 
usually increase strongly during upturns in 

destination countries. In addition, those Member 

States that have recently gained price 

competitiveness are expected to exhibit relatively 

strong export growth. A different situation prevails 

in economies that
 depend largely on intra
-EU and 
intra
-euro
-area trade. Export markets of these 
countries have been massively affected by the 

worsening of the economic situation in the EU.

(28) ... while import growth is slowed by the 
weakening in domestic demand.
 The weakening of economic activity in 
the EU and 
shrinking private consumption volumes have left 

their mark on the European import statistics for 

2011. The moderation in export growth also 
implied a decline in imported inputs. Other key 
determinants were import prices, which had 

increased stro
ngly in the first half of 2011. 
Moreover, in the second half of the year the 

depreciation of the euro in nominal effective terms 

weighed on import volumes. Overall, the terms of 
trade deteriorated markedly in 2011. Compared to 
the exceptional year of the w
orld trade rebound in 
2010, growth rates fell by about 6 percentage 

points in both the EU and in the euro area. 
 The short
-term prospects for EU imports are 
restrained by weak domestic demand, in particular 
stagnating or even shrinking gross fixed capital 

formation and private consumption. This pattern is 
in line with past evidence of EU imports lagging 
behind exports. As economic growth stabilises in 

2013, albeit at subdued rates, domestic demand 

components are expected to become more dynamic 

inducing addi
tional imports.
 EU and euro
-area current accounts almost in 
balance â
 The trade balances of the euro area and the EU 

were massively affected by the increase in import 

prices in 2011. In both areas the balance shrank, 

falling to 
-Â½% of GDP in the EU and to 
Â½% in the 
euro area. The effect on the external balance was 

partially offset by a larger surplus in the services 

balance, which widened the total surplus in the 

external balance of both areas. Overall, the current 

account moved closer to balance in 2011.

 Compared to the pre

Looking at more recent developments, m
any of

Among these

The adjustment has been particularly strong where

en very large at the start of the crisis
 (see Graph

of competitiveness in deficit countries 
tends to 

support th

largest declines in r

seen in

Germany, are 
moving in the opposite direction
, recording 
increasing relative unit labour costs. 
 The increased consoli
dation efforts in EU Member 
States can also be expected to have exerted an 
impact on current accounts both inside and outside 

the euro area. Fiscal consolidation impacts on the 

current account via its effects on gross fixed 

capital formation and on the rea
l effective 
exchange rate. In that respect, fiscal consolidation 
efforts contribute to the lowering of external 
imbalances in deficit countries.

 The pre

diverging trends in 
the external positions 
of 
Member States. Those starting from lower per

t larger net 
foreign capital inflows, but wider macroeconomic 
imbalances also emerged that went beyond 
standard convergence processes. 
These were driven 
by low real interest rates, 
booming credit growth, 
losses in competitiveness
 and
 excessive income

large current

in

cases.

the

But some 
differences are apparent in the timing of the labour

adjusters

record a 
pronounced slowing in compensation growth in 
2009, while for the late deficit adjusters this only 
occurred in 2010. 
Additionally,
 it appears that in

 REER depreciation.
 Sectoral
 drivers of adjustment
 The adjustment 
has 
since 2008 
mostly 
been driven 
by the private sector. In deficit count
ries
, the re
-appraisal of risks and more difficult access to credit 
has 
triggered 
pronounced 
balance
-sheet 
adjustment
s in the 
corporate sector
. Corporations in 
deficit countries have increased corporate savings 
and cut investment to improve their balance sheets. 
As a result, corporate investment in these countries 
remains depressed (Graph
 9). The 
situation is 
particularly worrying in the 
late deficit adjusters
 where investment levels are now significantly 
below historical averages, with negative 
consequences for these countries' potential growth.

forecast
 On the household side, balance
-sheet adjustment in
 deficit countries has been achieved primarily via 
cuts in investment rather than by rises in savings. 
Considering that household investment is mainly in 
housing and that many of these countries went 
through a period of overshooting in residential 
investme
nt in pre
-crisis years, this development 
may be seen as positive.
 Overall, adjustment in the private sector has
 been 
associated with a substantial rise in 
private sector 
net lending
. For most late deficit adjusters
, some 
additional (though modest) gains in
 private sector 
net lending should contribute to reduce current
-account deficits further over the forecast horizon. 
In surplus countries, private sector net lending 
increased in the early stages of the crisis
, but has 
since eased back moderately, reflectin
g more 
limited balance sheet adjustment needs; this trend 
is forecast to continue in 2012
-13, contributing to a 
reduction in current
-account surpluses. Households' 
net lending in deficit countries is projected to 
decrease som
ewhat over the forecast period.
 The contribution of the public sector to external 
rebalancing has so far been modest, starting only 
after 2010 as a result of a relatively stronger public 
finance consolidation in deficit countries.
 Overall assessment
 In summary,
 the analysis suggests tha
t considerable
 rebalancing of external positions has taken place in 
recent years 
within the EU 
and that the trend is 
likely to continue over the forecast horizon, though 
at an overall moderate
 pace. 
In particular,
 'late 
deficit 
adjuster
s' are not expected 
to have
 the
ir rebalancing process 
completed 
at the end of the 
forecast period. The adjustment 
of external 
imbalances 
was initially driven by 
the 
balance
-sheet adjustment in the private sector of deficit 
countries
, with a particularly sharp and rapid 
correc
tion in some Member States, mostly outside 
the euro area. There is now evidence that some 
surplus countries have begun to contri
bute to the 
rebalancing as well
, although 
falls in current
-account surpluses 
should remain relatively 
limited 
in 
2012
-13.
 Given 
that 
current accounts tend to be strongly 
affected by cyclical fluctuations
, it is difficult to
 disentangl
e their structural and cyclic
al drivers. 
However, a
 number of factors
 suggest that at least 
part of the observed rebalancing is of a more 
structural n
ature and therefore 
relatively persistent
. First
ly, needs in terms of public sector 
consolidation are generally higher in deficit than in 
surplus countries. Differentiated consolidation 
path
s will continue to be a bigger constraint on net 
borrowing
 in the 
former than in the latter in the 
years to come, contributing to the persistence of the 
rebalancing. 
 Second
ly, the on
-going balance
-sheet adjustment 
processes in the private sectors of deficit countries 
is at least partly driven by a change in risk attitud
es 
and a reassessment of growth prospects in the 
countries concerned. Given the high level of 
external liabilities in most of these countries, 
market pressure for rebalancing should remain high 
in the years to come and a reversal of the balance
-sheet adjus
tment appears unlikely.
 Third
ly, adjustment in deficit countries has been in 
part achieved by cutting housing investment. To the 
extent that this cut is a correction to the 
overshooting in investment observed in pre
-crisis 
years, it is both a welcome and 
possibly
 lasting 
development. 
 Finally, there is some evidence that the current
-account rebalancing is underpinned by changes in 
relative prices and competitiveness positions
 as 
well as gains in 
export 
market shares and 
expenditure switching in deficit coun
tries
. These 
changes 
are expected to 
contribute to a rebalancing 
of supply and demand in the countries concerned 
and therefore make the external 
adjustment 
more 
sustainable.
    Economic developments at the aggregated level
   39 Looking ahead, the outlook for moderate 
economic 
growth suggest
s that import demand will remain
 rather weak in the EU Member States
. All Member 
States with positive import growth in 2011 (except 
Finland and the UK) are expected to record lower 
growth rates of imports of goods and services in 
2012. This supports countries with external deficits 
on their path of rebalancing. In that reg
ard, cyclical 

reasons have become an important driver of 

rebalancing in the short
- to medium term
.(30) The 
current
-account forecasts for 2012 and 2013 point 
to an 
on-going
 adjustment of intra
-EU current
-account imbalances
. In several Member States outside t
he euro area, 
exchange rates are the key to rebalancing the 

economies away from housing and consumption 

towards industry and exports. However, the 

structural change that this transition requires is 

taking time.
(31) The labour market situation has recently 
deteriorated...
 Current labour market developments reflect both 
the heritage of the 2008
-09 recession and the 
stagnation of 2011
-12. Improvements during the 
early stages of the 2009
-11 recovery had been 
limited, mirroring the exceptional resilience of 

Europ
ean labour markets during the downturn in 
2008-09. Since companies had adjusted their 
labour input by reducing the number of hours 

worked per employee rather than cutting 

headcounts, the expansion first saw a 
normalisation in terms of working hours but no 
or 
only marginal employment growth. The deviation 

from the standard relationship between changes in 

economic growth and unemployment, often 

referred to as Okun's Law, implied that more 

economic growth than usual was needed to lower 
the unemployment rate. L
ittle progress was 
therefore made in terms of job creation when the 
economic situation started to deteriorate in the 

second half of last year.
                                                            (30) This current

-crisis
 patterns as for instance described in Schmitz, B. and

integration in the euro area, 
Journal of International Money 
and Finance
, December 2011, Vol. 30, No. 8, pp. 1676
-95.
 (31) Moreover, empirical stud
ies suggest that the 
responsiveness of exports and imports has declined over 

time, see e.g. Dong, W., The role of expenditure switching 
in the global imbalance adjustment, 
Journal of 
International Economics
, March 2012, Vol. 86, No. 2, pp. 
237
-51.
 Employment fell in the third and fourth quarter of 
2011, in the EU and in the euro area. In parallel, 

unemploymen
t has increased. In February 2012 the 

unemployment rate stood at 10.2% in the EU and 
10.8% in the euro area, which was about Â¾ pp. 
higher than a year ago and the highest since the 
introduction of the euro in 1999.
 ... and future improvements hinge on the
 strength and timing of the recovery â
 Forward
-looking labour market indicators suggest 
that the near
-term outlook for the labour market is 
rather weak, as the return to recession is exerting 
significant upward pressure on the unemployment 
rate. And the unce
rtainty surrounding the 
economic outlook is making companies reluctant 

to reverse layoffs. Accordingly, in the Commission 

surveys, employment expectations in the EU 

industry and services sectors declined towards the 

end of 2011 and remained at low levels i
n the first 
quarter of 2012 (see Graph 
I.29
). Consumers' 
unemployment fears have increased and continue 
to exceed long
-term averages. The PMI 
employment index, standing below the 50
-point 
threshold in the first three months of 20
12, 
confirms this picture for the EU and the euro area. 
What further weighs on prospects for employment 

is the limited scope for the kind of supportive 

policy measures that upheld the EU labour market 
during the previous downturn. In addition, public
-secto
r employment may be reduced in some 
Member States.

 Overall, the deterioration in the economic outlook 
results in downward revisions to the labour market 

forecasts for 2012. E
mployment is now expected 
to shrink in the EU (
-0.2%) and the euro area 
(-0.5%), while the unemployment rate is expected 
to increase markedly in both areas (compared with 
European Econom
ic Forecast, Spring 2012
   40 2011 by 0.6 pp. to 10.3% in the EU and by 0.8 pp. 
to 11.0% in the euro area).
 Further on, the expected rebound in economic 
activity should help to stabilise the labour market 
situation. Due to the usual lag of responses in 

employment to changes in economic activi
ty, 
however, it will take time to see any improvements 

in the labour market. The situation is also expected 

to benefit increasingly from reform efforts, which 
have been undertaken in several parts of the EU.
 They should become effective with the kind of 
time lag already seen in countries, which had 
already undertaken such measures some time ago.
 Overall, in 2013 employment is forecast to 

increase moderately in the EU and to stabilise in 
the euro area. As a result the upward trend in 
unemployment rates is ex
pected to be broken in 

the EU and the euro area.
 ... and will thus be unequally distributed across 
Member States by size and over time.
 Substantial differences persist across Member 
States, both in terms of job creation and 

unemployment rates. While two co
untries entered 
2012 with unemployment rates above 20% (Spain 
and Greece), two others recorded rates below 5% 
(Austria and the Netherlands). As regards changes 

over the past 12 months, the largest increases were 

faced by Greece (6.1 pps.), Spain (3.0 pps.)
, Cyprus (3.0 pps.) and Portugal (2.7 pps.) and the 

largest declines in Lithuania (
-1.7 pps.) and Latvia 
(-2.0 pps.).
 The comparison of national unemployment rates 

points to increasing cross
-country differences. The 
spread between unemployment rates of the
 top 
half, i.e. those 50% of the population living in 
areas with the highest unemployment rates, and the 

bottom half, i.e. those facing the lowest rates, has 
increased since the start of the economic and 
financial crisis (the blue line in Graph

 The reasons for these differences are manifold. In 

several Member States, problems that had been 

building for many years were amplified by the 

recession of 20
08-09. Thus, labour markets in the 
EU exhibit a high degree of diversity, which not 
only reflects the asymmetric effects of the crisis 
and different constraints for the financial sector 

and fiscal policy, but also cross
-country 
differences in the sectoral 
composition of past 
employment losses and different institutional 

settings.

   Economic developments at the aggregated level
   41 In general, the countries hit by the bursting of 
housing bubbles and/or 
where adjustment needs 
are amplified by 
external and fiscal imbalances are 

those where job losses were th
e most severe. The 
deterioration in labour market conditions caused 

by the 
2008-09 recession 
had been 
particularly 
severe in the Baltic countries, Spain and Ireland
, where the construction sector made a significant 

contribution to peak
-to-trough employment
 losses
. In particular, unemployment 
has 
persist
ed in 
countries facing large structural adjustments 

associated with
 a reduction
 in the size of
 non
-tradable sectors, such as construction, real 
estate and the financial sector.
 The 2009
-11 recovery
 has helped
 to reduce labour 
market problems, but due to different recovery 

speeds there have been substantial differences in 

unemployment rate falls since the recession. 

Overall, t
he recovery has not been vigorous 

enough 
to rebuild 
employment
, so that most 
countries
, particularly those with less flexible 
labour markets,
(33) entered the current recession in 
rather weak shape.
 In 2012, the weak economic performance is 
expected to slow employment growth in all 
Member States that had recorded expansion in 

2011, except Hun
gary, Romania, and the UK. In 

more than half of the Member States the 

unemployment rate is forecast to increase in 2012, 

with eight Member States recording an increase 
of 
more than Â½ pp.
 Further on, in 2013 all Member States except 
Greece, Spain, Italy, th
e Netherlands, Bulgaria, 
Finland, and Slovenia are expected to achieve 

positive rates of employment growth. While 

unemployment rates are expected to fall in 2013 in 
a majority of Member States, all except Germany, 
Austria, Malta and Poland will record high
er 
unemployment rates than in 2007.
 Import prices and labour costs expected to 
exert limited pressure on producer prices.
 Increases in commodity prices, most notably in the 
first months of last year, were a major driver of 

inflationary pressures in the EU 
economy in 2011. 

Developments in commodity prices pushed 
import 
prices
 (as measured by the deflator of imports of 
                                                           (33) See e.g.

 goods and services) to an annual rate of 5.6% in 
the EU (5.8% in the euro area). Going forward, the 

assumed stabilisation in commodity prices 
around 

current levels should lower import price increases 
to about 3Â¾% in 2012 and 1Â½% in 2013 in the EU 
(3Â¼% and 1Â½% in the euro area).
 The stabilisation in labour markets in the first half 

of 2011 resulted in a moderate increase in 
labour 
costs
, includin
g wages per employee (2.2% in both 
the EU and the euro area). The euro
-area index of 
negotiated wages, which captures the main 

component of wages settled in advance through 
collective agreements, increased by 2.0% in 2011.
 Nominal compensation per employee
 is expected 
to grow at annual rates of about 2% in 2012 and 
2013 (see Table 
I.8
). With non
-wage labour costs 
growing at almost the same rate, labour
-cost 
pressures should remain well contained over the 

forecast horizon. After hav
ing increased last year 
by about 1Â½% in the EU (1Â¼% in the euro area), 

labour productivity is expected to increase only 

modestly this year before rebounding in 2013 in 

the EU (Â½% and 1Â¼% respectively) and in the 

euro area (0% and 1%). This implies stronger
 increases in nominal unit labour costs in 2012, 

whereas real unit labour costs will almost stagnate 
given price developments. The magnitude of the 
expected decline in unit labour costs in 2013 will 

depend on the degree of persistence of slow 

productivity 
growth once economic growth gains 
traction again.

 Against the background of easing import prices, 
moderating energy prices and well

labour
-cost developments, price pressures on 
producers have diminished more recently and 
producer
-price inflation has been falling (s
ee 
Graph 
I.31
). 
 The future pass
-through of previous price 
pressures, down the supply chain and finally to 

consumer prices, will depend on the pricing power 

of manufacturers, which is closely associated with 

the amount of spare c
apacity. Going forward, data 
from the Commission surveys on selling price 

expectations in manufacturing point to increasing 
pressures on margins. This reduced pricing power 
is confirmed by recent changes in the ratio of input 

and output price components in
 the PMI (see 
Graph 
I.32
). 3040506070102030405060708090070809101112Graph I.32:

 A look at PMI data at the Member State level 

indicates that the pressure on margins has
 increased 
in particular 
in Italy
, Spain, Greece and 
Ireland, where the difference between input and 

output price components increased rapidly in the 
first months of 2012, whereas the increase was less 

pronounced in Germany and France.
 Consumer
-price inflation has surprised on the 
upside 
in 2011, â In 2011, consumer prices were strongly affected by 

volatile but overall rising global commodity prices 

and, in some Member States, by increases in 

indirect taxes and administered prices. These 
factors pushed HICP inflation rates temporarily 
abov
e 3% and contributed to annual rates of 3.1% 
in the EU and 2.7% in the euro area (see Graph 

I.33
). In the first quarter of 2012, HICP inflation 
stood at 2.9% in the EU and 2.7% in the euro area.

 The importance of commodity prices, most notably 

oil, is reflected in the contribution of energy prices 

to headline inflation, which was about 1.3 pps. in 

the EU and 1.2 pps. in the euro area (see Graph 

I.37
) in 2011. 
While initially only those HICP sub
-components that are most closely linked to oil 

prices were affected, other energy subcomponents 

(e.g. gas and electricity) have followed throughout 

the year.

   43 The initial impact of higher international food 
commodity pri
ces in the first half of 2011 subsided 
in the second half of the year. But the pass
-through 
continued and food
-price inflation in the year as a 
whole stood at
 3.2% in the EU (2.3% in the euro 
area)
, with the highest increases in commodity
-intensive items s
uch as dairy products, coffee and 
tea. Due to base effects, 
the impact of past 

agricultural commodity price increases should also 

dissipate over the forecast horizon.
  â increasingly affected by fiscal measures, â
 Towards 
the end of 2011, the impact of fis
cal 
consolidation measures became more clearly 

visible. Increased indirect taxes and administered 

prices accounted for a measurable part of 
inflationary pressures
, while other domestic 
inflationary forces remained rather moderate. In 
the year as a whole, i
ncreases in tax rates added 
about 
Â½ pp. to EU headline inflation. In particular
, rises in VAT such as in the UK added to headline 

inflation. In 
December 2011
 (latest available data) 
the HICP at constant tax rates (HICP
-CT) stood at 
2.6% in the EU and 2.5%

 ... but wi
th headwinds fading, inflation is bound 
to abate gradually over the forecast horizon â
 The easing in commodity prices towards the end of 
this year, in line with the futures
-based 
assumptions (see Box 
I.5
), and relatively weak 
economic activity
, should lowe
r consumer
-price 
inflation. This would be consistent with data from 

surveys 
which 
track price expectations and which 
point to easing consumer
-price inflation. The 
Commission's Consumer Survey showed 
that 
inf
lation expectations (over the coming 12 months)
 remained 
close to their long
-term averages
, both in 
the EU and the euro area. Market
-based inflation 
expectations for the medium
- to long
 term point to 
an easing of inflation going forward. However, in 

times of continued financial
-market turbulences, 
these 
indicators should be interpreted with caution
. Further on, headline inflation is expected to 

decline, owing to the fall in energy inflation, 

reflecting base effects related to oil price hikes in 

early 2011. The slowing in economic activity is 

likely to inc
rease the slack in the economy, 
constrain wage increases and lower the price
-
setting power of producers, while the weakness of 

private consumption will limit the price
-setting 
power of retailers. Therefore, at the current 

juncture the risk of second
-round 
effects appears to 
be rather limited.
 The return to subdued economic growth in late 

2012 and 2013 is not expected to add any 

substantial inflationary pressure, in particular since 

output gaps are only closing very slowly in the EU 

and the euro area. HICP h
eadline inflation is 
forecast to stay close to 2% in 2013 (1.9% in the 

EU, 1.8% in the euro area) and thus to be in line 
with inflation expectations, for instance in the 
ECB's Survey of Professional Forecasters. In 2013, 
European Econom

 Public finances
 continue to improve â
 Public finance developments in the euro area and 

the EU continue to be characterised by the fiscal 

exit strategy put in place after the 2008
-09 
recession. In line with the Council conclusions first 
issued in 2
009 and subsequently reiterated in 2011 
and in early 2012, the key objective of the fiscal 
exit strategy is to bring public finances back to a 

sustainable path within the context of the EU fiscal 

rules (see Box 
I.4
). Fiscal consolidation efforts, 
which sta
rted in 2010, intensified in 2011 and led 
to a significant improvement in public finance 

conditions in both the euro area and in the EU. The 

economic cycle, which was still supportive in the 

first half of 2011, also contributed positively to 

this improveme
nt.
 â mainly on the back of
 fiscal consolidation 
measures.
 Compared with the 2011 autumn forecast, the 

outlook for budget balances is broadly unchanged 

at the aggregate level. Against a backdrop of a 

temporary weakening in 2012 and a prospective 
gradual ec
onomic recovery in 2013, as well as 
planned and adopted fiscal consolidation measures 

across Member States, the declining trend in 

budget deficits is expected to continue over the 

forecast horizon (see Graph 
I.39
). 
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   45    Box I.4: 
Fiscal consolidation and the economic outlook
Following the significant deterioration 
in public 
finances across most EU Member States over 
recent
 years, the
re is an undisputed
 need for f
iscal 
consolidation
 to bring public finances back 
onto
 a sust
ainable path. Improving 
the 
fiscal stance is 
particular
ly crucial 
in highly
-indebted EU 
countries
. At the same time, 
there is 
major concern 
that decisive consolidation at the current juncture 
may 
derail the recovery
. The impact of fiscal 
tightening on econ
omic activity 
depends on a 
number of factors. First, t
he size of fiscal 
multipliers is highly dependent on the composition 
of fiscal consolidation, 
and multipliers are typically 
larger for 
measures on the 
expenditure 
side 
than on 
the 
revenue side
. Second, 
the monetary policy 
reaction is an important factor, and multipliers are 
higher when interest rates are constrained by the 
zero lower bound. Third, t
he credibility of fiscal 
packages also affects multipliers 
considerably 
through impact
s on anticipation 
and
 thereby 
the 
behaviour 
of private consu
mers and investors
. Fourth, 
fiscal consolidation may potentially 
dampen risk premia in sovereign
-debt markets
, with possible
 spillovers to corporate financing costs 
supporting the recovery
. Though difficult to 
quantif
y, this effect may 
be particularly important 
at present
, with some Member States fac
ing
 punitive sovereign
-bond spreads.
 The potential impact on economic activity in the 
EU of different types of fiscal consolidation was 
assessed in the autumn 2010 f
orecast
. The analysis 
was carried out in a general
-equilibrium 
macroeconomic model applying the open
-economy 
versions of DG ECFIN's QUEST model
.(1) Based 
on the same approach, this box evaluates the 
impact on economic activity of the 
currently
-decided fiscal cons
olidation plans. The model 
simulations take into account consolidation 
measures that have been 
adopted or specified in 
sufficient detail 
by Member States to date
 and are 
included in the forecast
. Collected at the 
country 
level, the data for the simulations
 is aggregated for 
the EU and euro
-area levels.
 Table 1 summarises the 
aggregated 
discretionary 
measures. Over the period 2011
-13, fiscal plans at 
the EU and euro
-area level are somewhat dominated
 
 of the additional

Discretionary fiscal measures (% of GDP)
  The 
estimated 
impact of the EU and euro
-area 
consolidation paths on economic activity, private 
demand and public finance
s is reported in 
Table 
2 which shows the deviations from a baseline 
scenario without consolidation
. The multiplier of 
fiscal consolidatio
n is moderate, namely around Â¼
. In the EU, the improvement in the budget balance 
of, ex-ante
, 1.4% of GDP in 2012 lower
s real GDP 
by 0.3% relative to the baseline
 scenario
. The 
results are of the same magnitude for the euro area
.  The fairly modest impact multipliers of the fiscal 
tightening derive from the design of the fiscal 
packages, with a relative bias towards measur
es 
which have a smaller short
-run multiplier, and the 
assumption that fiscal plans are fully credible. 
On aggregate, the combination of measures is 
relatively growth
-friendly in the medium and 
longer term. Many of the measures specified in 
Table 1, namely 
higher consumption taxes and 
lower transfers and government consumption, have 
a strong impact on households' current disposable 
income, but little negative impact on factor supply

(2) In 
the 
reference 
scenario (
credibility
) fiscal plans 
for 2012
-13 are perfectly credible ex ante. Full 
credibility of the consolidation plans is crucial for 
the size of fiscal multipliers, as
 private households 
and firms take the fiscal plans and the impact of 
lower debt on future tax liabilities and disposable 
income fully into account when making 
consumption, employment and investment choices, 
implying a stabilisation 
in private demand. 
Furt
hermore
, the intertemporal
ly-optimising 
consumers bring durable consumption demand 
forward when consumption taxes are expected to 
increase.
 An additional assumption underlying the small 
multiplier results is that monetary accommodation 
cushions the GDP imp
act of fiscal contraction by 
stimulating private demand, i.e. that interest rates 
are not constrained by the zero bound. 
Introducing 
a binding zero
-bound constraint (
ZLB) on nominal 
interest rates for 2012 more than doubles the 
impact multiplier of the EU 
and euro
-area 
consolidation package from Â¼ to 0.5
-0.6 in the 
credibility
 scenario (Graph 1).

 the GDP effect of 
fiscal consolidation. A

 credibility for fiscal multipliers. This scenario 
assumes that fiscal plans are not credible 
per se
. Rather credibility has to be established by action. 
More precisely, the scenario assumes that private 
households and firms in 2012 q
uestion the 
governments' commitment to consolidation and, 
therefore, consider the fiscal measures in 2012 to 
be only of temporary nature. The private agents 
change their beliefs in 2013 as the fiscal measures 
of 2012 remain in place and new measures are 
added. Hence, the continuation of the consolidation 
in 2013 creates political credibility.
 Graph 1 shows that in the 
learning
 scenario
, the 
lack of political credibility substantially enhances 
the initial impact of fiscal tightening on economic 
activity. In 
the absence of credibility 
in fiscal plans, 
the initial multiplier 
of Â½ 
in the EU and the euro 
area in 2012 is around twice as large as the 
multiplier
 of Â¼ 
in the case of ex
-ante credibility
 without 
a zero
-bound constraint
 on the interest rate
. The larger 
negative impact of fiscal tightening on 
activity in the absence of credibility derives mainly 
from the non
-anticipation of the future benefits. 
Lack of credibility forgoes the positive income 
effect that derives from the anticipation of lower 
future tax li
abilities, while frontloading of 
consumption in reaction to expected increases in 
the consumption tax also disappears if the 
announcement lacks credibility.

 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   47 The aggregate general government deficit in the 
euro area is expected to decli
ne to 3.2% of GDP in 
2012, about 1 pp. of GDP lower than in 2011. 

Taking into account only adopted budgets and 
other measures sufficiently specified by Member 
States by the cut
-off date, the overall budget deficit 
is set to decrease further to 2.9% of GDP 
in 2013. 

A similar profile is expected in the EU, where the 

aggregate deficit is expected to reach 3.6% and 

3.3% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively.
 The expected improvement in the budget balance 

of both areas in 2012 is almost exclusively driven 

by incr
easing government revenues. The revenue 
ratio of the euro area is forecast to increase to more 

than 46% of GDP, up by a hefty 0.9 pp. on the 
previous year (see Graph 
I.40
). In the EU, 
government revenues are expected to increase 
by 
somewhat less and to reach 45% of GDP. Higher 

revenue ratios arise mainly from indirect taxes and 

slightly less from current taxes on income and 

wealth. Government spending is projected to stay 
broadly unchanged in 2012 relative to GDP in both 
the euro 
area and in the EU, as an expected 
decrease in the real compensation of employees is 

off
-set by increasing transfers and interest 
payments relative to GDP in the light of increasing 

unemployment and debt levels. In contrast to 2011, 

when consolidation was 
mainly driven by 
expenditure cuts, the largely revenue
-based 
improvement in 2012 is at odds with the general 
policy guidance at the EU level to favour 

expenditure based adjustments, and possibly 

reflects the political cycle.

G. Mueller, Sovereign risk, fiscal policy, and

January 2012 and the empirical evidence cited 
therein.
 The decline 
in borrowing costs in addition to the 
anticipation of future income and supply effects of 
debt reduction lowers the multiplier
 further
, from 
Â¼ to 
around 
0.2
. The additional reduction in the 
multiplier is driven by the assumed spillover to 
corporate financing costs. The decline in the risk 
premium on corporate investment strengthens 
investment in
 the private sector and supports the 
recovery of output.
  From the different scenarios, it is evident that the 
effects
 of fiscal consolidation depend
 largely on 
the 
composition of fiscal packages and 
the 
reception of 
fiscal measures by private consumers an
d investors.
 The different measures on the expenditure and 
revenue side vary in their short
-term impact on 
aggregate demand and th
eir impact on long
-term 
growth. In addition, at the current juncture with 
its 
very low policy interest rates, the short
-term 
multiplier of consolidation may be increased unless 
unconventional monetary policy can work around 
the zero bound.
    European Econom
ic Forecast, Spring 2012
   48 In 2011, the economic recovery supported the 
fiscal exit strategy and structural and cyclical 

factors contributed in equal measure to the 

projected improvement in budget balances. In 
2012, however, discretionary consolidation is 
forecast 
to be the sole driving force behind the 
estimated improvement in the headline deficit (see 

Graph 
I.39
). More specifically, the estimated 
improvement in the structural balance of 1.3 pps. 

in the euro area and of 1.1 pps. in the EU
, is 
projected to be partially offset by the budgetary 

impact from the worsening short
-term economic 
situation.

 In 2013, the fiscal stance is broadly neutral in the 

euro area. The
 expected increase in the structural 
budget balance of 0.2 pp. would account for about 

half of the overall projected change in the headline 

deficit in that year. In the EU, the estimated 
change in the structural budget balance of 0.5 pp. 
would remain the s
ole driving force behind the 
expected improvement in the headline deficit.
 The budgetary situation improves across 
Member States â
 The projected improvement in the budgetary 
situation is broad
-based across Member States, yet 
notable differences persist. So
me countries are 
making rapid and sustained progress on their way 
towards sustainable fiscal positions. In others, 
progress is slower or takes place at a variable pace. 

A number of countries may register increasing 

headline deficits in one or two of the fo
recast 
years. In 2012, Denmark and Estonia are expected 

to register a marked deterioration in their 
budget 
balances. In Denmark, which is still subjec
t to the 
Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the worsening 

of public finance conditions reflects the 

introd
uction of a stimulus package whose 
budgetary effects are assumed to last only during 

2012 and the lump
-sum reimbursement related to 
the adoption of the reform of the voluntary early
-retirement pension (VERP). In addition, the 

absence of extraordinary and t
ypically rather 
volatile pension yield revenues reduces the budget 

balance compared to 2011. In Estonia, which is 

one of the few EU Member States currently not 

subject to the EDP, the budget balance is forecast 

to return to the red this year. The deteriora
tion in 

public finances in Estonia is due to the absence of 
windfall revenues linked to the Kyoto trading 
system, the social indexation of pensions and the 

restoration of the payments for the second pillar of 

the pension system. 
 As regards EU budgetary su
rveillance, all Member 
States except Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and 

Sweden are currently subject to the EDP. This 

results from the combined after
-effect of the deep 
economic recession in 2009 and the discretionary 

measures implemented at the time with th
e European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), aimed 

at stemming the risk of an economic and financial 

meltdown. In view of the severity of the 2009 

recession and its heavy impact on public finances, 
the correction period under the EDP was 
formulated as a multi
annual adjustment 
framework.  Most EDP countries have a deadline 

of either this year or 2013 to correct their 

excessive general government deficit.
(34) Currently 
all EDPs are in abeyance, with the exception of 

Greece and Hungary. Furthermore, among the 

Memb
er States subjected to the EDP, Greece, 
Portugal, Ireland and Romania benefit from 

financial assistance, while the Balance of Payment 

(BoP) programme for Latvia ended in January 

2012. 
 â while debt continues to increase, yet at a 
slowing pace
 Government de
bt-to-GDP ratios are expected to 
continue to increase over the forecast horizon in 
both the euro area and in the EU, albeit at a 

slowing pace compared with the 2008
-10 period. 
Even though current deficits are being reduced, 

increasing interest payments, co
mbined with 
somewhat lower nominal GDP growth, are 

assumed to push up public debt ratios (
see Table 
I.9
). On the whole, in the euro area gross public 
debt is projected to reach 92Â½% of GDP in 2013, 
                                                           (34) For a complete overview see: 
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governanc
e/sgp/deficit/index_en.htm
. Economic developments at the aggregated level
   49 while in the EU it is expected t
o slightly exceed 
87% of GDP. Compared with the autumn forecast, 

the debt ratio of the euro area has been revised 

upwards in both 2012 and 2013 on account of a 
downward revision of economic growth as well as 
a marked worsening of the stock
-flow adjustment,
 comprising technical adjustments and changes in 

financial assets. In the EU, the upward revision of 

the aggregate debt ratio over the forecast horizon, 

and more specifically in 2013, is mainly due to 

higher expected public debt in the United 

Kingdom, whic
h is partly caused by an amendment 
on the treatment of financial sector interventions

 6. RISKS
 Overall the balance of risks has improved slightly 

compared with the autumn 2011 forecast. Tail 

risks appear
 smaller than in the autumn of last year 
when substantial agreements had not yet been 
achieved (e.g. advances with firewalls, fiscal 
compact, restructuring in Greece) and non
-standard monetary policy measures had not been in 

place (e.g. the Eurosystem's LT
ROs). But at the 
same time new risks have emerged, limiting this 

relief. Overall, uncertainty remains at high levels 

as the economic and financial crisis is lasting, the 
EU economy is in recession and the validity of the 
policy assumption about the success
ful handling of 
the crisis
-related challenges remains crucial.
 Risks to the growth outlook
 remain tilted to the 
downside. As the economic and financial crisis, 
initiated by the subprime crisis in the US in 2007, 
enters its sixth year, some of the downside 
risks 

from earlier forecasts 
Å such as financial turmoil in 
some countries, entering a recession, or lower 

momentum in global growth 
Å have materialised 
and therefore entered the central scenario of this 

forecast. However, other risks have also since 

come 
to the fore and some new risks have 
emerged.
 On the downside, the risk of further financial 

turmoil remains in place, since financial markets 

remain fragile and are still prone to negative 

confidence shocks. A renewal of turmoil could re
-
activate or worsen
 adverse feedback loops and re
-ignite funding stress with detrimental effects on 

access to credit. The forecast depends crucially on 
the policy assumption that crisis
-related challenges 
are being successfully addressed. But with 
improvements in the economi
c situation, the risk 
of complacency necessarily rises. Should
 uncertainty about the implementation of already 

agreed policy measures occur, or should the 
response to future challenges lack timeliness, focus 
or ambition, a more negative development and a 
longer
-lasting period of stagnation cannot be 
excluded. The more the functioning of financial 
markets depends on central banks, the larger the 

risk that doubts about the return to market
-based 
activities may arise. Moreover, fiscal sustainability 

challenges
 are yet to be tackled not only within the 
EU but also outside (e.g. the US). Resulting 
consolidation measures that are not taken on board 
in the central scenario due to the no
-policy
-change 
assumption may have a more negative impact on 

domestic demand tha
n currently foreseen. And a 
sharp increase in oil prices could lower real 

incomes and consumption more than expected and 
jeopardise the economic upturn.
 On the upside, the policy measures already taken 
to address the challenges of the euro
-area 
sovereign
-debt crisis may have a faster and more 
sustained impact than currently expected. This 

would encourage companies to invest and 
households to consume resulting in an earlier 
return of confidence and an earlier transition to 

recovery than currently forecast.
 Should global growth turn out more dynamic than 
assumed in the baseline due to inherent growth 

dynamics and policy easing in emerging market 

economies, EU exports would benefit more than 

expected.
 The uncertainty surrounding the euro
-area growth 
outlook is 
visualised in a fan chart (see Graph 
I.41
) that displays the probabilities associated with 

various outcomes for euro
-area economic growth 
over the forecast horizon. While the darkest area 
European Econom
ic Forecast, Spring 2012
   50 indicates the most likely development, th
e shaded 
areas represent the different probabilities of future 
economic growth within the growth ranges 

depicted on the y
-axis. The width of the 90% 
bands is smaller than in previous forecasts. But as 

the balance of risks to economic growth is assessed 
as 
clearly tilted to the downside, the fan chart 
remains skewed towards the bottom.

Euro area GDP forecasts - 
Uncertainty linked to the balance of risks
 The 
risks to the inflation outlook
 for the years 
2012 and 2013 remain balanc
ed. While the 
deterioration in the economic environment has 
lowered some of the risks, risks related to fiscal 

retrenchment and developments in the external 

side environment appear to be more acute than 
previously assessed. 
 On the downside, the recession
 in the EU may be 
less mild than currently forecast. A further drop in 
economic activity may constrain price increases 

more than currently envisaged. Any attempt to 

competitively devalue outside the EU, e.g. by 
setting minimum exchange rates vis
-Ã -vis the 
euro, 
could reduce import prices and, if passed through 
via production and retail chains, lower consumer 

prices in the EU.
 On the upside, a stronger
-than
-expected rebound in 
global growth or continued unrest or military 

actions in oil
-exporting countries c
ould result in 
stronger inflationary pressures. Past periods of 

consumer
-price inflation could also result in 
stronger wage increases than currently expected 
and trigger second
-round effects which could raise 
inflation rates further. Higher indirect taxes 
and 
administrative prices due to additional fiscal 

consolidation measures could also push inflation 

rates higher. Moreover, the long
-time build
-up of 
liquidity and the non
-standard liquidity provision 
in the EU, most notably in the euro area and the 

UK, co
uld eventually result in stronger
-than
-expected consumer
-price increases.
 Overall, the main risk to the central scenario of the 

forecast for economic growth and inflation is a 

revival of the crisis in the EU.
 Economic developments at the aggregated level
   51    Box I.5: 
Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut
-off date for taking new information into 
account in this European Economic Forecast was 
26 April. The forecast incorporates validated public 
finance data from Eurostat's News Release 
62/2012, dat
ed 23 April 2012.
 External assumptions
 This forecast is based on a set of external 
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the 
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions 
from possible volatility during any given trading 
day, averages from a 10
-day reference period 
(between 1
1 and 2
4 April) were used for exchange 
and interest rates, and for oil prices. 
 Exchange and interest rates
 The technical assumption as regards exchange rates 
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange 
rates for all curren
cies. This technical assumption 
leads to implied average USD/EUR rates of 1.3
1 in 
in 2012 and 2013. The average JPY/EUR rates are 
105.
9 in 2012 and 10
6.5 in 2013.
 Interest
-rate assumptions are market
-based. 
Short
-term interest rates for the euro area are 
derived from futures contracts. Long
-term interest 
rates for the euro area, as well as short
- and 
long
-term interest rates for other Member States are 
calculated using implicit forward swap rates, 
corrected for the current spread between the 
interest rate a
nd swap rate. In cases where no 
market instrument is available, the fixed spread 
vis
-Ã -vis the euro
-area interest rate is taken for both 
short
- and long
-term rates. As a result, short
-term 
interest rates are expected to be 
0.8
% on average in 
2012 and 2013 
in the euro area. Long
-term euro
-area interest rates are assumed to be 
1.8
% on 
average in 2012 and 2.
0% in 2013.
 Commodity prices
 Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as 
possible, based on market conditions. According to 
futures markets, prices for
 Brent oil are projected to 
be on average 11
6.8 USD/bl. in 2012 and 
110.2 USD/bl. in 2013. This would correspond to 
an oil price of 
89.2 EUR/bl. in 2012 and 
84.1
 EUR/bl. in 2013.
 Budgetary data 
 Data up to 2011 are based on data notified by 
Member States t
o the European Commission on 
1 April and validated by Eurostat on 23 April 2012. 
Eurostat expressed a specific reservation on the 
data reported by Ireland, due to the fact that the 
restructuring plans of Allied Irish Banks and Irish 
Life & Permanent were n
ot yet finalised. These 
restructuring plans have been used by the Irish 
statistical authorities to calculate in the reported 
figures a (deficit increasing) capital transfer 
element of 3.7% GDP arising from the July 2011 
government injections into the two b
anks. Eurostat 
awaits the finalisation of the restructuring plans, 
including approval by the EU competition 
authorities, so that the amount of the capital 
transfer element can be confirmed. 
 Eurostat also expressed a specific reservation on 
the data report
ed by Ireland, due to the statistical 
classification of National Asset Management 
Agency Investment Limited (NAMA
-IL), which is 
currently classified outside the general government. 
Owing to the nationalisation of one of its 
previously private beneficial ow
ners, whose 
interest is currently under a process of sale, 
NAMA
-IL has been in majority public ownership 
since July 2011. Eurostat's decision of 15 July 2009 
on public interventions during the financial crisis 
specifies that majority private ownership is 
necessary for such an entity to be classified outside 
the General Government sector.
 Eurostat has amended the deficit and debt data 
notified by the United Kingdom for the years 2008 
to 2011 (as well as for financial years 2008/2009 to 
2011/2012). This has b
een done to ensure 
compliance with the updated financial defeasance 
chapter of the ESA95 Manual on Government 
Deficit and Debt, with respect to Bradford & 
Bingley (B&B) and Northern Rock Asset 
Management (NRAM). The reported deficit figures 
have been incre
ased by 360 million GBP (0.03% of 
GDP) in 2008 (as well as in financial year 
2008/2009), by 571 mn GBP (0.04% of GDP) in 
2009 (as well as in financial year 2009/2010), by 
826 mn GBP (0.06% of GDP) in 2010 (as well as 
in financial year 2010/2011) and by 787
 mn GBP 
(0.05% of GDP) in 2011 (as well as in financial 
year 2011/2012). The reported debt figures have 
been increased by 32 374 mn GBP (2.26% of GDP) 
in 2008 (as well as in financial year 2008/2009), by 
19 969 mn GBP (1.43% of GDP) in 2009 (as well 
as in 
financial year 2009/2010), by 56 680 mn GBP 
(3.87% of GDP) in 2010 (as well as in financial 
year 2010/2011) and by 42 287 mn GBP (2.81% of 
GDP) in 2011 (as well as in financial year 
2011/2012).

 European Econom
ic Forecast, Spring 2012
   52    Box (continued)
  For the forecast, measures in support of financial 
stability 
have been recorded in line with the 
Eurostat 
Decision of 15 July 2009
.(1) Unless 
reported otherwise by the Member State concerned, 
capital injections known in sufficient detail have 
been included in the forecast as financial 
transactions, i.e. increasing t
he debt, but not the 
deficit. State guarantees on bank liabilities and 
deposits are not included as government 
expenditure, unless there is evidence that they have 
been called 
on 
at the time the forecast was 
finali
sed. 
Note
, however
, that loans granted to 
banks by the government, or by other entities 
classified in the government sector, usually add to 
government debt. 
 For 201
2, budgets adopted or presented to national 
parliaments and all other measures known in 
sufficient detail are taken into consideratio
n. For 
2013, the 'no
-policy
-change' assumption used in the 
forecasts implies the extrapolation of revenue and 
expenditure trends and the inclusion of measures 
that are known in sufficient detail. 
 The general government balances that are relevant 
for the 
Excessive 
Deficit 
Procedure may be slightly 
different from those published in the national 
accounts. The difference concerns settlements 
under swaps and forward rate agreements (FRA). 
 According to ESA95 (amended by regulation No
. 2558/2001), swap
- and FRA
-related flows are 
financial transactions and therefore excluded from 
the calculation of the government balance. 
However, for the purposes of the ex
cessive deficit 
procedure, such
 flows are recorded as net interest 
expenditure.

of the ESM as planned on the cut

 Calendar effects on G
DP growth and output 
gaps The number of working days may differ from one 
year to another. The Commission's annual GDP 
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of 
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
 However, the working
-day effect in the EU and the 
euro area is estimated to 
be limited over the 
forecast horizon, implying that
 adjusted and
 unadjusted growth rates differ only marginally. The 
calculation of potential growth and the output gap 
does not adjust for working days. Since 
the 
working
-day effect
 is considered as temporary, 
it should not affect the cyclically
-adjusted balances.

  56  The recovery

 The export

second part of 2009 came to a halt in the second 
half of 2011. The slowdown in global activity 

coupled with a revival of the sovereign
-debt crisis 
and negative confide
nce effects, resulted in a 
shallow recession (
-0.1% both for the third and 
fourth quarter). For the year as a whole and thanks

GDP growth (y-o-y %)
forecast
 GDP is projected to stagnate in 2012, to recover in 

2013, growing by 1Â¼%. According to the most 

recent available indicators, an economic expansion 

is not to be expected at the beginning of 2012. In 

particular in view of the high degree of opennes
s 
of the Belgian economy, the slowdown in activity 

in neighbouring countries is likely to exert its toll. 

In the second half of the year, GDP should 

increase on the back of a gradual recovery for 

international trade, while the crisis
-related 
uncertainty wi
ll slowly fade away, pushing up 
business and households' confidence. Moreover 
the consolidation measures included in both the 
2012 budget and complemented by additional 

measures in January and March are likely to have a 

limited but still negative impact on
 this year's 
growth.  Eventually, downward pressure from a 

fall in real disposable income, stemming from 
rising unemployment and less dynamic non
-labour 
income, is likely to be partly balanced by a slight 
fall in the household saving rate in order to susta
in 
the level of consumption. Private consumption is 

then projected to remain anaemic in 2012 with no 

real growth, and to progress timidly in 2013. 
 In contrast with 2011, private investment is set to 

remain weak over the forecast horizon. 
Increased 

uncerta
inty and a below
-long
-term average 
capacity utilisation 
are
 expected 
to 
result in some
 postponement
s of planned investment projects
. In 
2013, business investment is projected to 
accelerate progressively, in line with the 

improvement 
in confidence.
 Demand f
or 
mortgages is expected to fall in 2012, also in view 

of the negative developments in household real 

disposable income, weighing
 in turn on 
construction investment. In view of the local 

elections in the second half of the year,
 public 
investment 
is projec
ted to remain upbeat in 2012 
and, on the contrary, to be negative in 2013. On 

the whole, investment is expected to grow by 0.7% 

in 2012 and to accelerate to 1.6% in 2013. 
 External sector and competitiveness
 Due to the gradual pickup in world trade expecte
d 
to materialise only in the second part of the year, 

export growth would be limited in 2012 but should 

accelerate slightly in 2013. Net trade contribution 
is then projected to be a drag on growth in 2012 (
-0.2 pp.) and to be still flat in 2013. Relatively
 high 
dynamic unit labour costs are projected to hamper 
competitiveness in 2012 and to a lesser degree in 

2013. Furthermore, suboptimal geographical and 

product specialisation will contribute to the loss in 
the market share over the forecast horizon. The 
surplus in the current
-account balance is expected 
to fall further in 2012 and 2013 in view of the 

projected deficit in trade of goods.
 Risks are slightly skewed towards the negative 

side. Exports might turn out to be lower than 
projected, should competitiv
eness deterioration be 
deeper than expected. On the other hand, private 
consumption might be more dynamic on the basis 

of regained households' confidence and a high 

saving rate.
 Inflation still high while labour market weakens
 Inflation reached 3.5% 
in 201
1 mainly on account 
of a surge in oil prices. In line with the further 

increase in oil prices in the beginning of 2012, 

coupled with the impact of the consolidation 
measures in the 2012 budget (estimated around 0.2 
pp.), inflation is projected to remain hi
gh at 2.9% 
and decrease to 1.8% in 2013.

December 2011,
 but edged up in the first two 
months of 2012 to 7.2%. In 2011
, employment 

growth was supported by a rise in hours worked 
and an increase in
 part
-time work, partly 
subsidised by the general government (e.g. service 

cheque jobs). In view of the weak economic 
environment, employment is projected to stall in 

2012 and increase only slightly in 2013. However, 

given a still dynamic growth in the lab
our force, 
unemployment is seen to increase both in 2012 and 

2013. Public finance: trying to eliminate the 
excessive deficit 
 The general government deficit reached 3.7% in 
2011 compared to 4.1% in the autumn forecast and 

3.8% in 2010. This revision mainly
 reflects the 
base effect stemming from a downward revision of 

the deficit of local authorities in recent years
. In 
2012, the general government deficit is likely to 
decrease to 
3% of GDP, mainly on account of the 
consolidation measures in the 2012 budget.
 In 
particular, an increase in the tax on dividends and 
interest, a reform of the "notional interest" system 

and the introduction of a specific levy on the 

"nuclear rent" of electricity will help reducing the 
deficit this year. On the expenditure side, cut
s were 
decided in federal government and social security 
spending for about 0.3% and 0.2% of GDP, 
respectively. In order to cope with the strong 

downward revision in growth (the budget had 

initially been based on the assumption of a 0.8% 
GDP growth in 2012
), additional measures were 
taken 
in March
, during the budgetary monitoring 
exercise. This, coupled with the base effect 
stemming from the downward revision of the 
deficit of local authorities, would push the deficit 

down to 3% of GDP in 2012. However, in 
2013, 

despite the projected acceleration in growth and 

some measures already taken for 2013, it should 

start to rise again, in part explained by the large 
amount of one
-off measures decided for 2012 
(about Â½% of GDP). In structural terms, the deficit 
is pr
ojected to decline by about 0.7 pp. of GDP 
(after deteriorating by 0.1 in 2011) and by a further 

0.1 pp. of GDP in 2013.  
 The general government debt reached 98.0% in 

2011. Under the current growth and deficit 

projections, the debt ratio is forecast to co
ntinue to 
rise slightly over the forecast period and it will 

probably exceed the psychological threshold of 

100% of GDP in 2012. Moreover, the large 

contingent liabilities stemming from the 

guarantees given by the State to financial 

institutions represent 
a risk for public finances
. 2. BULGARIA
 Slow recovery ahead whi
le fiscal position continues to improve
  58 Initial recovery phase driven by exports
 The 
Bulgarian eco
nomy 
expanded
 slowly over 
 2010-11. As in other converging EU economies, 
which had undergone a period of economic 
overheating and a build
-up of imbalances, t
he 
growth pattern 
in the 
recovery 
over 2010
-11 was
 largely driven by exports, while domestic demand
 remained stagnant, reflecting 
imbalances in the 

private sector
. Annual GDP growth reached 1.7% 
in 2011, with a decelerating trend within the year.
 Slow recovery ahead
 Compared to the autumn forecast, annual growth 

has been revised down by 1.8 pp
s. to 0.5%
 for the 
current year and by 
1.1 pps. to 
1.9% in 2013. 
The
se revision
s reflect
 the downward adjustment 
in EU economic prospects and its spill
-over ef
fects 
to the Bulgarian economy via the trade channel 

and lower confidence, affecting investment and 

consump
tion.
  The recovery 
is mainly restrained 
by 
the
 weaknesses of the labour market, the continued 

deleveraging of the corporate sector and a 

downsizing in the construction sector. 

Additionally, given the regional economic 

uncertainties, capital inflows and FD
I have 
stabilised at lower levels and have not given a 

notable boost to growth, unlike in the past decade. 
On the positive side, the financial sector has 
remained stable
, also providing a
 modest growth in 
private sector credit in 2011. 
The economy also 

ben
efits from relatively strong public finances, 
which do not face major adjustment 
needs 
in the 
medium
 term.
 In line with the expected recovery in the EU, 

prospects for the exporting sectors would improve 

from the second half of 2012.
 The 
deceleration
 in 
exp
ort
 growth
 compared to 2010
-11 is not seen 
to result in a notable widening in the trade 
deficit
 
until 2013, as both private consumption and 
investment are still weak and 
restrain
 imports.
 Consumer sentiment has remained low in the first 
months of 2012, 
sti
ll below the long
-term
 average.
 Household demand is expected to contribute to 
growth more notably in 2013, especially
 as the 
labour market is expected to stabilise and 
households are projected to reduce their currently 

high precautionary savings

Inflation 
forecast
 Investment has declined substantially for the past 

three
 years from the peak reached at the height of 
the boom. 
Investment is expected to be supported 
by public sector projects
. Bulgaria plans
 to 
increase 
the 
absorption 
of 
EU structural funds 
significantly in 2012
. However, g
iven the on
-going 
deleveraging of corporate balance sheets, 

adjustments in the real
-estate market and the weak 
economic environment, investment is expected 
to 
contract further in 2012 before 
moving to positive 
territory 
in 2013.
 Delayed recovery in the labour market 
 The effects of the crisis on employment were 

strong and protracted. 
Employment declined by a 
cumulative 12% 
between 2009 and 2011
, which is 

one 
of the steepest declines in the EU. T
he 
contraction in employment is forecast to level off 

over 2012 
and
 2013. Businesses are still cautious 
in hiring, as indicated by the weak employment 

expectations in business sentiment surveys. 
The 

unemployment rate in
creased from below 6% of 
the labour force to over 11% in 2011, with the 
inactivity rate also rising. 
Even with weak 
employment, average wages continued to 
increase, 

driven by structural changes in the labour market 

and the whitening of the economy
. The rec
overy in 
employment is 
held back
 by skill mismatches and 
a continuous decline in the working age 
population.
 This has negative implications for the 
growth potential of the economy.

     59 Low economic growth to dampen inflation
 HICP inflation slowed considerably 
over the 
course of 2011 and amounted 
to 3.4% in 2011 on 

average, 0.3
 pp. less than expected in the autumn 
forecast. While core inflation is expected to remain 
moderate given the weak economic and labour 
market 
outlook
, the energy component 
is set to 
rise 
as the
 global oil price 
increase feeds through
. Overall, inflation is expected to moderate further 

to 2.
6% on average in 2012 and 
stabilise
 in 2013
, supporting growth in 
real purchasing power of 

consumers. 
 Fiscal consolidation is set to continue
 Budgetary 
discipline led to a further improvement 
in the fiscal position in 2011. The budget deficit 

narrowed from 3.1% of GDP in 2010 to 2.1% in 

2011. Thanks to frontloading consolidation 

measures
, the structural deficit improved by 
1.6 pps. in 2010 and dropped fur
ther
, by another 
0.5 pp. to 
-1.0
% of GDP
, in 2011. 
The better
-than
-expected outcome in 
2011 (0.4 pp. lower deficit as 

compared to 
the autumn forecast) was mainly due 

to lower
-than
-projected capital spending, the 
freeze in pensions and public sector wages a
s well 

as cuts in subsidies.
 Fiscal consolidation is set to continue in 2012
-13, 
although at a slower pace, on account of 

improvement
s in revenue
s as well 
as 
the 
containment of public expenditure
s. The 2012 
budget implies a slightly restrictive fiscal stan
ce, 
with public sector wages and pensions frozen for a 
third year in a row and cuts in some 
non
-interest 
current expenditure. 
Advancing the agreed pension 
reform and measures to restructure loss making 
state
-owned enterprises is expected to help to 
contain
 expenditure pressures. On the revenue 
side, there are no major tax
 changes except for 
increasing excise taxes on some energy goods
. The 
general government deficit is forecast to improve 

further
, to 
1.9%
 of GDP in 2012
 and to 1.7% of 
GDP in 2013, while the
 structural deficit should 
decline from 
-1% 
of GDP 
in 2011 to 
-0.8% by 
2013. General government gross 
debt is envisaged 

 of GDP 
in 
2011 to 18Â½% of GDP in 2013
. The debt forecast 

does not include possible external debt issuan
ce in 
2012 to pre
-fund the 
repayment of 
euro
-denominated 
bonds of around 2% of GDP in 
January 2013
. 3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC
 From a mild recession to a mild recovery
  60 After two years of moderate recovery, the Czech 
economy entered a period of stagnation. 
In an 

environment of fiscal retrenchment, d
omestic 
demand
 was 
weaker in 2011 
than in
 2010, acting 
as the dominant drag on growth. The contribution 

of net exports to 
growth 
remained
 positive 
throughout 2011, but the growth rate of exports 

markedly de
creased 
towards the 
end of the 
year, 
on the back of lower demand in several of the 

Czech Republic's European trade partners.
 Weak 
domestic demand and sluggish export market
 growth
 are likely to continue
 to shape
 the 
economic environment in 2012
. An improvement
 in domestic 
demand, combined with 
a 
strengthening of
 external markets
, should lead to a 
mild recovery in 2013
. Weak domestic demand continues in 
2012  Consumption of h
ouseholds is expected to contract 
by 0.4% in 2012, after posting a 0.5% fall in 2011. 

The 
decline
 in real disposable income that 
constrained consumption expenditure in 2011 is 
expected to continue in 2012, mainly on account of 
higher 
inflation 
and somewhat
 less favourable 
labour market conditions. 
Due to the
 fragility of 
demand and the pressures faced by some 

multinational
 companies
 in their domestic markets
, companies 
remain cautious on investment as 
evidenced
 by surveys on business confidence and 
capacity
 utilisation.
 Fixed investment is 
therefore 
likely to be broadly flat in 2012
. A negative 
contribution to growth is, however, expected from 

the construction sector, which continues 
to operate
 under conditions of falling public expenditure on 

infrastructure
 and a stock of unsold 
houses
.  The contribution of net exports to GDP growth, 

which 
was
 the
 main driving force of the economy 
in the past two years, is projected to ease to 0.
9 pp. 
in 2012, and 
to 
subside further in 2013. The 
forecast is 
based
 on 
a conser
vative projection of 
market gains in non
-European economies 
(especially in the CIS), which still create relatively 

robust opportunities for exports. Larger
 market 
gains are considered the main positive risk to the 

forecast, especially in 2012. In 2013, the
 mild 
recovery expected in the Czech Republic 
and
 in 
the EU should provide 
support 
to both imports
 and 
exports. Despite a negative terms
-of-trade effect 
on account of higher oil prices 
assumed
 for 2012, 
the trade balance
 on goods and services
 as a 
percenta
ge of GDP 
is projected to improve from 

4.1% in 2011 to 4.
8% in 2012 and 
further to 5.0% 
in 2013.

 Inflation 
and unemployment 
on the rise
  Inflation 
increased in the last qu
arter of 2011 and 
the first quarter of 2012 to 
2.8% and 4
.0%, 
respectively, mostly due to 
a hike in the 
lower
 VAT rate from 10% to 14%, affect
ing
 about a third 
of the consumption basket (the direct effect 
of 

which 
accounts for 
around 
1.1
 pps.). Another 
inf
lationary
 effect
 came from 
hikes in 
oil and food 
prices 
combined
 with a depreciating currency. 
Given the lack of demand pressures, net
-of-tax 
inflation is expected to fall below 2% 
by the end of 
2012 and the overall inflation rate is expected to 

average 3.
3% in 2012. The forecast for 2013 
factors in another round of VAT increases 

(explained below), the direct effect of which is 

estimated at 0.
7 pp. 
 The unemployment rate 
is expected to rise 
from 
6.7% in 2011 to 7.
2% in 2012
 on the back of 
stagnating GDP, an
d to remain at this level in 
2013. In this context, 
real wages are likely to 
decrease 
over the forecast horizon
. Higher 
inflation and low productivity increases are 

consistent with rising unit labour costs.
  Government deficit on a downward path 
 The budge
tary outcome in 2011 was significantly 
better than expected. The general government 

deficit reached 3.1% of GDP, while the autumn 

2011 forecast projected a deficit of 4.1% of GDP.

      61 intermediate consumption, which 
fell by almost 
5% (0.4% of GDP), and public investment, which 
declined by more than 15% y
-o-y (0.7% of GDP), 
were the main factors behind this. 
 In 2012, the general government balance is 
projected to improve to 
-2.9% of GDP. 
Consolidation measures approve
d in the 2012 
budget include an increase in the lower VAT rate 

with an estimated fiscal impact of around 0.7% of 

GDP, a freeze in the central government sector 

wage bill (0.1% of GDP) and the introduction of a 

lottery tax (0.1% of GDP). Faced with worsenin
g macroeconomic conditions, the Czech authorities 
approved additional expenditure cuts amounting to 

0.6% of GDP
 in March 2012. These are expected 
to further reduce the operational costs of ministries 

and other central government bodies. A moderate 

rebound 
in public investment is projected over the 
forecast horizon. 
 Several factors should affect the budgetary 

outcome in 2013. The planned introduction of the 

private pension pillar could reduce revenue from 

the social security contributions by approximately 

0.2% of GDP, but this effect would be more than 
compensated for by the sizeable consolidation 

package (1.2% of GDP) approved by the Czech 
government in April 2012. The package, which 
will form the basis for the 2013 budget proposal 
and is taken into account
 in this forecast, includes 
a further 1
 pp. increase in both VAT rates, lower 
indexation of pensions, stricter conditions for tax 

deductibility for the self
-employed and an increase 
in the property transfer tax. The consolidation 

effort, together with a mo
dest improvement in 
macroeconomic conditions, will result in a 

reduction of the general government deficit to 

2.6% of GDP, while the structural balance is 

expected to improve by 0.8
 pp. over the forecast 
horizon. The debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to 
incre
ase further, reaching around 45% in 2013.
 The budgetary projections are subject to two main 

risks. The first one is related to the co
-financing of 
projects from the European Funds. As payments 

from the Funds were temporarily suspended due to 

irregularities
, it cannot be excluded that some on
-going projects will have to be financed entirely 

from national sources, which could lead to an 

increase in the general government deficit. The 
second risk concerns the financial implications of 
the law on compensation t
o churches currently 
discussed by the Parliament. Its approval would 

lead to a one
-off increase in the general 
government deficit of approximately 1.5% of 

GDP.
  4. DENMARK
 Subdued growth sustained by domestic demand
  62 GDP growth in Denmark reached 1% in 2011 after 
stagnating during the second half of the year as the 

slowdown of the global economy took its toll. The 

improvement in confidence indicators and
 readings 
for exports in the first quarter of 2012 suggests that 

a gradual pick
-up of activity is underway. 
However, as the external environment has 

deteriorated since last autumn, real GDP growth is 

expected to continue at a slow pace, reaching 1.1% 

in 20
12 and 1.4% in 2013. This implies a 
downward revision of Â¼ pp. in both years 

compared with the autumn forecast. 
 Driven mainly by domestic demand, and supported 
by the government's "kick
-start" stimulus package 
as well as the pay
-out of voluntary early ret
irement 
pension (VERP) contributions, Denmark's 
economic performance is, nevertheless, projected 
to be among the best for EU Member States this 

year. Towards the turn of the year, the recovery is 

expected to gain momentum
 slowly in line with a 
general impr
ovement in the economic situation in 
the EU. Fiscal consolidation efforts in 2013, on the 
other hand, will act as a drag on growth.
 Public initiatives support domestic demand
 Given the high degree of economic uncertainty, the 
need for deleveraging and 
the 
tightening credit 
conditions, the household saving rate remained 

high in 2011 and the corporate saving rate even 
increased. As credit conditions are expected to 
remain tight over the forecast horizon, gross fixed 

capital formation will continue to be propp
ed up 

largely by public initiatives such as the 

government's investment
-driven "kick
-start" and 
large
-scale infrastructure projects, while low 
interest rates and an improving economic 

environment should gradually support firms' 

propensity to invest towards
 the turn of the year 
and in 2013.
 Following the adoption of the retirement reform by 

Parliament, contributions to the VERP scheme are 
being reimbursed in 2012. Assuming that part of 
this reimbursement is consumed rather than 

reinvested in private pension 
funds, private 

consumption is expected to accelerate during the 

course of this year and to continue to grow at a 

moderate pace next year as households' real 
disposable income improves slowly. However, 
since real wage growth is now foreseen to 
be negative
 this year and the outlook for growth is 
more subdued 
Å also including a fragile housing 
market 
Å private consumption growth is now 
expected to be more moderate throughout the 

forecast horizon. Nevertheless, the yearly growth 
rate for 2012 is set to remain a
t 1.4% as in the 
autumn forecast due to the higher
-than
-expected 
carry
-over from 2011. 
 Elevated inflation in 2012
 Real wages are likely to be contained by elevated 
inflation and a very moderate outcome from the 

spring round of private sector wage agreemen
ts. 
As a result of the sustained significant increase in 
energy prices over the past year as well as the 
effects of tax hikes, HICP is projected to be around 

2.6% this year before dropping to 1.5% in 2013. 
 Moderate outlook for exports
 Although moderate wa
ge growth should support 
Denmark's competitiveness, export growth is 

projected to be significantly lower in 2012 than in 

2011 due to the less favourable external 
environment. However, the large share of non
-cyclical goods, e.g. pharmaceuticals, in Danish 
exports is likely to sustain export growth to some 
extent and limit the loss in export market shares. 

Furthermore, recent figures seem to suggest that 

Danish companies are beginning to take some 
advantage of the high growth in emerging markets. 
If this tend
ency continues, export performance 
could turn out better than projected. Due to the 

resilience of domestic demand, import growth 

should remain strong and the current
-account 
surplus is set to decline, reflecting lower savings in 

the private sector, by 2013
.  Continued
 stagnation in the labour market
 The subdued growth outlook is unlikely to allow 

for a pick
-up in private employment until next year 
whereas public employment should already start to 

head up somewhat this year in line with public 
consumption. T
he gradual improvement in 
economic conditions and employment prospects is 
likely to encourage more people to enter the labour 

market thereby lifting labour supply. 

Consequently, unemployment should remain 

broadly unchanged over the forecast horizon.

Budget affected by one
-off and "kick
-start" 
 Overall, the
 deficit for 2012 is revised down by 
0.4
 pp. compared 
with the autumn forecast to 4.1% 
of GDP. The revision implies that the negative 
budgetary impact of the "kick
-start" (0.4% of 
GDP) and lower
-than
-anticipated GDP growth
 will 
be more than offset by higher tax revenues. In 
particular, expected revenues from 
the pension 
yield tax and North Sea activities, benefiting from 
a higher oil price, are higher than in the autumn. 
The widening of the general government deficit 

from 2011 to 2012 reflects,
 in addition to the 
stimulus package, 
the absence of
 the type of
 extraordinary
 pension yield
 revenues 
that affected 
the government balance in 2011, as well as
 the 
lump sum reimbursement of VERP contributions 
estimated
 at almost 1% of GDP
. In the absence of 
this one
-off measure and on the back of 
government consolidation, 
the budget deficit is 

projected to fall back to 2.0% of GDP in 2013. 
 The structural balance is set to deteriorate from 
0.2% of
 GDP in 2011 
to 
-1.0% of
 GDP in 2013. 
However, the structural balance includes very 

volatile revenue items such as pension yield 
tax 
and North Sea oil revenues. Furthermore, the low 
current estimates of potential output growth may 

overstate the contribution of the economic cycle to 

the improvement of the budget balance. From a 

bottom
-up perspective
, net 
discretionary measures
 are es
timated to yield a consolidation of around 
1Â½% 
of GDP over the period 2011
-13. Part of the budget deficits in 2012
-13 will be 
financed by reducing the government's account 

with 
Danmarks Nationalbank
 and
 will only affect 
the net and not the gross government
 debt. 
Thus, 
although the country is running deficits, Denmark's 
gross 
public debt is projected to fall from 46.5% of 
GDP in 2011 to 42.1% in 2013.
 5. GERMANY
 Domestic demand to drive growth over the forecast horizon
  64 Pick-up in activity a
fter contraction in late 2011
 Real GDP expanded by 3.0% in 2011 (after 3.7% 
in 2010), reflecting the still
-strong momentum of 
activity, especially in the first half of the year. 

Growth was predominantly driven by domestic 
demand, which contributed 2.2 pps.
 to the annual 
rate. Private consumption saw its largest increase 
in five years. This was supported by sizeable real 

income gains and a slight reduction in the saving 

rate, both on the back of further benign labour 

market developments, as the number of peo
ple 
employed reached its highest level in 20 years. 

Gross fixed capital formation also continued to 

expand markedly, being the largest single 

contributor to GDP growth. This reflected both 

unabated investment in machinery and equipment 

and the strongest in
crease in construction since the 

mid
-1990s. Net external trade contributed 0.8 pp. 
to GDP growth as exports remained buoyant, while 

imports were also robust on the back of strong 

domestic demand.
 The strong annual growth figures mask the fact 

that growth d
ynamics slowed markedly in the 
course of 2011 as the euro
-area sovereign
-debt 
crisis deepened. Uncertainty weighed on the 

sentiment of economic agents, while new 

industrial orders declined considerably in the 

second half of 2011. Following a gain of 0.6% 

q-o-q (seasonally and working
-day adjusted) in the 
third quarter, the growth momentum was 
temporarily interrupted in the last quarter of the 
year, with a 0.2% q
-o-q decline in real GDP. 
Exports contracted more strongly than imports and 

gross fixed capital f
ormation (notably 
construction) was the only domestic demand 

component making a positive growth contribution. 
 Overall, a
vailable short
-term indicators for the first 
quarter of 2012 point to stabilisation. In particular, 

sentiment indicators for firms and 
households have 
been 
improving, although industrial production 
suffered a setback in February as the harsh weather 

led to a marked decline in construction activity. 
GDP is therefore expected to have 
stagnated 
in the 
first quarter.
 The second quarter is lik
ely to see 
some technical counter
-reaction to the previous 
quarter's weather
-related effects. Moreover, 
although the trend in new orders 
Å both fr
om domestic 
sources 
and from abroad 
Å is still weak, 
firms' assessment of the business outlook has been 
improv
ing over the 
past months
 and the crisis
-related uncertainty should slowly fade away
. Overall, activity is
 therefore 
expected to strengthen 
in the course of the year, with GDP set to expand 
by 0.7% for 
2012 as a whole. On the back of sound 
economic fundamen
tals
, including 
strong labour 
market performance, strong competitiveness and 

corporate balance
-sheet positions
, the limited need 
for household and public balance
-sheet 
adjustments
, as well as a noticeable monetary 
stimulus, domestic demand 
is set to
 remain
 a major
 growth driver
 over the forecast horizon
. As the 
effects of the 
sovereign
-debt crisis fade further, the 
pace of expansion in 
the second half of 2012 and 
in 
2013 is expected to be broadly in line with the 
economy's medium
-term growth potential.
 The 
sovereign
-debt crisis and oil prices remain the key 
risks to the German growth outlook.
 Real income growth to support private 
consumption
 - inflation permitting
 Having recorded a strong rise in 2011, household 
consumption should be the main contributor to 

GDP growth in 2012. Steady gains in employment 

should underpin household confidence, while 
recent wage agreements also point to sound 
nominal income growth. Prospects for real income 

growth and consumption are therefore good, unless 

oil price increases tra
nslate into a more persistent 

rise in inflation than anticipated in the baseline 

scenario. Private consumption should continue to 
expand robustly in 2013, amid still strong nominal 
income growth and lower inflation.

 Member States, Germany
   65 Investment: between uncertainty and 
favourable financing conditions
 Overall, gross fixed capital formation is set to 
expand considerably more slowly this year than 

last year. Amid the current uncertainty, some plans 
for i
nvestment in machinery and equipment are 
likely to remain on hold during the first half of the 
year. However, the monetary environment 
continues to be supportive, as reflected by 
favourable financing conditions for German firms 

and households. This should 
support machinery 

and equipment investment as activity and capacity 

utilisation pick up in the course of the year. While 

the end of temporary stimulus measures weighs on 

public investment, available indicators point to 
continued dynamic private housing inv
estment as 
activity continues to benefit from low real interest 
rates, possibly in conjunction with an increase in 

the perceived risk of investment alternatives.
 Net exports to act as a drag on growth 
 Export prospects are noticeably weaker than in 

2011, w
ith 40% of German exports going to euro
-area Member States, some of which are likely to 

see very subdued imports due to weak domestic 
demand. A gradual recovery of intra
-EU export 
growth is expected as the crisis
-related uncertainty 
dissipates, while expor
ts to emerging economies 
should prove resilient. In view of the expected 
noticeable pick
-up in unit labour cost this year, no 
significant market share gains to offset the 
relatively weak export prospects have been 
factored in. Exports should regain momentu
m in 

the course of 2012 and 2013. Still, imports are 

expected to expand even more quickly, due to 

lively domestic demand. Together with a 
sizeable 
terms
-of-trade deterioration in 2012
, reflecting 
high energy prices, the projected negative
 external 
trade co
ntribution to growth should be reflected in 
a further gradual narrowing of Germany's current
-account surplus over the forecast horizon.
 Labour market
 still improving
 Employment continued to 
rise
 markedly in 2011 
(by 1.3%), with the pace even 
accelerating 
as 
activity declined in the fourth quarter. The 

employment gains resulted in a less than 
proportional reduction in the unemployment rate 
(to 5.8%), given an increase in labour supply 

despite the long
-term unfavourable demographic 
trend. Labour supply benefi
tted from a further 
increase in participation, notably among older 

cohorts, as well as from a stronger
-than
-expected 
net immigration flow, also following the end of 

restrictions for workers from eight of the Member 

States
 that joined the EU in 2004
. With a
 noticeable carry
-over from 2011, a further 
expansion of employment by 0.12 m
illion
 already 
in the first 
two months
 of 2012 and firms' 
assessment of the business outlook improving, 

employment is expected to increase by 
1.0% this 
year and by 0.
4% in 2013. T
he unemployment rate 
should 
fall 
further to an average of 5.
3% next year
, despite a further increase in labour supply due to 

further significant net immigration flows and 

participation increases reflecting the positive 

developments in the German labour mar
ket
.  Wage growth and inflation
 Amid the increasing tightness of the labour market, 

trade unions have tabled demands for 
significant
 wage increases in several sectors. For the public 

sector, often a reference for private sector wage 

negotiations, an agreem
ent was reached for the 
federal level and municipalities resulting in a 6.3% 
wage increase over the forecast horizon. Together 
with wage agreements from 2011, this is projected 

to result in growth in wages per employee of 

around 3% this year and next. With
 subdued 
productivity developments this year, as firms have 

held on to their staff amid the winter semester's 
relatively weak activity 
given
 prospects of 
increasing labour market tightness, this is 
projected to result in a sizeable increase in unit 

labour 
costs. 
 Wage cost developments should also translate into 

a slight pick
-up in core inflation to around 1Â¾% on 
average in 2013. In 2012, inflationary pressures 

from commodity prices are projected to remain 

strong, after oil prices already surprised on the 

upside in late 2011 and the first quarter of this 
year. Overall, this should result in 
an average 
consumer
-price inflation rate of 2.3% this year as 
measured by the HICP. With moderating 
commodity prices, inflation 
sh
ould then return to 
below the 2% benchma
rk in 2013.
 Significant consolidation in 2011
 The general government deficit declined from 

4.3% of GDP in 2010 to 1% of GDP in 2011, 

benefiting from favourable cyclical conditions, the 

robust labour market, the phasing
-out of stimulus 
measures, specific fi
scal consolidation efforts and 
the fading
-out of the one
-off impact of financial 
sector stabilisation measures on the deficit in 2010.

      66 In particular, the strong growth in tax revenues of 
7.1% caused the deficit to fall below the 1.3% of 

GDP predicted in th
e autumn forecast. The debt
-to-GDP ratio decreased to 81.2% in 2011 after 
having surged by 8.6
 pps. to 83.0% in 2010, 
notably due the transfer of impaired assets to "bad 
banks" as part of financial sector stabilisation.
 Slight fiscal improvement in 2012 an
d 2013
 In line with the more moderate growth outlook, the 
deficit is projected to fall only slightly
, to 0.9% of 
GDP in 2012 and to 0.7% of GDP in 2013. In 

2012, consolidation should benefit from the 
phasing
-out of the remaining stimulus measures 
(around 0
.4% of GDP). In contrast, the recent 
wage agreements for the public sector at federal 
and municipal level are estimated to increase 

public expenditure by around 0.2% of GDP in 

2012 and by a further 0.1% of GDP in 2013. The 

reduction 
in the p
ension contribu
tion rate of 
0.3
 pp. at the beginning of 2012 and an expected 
further 0.4
 pp. in 2013, reflecting the favourable 
financial situation of the pension insurance, will 

lower revenues by about 0.1% of GDP
 in 2012 and 
2013 respectively
. The tax reform proposed b
y the 
federal government, which aims to reduce fiscal 

drag and would also lead to revenue losses of 

around 0.1% of GDP in 2013, is still due for 
adoption by the Federal Council and has therefore 
not been taken into account. The structural general 
governmen
t deficit is estimated to fall from 0.
8% of GDP in 2011 to 0.
4% of GDP in 2012 and to 
0.3% of GDP in 2013. Gross debt is projected to 

increase to 82.2% of GDP in 2012 as a result of the 
the euro stabilisation measures and to drop again to 
80.7% of GDP in 2
013 due to the denominator 
effect of GDP growth. The expected transfer of a 
second portfolio of impaired assets from WestLB 

to its "bad bank" ("Erste Abwicklungsanstalt") has 

not yet been specified, but is likely to further 

increase the debt level in 2012.
 On the other hand, 
the winding
-up of assets accumulated in "bad 
banks" could potentially reduce the debt stock.

 â while domestic demand remains s
trong
 A solid domestic demand, supported by 
consumption
 and 
investment
, is expected to feed 
into a 
growth 
rate of real
 GDP 
of 1.6% 
in 2012.
 In 2011, consumption increased by 4.2%
, with 
a high 
contribution from durable goods. 
Consumer 
sentiment has started 
to improve further
 lately and
, combined with 
the 
strong retail trade data from 
latest months, 
could 
lead to 
a relatively strong 
2012 outcome.
 In particular, the
 declining
, but
 still 
positive
, saving rate and increasing disposable 
income, supported by the 4
.4% pension increase in 
April 2012, lead to 
consumption growth 
expectations 
of about 3% 
for 
both 
2012 and 2013.
 Fixed investment is expected to remain strong, 

supported by one
-off public investment in 2012 
and reinforced corporate investment in 2013. 

Inves
tment increased by 26.8% in 2011
, with high 
corporate machinery investment targeted 
at 

increas
ing
 productivity. Corporates are positively 
minded regarding investment, although 
low 

capacity utilisation may still suggest 
a slowdown 
in the growth rate
. Public
 investment
 is expected to 
grow by 
39% in nominal terms 
in 2012, supported 
mainly by spending on energy efficiency
 related to 
CO2 quota revenues
. This, in turn, 
will 
lead to a 
contraction in public investment in 2013.
 The current account, in surplus s
ince 
2009, is 
expected to 
revert to 
negative 
values
. The t
rade 
balance 
may worsen by more than 1
 pp. of GDP in 
2012, since
 weak export growth 
and 
strong 
domestic demand
 will combine
. In 2013, Estoniaâ¢s 
output 
growth is expected to 
rebound to 3.8%
, with 
a revive
d export growth 
supporting domestic demand. 
Householdsâ¢ 

deleveraging 
is expected to 
continu
e, making 
the 
growth pattern more sustainable, but a
lso
 more 
dependent on 
the 
external environment.
 Continuing challenges: labour market
 â After a decline to 11.2% i
n autumn 2011, 
unemployment increased slightly during the 

winter
, with the tourism sector shedding mo
re 
employees than usual after a
 very favourable
 summer season. Slower global growth also played 

a role, with a labour market extremely 
responsive
 and 
the 
manufacturing 
sector 
already 
laying staff
 off 
in 
the last quarter of 2011
. Participation rates 
remain high, while vacancy rates 
are temporarily 
back to pre
-boom levels (2004).
 Unemployment is expected to 
start declining again 
from mid
-2012, 
albeit
 at a much
 slower pace amid 
moderate GDP growth. In particular, l
ess 
employment growth is expected 
in industry, but 
much will depend on how 
quickly
 employers will 
be able to adjust to growing labour costs. Monthly 
gross wages increased by 5.4% on average in 
2011, ma
inly in 
the retailing 
and 
the housing
, but 
also in 
the 
exporting sector, as bonus
 payments 
recovered
 in late 2011
-early 2012. Nominal wage 
growth is expected to remain r
elatively moderate 
at around 4.4
% in 2012 and 5.

    68 real wage growth 
should become increasingly 
positive, at around 0.5% in 2012 and 2.3
% in 
2013. â and rising prices
 After negative values in the first half of 2010, 

average annual HICP inflation rapidly rose and 

reached 5.1% in 2011, spurred by high food and 

oil prices. However
, inflation i
s expected to slow 
down to 3.9
% in 2012, as food 
price 
inflation 
recedes. Nevertheless, housing costs and energy 

prices will continue 
to 
driv
e inflation. In 2013
, inflation is ex
pected to maintain at around 3.4
%, 
pulled upwards by the completi
on of the electricity 

distribution reform on 1 January 2013. In parallel, 
core inflation 
is forecast to
 accelerate again and 
near headline inflation towards the end of 
the 
year.
 Public finances under pressure due to weaker 
economic 
growth and significant i
nvestment 
obligations
 The general government balance recorded a 
surplus of 1% of GDP in 2011 due to the strong 

employment growth and the positive one
-off 
effects related to sales of Kyoto units
 (35) combined 
                                                           (35) An Assigned Amount (or 'Kyoto
' Unit) represents an 
allowance to emit greenhouse gases. In 2010

corre
sponding investment projects.
 Going forward, a mix of cyclical and one
-off 
factors would exert downward pressure on public 

finances. The deficit is expected to reach 2.4% and 
1.3% of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively. 
Among the most significant measures af
fecting 
public finances are 
a number of
 one
-off projects 
and the planned pension increases. Moreover, the 

cessation of the temporary measures introduced in 

2009 Å a suspension of the contributions to the II 
pillar pension funds and the temporary limitation
s 
to local governments borrowing 
Å will negatively 
affect the general government position. In 2013, 

total current expenditure is set to grow by 4.5% 

due to expected increases in public sector wages 

and the carry
-over of the one
-off investment 
projects.
 Net
 of cyclical factors and one
-offs, the general 
government defi
cit is estimated at 0.8% and 0.5
% of GDP in 2012 and 2013. The general 

government debt will increase over the forecast 

horizon
, to 11.7% of GDP in 2013.

 7. IRELAND
 On-going domestic adjustment supported by export growth
  69 The Irish economy stabilises in 2011
 The Irish economy returned to growth in 2011 
after three years of contraction. GDP increased by 

0.7% for the year, although the divergence 
between the export
-oriented and domestic sectors 
continued. While net exports added 4.7
 pps. to 
growth, domestic demand continued to contract, as 

household balance
-sheet adjustment continued, 
and both fiscal consol
idation and contracting 
employment reduced disposable incomes. The 

effects of public and private sector deleveraging 
will continue to weigh on growth in 2012. 
However this will be offset again by external 

demand, so that overall real GDP growth of 0.5% 

is 
forecast for this year. Growth is then expected to 
pick up to 1.9% in 2013 as domestic demand 

stabilises and trading partner growth increases.
 Domestic demand to contract again
 Domestic demand fell for the fourth successive 

year in 2011. Private consumptio
n decreased by 

2.7%, government consumption by 3.7%, and 

investment by 10.6%. For 2012, the contribution to 
growth from domestic demand is set to be negative 
once again, albeit smaller. In 2013, the 

contribution to growth from domestic demand will 

be essen
tially flat, as investment levels stabilise, 
household consumption returns to growth (due to a 

slight decline of the precautionary element of 
savings) and public consumption continues to be 
reduced.
 Exports set to remain key engine of growth
 Irish exports 
expanded by a healthy 4.1% in 2011, 

although there was some slowdown in the second 

half of the year on the back of the weaker pace of 

activity in trading partners. Export growth was 
driven by the solid performance of the capital
-intensive multinational sec
tor. Gains were also 
seen by indigenous firms due to competitiveness 
improvements (unit labour costs continued to fall 

on the back of productivity improvements and 

wage moderation). Export growth is expected to 
slow to 3.2% in 2012. Prospects for demand in
 Ireland's trading partners are mixed, with the small 

contraction in the euro area expected to be offset 

by an upward revision to US growth.
 Employment stabilises and inflation stays low
 Although employment contracted by 2.1% in 2011 

as a whole, it grew by
 a seasonally adjusted 0.6% 
in the final quarter of 2011, the first quarter of 

employment growth 
since 2007. This growth came 
from export
-oriented
 sectors such as IT, tourism 
and manufacturing. While 
the broader 
employment 
situation is improving, 
agreed re
ductions
 in public 
sector employment and firm
-specific developments 
in the financial sector will lead to a 
further 
employment 
contraction for 2012 as a whole. 
For 
2013, some employment growth, albeit slow, is 
expected, as the drag on growth from domestic 

demand slows. This should lead to a small fall in 
the unemployment rate to 13.6% as participation 

remains flat and net outward migration continues. 

Inflation is forecast to rise slightly to 1.7% in 

2012. Core inflation will stay low, with upward 
pressure on
 the headline figures coming from 
higher energy prices, indirect taxes and a number 
of administered price increases throughout 2012. 

Inflation is expected to decline to 1.2% in 2013 as 

energy price
-related effects fall out of the annual 
comparison.
 Fiscal 
adjustment 
on track
 The headline government deficit stood at 13.1% of 

GDP in 2011. Excluding one
-off bank support 
measures of 3.7% of GDP, the underlying deficit 

was 9.4% of GDP. The better
-than
-expected 
outturn reflects expenditure savings achieved 

throug
h tight expenditure control, prudent design 
of the budget and 
higher
-than
-expected revenues 
from 
fees for 
bank guarantee
s and government's 
investment in the 
bank
s. These, together with 
savings on the interest bill (following reductions in 
margins on EU loa
ns), outweighed the effect of the 
challenging macroeconomic backdrop.
 The general government deficit is projected to 
decrease to 8.3% of GDP in 2012, below the 

government's 2012 budget forecast (8.6% of 

GDP). The budget introduced a fiscal adjustment 
of 2%
 of GDP in new measures on top of Â¾% of 
GDP from measures already introduced in 2011. 
A further improvement comes from lower interest 
expenditure, higher revenues from both fees for 

bank guarantees and bank dividends, as well as the 

stronger
-than
-expected 
employment figures since 
the budget.

forecast
% of GDP
 For 2013, the projected government deficit of 

7.5% of GDP includes a planned adjustment of 

2.1% of GDP, o
f which two thirds will fall on 

expenditure.
 Estim
ates of the annual change in the 
structural balance are 
smaller due to low potential 

growth following structural change in the 

economy.
 The debt
-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at 
120% of GDP in 2013. The
 increase in debt is 
driven by still
-high primary deficits, additional 
banking support measures, and rising debt 

servicing costs. The gross debt level is also 

affected by the substantial precautionary cash 

balances, which are assumed at 7Â½% of GDP at 
the e
nd of 2013.
 Risks remain balanced
 Risks to the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook 
remain broadly balanced. Downside risks include 

the continuing squeeze on disposable incomes as 

households seek to deleverage in light of the 
substantial fall in their net weal
th since 2008, the 
bulk of it due to declining property values. 

Lending 
to the SME and household sector 
continues to contract. On the production side, there 

is potential for a number
 of drugs falling off
-patent 
this year and thus depressing industrial outp
ut. In 
terms of upside risks, any improvement in trading 

partner growth may pass through to increased 
exports and employment. Given the 
competitiveness improvements achieved since 

2008, Ireland may see an increase in its market 

share of global trade. Final
ly, the low
-interest
-rate 
environment may allow a smaller contraction in 

private consumption while still supporting the 

necessary household balance sheet repair.
 8. GREECE
 An economy longing for the turnaround
  71 Looking for
 the turning poin
t in activity
 â The contraction in economic activity in the fourth 
quarter of 2011 was far deeper than expected. The 

quarterly accounts indicate that real GDP fell by 

7.5%
 in the last three months of 2011, compared 
with the same quarter of 2010. For the ye
ar as a 
whole, real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 

6.9
%. In 2012 a further contraction is expected, 
resulting
 from both a significant fall in internal 
demand and 
less
 dynamism in exports
 than 
expected
. Households' disposable income being 
hit 
by ris
ing unemployment
, cuts in private sector 
wages
 and the fiscal measures
 will keep domestic 
demand contracting. Also, unfavourable business 

and consumer sentiment and 
difficulties in 
access 
to credit
 for
 firms and households
 will contribute 
to their 
postponi
ng spending decisions
. The 
recovery, which was previously expected for 
this
 year, will be 
further delayed with, at best,
 an 
insignificant improvement in activity in 2013.
 Employment has taken a heavy blow in the face of 

contracting economic activity. Total
 employment 
declined by almost 
7% in 2011 and an additional 
fall is forecast in 2012, with the unemployment 

rate projected at 20%. Labour market reforms are 

expected to provide a significant contribution 

towards both stabilising the employment level and 

creating new jobs in the medium
-term perspective; 
however, employment is not expected to stabilise 

before 2013, and the subsequent recovery in the 
number of jobs will be slow.
 â while internal devaluation
 gains momentum
 Greek n
et exports 
are making a positiv
e contribut
ion
 to GDP and 
will
 remain 
a major
 source of growth in 2012
. But the extent of this 
positive effect will depend on 
Greek exporters
' ability
 to secure benefits from the labour market 
and sectoral 
reforms through increased 

productivity, lower prod
uction costs, and therefore 

gains in competitiveness. The gains in market 

shares that are projected for 2012 and 2013 are 

only a fraction of the losses 
seen 
during the 
previous decade.
 The current
-account deficit
, although contracting, 
remains
 at an unsust
ainable level. 
It was
 still
 above 
10% of GDP in 2011, 2 points better than in 2010 
and 4 points below 2009. The slow correction in 
the external imbalance will continue in 2012 
and in 
2013, 
driven by 
growing 
exports and an expected 
further 
contraction in im
ports, 
reflecting forecast 
developments in domestic demand, but also shifts 
in relative prices
. The current account should also 
improve in 2012 in the context of restructuring of 

government debt and the concomitant reduction of 
interest paid to the rest of
 the world.

 Inflation 
inertia 
remains high for an economy that 
is entering its fifth year of recession. 
Both HICP 
and constant tax inflation have
 remained 
persistently po
sitive, in contradiction to the 
expectation of a fast internal devaluation. 
However, t
he low lev
el of economic activity in 
2012 and the reduction in private sector wages 
is 
expected to 
moderate prices, with 
slightly 
negative 
inflation rates expected in 201
2 and 2013. 
This is 
based on the assumption that 
action to promote 
competition in the goods and services market 
will
 allow the reduction in labour costs to be passed on 

to consumers.
 The closure of the competitiveness gap is expected 

to accelerate. Followi
ng years of continued 
growth, well in excess of its main trading partners, 
unit labour costs are now clearly declining. Wages 
in the business sector have been falling in recent

at a pace that was insufficient to help

measures are expected to contribute to 
further 
significant
 reductions in
 labour costs over the next 
two years. Also, the product and service market 

reform will have a crucial role in increasing

forecast
Graph II.8.2:
Greece - Inflation and inflation at

 Continued p
rogress in 
reducing 
the 
fiscal 
deficit.
 The 2011 general government deficit fell to 9.1% 
of GDP from 10.3% of GDP in 2010. The decline 

in the deficit ratio resulted from an increase in the 

revenue
-to-GDP ratio of 1.2 pps., while the 
primary expenditure ratio as a share of GDP fell by 
1.4 pps. The increase in interest expenditure of 

more than 1 pp. means that the improvement in the 

primary deficit was almost 2Â½ pps. The general 
government consolidated gross debt in 2011 was 

above 165% o
f GDP, up from 145% of GDP in 

2010.  In 2012 the general government deficit is projected 
at 7.3% of GDP, which is consistent with a target 
for the primary deficit of 1% of GDP. To achieve 

this objective, the Government adopted cuts in 
expenditure of 1.5% o
f GDP in the first quarter. 
The Government aims at achieving a primary 

surplus of 1.8% of GDP in 2013. Based on current 

projections, this would require additional 

expenditure savings of 3.8% of GDP to be 

identified in coming months.
 The 
implementation of t
he 
debt exchange 
(private 
sector involvement or PSI)
 will help to 
put 
Greek 
public finance
s back on a sustainable path. 
However, given the sluggish economy, the debt 

ratio will only start to decline in a sustainable 

manner after 2013. 
  9. SPAIN
 Difficult times ahead
  73 Rebalancing continues as the economy enters 
into recession
 Spain is undergoing a deep structural adjustment 
following the reversal of the housing and 

construction boom. The large stock of accumulated 

private sector debt is pro
mpting deleveraging 
among households and non
-financial corporations. 
The banking sector, which still has significant 

exposure to the real estate and construction sector, 

is undergoing necessary restructuring and 

recapitalisation. Unemployment is unacceptab
ly 
high and is likely to increase further. Finally, 
public finances need to be brought back onto a 
sustainable path. The correction of these 

imbalances will affect domestic demand adversely 

over the forecast horizon, although a gradual 

improvement is expec
ted in 2013. Resilient 
exports and weaker imports, implied by subdued 

domestic demand, should continue to support 
net 
exports
 and, thus, economic growth. 
 Real GDP is expected to contract by 1.8% in 2012 
and by 0.3% in 2013 due to a large negative carry
-over. In the 
last
 quarter of 2011
, Spain entered 
recession, driven by 
a larger
-than
-expected 
deterioration in the labour market, lower public 

expenditure, and deteriorating credit conditions, 

while the euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis 
intensified and external
 demand weakened. 
Internal demand is set to act as a drag on growth in 

2012, only partially compensated 
for 
by external 
demand. The contraction is expected to be 
at its
 strongest in the second half of 2012, reflecting the 

short
-term impact of consolidation
 efforts
. In 2013, 
quarterly GDP growth is projected to turn positive, 

but this is subject to the no
-policy
-change 
assumption
. Tensions in European wholesale financial markets, 

with negative spill
-over effects on credit supply, 
were alleviated by the ECB's
 policy intervention of 
providing longer
-term liquidity. However, the 
Spanish financial system as a whole remains 

vulnerable to market tensions given its large 

exposure to problematic real estate and 
construction assets, a weak economic outlook and 
large r
efinancing needs. In the short term, the 
necessary adjustment of bank balance sheets will 

contribute to keeping credit flow to the economy 

very constrained, which will dampen private 

consumption and investment.

Note: all variables are in nominal terms.
 Weak domestic demand
: a drag on economic 
growth
 Private consumption is expected to be 
very weak
 in 2012,
 driven by persistently high 
and still rising 
unemployment, large household debt, and a 

binding credit constraint.
 Households' disposable 
income is set to decline significantly due to higher 

employment destruction, slower wage growth, and 

an increase in income taxes. In addition, 

households' 
wealth 
will be reduced given an 
expected further fall in house prices. However,
 due 
to forecast lower inflation, the fall in gross 
disposable income in real terms is likely to be 
comparable to 2011. The s
avings rate is expected 
to 
decrease to around 11% as households try to 
smooth their consumption. Nevertheless, 

households should re
main net lenders over the 
forecast horizon given that they are expected to 

continue to reduce investment in housing
.  Non
-financial corporations are expected to 
increase their gross operating surplus, due to a 

further decline in labour costs, and their gro
ss 
saving should grow despite the increase in their 

direct taxes. I
nvestment
, particularly investment in 
equipment,
 is 
set
 to 
decline
 given the unfavourable 
economic outlook, 
high corporate indebtedness, 
excess capacity and difficult access to credit.
 All 
in 
all, corporations are expected to increase their net 

lending position, thus increasing the potential for a 

faster
 reduction of accumulated debt.
 Residential investment was weak in 2011. The 

decline in house prices accelerated to 11% in the 

last quarter 
(in year
-on-year terms) and prices are 
expected to continue falling in the short term, 

paving the way for further adjustment of the 
European Economic Foreca
st, Spring 2012
   74 housing sector and possibly a slight reduction in 
the large stock of unsold houses. Non
-residential 
investment is expected t
o decline, driven mostly by 
fiscal consolidation measures and, to a lesser 
extent, by corporations reducing their investment. 
Public consumption is also expected 
to fall, 
reflecting 
fiscal consolidation 
needs, including 
those addressed in the 2012 budget
. Strong support from exports growth
 Exports growth is expected to remain robust over 
the forecast horizon although the pace of growth 

should ease. Declining unit labour costs (ULC) and 

improving product and regional diversification 
have allowed Spain to inc
rease its export market 
share 
Å a trend that is expected to continue over the 
forecast horizon
, which is important
 to further 
reduce the high external deficit
. As a result of 
relatively strong exports and falling imports, 
Spain's trade balance has signific
antly improved. 

In particular, the non
-energy goods balance was 
close to equilibrium, while the non
-tourist services 
balance moved into a surplus at the end of 2011. 

This resulted in an accelerated correction of the 

current
-account deficit, which declined 
to 3.9% of 
GDP in 2011 and is expected 
to 
be close to
 balance 
by 2013.
 However, the high dependence of the 
Spanish economy on energy imports and the high 

and increasing interest burden may constrain the 
necessary improvement of the current account. 
 Employ
ment
 set to decrease further
 The l
abour market 
situation 
deteriorated further, 
beyond what was expected in the autumn forecast, 
and 
the unemployment rate 
reached
 22.8% in 
the 
last quarter of 
2011. Looking beyond the overall 
figures, the composition of the 
labour market 

adjustment has also changed. In the last quarter of 

2011, permanent employment fell by more (
-3.4%) 
than temporary employment (
-2.5%), contrary to 
the pattern seen in previous quarters. In addition, 
most of the adjustment took place through a
 reduction in the number of workers rather than 
through the reduction in the hours worked, which 

further increased unemployment.
 The recent labour market reform allows firms 

greater flexibility to adjust wages and employment 
to their specific economic situ
ation. Given the 
current weakness of the Spanish economy, this 
reform is likely to result in more moderate growth 

(or even a reduction) in wages and some further 

falls in employment in the short term.
 Moderation in wage growth and inflation
 Inflation decel
erated 
towards 
the end of 2011, due 
to the fading out of temporary effects (VAT and 

excise duty increases) and some moderation 
in energy price
 growth
. Over the forecast horizon, 
weak 
domestic
 demand is expected to put 
downward pressure on core inflation. H
owever, 
compared to the autumn 2011, the inflation 

forecast for 2012 has been revised upward
s, 
mainly due to higher expected oil prices. In 

addition, 
an increase in some administered prices 
(including electricity, gas, and public transport) 

will also put s
ome upward pressure on prices
. Wage growth is expected to be moderate and, in 
combination with the projected continued strong 
growth in labour productivity, will further reduce 

ULC. T
he inflation differential with the euro area 
is expected to be negative, 
leading to some 

improvement in price competitiveness.
  Risks to baseline scenario
 This forecast is subject to considerable risks. An 

intensification of the sovereign
-debt crisis could 
significantly increase Spain's risk premium. Also, 

a further deteriorati
on in bank balance sheets could 
have negative consequences for lending to the real 

economy and public finances. Higher
-than
-expected oil prices would affect the Spanish 

economy disproportionally given its oil 

dependence. In addition, the household saving r
ate 
could 
increase
 due to greater precautionary saving. 
 Ambitious fiscal consolidation planned
 The general government deficit was 
8.5% of GDP
 in 2011, above the government target of
 6%. 
About two thirds of this
 deviation 
was due to 
Autonomous Communities
, while s
lippages at 
central government and social security were more 

limited.
 The deviation 
was
 driven mainly by 
weaker
-than
-expected revenues
, linked to lower
-than
-foreseen growth and weak tax elasticities
. Notably
, taxes on production and imports (VAT, 
taxes on real estate transactions) recorded major 
shortfalls, affecting both the central and regional 

government
s. Social contributions also came in 
weaker in line with a stronger
-than
-expected 
deterioration in the labour market.
 In 2012, the general govern
ment deficit is 
projected to reach 6.4% of GDP. This would imply 

a reduction of slightly over 2 pps. of GDP 

compared with 2011. On 30 March 2012, Spain 

adopted its draft 2012 budget law, which targets a

      75 central government deficit of 3.5% of GDP (down 
from 
5.1% of GDP in 2011) and a balanced budget 
for social security. For general government, the 

target is a deficit of 5.3% of GDP. Whereas the 
target of the central government should be within 
reach, deviations are projected at this stage for 
regional governm
ents. This reflects the standard 
no-policy
-change assumption and the fact that not 
all consolidation measures at regional level for 
2012 have been specified yet. Moreover, the social 

security system is projected to record a deficit 

again this year in line 
with a deteriorating labour 
market outlook.
 Total revenues are set 
to rise by 
0.9% of 
GDP in 
2012, boosted by revenue
-increasing fiscal 
measures mainly in direct taxation, such as 

changes to income and corporate taxation.
 Some of 
these measures are tempora
ry in nature (e.g. 

increase in income taxes, a change in the 'tax 

instalment' system for corporate taxes). This 
forecast does not incorporate the expected impact 
of the fiscal amnesty and additional measures to 

fight tax fraud, given the uncertainties invo
lved in 
estimating the additional revenue created by such 

measures. The successful implementation of the 

fiscal amnesty would imply a better fiscal outcome 

than currently projected. Total expenditure is 
expected to decline 
by 1.2% of GDP,
 underpinned 
by 
deep cuts in ministerial spending levels
. The 
budget envisages major cuts in capital spending 
and 
Å to a lesser extent 
Å in current spending, 
including
 a freeze in public sector wages and 
hiring stops for public employees. The recently
 announced regional
 sav
ings in the areas of health 
and education are taken into account in this 
forecast and have an impact in 2012 and 2013.
 Risks 
appear to
 be broadly balanced. An even 
deeper
-than
-projected recession or greater 
sensitivity of revenues to the 
on-going structura
l adjustment 
could entail 
bigger
 revenue shortfalls 
and higher social expenditure
. On the contrary
, strict enforcement of th
e Budget Stability Law 
and 
the adoption 
and implementation 
of strong fiscal 
measures at regional level 
would m
itigate the risks 
of a
 slippage
. Based on the no
-policy
-change 
assumption, the budget deficit is forecast to reach 

6Â¼% of GDP in 2013. 
 The structural balance is expected to improve from 
a deficit 
of 
7Â¼% of GDP in 2011 to 4Â¾% of GDP 
in 2012 and 
2013. Amidst the still
-high publi
c deficits and negative GDP growth, 
government 
debt is set to increase from 68.5% of GDP 
in 
2011 
to 87.0% of GDP in 2013
. 10. FRANCE
 Resilient economic growth so far, slow recovery ahead
  76 A growth pattern blurred by temporary items
 After months of uncertainty and a weak economic 
environment, recent signals seem to point towards
 a recovery of the French economy in 2012. A 

stronger
-than
-expected 
economic growth in the 
fourth quarter of 
2011 (0.2%), together with 
a 
straightening up in 
the 
consumption of goods and 
services in the first few months of 2012
, suggest 
that France is faring better compared 
with
 its main 
peers in the euro area. However, this needs to be 

put in p
erspective
, as some temporary effects seem 
to have also played a significant role in these 

broadly positive developments. 
 Results 
in the fourth quarter of 
2011 were strongly 
supported by dynamic investments, particularly by 
non
-financial companies, and by
 exports. Part of 
the surge in investment can be linked to the 
anticipation by firms of the higher taxation of cars 
which came into force on 
1 January
, 2012. Exports 
benefited from exceptional sales in the 

aeronautical sector. The rise in energy 

consumptio
n in February 2012, on the back of 
colder weather than usual, seems to have sustained 
private consumption. Without these temporary 
elements the slowdown of the French economy 

would have been more pronounced.
 In 2012, the recovery would therefore be slower 

than could be expected from the latest economic 

results. 
Private consumption would not play its 
usual role as 
an 
engine for growth, although it 
might be resilient enough as to 
prevent
 the country 
from 
enter
ing
 a recession. Instead, investment is to 
set the
 pace for the overall economic recovery. 
With 0.5% annual GDP growth, the French 

economy is nevertheless forecast to be on a 
somewhat more dynamic path than most of the 
other 
euro
-area 
Member States. 
 In 2013, this moderately positive trend is expected 

to 
gradually gain momentum. Increased confidence 
of private households is forecast to allow for a 

decrease 
in the savings rate, and investment would 
gradually return to the pace seen in 2011. Overall, 

real GDP growth is expected to increase to 1.3%
 in 
2013, only marginally 
below the 1.
4% expected in 
the 
autumn 2011 
forecast
, but 
slightly
 above the 
average for the euro area.
 Labour market: not yet out of the woods
 Employment has fallen in the second semester 

with the number of employees in the private sector 

down by 0.3%. The unemployment rate rose by a 
cumulated 0.3 pp. in the last two quarters of 2011. 
The statistics provided by the unemployment 
offices
 suggest that long
-term unemployment and 
unemployment among senior workers increased 

most. 
 The slow economic
 recovery is expected to be 
insufficient to stop the deterioration in the job 

market. After reaching 9.
7% in 2011, the 
unemployment rate is expected to increase to 

10.2% in 2012 and to stabili
se at 10.
3% in 2013. 
 Labour market prospects to weigh on privat
e consumption and the speed of the recovery
 The recovery of private consumption in 2012 and 

2013 will be dampened by negative 
developments 

in the labour market. The high level of 
unemployment is likely to weigh on wage 
negotiations. In a context of relativ
ely high 
inflation, real wages are 
set to
 remain flat in 2012 
and 2013.

forecast
 Uncertainties 
about
 the labour market should also 
have a negative impact on the propensity to 
consume, with s
avings being maintained at a high 
level in 2012. In 2013, households 
should reduce 
their level of precautionary savings on the back of 
the foreseen stabilisation 
in the labour market and 
a better economic outlook.

   77 Gradual pick up 
in investment
 In the seco
nd semester 
of 
2011, pessimism 
among
 investors, together with concerns about a potential 
credit crunch
, led to high uncertainty. In early 
2012, the intervention by the ECB dampened 
worries on the credit market and contributed to a 
significant improvement i
n economic sentiment. 
 However, the conditions for a rapid pick
-up 
in investment do not yet seem to be met. Sluggish 

expectations 
make
 investors
 behave cautiously
, as 
the limited demand for credit shows. The operating 

surplus of French companies, which rea
ched a low 
point in 2011, is expected to 
continue to
 constrain 
their ability to invest
.  Lower 
investment in 
the 
car sector (which was 
very dynamic in the fourth quarter of 
2011) and 

the impact of low temperatures
 on the construction 
sector in February are
 expected to translate into 
temporar
ily negative investment growth in the first 
quarter 
of 
2012. Increasing confidence is then 
projected to start 
to drive
 a gradual recovery 
throughout the forecast period, leading to a 

virtuous cycle in 2013, with increase
d demand and 
improved profitability resulting in a partial catch
-up 
in investment. 
 After the strong destocking observed in the last 
quarter
 of 2011, the level of stocks 
sh
ould stabilise 
over the forecast horizon. Due to a strong carry
-over, stocks would m
ake a negative contribution to 
growth in 2012 and a neutral contribution in 2013. 
 External trade driven by the modest rebound in 
external demand
 After a dynamic 
fourth quarter of 
2011, driven by 
steady sales by the aeronautic industry, exports are 

expecte
d to slow down in 2012 due to sluggish 
international demand. In 2013, the projected 
recovery of demand in the EU, together with 

efforts to curb the losses in export market shares, 

would result in recovering exports. 
 Due to the weakness of dom
estic demand
, imports 
are expected to remain depressed in 2012. Net 
external trade would therefore contribute 

positively to growth in 2012. In 2013, the 

contribution from net exports would be neutral. 
 Decreasing inflationary pressures 
 The rapid increase 
in energy pri
ces in 2011 has 
contributed to the relatively high level of inflation 
despite a gloomy economic context. In 2012, 

although oil prices are 
assumed
 to stabilise, the 
recent increase is set to gradually feed through and 

the HICP inflation likely to be broadly
 unchanged 
at 2.
1%, 
from
 2.3% in 2011.
 In 2013, the inflation rate is expected to continue 

to decrease to 1.9% on the back of high levels of 

unemployment and weak level of economic 

growth. The increase in the reduced VAT rate 

from 5.5% to 7%, the announced
 rise in the 
general rate from 19.6% to 21.2% in October 2012
 and
 additional taxes on tobacco 
are
 forecast to 
dampen the impact of expected downward 

pressures on inflation.      
 Increasingly balanced risks
 Beyond the risks associated with the general 

econ
omic environment, specific risks 
relating to
 the French economy appear more balanced than in 

the autumn 
of 
2011. 
 The return of confidence in the private sector in 
early 2012 after months of continuous 
deterioration could signal a stronger recovery. In 

thi
s case, a faster pick
-up 
in investment, together 
with a possibly lower level of savings rate would 

improve the growth profile of France. 
 On the other hand, although a number of 
uncertainties related to the financial sector have 

been lifted, the impact of 
stronger capital 

requirements of banks could have a stronger than 

expected adverse impact on credit standards, hence 

limiting the level of investment by
 companies. 
 Improved fiscal position with challenges 
remaining
 In 2011, the general government deficit 
reached 
5.2% of GDP, down from 7.1% in 2010 and below 

the official target of 5.7% (the target was also 

overachieved in 2010). 
While partly due to the 
phasing out of the remaining
 stimulus measures,
 exceptional
 military equipment expenditure 
recorded in 201
0 and some other exceptional 
factors (adding up to nearly 1% of GDP)
, the 
deficit reduction also stems from new measures on 
the 
revenue side (0.7
%); growth 
above potential 
also played a role (0.2%)
. The better outcome 
compared to the autumn 2011 forecast, 
which 
projected a deficit of 5.8% of GDP, partly comes 

from windfall revenues and statistical

      78 reclassifications, implying only a limited base 
effect for 2012. 
 Turning to 2012, the deficit is expected to decrease
 further 
on the back of the consolidation me
asures 
announced in 
the second half of 2011 and in 
January 2012
 (estimated impact of 
around 1% of 
GDP) and adopted as part of the supplementary 
budget for 2011 as well as the budget and the 

supplementary budget for 2012
. These measures 
are mainly revenue b
ased (0.8% of GDP). They 
include a further cut in tax expenditures; 
no 
indexation of tax brackets concerning personal 
income tax and tax on wealth
 in 2012
Å13; limiting 
the possibilities for carrying over losses in the 
calculation of corporate income tax; a
n additional 
temporary tax on top incomes and large 

companies; 
higher taxes on capital 
income and 
gains
; an increase in VAT 
for several categories of 
goods and services
 enjoying a reduced rate (from 
5.5% to 7%)
; and a rise in excise duties on tobacco 
and a
lcohol. On the expenditure side, savings 
come from cuts in central government expenditure; 

an only partial indexation 
of some social benefits 
(e.g. family and housing)
; and a tighter healthcare 
spending norm.
 Furthermore, the 2010 pension 
reform will start
 to yield budgetary savings. 
On the 
other hand, 
economic 
growth 
below potential will
 have a negative im
pact on the headline deficit. 
Overall, the 2012 deficit is projected to reach 4Â½% 

of GDP
.  The deficit is expected to continue to decrease in 
2013, albei
t only slightly, remaining above 4% of 
GDP. The rise in social benefits is set to decelerate 

thanks to the economic recovery and the increasing 
impact of the pension reform. Already adopted 

revenue measures of around 0.2% of GDP will 

also contribute to low
ering the deficit. However, 
under the usual no
-policy
-change assumption, the 
expected outcome remains significantly above the 

official target of 3% of GDP
. Projected higher 
expenditure growth and lower GDP growth 

prospects are the main drivers explaining t
he 
difference.
  Overall, this implies a cumulated improvement in 

the structural balance of around 1Â¼% of GDP in 

2012Å13, mainly concentrated in 2012.
 The debt ratio is expected to continue to rise over 

the forecast horizon on the back of still
-high 
expecte
d deficits. The public loan launched in 

2010 (the so
-called 
"investissement
s d'avenir"
 programme
, notably consisting in public 
investment
) is set to have only a marginal impact.
  11. ITALY
 A slow exit from the new recession
  79 The sovereign
-debt crisis hits the real economy
 The Italian economy has been hit hard by the
 euro
-area 
sovereign
-debt 
crisis. The sharp increase 
in government
-bond yields 
in the final months of
 2011 translated into higher financing costs for 
Italian banks. As 
credit conditions 
for firms
 tightened and 
economic agents' confidence 
deteriorat
ed,
 domestic 
demand
 plunged
. In the last 
quarter of 2011
, real GDP contracted by 0.7% 
q-o-q, after
 falling by
 -0.2% in the third quarter
, while i
n 2011 as a whole 
it rose by 
only 
0.4%
.  After incorporating the large GDP decline in the 

fourth quarter of 2011, economic activity entered 

2012 with a negative growth impulse of 0.5 pp. It 

is set to continue to contract
 in the first half of 
2012, as spending and investment plans of 

consumers and firms are held back by poor labour 
market prospects and still
-high uncertainty in 
financial markets. Real GDP is expected to have 
declined by a further 0.7% 
q-o-q in the first qu
arter 
of 2012 and to fall by 0.4% in the second quarter. 

Under the assumption of no further worsening in 

financial market conditions and yields on 10
-year 
Italian sovereign bonds slightly below 6%, output 

is expected to stabilise in the third quarter of 20
12 
and to start expanding only mildly as of the last 

quarter of 2012. As a result, real GDP is set to fall 

by 1.
4% in
 2012 and increase by 0.4% in 2013. 
 Domestic demand is set to fall sharply in 2012
 The fall in households' real disposable income
 Å relate
d to a weak labour market and the on
-going 
large fiscal consolidation 
Å affects private 
consumption, which has been declining since the 
second quarter of 2011. Consumption is set to 
continue to fall until the end of 2012 and to 

stabilise only in 2013. Gros
s fixed capital 
formation is being shaped by tight financing 

conditions and falling demand. Equipment 

investment declined sharply in the final quarter of 
2011 and is set to continue to contract in the first 
half of 2012. However, firms are expected to 

resu
me their investment plans already in the 
second half of the year, on the back of recovering 

foreign demand and gradually easing financing 

conditions. By contrast, construction investment is 

projected to continue to fall over the entire forecast 
horizon. 
 The drop in domestic demand, and particularly in 
gross capital formation, is expected to lead to a 
significant fall in imports in 2012, to be followed 

by a mild recovery in 2013. Driven by the 
expected sustained demand from extra
-EU trade 
partners, exports 
are set to expand throughout the 
forecast horizon, accelerating as of the second half 

of 2012. Against this background, the contribution 

of net exports to real GDP growth is expected to 

remain positive over the forecast horizon
 due to 
subdued imports. Stil
l, some moderate loss in 
export market shares is expected over 2012
-13, 
after the temporary improvement recorded in 

2010-11. Owing to the improved trade balance, the current
-account deficit is projected to narrow significantly 
in 2012. The external deficit
 is set to also continue 
to narrow in 2013 thanks to accelerating exports 
and improving terms of trade.

 Rising unemployment and wage moderation 
 On the back of declini
ng economic activity, the 
gradual recovery in headcount employment which 

had started at the end of 2010 came to a halt in the 
last quarter of 2011. The unemployment rate 
started to rise again in the second half of 2011, 

driven by a sharp rise in the youth 
unemployment 

rate. In 2012, headcount employment 

developments are projected to be slightly less 

negative than those for hours worked, thanks to a 

higher use of the wage supplementation 
scheme 
(CIG), whereby employees
 temporarily suspend or 
reduce activity,
 but keep their job and 
receive 
income
 support. In 2013, both measures of 
employment are expected to remain stable. At the 
European Economic Forecast, Spring 2012
   80 same time, labour force participation is set to 
continue to recover, driven by gradually rising 

employment rates for the older age gr
oups 
Å due to 
the recently adopted pension reforms 
Å and a 
return to the labour market of inactive workers 

who are now impelled to look for jobs by the fall 
in households' disposable income. As a 
consequence, over 2012
-13 the unemployment rate 
is projected
 to rise by more than 1 pp. compared to 
2010-11. Wage increases 
in the private sector 
are projected 

to remain below inflation over the forecast 
horizon, while public sector wages continue to be 
frozen. These moderate wage developments are 

compounded by the
 stagnation in labour 
productivity expected over 2012
-13, on account of 
the negative cyclical conditions and some labour 

hoarding by firms. As a result, nominal unit labour 

costs are projected to increase by around 1Â¼% on 

average in 2012
-13. This, together
 with some 
exchange rate depreciation, entails some recovery 

in cost competitiveness vis
-Ã -vis Italy's main trade 
partners.  
 Higher oil prices and taxes weigh on inflation 
 HICP is set to accelerate in 2012, despite falling 

domestic demand and moderate pr
essures from 
labour costs, and to ease thereafter. This is 

explained by the further rise in oil prices and the 
effects of fiscal consolidation measures. The 
standard VAT rate was increased by 1 pp. in 

September 2011, while excise duties on fuel were 

raised
 after the new consolidation package adopted 
in December 2011. The forecast also incorporates 

the additional 2 pps. increase in both the 21% 
standard VAT rate and the 10% reduced rate which 
is due to enter into force in October 2012.
  Core 
HICP inflation 
Å i.e. excluding energy and 
unprocessed food 
Å is set to go above 3% in the 
final quarter of 2012 and then to start to decrease 

to reach 1.5% by end
-2013, under the assumption 
of no second
-round effects on wages from the 
increase
 in inflation due to higher 
indirect taxation.
 A structural balanced budget in 2013
 Italy's public finances continued to improve in 

2011, with the 
general government 
deficit falling 

to 3.9% of GDP (from 4.6% in 2010) thanks also 

to some one
-off measures. Interest expenditure 
grew to 
4.9% of GDP, while the primary balance 
moved to a surplus of 1% of GDP. Primary 

expenditure fell both in nominal terms 
Å for the 
second year in a row 
Å and as a share of GDP. The 
moderate rise in current primary expenditure was 

largely due to a decline in 
compensation of public 
sector employees, while the significant fall in 
capital spending is explained by both further 
reductions in subsidies to investment and the 
one
-off sale of broadband licences, recorded as 
negative expenditure. Total revenues rose bro
adly 
in line with nominal GDP. Income taxes remained 

flat in nominal terms, also due to the partial 

postponement to 2012 of the first instalment of 

self
-assessed personal income taxes. Conversely, 
indirect taxes rose driven by the VAT rate increase 

of Sept
ember and higher excise duties. Capital 
taxes also increased, mainly due to the one
-off 
levy on the revaluation of corporate assets.
 In 201
2, t
he 
general government 
deficit is 
projected to 
further 
decline
, to 
2.0
% of GDP
 and 
the primary surplus to improve 
to 3.4% of GDP, 
thanks to the sizeable budgetary consolidation 
measures adopted in 2010
-11. By contrast, interest 
expenditure is projected to rise further 
Å to 5.4% of 
GDP 
Å due to higher refinancing rates. In 
structural terms, the annual adjustment is pro
jected 
to be around 3 pps. of GDP for the overall balance 

and 3Â½ pps. for the primary balance. 
 In 2012, current primary expenditure is set to rise 
slightly in nominal terms as social transfers 

continue to increase, although at a moderate pace 

thanks to th
e non
-indexation of higher pensions. 
Expenditure on compensation of employees is 
projected to continue to fall thanks to both the 
4-year freeze in public wages and careers and the 
continued restriction in recruitment. Intermediate 

consumption is set to dec
line slightly due to the 
savings planned in departmental expenditure and 

cuts to transfers to subnational governments. The 

latter also affects capital spending, which is set to 
continue to decline in 2012. As a result, primary 
expenditure is expected to in
crease only 
marginally in nominal terms and to continue to 

decline as a share of GDP.
  Total revenues are expected to grow by more than 

5.5% in 2012, increasing substantially as a share of 

GDP. Overall, the impact of the adopted 

consolidation measures is l
arger on indirect taxes, 
which are projected to rise by more than 10% 

through increases in excise duties, stamp duties on 

financial assets and VAT rates
 as well as the 
re-introduction of taxation of owner
-occupied 
dwellings. The tax rate increase on other 
property 

is set to boost direct taxes, which are also buoyed

of the personal withholding tax on interests and 

dividends. Corporate income taxes are projected to 
rise marginally on account of further increases in 
the tax rate for large energy companies, partly 
offset by the new allowance on corporate equity 
(ACE) and the possibility to deduct part of the 

regional tax on productive activities (IRAP) paid 

on labour c
osts. Social contributions are assumed 
to grow slightly, thanks also to the increase in 

contribution rates for self
-employed people. By 
contrast, capital taxes are set to decline sharply, as 
one
-off revenues are much lower than in 2011. No 
additional reven
ues from the numerous measures 
adopted to fight against tax evasion
 are 
incorporated in the forecast,
 as their 
outcome is 
difficult to assess in advance.
  The measures adopted in 2010
-11 produce 
additional consolidation effects
 in 2013, entailing a
 further
 increase 
in the 
primary surplus to 
4.5% of 
GDP and a decline in the headline deficit
 to 
1.1% of GDP.
 Interest expenditure is projected to 
continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace. A 
balanced budgetary position is expected to be 

achieved in structural ter
ms thanks to the 
additional 
adjustment
 of more than Â½ pp.
 of GDP
. The 
structural 
primary
 surplus is set to increase by 
around 1 pp. and reach 5Â½% of GDP
.  Graph II.11.2:

 In 2013, primary expenditure is expected to

Revenues
 are set to rise in line with output, with

the VAT rate increase timed for October 2012. 
 The g

 12. CYPRUS
 The correction of domestic and external imbalances weighs on 
econ
omic activity
  82 Tourism exports unable to offset falter
ing 
domestic demand
 The Cypriot economy grew by a modest 0.5% in 
2011. After a 
stronger
 first half year
, when GDP 
rose by 1.5% y
-o-y thanks to an exceptionally 
good tourist season, economic activity was badly 
affected by the accident in July
 2011 that 
dest
royed the Vassilikos 
power station
 which 
accounted for half of the
 island's
 total 
electricity 
generati
on capacity. 
 Domestic demand, traditionally the main driver of 

growth, 
decreased considerably
 in 2011.
 Tightening bank lending conditions
, along with a 
worsening labour market outlook and weakening 
confidence
, weighed on private consumption. In 
addition, 
subdued
 foreign demand for housing and 
the
 restructuring of corporate balance sheets kept 
investment on a correction path for 
the
 fourth
 year 
in a row. On
 the other hand, the external sector 
made a positive contribution to growth
. Revenues 
from tourism i
ncrease
d by 13%
, driven by
 political 
instability in competing Mediterranean 
tourist 
destinations and an increased flow of arrivals from 

emerg
ing markets suc
h as Russia. 
In addition
, import growth decelerated, in line with the 

contraction in domestic demand.
 Nevertheless, 
with a current
-account deficit above 10% of GDP, 
the external imbalance remained sizeable.
 Squeeze on private income and credit growth
 GDP i
s projected to contract by 0.
8% in 2012 due 
to 
a fall in
 domestic demand
 and
 the
 weaker 
external environment
, notably including persistent 
financial market uncertainty. Private consumption 

will be restrained by the squeeze in disposable 

income, mainly amon
g public sector employees, 
exerted by the fiscal restriction
 incorporated in the 
Budget Law 2012 adopted on 16 December 2011
, 
as well as by the rise in unemployment to 
unprecedented levels. The large exposure of the 
financial sector to Greece and the banks
' need of 
recapitalisation will probably 
raise the cost of 

financing and limit 
private
-sector 
access
 to it
. Demand for h
ousing is 
also 
expected to remain 
sluggish
, while other construction investment is 
likely to benefit from reconstruction work in the 
des
troyed Vassilikos power station and from other 
infrastructure projects.
 Leading indicators point to 
weak
, albeit improving
, consumer and business 
confidence. This suggests that 
a recovery should 
set in during the second half of 2012
, with the 
improvement o
f the external environment and the 
resumption of 
private 
investment as uncertainty
 slowly
 dissipates. 
The contribution of the external 
sector to growth is set to remain positive. While 
slowing global trade and worsening economic 

prospects in Cyprus' main t
rading partners 
are
 likely to weigh on exports of goods, this 
should be
 partly offset by healthy performance 
of business 
services and tourism. Imports are set to decline 

against the backdrop of weak domestic demand
, allowing the current
-account deficit to 
narrow 
further to around 7.7% of GDP
. Economic activity 
is projected to recover only gradually in 2013
, 
mainly driven by private investment, while 
domestic consumption will remain constrained by 
the need for further correction of economic 

imbalances
.  Mode
rating price and wage inflation amid 
rising unemployment
 A tentative resumption of employment growth 

levelled off in the course of 2011, with 
labour
-intensive sectors such as construction and trade
 suffering job losses
. Unemployment 
remains on a 
strong upw
ard
 trend
, rising from
 7.8% in 2011
 to 
around 
9Â¾% in 2012
. Wage growth is expected to 
moderate given
 the
 unfavourable labour market 
conditions 
together
 with public sector wage 
restraint
. Specifically, the
 cost
-of-living 
adjustment 
(COLA) in the public sect
or is 
suspended 
for two years
. In addition, the 
government and the social partners 
have 
agreed to 
reform the 
COLA
 by mid
-2012. 
 HICP inflation is projected to 
marginally 
decline 
to 
3.4
% in 2012 from 
3.5%
 in 2011 on the back of 
easing commodity prices
 combi
ned with weake
r domestic demand. Furthermore, the base effect of 

the increase in
 electricity prices is set to dissipate 
in the last quarter of th
is year. 
On the other hand, 
the increase in VAT may add around Â½ percentage 

point to the annual rate. 
Core infl
ation is forecast 
to remain contained at about 2%.
 With domestic 
demand remaining subdued and the effect of the 

VAT increase fading, headline inflation may abate 

further to 2Â½% in 2013.

      83 Government facing severe financing 
constraints
 The government deficit 
increased from 5.3% in 
2010 to 6.3% in 2011
, mainly 
due to 
lower 
revenues in the wake of the
 slowdown of 
economic 
activity
 and 
reduced corporate profitability. At the 
same time, expenditure slippages appear to be 

related to rising social outlays due to hig
her 
unemployment and redundancy payments and the 

higher cost of financing.
  Driven by the recent consolidation efforts, the 

government deficit is set to narrow to 3.
4% of 
GDP in 2012
 and
 2.5% GDP in 2013
. On this 
basis, 
and 
in view of 
shrink
ing
 economic ac
tivity
 this year
, the 
government 
debt
-to-GDP ratio 
should remain on a rising trend and reach about 

76% 
in 
2012, mainly reflecting the stock
-flow 
adjustment increasing debt due to disbursement in 

EFSF and ESM
.  The financial sector in Cyprus, 
which is 
large
 in 
size relative 
to 
the economy's annual output, has 
been affected by developments in Greece
; domestic banks los
t a significant 
amount of 
capital 
following
 their voluntary participation in the 
agreed haircut on Greek sovereign
 debt (PSI). By 
June 2012, th
e commercial banks' solvency ratios 
may well 
reach the targeted minimum Core Tier 1
 ratio
 of 9%. To
 this end, banks are currently 
pursuing capital strengthening plans. 
Should
 the 
Cypriot banking system have to resort to 

government support
 for recapitalisat
ion
, the 
government debt 
ratio c
ould rise to around 85% of 
GDP, thus further weakening the long
-term 
sustainability of public finances at a time when 
the 

sovereign itself is severely constrained in 

international bond markets.

 Recovery remains on track despite external shocks
  84 Growth slows after strong rebound
 Latvia's economy rema
ined largely resilient to 
adverse external shocks in the second half of 2011 
but signs of a slowdown appeared in the beginning 

of 2012. After a strong rebound of 5.5% in 2011, 
GDP growth is expected to decelerate to 2.2% in 
2012, reflecting the weaker exte
rnal environment 

and more cautious investments and private 

consumption. This is also confirmed by a 

downturn in economic sentiment in March 2012, 

although the underlying indicator remains above 
the 12
-month average. With the gradual 
improvement in the exte
rnal outlook, Latvia's 
growth is forecast to pick up again, to 3.6% in 
2013. Exports and investments are projected to 

remain the main growth drivers in the medium run 

while private consumption is set to rise at a lower 

rate due to continuous deleveraging i
n the retail 
banking segment.

GDP growth (y-o-y%)
forecast
 The breakdown of GDP by sector shows that 
tourism, construction and manufacturing achieved 
the highest real growth rates of 21.9%, 12.4% and 

11.7% in 20
11. Construction works were 

supported by favourable weather conditions 

towards the end of the year but business surveys in 

the sector also signal a broadly favourable outlook 
for 2012. Hard data for the first months of 2012 
indicate some slowdown in manufa
cturing, while 

hotel occupancy rates continue to demonstrate a 

rapid expansion in tourism.
 New jobs and emigration curb unemployment
 While employment increased by 3.4% in 2011, the 

pace of job creation is set to slow down 

significantly due to weaker econom
ic growth and 
some moderation in business sentiment. Helped 

also by increased emigration flows, the rate of 

unemployment dropped substantially in 2011 to a 

year
-average of 16.1% for the age group of 15
-74 (from 18.7% in 2010), but remained well above the 

EU average. Unemployment is expected to 
decrease further in 2012
-13, but the high shares of 
youth and long
-term unemployment remain 
relevant challenges. Skill mismatches, as well as 

lack of qualified staff in some business sectors, 

pose additional concerns 
on the labour market 
although the ratio of job vacancies was still low at 
0.4% of all job openings at the end of 2011.
 Inflation decelerates despite oil shocks
 HICP inflation rose by 4.2% in 2011 after a drop 

of 1.2% in 2010. The index was strongly affecte
d by the increase in VAT rates, as evidenced by the 

much lower constant
-tax price index of 2.7%. 
Commodity prices of agricultural products and 

primary energy resources were the other major 

price movers while core inflation remained very 

low. Inflation is p
rojected to decelerate to 2.6% in 
2012 and 2.1% in 2013 as the impact of the tax 

hikes weakens substantially. Uncertainties related 
to crude oil prices pose a significant risk to the 
inflation forecast due to the high weight of energy 

in the country's cons
umer basket.
 Current account expectedly shifts to deficit
 The current
-account balance turned to a deficit of 
1.2% of GDP in 2011 from a surplus of 3% of 

GDP in 2010. Increased domestic demand, driven 

mainly by the strong rebound in corporate 
investments, p
ushed up imports to a real growth of 
20.7% in 2011. Exports rose by 12.6% and their 
share in GDP widened to 59.3% in 2011 from 

53.8% in 2010. Export shares in global trade also 

kept rising, showing further improvement in 

external competitiveness. In the me
dium run, 
imports are projected to grow slightly faster than 
exports, as demand for investment goods remains 

high. Therefore, the current
-account gap is set to 
widen further, but to levels that will not pose 

threats to the sustainability of the country's 

external position. The external account, calculated 
as the sum of the current and capital accounts, 
posted a surplus of 0.9% of GDP in 2011 and is 
expected to remain broadly balanced in 2012

 Public finances continue to improve
 The robust economic growth in the second half of 

2011 led to a better
-than
-expected outcome, with a 
general government deficit of 3.5% of GDP in the 

year as a whole. Better tax performance 
Å in 
particular on the side of 
labour taxes 
Å explained 
the major part of this over
-performance, with 
savings under some expenditure categories adding 

to this. The impact of financial support to the state
-owned Mortgage and Land Bank and to the state
-owned national airline company amoun
ted to 0.8% 
of GDP, in line with previous expectations.
 The 2012 budget law was adopted by the Latvian 

Parliament on 15 December 2011. On the revenue 

side, measures in the law include legislative 

actions to strengthen the tax administration in 

sectors pron
e to undeclared activity and to broaden 
the property tax base, with an overall estimated 

impact of 0.3% of GDP. On the expenditure side, 
the budget includes steps to support the nominal 
freeze in the public wage bill, reducing subsidies 

and limiting other 
expenditure while safeguarding 

the social safety net and investments. The overall 

impact of the expenditure restraint is estimated at 

0.6% of GDP. Moreover, tax increases that took 
effect in summer 2011 further contribute to the 

improving outlook of public
 finances. Taking into 
account these measures and the better outcome 

seen in 2011, the general government deficit is 

now expected to be 2.1% of GDP in 2012. In 2013, 
the general government deficit is projected to 
remain 
unchanged as the increase in state 
contributions to the funded pension scheme 
Å as 
foreseen by legislation 
in force 
Å offsets the 
cyclical improvement
 in tax revenue, while some 
expenditure items increase under the no
-policy
-change assumption.
 In June 2011, the authorities returned to the 

international financial markets and a second major 
international bond issuance took place in February 

2012. The debt level increased in 2011 by less than 

expected due to a buy
-back of government bonds 
from the Deposit Guarantee Fund, while the ratio 

of debt 
to GDP declined. Over the forecast 

horizon, the general government debt is expected 

to reach 44.7% of GDP by the end of 2013, partly 

as the authorities pre
-fund the repayment of loans 
under the EU Balance of Payments programme. 
Following the expiry of the 
programme in January 
2012, these repayments will peak in 2014
-15, 
subsequently reducing the debt
. 14. LITHUANIA
 Growth set to slow down but remains robust
  86 After 
a strong 
2011, uncertainty lowers growth 
going forward
 Economic growth picked up significantly in 2011, 
reaching 5.9%. Lithuania took full advantage of 

growing export markets as on
-going real wage 
declines and productivity improvements fostered 
competitive
ness. Net exports contributed 
positively to growth. Subsequently, corporate 
profits, as well as employment, increased and 

domestic demand took over as the main driver of 

economic growth. However, at the end of 2011, 

Lithuania felt the repercussions of the 
slowdown in 
the EU as external demand declined. In addition, 

turbulences in financial markets and the 

bankruptcy of the domestic bank Snoras in 

November 2011 further dampened consumer 

confidence and business expectations.

mirrored 
in 
decreasing 
lending 
since the 
beginning 
of 2012. In 2013, both private investment and 

private consumption are expected to 
accelerate
 on 
the back of a 
stronger
 global environment. Public 
investment will grow over the forecast horizon
, supported by 
EU co
-financed projects.
 Relatively resilient exports in weak global 
environment
 Lithuania's
 strong trade performance in 2011
 was 
accompanied by a gain in market shares
, when 
exports grew in real t
erms by 13.7% and imports 
by 12.7
%. In 2012, e
xport growth
 is set to
 moderate
 because of weaker export demand. Due 
to a high energy
-dependency feeding import 
demand
, net 
exports are
 likely to contribute 
slightly negatively to GDP growth. 
After a bout of 
weakness in early 2012
, the
 well
-diversified export 
structure and relatively positive prospects for 
Lithuania's main export markets 
(the Baltics, 
Russia, Germany and Poland) 
will 
underpin the 
trade performance. 
 The current
-account balance turned to a defici
t of 
1.6% of GDP in 2011. The negative trade and 
income balance were partially offset by siz
eable 
current transfers, 
in particular 
high inflows from 

the EU funds and strong workers' remittances. The 

external balance also deteriorated in 2011 but 

remained p
ositive, reflecting 
the high
 capital
-account surplus 
due to the 
increase
d absorption of 
the 
EU 
structural 
funds. The current
-account 
deficit is expected to 
widen somewhat 
further, 
while the external surplus is expected to broadly 

stabilise in 2012 as the n
egative impact of weaker 
external demand is offset by a decrease in 

domestic demand growth.
 Inflation is set to moderate
 HICP inflation accelerated in 2011 owing to higher 

energy and food prices 
and 
Å to a lesser extent 
Å rising domestic demand
 narrowing t
he output gap
. Annual
 average inflation increased from 1.2% in 
2010 to 4.1% in 2011. Core inflation also edged 

up, averaging 2.4% in 2011. In March 2012, 

12-month average inflation stood at
 4.2%, mainly 
due to higher energy prices. However, it is 

projected
 to 
decelerate 
to 3.1% in 
2012 for the year 
as a whole, 
driven by lower food and commodity
 inflation 
and 
weaker domestic demand. In 2013,

     87 inflation is forecast to inch down further to 2.
9%, as 
oil prices 
in particular are assumed
 to 
decrease. 
Overall domes
tic price pressures
 are
 set to
 remain 
moderate,
 inter alia 
due to 
a still
-high 
rate of 
unemployment and 
limited
 wage growth. The 
latter is expected to 
accelerate in 2013 in line with 
an increase in 
labour product
ivity.
 Fiscal consolidation 
is set to contin
ue In 2011, Lithuania's general government deficit 
narrowed to 5.5% of GDP from 7.2% in 2010. The 
budgetary outturn was somewhat worse than 

expected in 
the 
autumn and above the 
government's deficit target of 5.3% of GDP
; this 
was mainly due to some unfores
een calls on state 
guarantees on loans by some companies and a 

higher
-than
-planned local government deficit
. The 
adjustment has largely r
elied on expenditure 
restraint,
 as spending on goods and services and 
social benefits further decreased. 
The revenue
-to-GDP ratio fell further, despite 
reviving
 domestic 
demand and ef
forts to improve tax compliance
.  The 2012 budget include
s further 
substantial cuts 
in expenditure
, in particular 
by 
maintaining the 
public sector wage freeze for 
a third year. Some 
temporary 
measures limiting the growth of social 
benefits have been made permanent. Social 
security pensions, cut at the beginning of the crisis, 
have been broug
ht back to the pre
-crisis level
. Additional revenue will mainly be collected from 
non
-tax revenues, inclu
ding higher dividends from 
state
-owned enterprises 
and sales of carbon rights. 
The 
budget law
 also includes a contingency 
provision requiring a supplementary budget should 
revenue fall short of or the deficit 
or 
be above 
plan
. Taking into account these mea
sures and the 
somewhat worse outcome in 2011, the general 

government deficit is expected to decrease to 3.2% 

of GDP in 2012. T
he structural deficit is 
estimated
 to decrease from 
5.1% in 2010 to 4.6
% in 2011 

and further to 2.
9% of GDP
 in 2012.  
 In 2013, so
me consolidation measures will expire, 

including the freeze 
in government wages. 
However, overall
 expenditure increase
 will be 
contained by the state budget expenditure rule
. The 
government deficit is therefore expected to 

decrease to 3.
0% of GDP 
in 2013. 
The general 
government debt is 
set
 to 
increase from
 38Â½% of 
GDP in 2011 to 
nearly 4
1% of GDP
 at the end of 
the forecast 
horizon
. This is more than expected in 
the autumn forecast since the government

of repaying debt

deposit insurance company for compensation of 

insured deposits following the bankruptcy of the 

Snoras bank
. 15. LUXEMBOURG
 Unfavourable international environment dampens growth prospects
  88 Weaker performance of financial services and 
manufacturing weigh on growth â
 In 2011, the Luxembourg economy grew by 1.6% 
according to the first official estimate. A strong 

third quarter (1% q
-o-q) was followed by a rather 
weak
 one (0.2% q
-o-q in the fourth quarter), but 
there was no contraction in GDP despite 

unfavourable international environment. 
 The turbulence on the financial markets affected 

the performance of financial services, which faced 

a decline in added value of mo
re than 5% in 2011. 
Manufacturing recovered quickly in 2010 after the 

2009 global crisis, but has again faced a decline in 

output since the second quarter of 2011. The 

relapse was particularly marked towards the end of 

the year, when a number of important 
iron and 

steel plants closed partially. Other sectors, on the 

other hand, showed some resilience. 
 Private and public consumption increased 
moderately in 2011, by 1.8% and 2.5% 

respectively. Investment has been the most 

dynamic component of GDP. The big hi
ke was 
partly due to large purchases of planes and 
satellites by Luxembourg
-based companies. Net 
exports have contributed negatively to growth 
since 2008. This was again the case in 2011, not 

surprisingly given the poor performance of 

financial services an
d manufacturing, two 
important export sectors.
 Growth expectations for 2012 are modest. The 

carry
-over from 2011 to 2012 is around 0.5%. 
GDP is estimated to have remained broadly flat in 

the first quarter of 2012, given the weak 

performance of the euro are
a, Luxembourg's 

principal export market. 
Increasing confidence
, both in Luxembourg and in the EU as a whole,
 should support a gradual return of growth from the 

second quarter on
wards
, resulting in average 
growth 
of slightly above 1% 
in 2012. Again, 
growth 
is exclusively supported by 
domestic 
demand
 while
 net exports 
still contribute 
negatively, although their drag on growth is 
expected to diminish.
 Financial services should 
start to benefit from the progress made to 
overcome the sovereign
-debt crisis, but
 in the short 
term
 this
 sector
 is not expected to return
 to 
its pre
-crisis dynamism.
  Only in 2013 
is Luxembourg
's econom
ic output
 expected to
 return to 
its pre
-crisis level. GDP is 
expected to grow by around 
2% in 2013, well 
below the average rates recorded
 in the past. The 
main contribution will again come from domestic 

demand
, while the external balance is also 
expected to contribute positively, for the first time 
since the outbreak of the worldwide economic and 
financial crisis
. The main downside risk for
 this 
growth scenario lies in the export performance of 

financial services, which would be heavily affected 

should further unrest hit financial markets
 worldwide.

forecast
 HICP inflation 
reached 3.7% in 2011, after 2.8% 

in 2010. It has been driven upwards by rising oil 

prices and price increases for other raw materials. 

Considerable rises in administered prices also 

contributed. Inflation is expected to slow down to 

3% in 2012, higher than
 foreseen in the February 
2012 interim forecast, due to the higher oil
-price 
assumptions. The national index (NICP), which 

has a lower weight for oil products, is expected to 

fall from 3.4% in 2011 to 2.7% in 2012. In 2013, 

both the HICP and the NICP are e
xpected to 

decelerate to around 2% based on the assumption 
of moderating oil prices.
 â slowing down job creation â
 Job creation in Luxembourg 
was
 substantial in 
2011 despite a slowdown towards the end of the 
year. However, an employment increase of 
2Â½% has
 not been sufficient to bring down the 
unemployment rate. Indeed, unemployment 
has 
been 
rising since March 2011 and accelerated 
towards the end of the year, reaching 4.8% on 

average in 2011. Non

     89 grown faster than resident employment
, but the 
difference is much smaller than in the years 
preceding the crisis. Job creation is expected to 

slow to around 2% in 2012, moving the 
unemployment rate to
 5.2% on average. With 
economic growth in 2012 expected to be rather 

moderate and adjustment 
of employment in some 
industries still on
-going, slow job growth will 
continue throughout 2013. As a consequence, 
unemployment would reach a historic high of 

5.9
%. The automatic 2.5% indexation of wages
, which was due this winter, 
was
 postponed by the 
gove
rnment to 1 October 2012 in an attempt to 
temper wage growth. On the whole, wages are now 

expected to increase by 3.2% on average in 2012. 

With employment expected to increase more than 

output in 2012, productivity will further decrease 

in 2012, as 
was 
the
 case in 2011. This will raise 
unit labour costs, accelerating to a 4.
1% increase in 
2012. In 2013, output will 
again 
rise 
more quickly
 and the increase in unit labour costs will be 
contained to 2.
4%. â while public finances raise concerns
 In line with the
 autumn 
2011 forecast, the general 
government deficit 
reached
 0.6% of GDP in 2011 
(from
 0.9% in 2010). However, this small overall 
figure hides a deficit of 2.4% at the level of the 

central government, 
which is 
mitigated by an 
accumulation of pension reser
ves in the social 
security subsector. In 2012 and 2013, revenues are 
likely to be heavily affected by the weak 

performance of financial sector activities, which 

contribute to around 
25% of 
the 
fiscal revenues of 
the Luxembourg government. On the other hand
, expenditure on government consumption is rising 
autonomously. These two factors will drive a 
steady increase in the deficit, towards around 1.8% 

in 2012 and around 2.
2% in 2013.
 For 2013, these 
figures are based on a no
-policy
-change 
assumption
 and so th
ey do not yet include the 
consolidation package of around 
EUR 
500 million
 (1.2% of GDP) that has been announced by the 
government
, but still had to be defined on the cut
-off date of the forecast.
 With a structural balance of around 0.4% of GDP, 
Luxembourg 
almost reached its medium
-term 
objective (a surplus of 0.5% of GDP on the 

structural balance) in 2011. However, the 

structural balance is expected to deteriorate again 
to 
-0.6
% in 2012 and to 
-1.4
% in 2013. The public 
debt fell from 19.1% of GDP in 2010 to
 18.2% in 
2011. With 
a rising
 central governmen
t deficit to 
finance, the debt
-to-GDP ratio is expected to 
increase again, to 20.3% in 2012 and 21.6% in 
2013. 16. HUNGARY
 Muddling through
  90 The Hungarian economy grew by 1.7% in 2011. 
The main engine of the economy was the export 

sector, which will continue to drive growth over 

the forecast horizon.
 Domestic demand squeezed further
 There is no recovery in sight fo
r domestic demand 
over the forecast horizon. Real disposable income 

is expected to fall in 2012, given the softness of 

the labour market linked to the uncertain economic 
outlook, tax hikes and higher than previously 
expected inflation. Furthermore, the rec
ently 

decided financial transactions tax in particular will 

weigh on consumption in 2013. The negative 

impact of these developments on private 

consumption may be partly compensated for by the 
exchange rate fixing scheme agreed in December 
with the Banking 
Association. However, this 
increases longer
-term risks when the term of the 
agreement expires in 2016 and loan instalments 

will be hiked. 
 Investment is projected to continue to fall, which is 
particularly worrying since the investment to GDP 
ratio is now 
the lowest since 1997. Weak demand 

conditions persist with the exception of some 

sectors, most notably in export
-oriented 
manufacturing. Credit supply constraints are biting 

in the case of corporations, with tight non
-price 
conditions accompanying high int
erest rates, and 
the stock of loans is anticipated to decrease further. 

Most of the negative impact of the financial 

transactions tax is expected to affect investment, 

together with other measures introduced in 

Hungary's Convergence Programme, including 

sectoral levies. This picture is mediated by sizeable 
investments scheduled in automobile 

manufacturing.
 The pass
-through of the VAT rise into prices at the 
beginning of 2012 was more complete and 

immediate than previously expected. This could 
indicate that 
the corporate sector is stretched tight, 
presenting a downside risk for employment. The 

19% increase in minimum wages that took effect 

in January is expected to hit demand for low
-skilled labour, which is the segment where 

employment challenges are the mos
t acute. On the 
upside, 
wage compensation schemes 
which are 
less restrictive for
 enterprises
 than initially 
discussed
 have
 since 
been specified.
 Hungary's 
public works scheme is sizeable and set to expand 

further, providing most of the employment growth 

in 2012-13. However, the funding requirements of 
this scheme tend to crowd out other active labour 
market policies, even though 
increasing 
employment on the open market
 is crucial.
 Exports are still projected to grow at a healthy rate, 

thanks in part to a ma
jor new car plant having 
entered production in the second quarter of 2012. 

Another major automobile plant is scheduled to 
become operational in 2013, helping Hungary to 
gain further market shares
. Also as a result of 
lower import projections due to contrac
ting 
domestic demand, the positive contribution of net 

exports to growth is expected to be sizeable. 
The 
current
-account 
surplus is set to increase further
 over the forecast horizon.
 Overall, GDP is 
projected to contract by 0.3% in 2012, and to 

recover by 
a modest 1.0% in 2013. 
 Inflation was unexpectedly high at the beginning 

of the year, owing not only to the indirect tax rises, 

but also to a temporary exchange rate shock which 
boosted imported inflation. The new tax measures 
imply that inflation is likel
y to remain well above 

the central bank's target rate over the forecast 

horizon.
 Fiscal developments
 The 2011 general government budget reached a 

surplus of 4.
3% of GDP, thanks to one
-off revenue 
of 9.7% of GDP stemming from the de facto 

elimination of the
 earlier compulsory private 
pension fund and incorporating a better
-than
-expected outcome in the local government sector. 

Excluding one
-off 
factors
, however, the budget 
was in deficit by 5Â¼% of GDP.
 In 2012, the budget deficit is expected to reach 
2.5% of 
GDP. Compared with the autumn 2011 
forecast of 2.8% of GDP, this includes further 

savings adopted in the 2012 budget, as well as the 

permanent effect of the better
-than
-expected 2011 
budget balance, which improves the fiscal outlook 

by 
Â¾% of GDP. This is e
xpected to be offset by 
deteriorating growth prospects, higher interest 
expenditure and some expenditure slippages 
compared to the 2011 
autumn projections
. In 
addition, recent one

     91 the public pension pillar, accounting of EU fund 
absorptions and the public transport sector) will 

together raise revenues by Â¼% of GDP (bringing 

net total one
-off measures to 0.9% of GDP).  
 In the context of the 2012 update of the 
convergence program
me (CP), the government 
announced further saving measures with a 
budgetary impact of 0.3% of GDP in 2012, 

including a levy on telecommunication services.  

While the forecast set out in the 2012 CP is 

calculated with an extraordinary reserve of close to 

0.4
% of GDP, this forecast currently projects that 
no further extraordinary reserve will be left. This is 

on account of expected expenditure slippages of 

Â½% of GDP, mainly related to drug subsidies, the 

transport sector, and a lack of sufficient detail 

about 
cuts in budgetary appropriations.
 The 2013 budget deficit is expected to rise to 2.9% 

of GDP. Compared with the autumn 2011 forecast 
of 3.7% of GDP for 2013, a positive base effect 
from 2012 combined with a further substantiation 

of some elements of the st
ructural reform 
programme are offset by deficit
-increasing effects 
stemming from the agreement of the government 

with the banks, the lower economic growth 

outlook and increased interest expenditure.
 However, the 2012 CP contains numerous 

additional saving 
measures including tax increases, 
the introduction of new taxes such as the financial 

transaction tax, and expenditure cuts, mainly in the 
area of the budgetary chapters and drug subsidies, 
altogether with a gross budgetary improving effect 
of close to 2% 
of GDP. Taking into account the 
lack of specifics and implementation risks related 

mainly to some expenditure cuts, slightly over half 

of this deficit improving effect has been 

incorporated in this forecast. Compared with the 

2013 deficit target in the CP,
 this higher forecast 
mainly reflects the lower economic growth 
forecast and a more prudent assessment of the 
saving measures.
 The structural balance is expected to decrease from 

4Â¼% of GDP in 2011 to 2.1% of GDP by 2012, 

following a cumulative deteriorati
on of more than 

2% of GDP in 2010 and 2011. In 2013 only a 

slight improvement is foreseen.
 In 2011, the gross public debt declined somewhat, 

to 80.6% of GDP, in the light of the sizeable 

primary surplus of 8Â¼% of GDP, which was to a 

large extent offset by 
the depreciation of the 
forint. 
Assuming that no public assets will be sold in 

2012, the gross public debt is expected to decrease 
to 78
.5% of GDP in 2012 and slightly further in 
2013, based on the current deficit outlook
. 17. MALTA
 Growth moderates but remains above the euro
-area average
  92 Loss of momentum in the second half of 2011 
continues into 2012
 At 2.1%, real GDP growth in Malta remained 
relatively robust i
n 2011, outperforming the 
average for the euro area (1.5%). Growth was 

driven mainly by net exports and household 
consumption. The sharp contraction in investment 
also reflected a base effect from some relatively 

substantial one
-off projects in 2010. 
 The 
moderation in economic growth that became 
evident in the second half of 2011 is expected to 
carry over into 2012, when growth is forecast to 
slow to 1.2%, before rebounding to almost 2% in 

2013. -10

Graph II.17.1:
Malta - Contributions to real GDP 
growth
 Compared with 2011, the contribution from 
external trade is set to moderate in 2012, reflecting 

a weaker outlook for the tourist sector as well as a 

faster rebound in imports. Consumer confidence is 

projected to remain low on the back of 
rising 
unemployment
 and real household consumption is 
projected to grow at a subdued pace.
 Fixed 
investment is forecast to stagnate given below
-average levels of capacity utilisation in the 

beginning of 2012 and increased uncertainty about 

domestic and inter
national prospects. Overall, 
domestic demand and net exports are forecast to 
contribute equally to real GDP growth in 2012.
 Business investment and household consumption 
are forecast to strengthen in 2013, thus becoming 

the main drivers of growth. After re
aching 
historically low levels in 2011
-12, the private 
investment ratio is projected to start to recover 
gradually, supported also by improved global 

growth prospects. The planned construction of the 

electricity interconnector pipeline with Sicily 

provides
 a further boost. At the same time, 
stronger employment and average wage growth are 

projected to increase the disposable income of 

households, thereby leading to a mild acceleration 
in private consumption. Given its high import
-intensity, stronger domestic
 demand is set to boost 
imports but net exports are still forecast to 
contribute positively to growth given the 

strengthening of exports.
 Inflation and employment growth both 
moderate compared to 2011
 HICP inflation averaged 2.4% in 2011, driven 
mainly by 
the food and energy components (the 

latter mitigated by the government's decision to 

keep electricity tariffs unchanged). Inflation is 
forecast to moderate slightly over the forecast 
horizon. 
In 2012, lower oil price dynamics and an 
extension of the freeze
 in electricity tariffs are 
behind the slowdown
. The slight pick
-up in 2013 
is mainly on the back of the services component, 

reflecting the improvement in domestic demand. 
As in 2011, inflation in Malta is projected to stay 
slightly below the euro
-area ave
rage in 2012 
before climbing back above it in 2013.
 Employment growth averaged 2.3% in 2010
-11, 
outperforming the euro
-area average owing in 
particular to a sizeable improvement in female 
participation and employment. A continuation of 
this trend is expect
ed to support employment 

dynamics over the forecast horizon. Nevertheless, 

the weakening of economic activity is projected to 

translate into more moderate job creation over the 

forecast horizon.
 Risks to this scenario are broadly balanced. Aside 

from risks
 related to the international environment, 
a specific factor relevant for Malta is a possibly 

more resilient labour market, which would lead to 

higher household consumption. The absence at this 

stage of credit constraints implies that a possible 
swifter re
covery in investor appetite for new 
projects could probably be financed easily.

      93 Government deficit remains below 3% of GDP
 The general government deficit was 2.7% of GDP 
in 2011, slightly better than estimated in the 

autumn forecast (3% of GDP), mainly bec
ause of 
higher one
-off revenues from the extension of the 
2010 tax amnesty.
 In 2012, the deficit is projected to narrow slightly, 

to 
2.6% of GDP, while the primary surplus 
increases to 0.8% of GDP (from 0.4% in 2011). 

The forecast includes the impact of th
e measures 
adopted in the 2012 budget (which was presented 

after the cut
-off date of the autumn forecast) and 
the January review of spending allocations. The 
current revenue ratio is projected to increase by 
1.1% of GDP compared to 2011, reflecting inter 

alia measures to improve the efficiency of revenue 
collection (mainly of a one
-off nature) and one
-off 
concession fees from the local lottery operator. 

Primary current expenditure is forecast to rise by 

0.3% of GDP, mainly reflecting a rise in subsidies 

to 
the national energy company (Enemalta). The 
increase in net capital expenditure of 0.4% of GDP 

is mainly due to the planned equity injection into 

Air Malta (0.3% of GDP).
 In 2013, the deficit is projected to widen to 2.9% 

of GDP
 based on the no
-policy
-chan
ge 
assumption, while the primary surplus declines to 
0.5% of GDP. While tax revenue is boosted by the 

pick
-up in economic activity, the disappearance of 
the one
-off revenue 
projected for 2012 implies
 that 
the current revenue ratio returns to its 2011 level
. Primary current expenditure is forecast to drop by 
0.6% of GDP, reflecting a continuation of the tight 
recruitment policy in the public sector as well as 

lower dynamics of social transfers from the 
gradual impact of the 2006 pension reform. Net 
capital e
xpenditure (which includes the planned 
additional equity injection into Air Malta) is 

expected to fall slightly as a percentage of GDP.
 In structural terms, 
there would be no 
improvement in the structural balance in 2012, and 
a marginal one in 2013 on a no
-policy
-change 
basis
. General government gross debt increased by 

almost 10 pps. of GDP between 2008 and 2011, to 

72% of GDP, and is forecast to increase to 75.2% 

by 2013. 
 The deficit and debt outcomes could be higher, 
given risks to expenditure from the o
n-going 
restructuring of Air Malta, the expected renewal of 

the public sector wage agreement and the financial 

situation of Enemalta
. 18. THE NET
HERLANDS
 Subdued outlook on the back of weak domestic demand
  94 Negative growth in the second half of 2011
 In the second half of 2011, the Dutch economy 
experienced a sharp downturn on the back of a 

pronounced weakening of both internal and 

external demand, recording negative
 quarter
-on-quarter growth of 0.4% and 0.6% in the third and 

fourth quarter, respectively. 
 The substantial drop in private consumption 
mirrored negative developments in household 

disposable income and consumer confidence, 
which had been hovering near hist
orical lows. 
Unfavourable wealth effects, which have a 
relatively large impact on private consumption in 

the Netherlands, also played a role. House prices, 

which have been decreasing gradually by around 

3% per year since the third quarter of 2008, 

continue
d this downward trend. Negative 
developments in financial markets in 2011 not 

only led to losses in household financial wealth but 

also prompted pension funds to increase pension 

premiums. The net assets position of Dutch 

households, however, remains firml
y positive as 
financial and non financial assets keep 
outweighing the liabilities. Business confidence 
also remained weak: the business climate indicator 

has stabilised around the low level reached in the 

summer of 2011. Construction investment was 

weak ma
inly on account of lacklustre housing 
construction. The number of building permits 

issued in 2011 was down by 9% compared to the 
previous year, reaching its lowest level since 1953.
 On the external side, exports were adversely 
affected by the slowdown in g
lobal trade and, in 
particular, euro
-area trade. This resulted in a fall in 
export volumes in the second half of 2011, even 
though exports still grew by 3.8% for the year as a 
whole.
 External demand the sole significant engine of 
activity, but contraction 
in 2012 The negative quarterly growth pattern in the 
second half of 2011 is forecast to extend into the 

first half of 2012, albeit at a less pronounced pace. 

This, in combination with the large negative carry
-over from 2011, translates into negative real G
DP 
growth of 0.9% over the whole of 2012. Economic 
growth is expected to return to positive territory in 

2013, but only at a modest rate of 0.7%, with net 
exports being the sole significant driving force. 

These projections are based on a no
-policy
-change 
assumption. The impact of additional consolidation 
measures, on which an agreement was reached in 

Parliament at the end of April, is not included in 

the baseline forecast.

Domestic Demand
GDP (y-o-y%)
forecast
 With virtually all determinants of consumption 
pointing downwards amidst an environment of low 
consumer confidence and no indication of a 

rebound in sight, final consumption expenditure of 

households is expected to record negative growth 
of 1.5% in 2012, wh
ile stabilising in 2013. 
 Real disposable income dropped for the fourth 
year in a row in 2011 and is expected to remain 

negative in 2012. Lower public employment, wage 

moderation in the public sector and a higher tax 
burden will all weigh on disposable inc
ome. Wage 
increases in the private sector are also expected to 
stay well below inflation as the labour market is 

set to remain weak over the forecast horizon. 

Household consumption should continue to reflect 

negative wealth effects, stemming in particular 
from on
-going weakness in the housing market, as 
well as increases in pension premiums and cuts in 
second
-pillar pension payouts as of 2013, due to 
the need to restore the buffers of pension funds. As 

already
-agreed consolidation measures from the 
2010 Coa
lition Agreement are concentrated on the 
expenditure side, government consumption is 

expected to decrease by 0.8% in 2012 and to 

increase marginally, by 0.1%, in 2013. 
 Gross fixed capital formation is forecast to 

decrease by 3.9% in 2012 and to increase s
lightly 
Member States, The Netherlands
   95 by 0.2% in 2013. The projected fall in investment 
this year is mainly due to declining construction 

investment, in particular housing construction, 

which is set to decrease substantially as a result of 
the expected continued gradual decrease in hou
se 
prices and the strong rise in the stock of unsold 

dwellings. In a context of weak expected demand, 
high uncertainty and capacity utilisation below its 

pre
-crisis level, investment in equipment is also 
expected to decrease in 2012 and to rebound 

subseque
ntly in 2013. Finally, gross public 
investment volumes are set to decrease in both 

2012 and 2013 as a result of fiscal consolidation.
 Net exports are expected to contribute positively to 

economic growth throughout the forecast horizon. 

In 2012 this would r
eflect falling imports in line 
with weak domestic demand, rather than buoyant 

exports. On the one hand, resilient demand from 

Germany, the Netherlands' main trading partner, 

should provide a boost. On the other hand, weak 
conditions in the EU periphery are
 set to weigh 
negatively on external demand. The Dutch 
economy is expected to benefit from a rebound in 

world trade in 2013. 
 This macroeconomic scenario is subject to both 

positive and negative risks. On the negative side, 
sizeable additional consolidatio
n measures would 
put downward pressure on growth. On
-going 
uncertainty surrounding housing market 
developments may weigh more heavily on private 

consumption and construction investment. On the 

positive side, more buoyant demand for exports 
could improve th
e growth outlook, given the open 
nature of the Dutch economy. 
 Inflation driven upwards by energy prices in 
2012 and cooling down in 2013
 After years of low inflation of around 1%, HICP 
inflation accelerated to 2.5% in 2011, mainly as a 

result of increases
 in energy and processed food 
prices. In the first quarter of 2012, the HICP grew 
by 2.8% y
-o-y. Over the remainder of the year, 
weak domestic demand should hold back 
underlying inflation, but this is expected to be 

more than offset by a strong rise in ene
rgy prices. 
On average, the HICP is expected to continue to 

increase by 2.5% in 2012. With oil prices assumed 
to decrease gradually from the second half of 
2012, and persistently weak domestic demand, 

inflation is forecast to decrease significantly to 

1.8%
 in 2013.
 Following a decline in recent years, nominal unit 
labour costs are expected to increase over the 
forecast horizon as a result of past wage 

agreements, which were based on more positive 

growth assumptions and labour productivity 
developments. Furt
hermore, employers' social 
contributions are expected to increase. In relative 
terms, however, the Netherlands gains in 

competitiveness. Combined with the positive 

performance of the trade balance, this results in a 
projected rise in the current
-account su
rplus. 
 Unemployment on the rise
 In 2011 as a whole, the unemployment rate 
decreased marginally to 4.4%. This was mainly the 

result of a well
-performing labour market in the 
first half of the year, combined with a shrinkage of 
the labour force caused by th
e general perception 
of negative job prospects ('discouraged worker 

effect'). From the second half of 2011, however, 
this picture reversed, as job prospects worsened, 

while the labour force increased substantially and 

the unemployment rate started to trend
 upwards. 
 The substantial increase in the labour force in the 
second half of 2011 was predominantly due to a 
significant increase in the availability of women 

and older workers. As a result of losses in family 

disposable income, as well as heightened 

unce
rtainty over future labour income and pension 
prospects, the incentive of second
-earners to enter 
the labour market or work more hours increased 
('added worker effect'). Due to the high carry
-over 
from the second half of 2011, the labour force is 
expected 
to rise by 1.3% in 2012, while for 2013 a 
more moderate rise of 0.3% is projected.
 Employment prospects are forecast to remain dim, 
in both 2012 and 2013. This partly relates to the 
government's intention to significantly reduce the 

number of public sector
 employees.  In addition, 
developments in the private sector are to remain 

subdued over 2012 and 2013, in view of weak 

demand. Overall, unemployment is projected to 
rise to 5.7% in 2012 and to increase further to 
6.2% in 2013. Whilst still relatively low i
n a 
European context, these rates would be the highest 

recorded since the mid
-nineties. The projected 
pronounced rise in unemployment, contrary to 

earlier crisis years, mainly results from less labour 
hoarding by the private sector. This is in line with 
firms' reduced profitability and a less tight labour 
market, implying lower search costs for qualified 

personnel.

      96 Cycle hampers improvement of the general 
government balance and debt increases 
further
 In 2011, the general government deficit fell 
slightly to
 4.7% of GDP from 5.1% in 2010, 
reflecting the reversal of the earlier fiscal stimulus 

and some consolidation measures. In 2012, the 

deficit is projected to improve further to 4.4%, 

despite the slump in growth, as a result of further 
consolidation measures
 on both the expenditure 
and the revenue sides. The growth in nominal 
expenditure is constrained by across
-the
-board 
cuts. Interest expenditures should remain relatively 

low in a low interest environment, while revenues 

should rise, in spite of adverse cyc
lical 
developments, due to tax increases mainly on 
household income and wealth. In addition, in line 
with the rise in oil prices, gas revenues should 

increase considerably. These projections do not 

include any impact of the additional consolidation 

package
 negotiated with Parliament by the 
caretaker government at the end of April.
 Despite the projected pick
-up in economic growth, 
the deficit is expected to increase slightly to 4.6% 

in 2013 in the absence of additional policy 

measures. This is the result of 
already
-decided 
limited measures on the revenue side
 from the 
2010 Coalition Agreement
, a lagged reaction of tax 
revenue to the cycle, lower gas revenues in line 
with moderating energy prices, higher interest 
expenditure as public debt rises, and the 

assum
ption of further substantial increases in 
social security and health care expenditures.
 The 
structural balance is projected to improve by 

1.1
 pps. in 2012, and to roughly stabilise in 2013. 
The gross government debt increased by over 

2 pps.
 in 2011, to rea
ch a level of 65.2% of GDP. 
The debt ratio is expected to rise by around 5 pps. 
in 2012 and by approximately 3 pps. in 2013, to 
70.1% and 73.0% of GDP respectively. This 

mainly reflects sustained deficits going forward, 

coupled with sluggish nominal GDP gr
owth.

 19. AUSTRIA
 Nascent recovery of confidence still to work its way through
  97 Strong growth outcome in spite of flagging 
momentum in 2011
 The Austrian economy surpassed its pre
-crisis 
output level in 2011. GDP growth strengthened to 
3.1%, significantly outperforming the EU average. 

In contrast to 2010, domestic demand played a 
more im
portant role, while the contribution of net 
exports weakened with the easing of global trade 
growth. Capital formation contributed 2.4 
pps.
 to 
growth. This reflects the strong revival in 

investment activity that had already started in 2010 

and was sustaine
d throughout most of 2011
, as 
well as a marked increase in inventory build
-up. 
The latter possibly signals a worsening of growth 

prospects. Indeed, both export and overall growth 

tailed off in the course of the year, to slightly 

negative quarter
-on-quarter
 rates in late 2011. In 
addition, despite further advances in employment, 

the growth rate of private consumption was rather 
modest.
 2012 and beyond 
Å the recovery of confidence 
will take time
 Economic activity
 slackened in late 2011 and
 is set 
to remain we
ak in the coming quarters. 
Corporations and households remain cautious with 
regard to investment and consumption spending, 
setting the stage for rather subdued growth 
throughout most of 2012. GDP is projected to 

grow by just 0.8% in 2012 before regaining s
ome 
momentum in 2013.
 Private consumption is likely to stay sluggish as 
the recovery of household confidence is at a very 
early stage and employment growth is 

decelerating. The decline in unemployment came 

to a halt in August 2011 and 
unemployment 
has 
fluc
tuated around a rate of 4.2%
, with the number 
of job
-seekers still 23% above the pre
-crisis trough 
according to data for February 2012. As a result of 
the latest wage agreements, the index of negotiated 
wages has started picking up and the increase 

reached
 3.2% 
y-o-y in March 2012. This limits the 
scope for sustaining the pace of employment gains 

during 2012. The overall impact of these 

counteracting trends on households' real disposable 
income is rather uncertain.
 Manufacturers' order inflows and backlogs 
weakened throughout 2011 as did their 
expectations for exports. Indeed, firms have 

boosted their competitiveness by a renewal of 

capacity and by withholding the compensation 
productivity gains reali
sed in 2010 and early 2011. 
Thus, their capacity to accomm
odate demands for 
wage increases has strengthened. However, the 
outcomes of latest wage negotiations may put 

upward pressure on unit labour costs as the growth 

of output and productivity are still struggling to 
recover from the decline in the second half o
f 2011. The prospects for weaker export and overall 
growth
, as well as the levelling
-off of capacity 
utilisation rates
, will still act as a drag on 
investment activity in the upcoming quarters. 
Financing conditions may tighten as banks focus 
on raising cap
ital buffers and a further clean
-up of 
balance sheets. Credit demand from both 

companies and households has been weakened by 

the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, 

while the renewed tightening of credit standards 
may weigh additionally on credit
 activity in the 
coming months.
 On the whole, the risk
s seem 
balance
d. While the 
downside risks stemming from weaker demand 
within the EU cannot be discounted, Austria's 

economy could well benefit from solid import 
demand outside the EU, including 
demand f
ed 
through its integration in the supply chain of 
German exporters. Solid sentiment in the 

construction sector and sound corporate and 

household balance sheets 
may yet provide some 
support
 for investment activity. 
 Driven by higher motor and heating fuel p
rices, as 
well as rising food prices, headline inflation 

averaged 3.8% from April to November 2011, but 

fell to 2.7% 
by March 2012. Core inflation (HICP 
excluding energy and unprocessed food) has been 

affected by spillovers into prices of services, where 
the annual rate of change accelerated to a peak of 
3.9% in August 2011. These effects are 
expected
 to disappear gradually, leading to a moderation of 
inflation in 2012. Wage growth is likely to remain 

contained, as the pace of economic expansion 

decelerates
, although the translation of wage 
increases negotiated in various sectors into the 

effective wage level may well exert upward 

pressure on producer and consumer prices.

     98 Further fiscal consolidation slowed down by 
bank rescue
-related payments
 The general go
vernment deficit declined from 
4.5% of GDP in 2010 to 2.6% of GDP in 2011. 
The reduction in the deficit was a result of 
favourable economic conditions and the 
consolidation measures agreed on at the end of 

2010. On the revenue side, they inclu
ded
 a bank 
levy and a rise in the taxes on fuel and cigarettes. 
The expenditure measures consisted mainly of cuts 

in family allowances and pension entitlements and 

reductions in administrative costs. The 

consolidation effort was partly offset by additional 

spending on 
long
-term care, education, and R&D. 
The 2011 deficit turned out significantly lower 
than the 3.4% of GDP 
in the autumn 2011 
forecast 
and the 3.6% of GDP notified by the Austrian 

authorities in autumn 2011. Part of the difference 

can be explained by the shi
ft of the cancellation of 
government participation in the "bad bank" KA 

Finanz from 2011 to 2012
, based on the decision 
by Eurostat (0.3% of GDP). The rest was due to 

higher
-than
-expected tax revenue and the lower
-than
-planned expenditure of the sub
-nation
al 
authorities.
 The consolidation effort is expected to continue 

over the forecast period
, based on further effects of 
the above
-mentioned measures and on a new 
package adopted by parliament in March 2012. 
It 
is estimated in this forecast that
 the latter w
ill have 
a deficit
-decreasing effect of about 0.1% and 0.5% 
of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively. On the 

revenue side, they include closing loopholes in 
VAT collection, taxing gains accrued due to 
rezoning of land, hikes in income tax for high
-earners and 
rises in social contributions for certain 

groups. On the expenditure side, the measures 
consist mainly of cuts in pension allowances, civil 
service wage freezes and reduction in 

administrative costs, although these will be partly 

offset by additional spend
ing on education. 

However, the consolidation effort in 2012 will be 

hampered by a slowdown in real GDP growth and 
by capital transfers due to government 
participation in two struggling banks, ÃVAG and 

KA Finanz (0.6% of GDP). Thus, the general 

government d
eficit is forecast to widen to about 
3% of GDP in 2012, before dropping to just below 

2% of GDP in 2013 against the background of 

accelerating economic activity. In structural terms, 

the deficit is to gradually fall from 2.4% of GDP in 

2011 to 1.8% of GDP 
in 2013.
 The debt ratio is projected to rise steadily 

throughout the forecast period, from 72.2% of 

GDP in 2011 to 74.3% of GDP in 2013
. 20. POLAND
 Growth continues, but at a lower pace
  99 Impressive performance in 2011 
 After a sharp rebound 
in 2010 
from the trough of 
the economic and financial crisis, economic 

growth strengthened further in 2011
, reaching 
4.3%. 
All components of d
omestic demand 
supported this perf
ormance, but 
private investment 
was particularly strong, on the back of 
growing 

profitability and easy access to credit
. Private 
consumption 
was 
robust, although 
its growth was 
somewhat lower than 
in 2010, while
 public 
investment 
benefited from a hefty 
inf
low of EU 
structural funds. 
However, during the second half 
of 2011, Poland felt the repercussions of the EU 

slowdown. External demand 
suffered
 and 
consumer and producer confidence
 waned.
  At the 
same time, 
a considerable depreciation of 
the 
zloty 
partiall
y offset the negative impact 
of 
weakening 
external demand. 
 Private investment takes over as the main 
driver of growth
 Real GDP growth is 
projected to slow down 
considerably to 2.7% in 2012 on the back of 

deteriorating global demand and continued fiscal 

consolidation effort. It is set to remain at a similar 
level in the following year. Domestic demand is 

projected to remain the main driver of growth, but 

the focus is expected to continue to shift from 

consumption to investment. Private gross fixed 

capital f
ormation is likely to remain strong. 
Companies are set to benefit from the currency 
depreciation and use their profits to renew their 
machinery in preparation for an expected upturn in 

the cycle. At the same time, growth in private 

consumption is likely to
 decelerate. It is set to be 
constrained by a slowdown in real wage 

developments and by declining consumer credit, 

reflecting recent regulatory changes and a shift of 
credit supply towards corporates.
   Both government consumption and investment are 
planne
d to stabilise in 2012.
 However
, in 2013
 (under the no
-policy
-change assumption)
, public 
consumption is set to rebound
. Public investment
 will 
reach a peak prior to the European football 
championship organised in June 2012, 
and 
is 
expected to decrease shar
ply 
thereafter
 in line with 
the completion of major infrastructure projects by 

the end of 2012.  
 Negative trends in foreign trade are expected to 
continue in 2012
, with both exports and imports 
slowing down
 in comparison with developments in 
previous year
s. However, the contribution of net 
exports to growth will increase slightly as growth 

in exports, driven 
partially 
by still weak currency, 
exceed
s that in imports. In 2013, the trend 
is forecast to reverse: 
imports will grow more 

strongly than exports as 
private 
domestic demand 
picks up 
and the 
net
 positive effect on growth 
decline

 This scenario is subject to broadly balanced risks. 

On the upside, a persistently weak currency woul
d further boost exports and enhance import 

substitution. On the downside, 
a withdrawal of 

foreign funding 
from 
the region 
could adversely 
affect credit markets for private and public 
borrowers, leading to lower investment and 
consumption. 
 Current
-account 
deficit decreases temporarily
 Following positive developments
 in 2011, the 
current
-account balance
 is forecast to continue 
to 
improv
e in 2012. 
On the back of a 
significant but 
temporary depreciation of zloty
, fuelling external 
demand for exports and a slow
down in domestic 
consumption
, the current
-account deficit
 is set to 
decrease from 4.
3% in 2011 to 3.
9% in 2012. It is 
however expected to deteriorate again in 2013 

following a rebound in investment demand and 

high income transfers abroad linked to increase
d holdings of sovereign debt by foreign investors. 
   European Economic Forecast, Spring 2012
   100  Financial system remains profitable 
 Bank lending to both corporate and household 
sector increased substantially in 2011, in line with 
high profitability and the improved capital base of 
the sector.   
The overall share of non
-performing 
loans
 (NPLs)
 is relatively 
stable
, though 
the 
relatively low quality of household loans (with 
NPLs reaching 18.9%) might pose a challenge to 
private consumption going forward. The main 

risks to the stability of the finan
cial sector and 
sustained credit supply to the economy stem from 

the uncertain international environment through 

large foreign ownership of the banking sector and 

continued, but diminishing, r
eliance on foreign 
funding for 
liquidity provision. 
 Employment 
growth in spite of economic 
slowdown 
 After a significant 1
% hike in total employment in 
2011, the situation on the labour market is 

expected to remain relatively robust over 2012 and 

2013. 
However, the economic slowdown will limit 
total employment growth 
to a mere 0.3% in 2012 

and 0.4% in 2013
. The number of unemployed is 
forecast to 
stabilise,
 leading to a 
temporary 
increase in the 
unemployment rate fr
om 9.7
% in 
2011 to 9.
8% in 2012
 and a marginal decline to 
9.6% thereafter, in line with rebounding 
employ
ment growth. 
 Inflation set to decrease after the peak
 HICP inflation reached 3.9% in 2011
, as a result of 
the 
strong depreciation of 
the 
zloty in the second 
half of the year, 
and consequently 
high import 
prices (mainly energy and food)
. In addition, 
admin
istered prices
 were persistently high
. On the 
other hand, 
with labour market imbalances being 
adjusted mainly through reductions in real wages, 
rather than employment changes, pressure on wage 

increases remained weak over the last
 year, 
preventing 
an 
even 
stronger hike 
in 
inflation
. Over 
the 
forecast horizon, the 
inflation rate is expected 
to decrease to 3.7% in 2012 and 2.9% in 2013, 

reflecting a gradual decline in commodity prices 

and weaker domestic demand. 
The implementation 
of the CO
2 emission scheme 
might result in f
urther 
energy price hikes 
and present a 
significant upside 
risks for inflation.
  Fiscal consolidation 
continues, 
but 
at decreasing pace
  After rising continuously
 from 1.9% of GDP in 
2007 to 7.
8% of GDP in 2010, the general 
government defic
it started
 decreasing in 2011, 
when it fell
 sharply 
to 5.
1%; it is projected 
to 
continue falling 
over the forecast period. In 2012, 
despite a considerably slower GDP growth, the 
deficit is expected to decrease to 3.0% of GDP on 
the back of the 2011 package
 of structural 
consolidation measures which will remain in force 

in 2012 and is supported by additional measures 

included in 2012 Budget Law. On the revenue 

side, these measures include a change to the 

pension system consisting of the retention of part 
of 
the pension contribution previously
 earmarked 
to the private schemes in the first public pillar,
 a temporary (3 years)
 increase in 
the 
VAT rate (
of 1 pp.) and in excise duty on tobacco (
of 4 pps.), 
the 
abolition of some VAT and excise duty 
exemptions and a
 freeze in Personal Income Tax 
(PIT) thresholds. Those reforms 
were
 complemented in 2012 by 
an 
increase 
of 2 pps.
 in 
disability 
contributions, the introduction of a tax 
on copper and silver extraction and further minor 

changes in excise duty regulations. A
s a result of 
those measures and additional windfall revenues 

from dividends of state
-owned companies, 
revenue
-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase from 
38.5% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2012. 
 On the expenditure side, structural measures which 

have remained in f
orce from 2011 include: an 
expenditure rule limiting growth in all newly 

enacted and existing discretionary expenditure 

items to 1 pp. over the inflation
 rate, a 
further 
freeze 
in the wage fund of public sector employees
 and
 some minor cuts in social spend
ing
. These 
measures
 have been complemented by a decrease 
in complementary 
direct 
payments to farmers
 in 
the 
framework of the Common Agricultural 
Policy. Moreover, the government is planning to 
sharply cut public investment expenditure as from 
the second ha
lf of 2012, i.e. as soon as the projects 
contracted in relation to the European football 

championship have been completed. Consequently, 

public investment spending is forecast to 
grow 

only moderately 
in nominal terms and the overall 
expenditure
-to-GDP rati
o to decrease from 43.6% 
in 2011 to 43.1% in 2012.

     101 In 2013, the dynamics of the general government 
deficit reduction is forecast to slow down as some 

measures (abolition of some VAT exemptions, 

freeze in the public sector wage fund) 
implemented in recent
 years are set to expire and 
the share of pension contributions retained in the 

public pillar planned to start
 decreasing (from 
5.0% to 4.5% of gross wages),
 while no significant 
new measures have been officially announced. The 
headline deficit is expected
 to fall to 2.
5% on the 
back of slowing but still relatively robust GDP 

growth and further sharp decrease in public 

investment.

 However, g
iven the 
structural character of most 
implemented reforms and a negative but relatively
 stable output gap, the structural deficit is set to 

follow the 
path of
 the headline deficit, falling from 
5% in 2011 to 
1.9%
 in 2013.
 The genera
l government debt increased 
notably
 in 
2011, mainly due to a significant depreciation 
in the Polish currency, raising concerns about 
exceeding the legal
ly binding
 threshold of 55% of 
GDP (according to the national definition of debt) 
which 
would have 
oblig
ed the government to 
apply 
counter 
measures. However, in 2012, thanks 
to 
the
 slight increase in 
the 
zloty's exchange rate, 
further reduction in the headline deficit and 
prudent government's debt management strategy, 
the general government debt is expected 
to start 

decreasing for the first time since 2007. The debt is 

projected to fall from 56.
3% in 2011 to 5
5.0
% in 
2012 and further to 5
3.7
% in 2013. The projected 
debt figures are, however, subject to considerable 

uncertainty due to high exchange

affecting the debt valuation.
 21. PORTUGAL
 Fiscal and external adjustment are underway
  102 The downturn in economic activity in 2011 was 
milder than expected
 Real GDP declined by 1.6% in 2011
. This 
is 
0.3
 pp. less than anticipated in the
 autumn forecast
 and is the result of stronger 
exports and private 
consumption
, while i
mports weake
ned more
 than 
projected. 
The current
-account deficit 
as a share of 
GDP 
narrow
ed further 
by about 3
 pps.
 in 2011
, partly 
due to a strong decline in imports, i
n line 
with the fall in domestic demand. 
Strong data for 

the first two months of 2012 confirm that e
xport 
growth 
has become more broad
-based, with 
increasing market shares outside the EU partly 

compensating for the deceleration of exports to the 

EU
. Despit
e some recent improvements, 
the loss 
of 
external price 
competitiveness during the past 

decade has not yet been reversed. 
 In the last quarter of 2011, the 
labour market 
situation worsened significantly
, as e
mployment 
contracted by 2Â½%
 compared with the pre
vious 
quarter
 and the unemployment rate reached 14%, 
up from 12.7% in the third quarter of 2011
. The 
jobless rate climbed to 15% in February and is set 
to increase further this year.

 Having reached record lows in 
the last quarter of 
2011, confidence indicators 
have since stabilised 

and some even reversed their downward trend
, but 
the continued decline in industrial production is 

giving cause for 
concern. In February
, indust
rial 
output was 7% lower than in the same month last 

year and confidence in this sector has 
hardly 
improved in recent months. Moreover, financing 
conditions remain 
tight 
and bank lending to the 
non
-financial 
private 
sector has been shrinking 
since mid
-2011.  Deteriorating external environment to weigh on 
economic activity in 2012
 Export
s are projected to decelerate to 
2.5% in 2012
 due to a 
worsening economic outlook in some of 
the country's 
main E
U export markets. This is set 
to have negative second
-round e
ffects on private 
investment, which is expected to decline by 
12%.
 With p
rivate consumption expenditure 
still 
forecast to contract by 
some 
6%, real GDP 
is now 
projected to shrink by 3.3% in 2012, which is a 
downward revision of 0.3
 pp. compared to the 
autu
mn forecast.
 The adjustment of the current
-account 
balance should 
continue
, albeit 
at a slower 
pace
. Although the economy is expected to regain 
traction during 2013, annual growth is projected to 

be rather weak at 0.3%, mainly due to a negative 

carry
-over 
from 2012. The main driver of growth 
in 2013 
should
 once again 
be exports 
based on the 
strengthening EU economy and improved 
price 
competitiveness
 due to continued wage restraint
. The weakness of economic activity should 
continue to counterbalance price pr
essure from 
indirect tax increases. High unemployment should 

keep wage increases in check
, while anaemic 
domestic demand should contain price mark
-ups. 
Nevertheless, HICP inflation is expected to reach 

3.0% in 2012 as the dampening forces are 
projected to 
dominate the dynamic forces only in 

2013 when the effects of the tax hikes dissipate. 

Unit labour costs are 
projected to fall by about 3% 

this year and by Â½% in 2013.
 Risks to the forecast appear to be balanced. 
While 

the export
s projection is on the cauti
ous side 
assuming constant export market shares, there are 

downside risks
 to domestic demand 
related to a 
stronger
-than
-expected deterioration of the labour 
market.
 On the positive side, continued progress in 
implementing the 
Economic 
Adjustment 
Programme 
could boost investor confidence, 
thereby further lowering sovereign bond yields and 

attracting foreign investment. 
 Growth composition unfavourable to
 fiscal 
consolidation 
 The 
2011 
deficit 
stood at
 4.2%

to a target of 5.9

      103 which increased capital revenues by 3
Â½ pps. 
of 
GDP on ESA95 basis
. However, despite the large 
one
-off transactions and temporary measures, 
the 
fiscal consolidation effort 
implemented 
in 2011 
was large and 
the improvement in the cyclically
-adjusted primary balance, net of one
-off measures,
 amounted to a considerable 3Â¼
 pps. of GDP
. In 2012, Portugal 
is 
undertak
ing
 consolidation 
efforts worth 
over 5
% of GDP
.  Expenditure
-reducing measures account for most of the effort
, mainly wage and pension cuts
, but also 
expenditure cuts in the health sector
. In addition, 
reductions in public sector employment 
are to 
continue and access to some social transf
ers is to 
be tightened. 
On the revenue side
, the 
consolidation 
plan
s for 2012 rely mostly on higher 
indirect taxation, as the VAT structure is set to 
change, with
 more goods and service
s being 
taxed 
at the 
higher 
intermediate 
and 
standard rates.
 Regarding 
direct taxation, the focus is 
mainly on 
broadening 
the 
tax base by reducing deductions 
and
 exemptions applicable to 
personal and 
corporate income
 taxation
.  The 2012 target for the general government 
deficit 

of 4.5
% of GDP remains valid. 
However, 
downside 
risks to 
the fiscal projection related to 
the macro outlook are starting to materialise, with 

the 
growth composition 
tilting more strongly 
towards net exports and 
away from domestic 

demand
, as is evidenced by the 
more 
pronounced 
fall in private consumption
 and 
the substantial 
worsening of the labour market situation
. As a 
result, the deficit in 2012 is now projected to be 
0.2
 pp. higher than in the autumn 2011 forecast. 
However, t
he government is committed to 
reaching 
the 2012 fiscal objectives
. A ti
ght
er budgetary execution 
is foreseen.
 For 2013, additional consolidation efforts of about 

2% of GDP are included in the forecast, in line 

with the commitments under the Economic 
Adjustment Programme. They are largely based on 
the deepening of previously implemen
ted cost
-cutting measures and a further broadening of tax 

bases. The 
details of the fiscal consolidation plans 

for 
2013 and beyond are set out in the 2012 
Fiscal 
Strategy Document
. Considering the planned 
consolidation measures and the projected GDP 

path o
ver the period 2011
-13, the reduction of the 
government deficit to 3% of GDP in 2013 from 

9.8% in 2010 should largely be the result of a 

falling expenditure
-to-GDP ratio, with a smaller 
contribution from a rise in the revenue ratio. The 

improvement in the 
structural balance over 

2011-13 is forecast to amount to about 7
 pps. of 
GDP. Government debt is projected to stabilise at 
117% of GDP in 2013, up from 72% of GDP in 
2008. 22. ROMANIA

  After two years of negative readings and a

growth resumed in 2011 with the economy

was mainly driven by a robust increase in 

industrial output and an exceptional agricultural

GDP (y-o-y%)
forecast
 Growth in 2012 to slow down but to remain 
supported by investment
 For 2012, real GDP is projected to grow by 1.4%, 
with domestic demand expected 
to be the main 

growth factor.
 Although households and corporates 
are expected to continue to adjust their balance 
sheets during the first half of 2012, the continued 
improvement in employment, coupled with lower 

inflation, should support real disposable in
come. 
This should 
also 
contribute to a revival of private 
consumption during the second half of 2012. 
Investment is expected to be an important driver in 
2012 given the country's need to modernise its 
public infrastructure, partly with the co
-financing 
fro
m EU funds. Due to the financial market 
uncertainty, some of the investments initially 

planned for early 2012 are likely to be delayed to 

the second half of 
2012 or 2013. As in 2011, credit 
activity is set
 for a modest increase in 2012, as 
households and c
redit institutions continue 
to 
repair their balance sheets.
 External demand is expected to continue to 
contribute negatively in 2012 due to the worsening 

economic outlook for the EU which accounts for 
about 70% of Romania's exports. 
Weaker external 
demand 
will slow down export growth, while the 
slowdown in import growth will be less 

pronounced as domestic demand keeps up
. The 
resulting increase in the trade deficit will 
lead the 

current
-account deficit to widen to 5.0%. For 2013, 
GDP growth is estimated to 
accelerate to 2.9% as 
domestic demand recovers.
 The balance of risks to 
the 2012 growth baseline scenario remains tilted to 
the downside although risks become more 

balanced over the medium term. Downside risks 

include additional needs 
to repair household 
balance sheets, coupled with tighter credit 
standards for consumer lending that may result in 

lower
-than
-currently
-forecast private consumption. 
Upside risks include a stronger contribution of 

investment from higher EU funds absorption and 

of domestic deman
d linked to possible pre
-electoral fiscal slippages.
 Labour market 
remained
 subdued
 but is 
expected to improve over forecast horizon
 The labour market 
remained subdued in 2011
: 
according to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the 

unemployment rate for the age g
roup 15
-74 remained at 7.4% in 2011. Alarmingly, young 
people remain a particularly vulnerable group as 
the unemployment rate for employees 
below 25 

years 
continued to increase and reached its highest 
level of 25.4% (LFS) in 
the last quarter of 
2011. 
The o
verall employment rate remained low in 
2011 at 58.5%. 
Unit labour costs have risen only 
slightly, by 
1.7% in 2011
. Labour market 
conditions are expected to improve over the 

forecast horizon with unemployment forecast to 

decrease to 7.2% in 2012 and to 7.1%
 in 2013.
 Inflation to remain within the NBR's target range
 in 2012 and 2013
 Upside risks to the inflation outlook remain, 

although price pressures receded significantly in 

2011. HICP inflation fell sharply to 3.2% in 

December 2011, close to the mid
-point 
of the 
national central bank's (NBR's) target range of

and fell close to the euro

the first 
quarter of 
2012
 averaging 2.7%, partly 
due to
 a favourable base effect from higher food prices a

the medium term, risks to the inflation outlook are 

tilted to the upside due to 
as-yet

further increases in administered energy prices.

 Fiscal consolidation to continue
 The 
general government 
deficit decreased
 from 
6.8%
 in 2010 to 5.2% of GDP in 2011, but it 
would have been 
 significantly below 5% without 
the inclusion of a substantial one

item, worth 
1.1% of GDP, due to payment obligations related 

to court decisions which became definitive in 2011

(37) The deficit is 
expected to come down to 2.
8% of GDP in 2012. 
The measures implemented by the authorities to 

con
tinue fiscal consolidation include: (i) a freeze 
in public wages and further employment cuts in the 

public sector; (ii) a pension freeze; (iii) the 
introduction of a new social assistance code; (
iv) 
excise rate hikes for cigare

) an 
increase in royalties for 
the use of resources

construction material. For 
2013 the budget deficit is expected to fall to 2.
2% of GDP under a no

 The 
structural balance is expected to improve further 
over the for
ecast horizon, from 
-3.3% of GDP in 
2011 to 
-1.2% of GDP in 2013, as a result of 
continued fiscal consolidation. The debt

ratio is expected to stabilise in 2012

after several years of rapid growth due to the 
economic crisis

from specific sectors of the economy asking for bonuses 
that are given in other sectors, teachers 
who
 had contested 
the fact that th
ey did not receive the 50% increase in wages 
that was decided in 2008 and that the government did not 
apply
, and individuals contesting the 25% wage cut applied 
in 2010. 
The government had passed a law in Parliament 
which divided the payment of the sum int
o five yearly 
tranches from 2012 to 2016, but according to ESA rules the 
entire amount related to these decisions needs to be 
recorded in 2011 as that is the year when the decisions

these decisions was
 determined with certainty. 
 23. SLOVENIA
 Economic growth to continue to underperform the euro area
  106 Construction and private consumption are a 
drag on growth throughout the forecast horizon
 Slovenia ha
s been underperforming the euro area 
in terms of real GDP dynamics since 2009. The 
main drag on growth has come from the on
-going 
sharp retrenchment in investment, with 
construction output declining by a quarter in 2011 
alone. Private consumption also decl
ined in real 
terms in 2011. Net exports made a large positive 

contribution to real GDP growth in 2011; while the 

deterioration in the external environment led to 

lower export volume growth than in 2010, 
Slovenia managed to increase its export market 
shares
. Below euro
-area average growth is 
expected to continue throughout the forecast 

horizon. 
After a
 fall by 0.2% in 2011
, real GDP is 
forecast 
to 
contract by 1.4
% in 201
2 before 
rebounding by 0.7% in 2013.
 Given the lack of new large infrastructural projects
 and a high stock of unsold new housing, 

construction is forecast to decline again in 2012 

and more modestly so in 2013. E
quipment 
investment
 is projected to continue to expand over 
the forecast horizon, but at a subdued pace
 in 
2012. The investment outloo
k is affected by tight 
financing conditions for the corporate sector, 

which is one of the most indebted in the euro area, 

and the on
-going deleveraging process in the 
banking sector. Further job losses and negative real 

wage growth (driven mainly by develo
pments in 
the public sector) are projected to entail further 
drops in real private consumption in 2012 and, to a 
lesser extent, in 2013.

 Export growth is forecast to mode
rate significantly 
in 2012 given the further weakening of the euro
-area outlook. However, the contribution to growth 

from net exports is forecast to remain strongly 

positive (as in 2011) given the weakness of 

imports growth. In 2013, the projected recovery
 in 
investment and exports will boost import growth 
and thus reduce the positive contribution to growth 
from net exports.
 Employment continues to shrink while inflation 
remains below the euro
-area average
 Reflecting more muted activity, average HICP 
inflat
ion in 2011 was lower than the euro
-area 
average (2.1% versus 2.7%). It is projected to 

marginally increase in 2012, to 2.2%, as higher 
services inflation is forecast to be broadly offset by 
lower food inflation, and to fall to 1.7% in 2013, 

essentially re
flecting a moderation in energy 
inflation. In both years, inflation would remain 

below the euro
-area average.
 Employment growth has been negative since 2009 

and this 
is expected to continue throughout the 

forecast horizon. Unemployment has doubled to 

8.7% 
in the last quarter of 2011 relative to the 
trough in mid
-2008. Further job losses are 
expected to occur
 in construction, where 
employment has yet to fully adapt to the lower 
output, and in labour
-intensive industries, which 
are losing competitiveness afte
r the recent 
minimum wage increases. After a deceleration in 
2011, average wage growth is forecast to moderate 

further in 2012, due to cuts in public sector wages, 

before picking up slightly in 2013.
 Risks to the real GDP growth forecast are related 

to an 
intensification of negative feedback loops 

between deleveraging banks and the credit
-constrained real economy, which could bring 

further bankruptcies and a more severe 

retrenchment of investment. A sharp fall in house 
prices, which is possible given the ab
sence of 
significant adjustment to date, would have wide
-ranging effects that are difficult to assess in 
advance.
 On the positive side, private consumption 
could be more resilient if the positive effect on 

confidence of the roll
-out of the fiscal 
consolida
tion strategy is stronger than currently 
anticipated.

      107 Government deficit ratio is forecast to decline, 
while debt reaches 58% of GDP by 2013
 In 2011, t
he general government deficit 
was
 6.4%
 of GD
P. Without 
deficit
-increasing one
-offs from
 capital support o
perations, the deficit would have 
been 5.4% o
f GDP. The outturn is 0.7 pp. of GDP 
worse than the estimate in the autumn 2011 

forecast, mainly reflecting weaker direct and 
indirect taxes, with a partial offset coming from 
lower net capital expenditure.
 In 2
012, the deficit is forecast to decline to 4.3% of 
GDP. On the expenditure side, the draft budget for 

2012 implements broad
-based restraint in 
compensation of employees and social transfers 
(including a freeze on indexation arrangements) as 
well as in inte
rmediate consumption. Also, net 
capital expenditure is cut compared to 2011. On 

the revenue side, the positive impact of higher 

excise duties on tobacco and alcohol is more than 

offset by direct tax relief (a cut in the corporate 

income tax rate and more g
enerous investment 
allowances). 
Interest expenditure is forecast t
o increase strongly due to 
rising debt and the 
high
 
interest rate spreads on long
-term government 
bonds vis
-Ã -vis Germany.
 The deficit forecast for 
2012 is lower than 
the 
5.3
% projected in t
he 
autumn forecast mainly because the draft 2012 

budget has now been included. The difference with 
the deficit target of 3.5% of GDP mainly reflects 

more cautious revenue projections in conjunction 

with a more negative macroeconomic scenario.
 In 2013, the 
deficit is projected to decline further, 
to 3.8% of GDP. This reflects the incorporation of 
the draft act on balancing public finances, which 

extends several consolidation measures until after 

2012, and the fact that some measures in the 2012 
budget will h
ave their full impact only in 2013.
 In structural terms, the deficit is projected to 
improve by around 1Â¾% and Â¼% of GDP in 2012 

and 2013 respectively.
 Gross government debt stood at 4
7Â½% of GDP in 
2011. As a result of persisting primary deficits
, rising i
nterest rates and low GDP growth
, the debt 
ratio is projected to grow over the forecast horizon 

to 
some 58
% of GDP in 2013
. The deficit 
and 
debt projections are subject to 
upside risks from possible further capital support 

operations, including for the lar
gest (majority 
state
-owned) banking group, and the calling of 
guarantees, while the draft budget and act on 

balancing public finances were at the cut
-off date 
not yet approved by parliament and subject to 

negotiations
. 24. SLOVAKIA
 Economy still resilient in 2011 but growth losing pace
  108 Growth maintains momentum in 2011 
 Economic activity remained strong in 2011, with 
real GDP growing at 3.3%. The robust 

performa
nce was nearly entirely due to net exports, 
while inventories posed a substantial drag. Strong 
export growth, mainly in machinery and transport 
equipment in the last quarter of 2011 after two 

preceding negative quarters, suggests that a 

positive shock led 
to depletion of stocks, given 

persisting uncertainty about future developments. 

Combined with weak demand of households, this 
resulted in a positive external balance of goods and 
services of 2.6% of GDP. Financial market 

conditions continued to remain soun
d due to banks' 
generally healthy liquidity and limited exposure to 

risky securities.
 Meanwhile, domestic demand excluding 
inventories remained almost flat in a context of 
persistently high unemployment and budgetary 

consolidation. Household consumption co
ntinued 

to contract, mirroring the drop in real disposable 

income triggered by stagnating labour market 

conditions and fiscal measures, in particular the 
increase in the standard VAT rate and the cut in 
the public sector wage bill. With the government 

also
 slashing its capital expenditure, the solid 
performance of investment in 2011 was driven by 

the private sector, especially in the automotive 

sector, where new production lines were opened.

 Exports to remain engine of growth in 2012
-13 Slowing economic activity in Slovakia's main 

trade partners is expected to be the main drag on 

growth in 2012, which is projected to decelerate to 
1.8%. While the sizeable increase in 

manufacturing pr
oduction underpinned a sustained 
increase in export market shares
 in 2011, the 
outlook for 2012 appears less rosy.
 With four fifths 
of the total exports directed towards the single 

European market, where activity remains subdued, 

exports are expected to gr
ow below their long
-term 
trend in 2012. With the EU economy expected to 

recover gradually in 2013, export growth and 

investment should accelerate in 2013, 

underpinning the pick
-up in real GDP to 2.9%.
 Domestic demand to pick up only in 2013 
 Against the ba
ckground of sluggish labour market 
conditions in 2012, households' disposable income 

growth will remain subdued. Average annual 

growth of gross disposable income, which had 
been around 10% in nominal terms in the five 
years preceding the crisis,
 slowed to 
3% in 
2009-10 and actually declined in real terms in 
2011, depressing households' consumption. The 

resumption of growth in 2013 should bring about a 

moderate recovery in consumption along with 
gradual improvements in the labour market.
 Prevailing uncertain
ty in 2012 suggests a slower 
pace of private investment in the corporate sector, 
and investment in residential construction is likely 

to remain subdued in view of stagnating house 

prices. However, the profitability of non
-financial 
corporations has remaine
d among the highest in 
the EU and investment postponed in 2012 is 

expected to resume in 2013. Public procurement 

contracts for the construction of major transport 

infrastructure were finalised in 2011 and are also 

expected to support capital formation over
 the 
forecast horizon. 
 Inflationary pressures expected to ease 
 After remaining below 1% for two years, inflation 

spiked at 4.1% in 2011, driven largely by energy 

and commodity prices and by the increase in the 

standard VAT rate and in excise taxes introd
uced 
in January 2011. Core inflation stood at 2.7% in 

2011. HICP inflation is set to ease to 2.9% in 
2012, due 
to the fading 
away 
of the effect of the 
increase in indirect taxes
 and
 lower average 
increase
s in administered prices 
for 
heat
ing
, gas, 
and

ricity

 Labour market to remain sluggish 
 Following a 
sharp rebound in productivity and 

hours worked, the crisis
-induced process of labour 
adjustment came to a halt in the last quarter of 

2010, when annual employment growth stabilised, 
after
 having declined for seven quarters. 
Consequently, after peaking at 1
4.4% in 2010, the 
unemployment 
rate showed signs of recovery in 
2011 when it fell by 1
 pp. to 13.5%. 
Unemployment is however likely to remain high at 
13.2% in 2012, as economic growth 
is set to 
remain 
well 
below
 potential.
 Improved cyclical 
conditions 
in 2
013 sh
ould support employment 
growth above
 0.5
%, leading to 
a gradual reduction 
in 
the unemployment rate 
to below 13%.
 Public finances consolidation under way
 The government achieved a major reduction in the 

headline deficit in 2011, bringing it down to 4.
8% 
of GDP from 7.7% of GDP a year earlier. The 

consolidation 
programme included cuts in the 
public wage bill, a reduction of intermediate 

consumption, an increase in the standard VAT rate 

of 1 pp., and a broadening of the tax base for  
personal income
 tax 
and social contributions. The 
final outturn was, however, also influenced by 

other factors. Tax revenue shortfalls due to less 
tax
-rich growth and increases in non
-budgeted 
expenditure, because of the assumption of debt of 

hospitals and railway companies, 
negatively 
affected the budget balance. On the other hand, EU 

co-financing,
 interest payments, social and health 
care expenditure was lower and the outturn for 

local governments
 was better than expected. 
 For 2012, a limited set of measures has already 
bee
n approved, focusing on further cuts in the 
wage bill and in intermediate consumption 

expenditure on goods and services; on the revenue 

side, a bank levy will be introduced, coupled with 

some broadening of the corporate tax base. As 

some of the measures ha
ve proven difficult to fully 
implement in the past 
(e.g. cuts in wage bill
s), they 
are only partially incorporated in the forecast. The 
projected deficit is 4.7% of GDP in 2012. In the 
absence of announced policy measures for 2013, 

the deficit is forecast 
to increase slightly to 4.9% 

of GDP. The projected improvement in the 

structural balance over the forecast horizon 

amounts to 0.5 pp. The public debt
-to-GDP ratio is 
expected to reach 53.5% of GDP in 2013

 The Finnish economic growth was a solid 2.9% in 
2011, but growth slowed 
markedly to 0.1
% q-o-q in the last quarter.
 Consumption continued to grow 
throughout the year, but exports contracted in all 
quarters except the third. This led to negative trade 
and current

time in nearly 20 years.
 For the first half of 2012, growth is expected to 

remain weak, but to stage a gradual recovery 
thereafter. In early 2012, private consumption 
grew strongly but continued weakness on the 

production side is manifested in the manufacturing 

sector and exports.
  Consumption was leading growth 
 Consumption in early 2012 was supported by 

temporary factors. Due to the increases in 

employment and rising wages, including payment 

of one
-off bonuses, the wage bill
 of the whole 
economy 
increased significantly in the beg
inning 
of 2012. Car sales were up 34% in the first quarter 

due to increases in the car registration tax that took 

effect in April. 
 The consumption outlook for 2013 is influenced 
by the announced 1 pp. VAT increase as of 
January and by additional increases
 in labour 
taxes. While households might bring forward 

purchases from 2013 to 2012 and hereby boost 

consumption this year, consumption growth will 

be dampened in 2013. The trend in lowering the 
savings rate is expected to slow down but to 
continue, due to 
enhanced confidence arising from 

fiscal consolidation and a stable employment 

situation. 
 Investments to recover gradually
 Gross fixed capital formation is projected to 

continue to weigh on growth in 2012 and to 

recover gradually in 2013. 
While fiscal cons
traints 
do not allow for the increase in public investments, 
the
 private sector is even expected to reduce 
investments, particularly in the construction sector. 
New housing starts have fallen and vacancy rates 

seem to have increased. In contrast, investmen
t growth in the manufacturing sector is expected to 
continue in 2012 and to lead the recovery in 2013, 
as surveys point to intentions to replace production 
capacity in manufacturing.
 Foreign trade undergoing changes
 The economic slowdown in 2011/12 is driv
en by 
weakened net exports, on the back of reduced 

demand from main trading partners. While exports 

of chemicals and machinery are quickly recovering 
from the crisis, some key industries, namely 
electronics and paper, are undergoing structural 

changes infl
uencing short
- and long
-term 
prospects. Finland is continuously losing export 

market shares as both price and non
-price 
competitiveness have deteriorated. 
 Import volume growth in 2011 has been influenced 

by strong domestic demand. The trade balance for 

goods is expected to fall further to 
-0.9% of GDP 
in 2013, due to slow pick
-up of export demand 
compared to imports.

 Labour market facing structural changes 
 Slowing economic growth is expec
ted to cause a 
slight deterioration in the unemployment rate in 

2012. I
n 2013
, the labour market situation is
 projected
 to improve marginally
, with employment 
in industry continuing to be replaced by 

employment in services.
 Over the current decade, a large
 baby
-boom 
generation is set to retire. The working age 

population will start to decrease slightly in 2012 
and 2013, reducing the labour supply.

    111 The decision to increase the age from which 
employees can enter into 
part
-time pension
, thus 
increasing the ef
fective retirement age, will help to 
mitigate the effects of the diminishing labour 
force 
in the coming years. 
The government 
is 
stick
ing
 to 
its ambitious targets 
of an 
employment rate of 72% 
and 
an 
unemployment rate of 5% by 2015.
 Inflation to remain high
 in 2012
 HICP inflation averaged 3.3% in 2011, Â½ pp. of 
which was estimated to be contributed by tax rises 

on energy, VAT and excises on alcohol, tobacco 

and sugar.
 In 2012 additional increases in indirect taxes 
are 

expected
, prevent
ing
 HICP inflation from
 abating 
considerably.
 In addition, rising world market 
prices for oil are generating upward pressure, 

bringing inflation to 3% on average this year. 
 For 2013, inflation is expected to slightly recede to 
about 2Â½%, due to the waning impact of earlier tax 
rises, but counterbalanced by the announced VAT 

increase of 1 pp. in 2013. The collective wage 

agreement for 2012 and 2013 provides for 

moderate wage growth, with limited inflationary 

impact.
 Additional consolidation measures to bring 
public finances into 
balance
 In 2011, tax revenues proved to be higher and 
expenditure somewhat lower
 than foreseen, 
although a significant part of these unspent 
expenditure is expected to be carried over 
to this 
year. While the central government deficit was 

-3.1% of GDP
, the
 general government deficit, 
which also includes returns of pension funds, was 

-0.5% of GDP, lower than expected in the autumn 
forecast.
 In March 2012, the government approved 

additional consolidation measures in order to meet 

the government's objective to
 restore balance to the 
central government finances by 2015. From 

January 2013, the VAT rate will be increased by 

1 pp. Earned income tax will be effectively 
increased. Municipalities will receive less transfers 

from the central budget and are expected to 

respond by increasing local tax rates in 2013. 
 These additional measures will balance the fiscal 
impact of the weakening economy, resulting in a 
broadly stable general government balance over 

2012/13. The structural surplus is expected to be 

0.3% of GDP i
n 2012 and 2013
. 26. SWEDEN
 Subdued recovery with low employment growth
  112 2011 ended in contraction
 The Swedish economy recovered strongly from the 
2008/09 recess
ion with 
annual real GDP growth 
reaching 6
.1% in 2010 and quarterly rates of 0.8% 
on average in the first three quarters of 2011. 
In 
the fourth quarter, however, growth contracted by 
1.1% q
-o-q, as external demand contracted 
significantly and retail sales 
continued to be very 

subdued. Overall, GDP grew by 3.9% in 2011.
 Recovery expected to be subdued
 For early 2012, various indicators send mixed 

signals. On the one hand, both business and 

consumer confidence have rebounded noticeably 

in the first months of 
the year, with the composite 
indicator hovering slightly above its historical 
average level in March and April. All business 

sectors and households have become more 

optimistic about the outlook, supported by more 

stable prospects for the labour market and 
positive 

developments in the stock markets. Household 
expectations about future house price 
developments, which reached a low at the end of 

2011, have also recovered strongly, 
helped by 
interest rate cuts by the Riksbank. This has led 

heavily indebted hous
eholds to start spending 
again. After the weak second half of 2011, retail 

sales have rebounded strongly in the first quarter 
of the year.
 On the other hand, the latest industrial production 
data have been disappointing, with a sizeable 

contraction in Febr
uary (
-5.2% on the previous 
month, working
-day and seasonally adjusted), 
reversing the previous promising figures. 

Similarly, the preliminary monthly figure for new 

orders showed a significant drop in February 

(-5.5% on the previous month, working
-day and 
seasonally adjusted), in particular for new orders 

from abroad (
-8.5%). Compared to the preceding 
three months, industrial production in the period 
December 2011/February 2012 declined by 1.2% 
and new orders increased by a meagre 1%. In 

addition, according
 to the quarterly service sector 
indicator published in March by Almega, the 

employer organisation for the Swedish service 

sector, the contraction in services production 
observed in the fourth quarter of 2011 is most 
likely to have continued in the first q
uarter of 
2012. Reflecting lingering uncertainties about the 
strength of the recovery, the major stock index lost 

a significant share of its previous gains in the 

month to mid
-April.
  Taken together, this points to a rather subdued and 

fragile recovery in 
2012, led by consumer 

spending. With low capacity utilisation, slow 

demand growth and a stronger krona, corporate 

investment plans have been put 
on hold and 

companies have been revising hiring plans
 down
wards
. Export demand is 
forecast 
to 
gain 
traction onl
y in 2013
, reflecting the 
current 
slowdown in some trading partners. This is 

expected to lead to only very limited employment 

growth over the forecast horizon and 
the 

unemployment 
rate 
is therefore likely to remain 
above 7Â½% in 
both forecast years.
 Monetar
y policy has already turned more 
expansionary with two consecutive 25 basis point 

rate cuts in recent months, bringing the repo rate to 

1.5%. There is uncertainty about the future path of 

the repo rate, as the Riksbank is balancing the need 
to 
provide shor
t-term stimulus with a wish to avoid 
a reacceleration in household borrowing. 
Overall, 
GDP growth is forecast to reach only 0.3% in 
2012, before accelerating to 2.1% in 2013. 

Domestic demand is expected to be the main driver 

of GDP growth in both years, wi
th net trade only 
turning slightly positive in 2013.

     113 due to a stable commodity prices outlook and 
strong carry
-over effects from the last quarter of 
2011, when actual inflation dropped much more 

than expected across most categories of the 
consumer basket. Although the on
-going wage 
bargaining round h
as so far resulted in moderate 

wage increases (corresponding to 2.4% growth 
over a year), an expected productivity slowdown in 

2012 is likely to raise unit labour costs 

significantly. Underlying inflation is expected to 

remain subdued throughout 2012, howe
ver, with 
low demand and capacity utilisation restraining the 

inflationary impact of higher unit labour costs. In 
the second half of the year, as the recovery gains 
some traction and employment growth resumes, 

cost pressures are expected to re
-emerge and 
inflation to pick up gradually. In 2013, HICP 
inflation is expected to reach 1.5%. 
 Risks tilted to the downside
 Given that households are heavily indebted, the 

forecast is sensitive to shocks affecting consumer 

sentiment. On the one hand, should consumer 

confidence continue to improve, households could 
reduce the currently high household saving rate, 

which would boost demand. On the other hand, 

slower employment growth, weaker house prices 

or higher mortgage rates could lead households to 

focus on deleverag
ing, with adverse effects on 
consumption. The continuation of the krona 
appreciation from late 2011 represents an 
additional downside risk to both the GDP and 

inflation forecast.
 Government finances to remain close to 
balance
 The general government balance
 recorded a 
surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2011. With the 
slowdown in economic activity, it is likely to fall 

into a deficit of 0.3% of GDP in 2012, before 
returning to a small surplus in 2013 as the recovery 
takes hold. The expected weak employment 

growth and 
persistently high unemployment limits 

the improvement in the fiscal balance. The 

structural balance deteriorated in 2011, as 

economic growth turned out to be rather tax poor, 
but is expected to improve slightly over the 
forecast horizon. Mainly thanks to a
 pick
-up in 
growth and planned privatisation receipts of about 
0.5% of GDP per year over the forecast period, 

gross public debt is expected to fall gradually from 

more than 38%
 of GDP in 201
1 to around 
34% of
 GDP in 2013
. 27. THE UNITED KINGDOM
 Growth likely to remain subdued this year but with a brighter outlook
  114 A poor growth performance in 2011 
 Economic growth in the UK was weak and uneven 
in 2011, with GDP gro
wth of 0.7% for the year as 
a whole. The third quarter saw a surge of 0.6% in 

growth after a contraction of 
-0.1% in the second 
quarter, following the extra bank holiday for the 

royal wedding. However, this growth proved 

unsustainable and fizzled out quick
ly with the final 
quarter registering a negative growth rate of 
-0.3%.
 The main cause of weakness in 2011 was 
household consumption, which contracted for four 
consecutive quarters between the final quarter of 

2010 and the third quarter of 2011.
 Investment,
 which had been expected to contribute positively 

to growth, actually fell by 0.6% in the final quarter 

of 2011 and by 1.2% over the year. Net exports 

were the main source of growth in 2011, 
contributing 1% to GDP growth. Output in the 
production industrie
s fell by 1.2% in 2011, 
whereas both construction and services output 

increased, by 2.8% and 1.6%, respectively. 
 Lending to non
-financial corporations fell in 2011 
and remained muted for households. The banking 

sector, while solvent and benefiting from in
creased 
stability, remains subject to non
-negligible 
tensions, as reflected in interbank spreads. 
 Subdued growth outlook in the short term
 The preliminary estimate of first quarter GDP 

growth is 
-0.2%, which contrasts with the most 
recent business survey 
data indicating an 

expansion across all sectors for each of the first 
three months of 2012. In March, manufacturing 
showed four months of continuous expansion and 

a ten
-month high based on improved new orders. 
In the construction sector, although data are 
highly 

volatile and activity is at a low level, new orders 

increased at the fastest rate seen in more than four 
years. The services indicator gave the strongest 
reading since the second quarter of 2010. The first 

quarter estimate was dragged down by very w
eak 
construction data and subdued growth in services. 

However, given the volatility in the first estimate 

of construction data, survey results suggest that 

this number may be revised up somewhat.
 Bank lending is unlikely to pick up in 2012 despite 

a furthe
r GBP 50 billion expansion of the 
quantitative easing programme in February 2012 

(taking the total to GBP 325 billion). In fact, 

lending spreads, which have increased in the wake 
of the financial crisis, may edge up in 2012 as 
banks face higher funding cos
ts. This may further 
constrain credit availability and subsequently 

investment growth.
 The overall outlook for 2012 remains uncertain 

but, with an anticipation of stronger real wages 
improving household consumption growth towards 
the end of the year and mo
re stability in the UK's 
export markets, GDP growth is expected to remain 

positive at 0.5% in 2012 with a further 

improvement in 2013 to 1.7% as investment rises.
  Weak consumption likely to continue
 Consumption growth was negat
ive for 2011 as a 
whole. This was to be expected, with consumers 

being squeezed by high inflation, the government's 

consolidation plans, low nominal wage growth and 
higher unemployment. Surprisingly, consumption 
turned positive in the final quarter of 2011
, probably because of heavy pre
-Christmas 
discounting by retailers. However, this growth is 

unlikely to have continued into the start of 2012 

given the negative growth of first quarter GDP.
 The household saving rate increased throughout 

2011, standing at 7
.7% in the final quarter of 2011 

compared to 6.8% in the same quarter of 2010. 

The rise in the unemployment rate is likely to have 

made consumers more cautious about spending. 

Recent results from the Commission's Business 
and Consumer survey indicate that 
household 
consumption is likely to remain weak this year as 
Member States, The United
 Kingdom
   115 welfare cuts and high unemployment curtail 
demand. However, in the second half of 2012 and 

continuing into 2013, consumption is forecast to 

increase as the falling inflation rate bolsters real 
wag
es, despite continued low nominal wage 
growth. The initial boost to consumption is likely 

to come from the London Olympics with more 
positive growth prospects for 2013 playing a role.
 Corporate surplus does not translate into 
investment growth
 Despite the 
corporate surplus, it appears 
increasingly unlikely that business investment will 

be a strong supporter of growth in 2012. 

Businesses remain cautious given weak and 
uncertain domestic and external demand, and 
credit constraints may also be playing a role, 

especially for smaller businesses, in delaying 

investment decisions. This is despite the low 

interest rates (secured by the quantitative easing 

programme) and the credit easing measures 

announced by the government.
 Furthermore
, it is 
not clear 
which types 
of companies are
 guarding 
their surplus
 or whether they would invest in the 
UK in any case
. As household demand increases towards 
the end of 

the year
, investment is likely to 
remain weak 
before picking up in
 2013. 
Continuing low interest 
rates and improved
 demand prospects
 in 2013 
should support this growth.
 Volatile net exports
 Net exports contributed positively to overall 

growth in 2011, albeit to a lesser extent than 

expected in the autumn 2011 forecast. The 

uncertainties in the euro area and on
-going 
restricted credit availability appear to have reduced 
the stimulus to exports provided by the low value 

of the pound and the on
-going quantitative easing 
programme. However, a positive factor to 

emphasise is that, despite the turmoil in the euro 
area, UK exp
orts there have remained quite robust 
and goods exports to non
-EU countries increased 
by more than 50% since 2007, albeit from low 
levels. Additionally, the effects of the depreciation 

of the pound may continue to feed through for 

some years, as exporters 
may have tended to 
bolster their profit margins before fighting for 
market share.
 Thus, with government expenditure falling, 
sluggish consumption and business investment 
remaining subdued, the main driver of growth in 

2012 is likely to be net exports, whos
e contribution 
is set to increase in 2013. Sterling's sustained 

weakness, despite recent small increases, should 

help protect exporters' price competitiveness. 
 Employment prospects poor in short term
 While having remained quite steady since 2009 

despite p
ublic sector job cuts and weak growth, 
unemployment finally rose in the second half of 

2011 after public sector employment fell by more 
than 4% in 2011 as a whole and an apparent 
revision of firms' labour hoarding decisions. 

Figures from the final quarter 
of 2011 showed that 

the unemployment rate had increased to 8.4%, the 

highest rate since 1995. Despite private sector 

employment growth exceeding public sector job 
losses by some 8,000 in the three months to 
December 2011, the forward looking indicators 
imp
ly that private sector employment remains 
sluggish. The unemployment rate is therefore 
likely to increase slightly in 2012, to peak at 8.5% 

before edging back to 8.4%
 in 2013.
 Inflation on a downward slope
 After reaching a high of 5.2% in September 2011, 

the annual inflation rate fell continuously to 3.4% 
in February 2012. This was due to a number of 

factors including the VAT hike to 20% in January 
2011 falling out of the calculations, falling energy 
prices and weak nominal wage growth. Inflation 

expectatio
ns have also fallen back significantly.
 Despite the uptick in inflation to 3.5% in March, 

the forecast is for inflation to fall almost 

continuously throughout the next two years to an 
average of 2.9% in 2012 and 2.0% in 2013. The 
main risk to this forecast
 stems from increasing oil 
prices, which could reduce the rate of decline in 

inflation, but are unlikely to reverse it.
 Fiscal consolidation continues 
 The UK government is proceeding with its fiscal 

consolidation plan and has delivered the tax rises 

and s
pending reductions planned to date. The 
government introduced some small changes in its 
2011 Autumn Statement, published in November 
in order to adhere to the two national targets on 

deficit and debt ratios. This changed neither the 

pace nor the size of th
e existing
 consolidation 
plans, but altered their timing and composition. 

The government also extended the planned length 
of the consolidation effort

s increased the 
estimated total structural conso
lidation effort 
required. 
The 2012 Budget, from March, was also 
fiscally neutral. 
 In the Autumn Statement, the main measures set 
out by the government were an increase in the 
Bank Levy rate from 0.078% to 0.088%, a public 

sector pay cap after the current 
pay freeze expires 

in 2013, a new '
youth contract' to 
encourage
 the 
hiring of young people and a new infrastructure 

fund worth GBP 6.3 billion. The Budget focused 

on simplifying the tax system and attracting 
business investment. The measures included a 
red
uction in the top rate of tax to 45%, a rise in the 
personal income tax allowance to GBP 9
,205, a 
new 7% Stamp Duty Land Tax 
on purchasing
 houses worth more than GBP 
2 million
, a further 
reduction 
in the corporation tax rate 
to 24% 
with 
an offsetting incre
ase in the Bank Levy to 0.105%, 
increased tax allowances and R&D credits for 
certain industries
. In addition, 
more funding was 
set aside for infrastructure investment and 
national 
loan scheme 
to improve credit conditions.
 The most recent fiscal data availa
ble from March 

show that the initial undershoot of borrowing in 

2011-12 has been reversed, with departments 
increasing spending in order to exhaust their 

budgets before the end of the financial year (FY) 
on 31 March 2012. The revenue intake also 

slowed, so
 overall borrowing is likely to be as 
originally forecast. The deficit for FY 2011
-12 was 
8.4% and this is forecast to fall to 6.1% in FY 
2012-13. It should be noted, however, that this 
large decline is mainly due to a one
-off measure 
(1.8 pps.) in which t
he Royal Mail pension fund, 
together with its long
-term liabilities, is taken over 
by the government. The structural balance 
continues to improve, with the deficit falling from 

9.6% in 2009
-10 to 6.9% in 2011
-12. It is forecast 
to fall further to 5.3% in 2
013-14 with the average 
fiscal effort is estimated at 1.1% since 2009
-10. Gross debt for FY 2011
-12 is estimated at 86.8% 
of GDP after being revised up by Eurostat's 

amendment on the treatment of financial sector 

interventions. This is forecast to continue
 to 
increase every year until the end of the forecast 

period, currently FY 2013
-14, when it is estimated 
to be 94.7% of GDP.

 Remaining in recession
  118 GDP stagnation in 2011
 Real GDP stagnated
 in 2011
 (-0.0%)
 following 
two years 
of declining output. 
Economic activity 
started to recover
 in the second and third quarter 
of 
the year, but relapsed into contra
ction in the final 
quarter. F
inal domestic demand 
continued to 
contract in the year as a whole
, particularly due to 
a further dro
p in investment activity
. Private 
consumpti
on was slightly positive
, but
 this was 
partly offset by reduced
 public consumption
. The 
level of real GDP was 
propped
 up by inventory 
accumulation
, which contributed 
more than one
 percentag
e point to growth. Net exports 
added 
slightly 
to GDP growth
, as exports of goods and 
services expanded faster
 than i
mports
. Overall, it is 
fair to say 
that in 2011, the Croatian economy 

essentially remained in the recession which had 

started in 2008.
 Reflecting the continuation of suppressed 

economic activity, 
employment
 declined further 
and 
underlying infl
ationary pressures remained 
low in 2011. The ris
e in
 headline inflation,
 to 
2.2%, was mainly 
a consequence of higher 
commodity prices, particularly in the food 

segment.
 The current
-account deficit remained 
relatively low at around 1% of GDP.
 Monthly data suggest that the economy has 
weakened further in 
the first quarter of 2012. 
The 
downward trend of
 industrial production 
and 
construction activity steepened in January and 

February. Retail sales data were relatively strong, 

but they were likely to have been distorted by the 

prior announcement of a VAT rat
e hike. The 
foreign trade data show a significant decline of 

exports, suggesting 
that 
the weakness
 in some of 
Croatia's major export markets continues to 

depress the domestic economy. 
 Recovery postponed to 2013
 The 
Croatian 
economy fac
es strong headwinds 
in 
2012. Contracting economic activity in the euro 

area, particularly in major trading partners like 

Italy and Slovenia, is spilling over to Croatia. 
International competitiveness has proved 
insufficient to prevent a decline in export market 

shares in rece
nt years. 
Weak labour market 
conditions continue
 to exert downward pressure on 
incomes and
 spending. The high level of 
indebtedness of
 households and companies and 
their need to
 deleverage are weighing on domestic 
demand.
 Credit conditions are relatively 
unfavourable. Consumer and business confidence 
is 
suffer
ing
 from the
 uncertainties originating in 
the international
 environment. 
There has also been 
little progress in lowering deep
-seated structural 
obstacles to growth. In 2013 the more cyclical 
headwinds 
from the external side should lessen. At 
the same time, the economy should get a boost 
from infrastructure
-related investment by state
-owned companies and from investments related to 

EU accession.

Croatia - GDP growth and 
contributions
 The need for fiscal consolidation restricts the room
 for government spending. In the present forecast,
 the projections for 
public consumption and 

investment
 are based on the 'no
-policy
-change' 
assumption, i.e. only fiscal measures already 
enacted or known in sufficient detail can be taken 
into account. Overall, public consumption
 will 
detract from
 GDP growth
, while public investment 
will only contribute marginally
. Croatia's exports are
 likely
 to 
continue to 
underperform in the short term. G
iven suppressed 
export markets, export volumes are projected to 
contract in 2012 before returning to modest growth 

in 2013
. In terms of contributions to GDP growth, 
net exports 
have provided an
 offset to faltering 
domestic demand
 since the beginning of the
 recession. This pattern is projected to continue in 
2012. But i
n the following year, when domestic 
demand, particularly thanks to investment, is
 projected to increase
, imports will accelerate and 
net exports will 
again 
subtract from GDP growt

     119 The foreca
st projects real GDP to shrink 1.2% in 
the current year, before the economy emerges from 

recession in 2013 with a growth rate of 0.8% on 

the back of the improving international 
environment and the pickup of investments. 
Consumer spending should also increa
se slightly in 
2013 in the context of stabilising employment and 

marginally higher wages. The risks to this growth 

forecast are mainly on the downside. The general 

risk related to international 
financial markets
 is 
exacerbated by the risk of credit restrai
nt if funds 
were to be withdrawn from the Croatian banking 

system in the context of widespread bank 
deleveraging in the euro area.
 The labour market is projected to mirror 
developments in output with the usual lag. This 

means that employment should continu
e to fall in 
2012 before stabilising in the following year. Since 

the labour supply is declining structurally, the 

unemployment rate should already decline 
somewhat next year. Despite disinflationary 
pressures from the on
-going recession, consumer 
prices w
ill be pushed up in 2012 by the recent rise 
in international energy prices and the increase of 

the standard VAT rate. The current account has 

adjusted sharply in the first years of the recession, 

although it has not quite managed to turn to 
surplus. When e
conomic activity picks up in 2013, 
the deficit is forecast to rise again, although this 
will be moderated by the assumed decline in 
international oil prices.
 Fiscal deficit projected to remain high
 The 
recession 
has 
put public finances under severe 
pressur
e, pushing the general government deficit 
up to 
around 5%
 of GDP in 2010
 and 2011
. Based 
on the above
-mentioned 'no
-policy
-change' 
assumption the forecast projects that the fiscal 

deficit will remain roughly unchanged over the 

forecast period. On the reven
ue side, it has, inter 
alia, been taken into account that 
the standard 
VAT rate was
 increased by 2 
pps.
 to 25% as of 
1 March
 2012 and
 that
 employers' contribution to 
the compulsory health insurance has been reduced 

from 15% to 13% as of 1 May 2012
. On the 

expenditure side, the forecast takes into account 

both the authorities' on
-going efforts to limit 
spending growth and the dynamics recorded in 

recent years for categories like interest payments 

and social transfers. General government debt is 

projected to 
continue its steady increase since the 
beginning of the recession, to 57% of GDP in 
2013. This incorporates the government's 
assumption of the debt of the state
-owned 
shipyards in the context of their privatisation
.  Candidate Countries

A Sustained capital inflows support economic growth
  122 Marked growth deceleration during 2011
 Economic activity appears t
o have decelerated 
markedly during 2011, in particular towards the 
end of the year, reflecting not only weakening 

external demand but also an election
-related rise in 
public spending in the first half of the year. High
-frequency data for the first months o
f 2012 point to 
continued weak growth. However, sustained 

capital inflows in the form of workers remittances, 

income from cross
-border trade, foreign loans but 
also higher FDI inflows provide important support 
for economic activity. 
 The main sources of gr
owth in 2011 were probably 
private consumption and exports, benefiting from 
the above
-mentioned capital inflows and strong 
demand for some of the country's specialised 

products, such as steel products and car 
components. A significant share of strong 
inves
tment growth seems to reflect inventory 
building. The forecast assumes that about one 

percentage point of the currently published growth 

of 3.0% in 2011 might be due to this "stock 

building" effect. 
 Overall, national accounts data for 2011 is still 

subjec
t to a high degree of uncertainty. As a result 
of a significant data revision for 2010, current 

published year
-on-year growth rates for 2011 
might be revised substantially. 
 On the back of weakening domestic demand in the 
second half of 2011, the widening 
in the current
-account deficit remained limited, with an increase 

in the trade deficit from 21.3% in 2010 to 23.0% in 

2011 and a rise in the current
-account deficit from 
2.2% in 2010 to 2.8% in 2011. Capital inflows, in 
the form of current private transfer
s, remained on 
their high level of around 20% of GDP. Inflows of 
foreign direct investment were strong in the first 

and last quarter of 2011, resulting in an increase 

from 2.3% of GDP in 2010 to 4.2% in 2011. 

Foreign exchange reserves continued to improve 

towards the end of 2011, benefitting from higher 
inflows of current transfers and FDI. 
 Inflation picked up in 2011, from 1.6% in 2010 to 
3.9% in 2011, mainly due to high inflation in the 

first half of the year. Since then, inflationary 

pressures have decl
ined, coming down to 1.4% 
y-o-y in March 2012. 
The main drivers have been 
strong rises in food and rental, but also energy 

prices.
  The 
labour
 market 
benefitted from strong growth 
in the first half of 2011, which, despite a weak last 

quarter, resulted in a
n annual increase in 
employment of about 1% and a 1.8% decrease in 

the number of unemployed. This brought the 

unemployment rate down slightly, from 32% in 

2010 to 31.4% in 2011. Youth unemployment 

appears to have increased significantly, in 

particular in t
he last quarter of 2011, reaching 
close to 50% of the age group's labour force. 
 The 
central
 government deficit remained at 2Â½% 
of GDP. However, significantly lower
-than
-planned revenues meant that the government did 
not reach its spending targets, in part
icular in the 
area of public investment. In September 2011, the 
government adopted a supplementary budget, 
mainly reallocating spending in order to meet the 

2.5% deficit target. In response to a weak revenue 

performance in the first months of 2012, the 

aut
horities revised the 2012 budget, lowering 
revenue projections, which will be largely 
compensated for by reconsidering planned 
investment.
 Sustained capital inflows will support the 
economy 
 The deceleration of external demand and declining 
real wage incom
e could result in real GDP growth 
around 1Â¾% in 2012. Private consumption and 

investment are likely to be the 
main sources 
of growth, benefiting from stable private transfers 

and increased foreign direct investment. 
In 201
2, export market growth is expecte
d to decelerate to 

some 2Â½%. However, the completion of some 

export
-oriented FDI projects, should allow  market 
share gains in 2012 and 2013. This should help to 
bring growth to around 2Â½% in 2013. Inflation is 
expected to decelerate in 2012, following the
 expected slowdown in prices for energy and 

metals, but 
Å on the back of stronger growth 
Å to 
accelerate again in 2013. 
 Employment growth 
in 2012
 will 
decelerate
 in line 
with the growth slowdown and 
will be constrained 

by 
the 
probably
 still
-difficult inte
rnational 
environment in 201

remain subdued, given the need to remain

 A recovery is taking hold
  124 Economic recovery has taken hold in 2011
 ... The economy expanded by 3.1% in 2011, beating 
most expectations. GDP growth was mainly driven 

by private consumption, although private 

investments and exports also contributed to the 
recovery. At the same time, 
public consumption 
and investments continued to be a drag on growth. 
Strong domestic demand fuelled buoyant imports 

and the contribution of net exports to growth 

remained negative 
Å though to a lesser extent than 
a year before 
Å at around 1 percentage poin
t. More recent high
-frequency indicators present a 
mixed picture. While industrial production 

stagnated in January, statistics on credit and 

payment card turnover and on retail trade suggest a 

continuation of relatively strong domestic demand 

through Febru
ary. Consumer sentiment rose in 
February for the fourth months in a row, but 

dropped considerably in March. Tourism has 

reached new highs and the prospects are for 

another record year for the sector.
 â but
 growth is likely to decelerate
 The outlook for dom
estic demand in 2012 remains 
broadly unchanged compared with the autumn 

forecast. Private consumption growth is expected 

to decelerate, as the factors which temporarily 
supported household incomes (one
-off debt relief 
measures, extraordinary mortgage inter
est 
allowances and temporary withdrawals of savings 
from voluntary pension schemes) start to fade 

away. On the other hand, pay increases related to 

wage settlements and the expected increase in 
employment would prop up disposable income and 
spending. 
 Publ
ic investments are constrained by the tight 
fiscal situation and are likely to stagnate before 

starting to recover at the end of the forecast period.  

Since total investments are at a historically low 
level as a share of GDP (13%), there is scope for a 
rev
ival in investment activity. The forecast 
assumes that growing demand, especially in some 

capacity
-constraint sectors, will be support 
relatively robust growth in investment activity. 

However, risks remain on the downside, as the 
corporate sector is still 
marred by high debt and 
the on
-going restructuring of its balance sheets.

forecast
 Merchandise exports hinge on the performance of 
two key sectors (fishing and aluminium) where 

production li
mitations and subdued foreign 
demand would curb growth. Services are expected 

to continue growing strongly driven by the 

flourishing tourism industry.
 Overall, the forecast projects domestic demand to 

remain the main driver of growth and foresees a 

continu
ation of the recovery with a slight 
moderation in growth.
 Some gains in employment ahead
 The growth seen in 2011 was jobless. 

Unemployment fell mainly due to exits from the 

labour force, rather than the creation of new jobs. 

Further increases in economic a
ctivity are also 
likely to lead to some gains in employment. 
However, the labour market is expected to remain 

weak, with unemployment remaining high above 

the usual Icelandic standards.
 A tale of inflation worries
 â Rising oil, house and food prices, as we
ll as 
stronger wage pressures, have led annual inflation 

to accelerate to 5.3% at end
-2011. Price pressures 
continued in early 2012 and inflation rose to 6.4% 
in March. Inflation expectations have increased as 
well, with annual inflation not set to fall be
low the 
Central Bank's inflation target (2.5%) within the 

forecast horizon.
 ... and exchange rate troubles
 The exchange rate of the krÃ³na vis
-Ã -vis the 
euro 
came under pressure during the first quarter of 

2012, when it depreciated by around 6.6%. There

 Trade surpluses slowly eroding
 In 2011, the surplus in trade in goods and services 

fell to 8.2%
 of GDP, from 10.1% in 2010. This 
resulted mainly from a drop in the merchandise 

trade surplus. The forecast projects this trend to 
continue, albeit at a slower pace. A large part of 
the net income balance is accounted for by banks 

in winding up proceeding
s. The forecast assumes 

that related accrued interest on the debt of those 

banks will gradually be reduced and, therefore, the 

headline current
-account deficit will decline. 
However, the underlying current account, 

excluding banks in winding
-up proceedings
, is 
likely to remain broadly unchanged, hovering 

around a zero balance.
 Public finance consolidation has slowed â
 The process of fiscal consolidation that started in 

2009, continued through 2011, albeit amid some 

relaxation in fiscal discipline compared t
o initial 
plans. New government's commitments in the 
context of the May 2011 collective wage 
agreements compromised some of the initially 

envisaged savings on the expenditure side. The 

general government balance recorded a deficit of 

4.4% of GDP in 2011 
Å significantly lower than 
the deficit of 10.1% a year before, but about one 
percentage point higher than initially planned.
 â further fiscal slippages cannot be excluded
 The 2012 budget targets a 1.4% of GDP deficit 

(and a balanced budget by 2013
), based on
 a set of 
new consolidation measures aimed 
at rais
ing
 revenue and slash
ing
 predominantly current 
expenditure. However, 
with
 the higher
-than
-planned 2011 outcome and the fact that the 

proposed consolidation path increasingly 
relies
 on 
temporary non
-tax meas
ures and other unspecified 
or unlegislated measures, the forecast projects that 
the deficit w
ill
 reach 2.8% of GDP in 2012 and 
2.0
% in 2013. In addition, the risks to this scenario 
are on the downside
, as a number of contingent 
liabilities could materialis
e and lead to increased 
government spending. The envisaged 

consolidation path, coupled 
with
 the prepayments 
of foreign debt in March 2012, would nevertheless 

be sufficient to put the general government debt
-to-GDP ratio on a declining trajectory, bringing 
it 
below 90% in 2013
. 31. MONTENEGRO
 Subdued recovery in progress
  126 Recent developments
 The Montenegrin economy is still recovering from 
a hard landing in 2009. I
n 2011, the economy grew 
by about 2Â¾%, slightly faster than the previous 

year. Growth was mainly driven by exports and 
private consumption, supported by a resilient 
tourism industry. Consumer
-price inflation 
remained moderated, at 3% in 2011, reflecting 

higher food and transport prices as well as a rise in 
excises. Bank lending still remained in negative 

territory. Despite some additional lay
-offs from 
heavy industry and mining, the labour market 

recorded some improvement thanks to job creation 

in the servi
ces sector. Total employment levels 
increased by 1% in 2011 while the unemployment 

rate stabilised at 19.7
% as in 2010. The current
-account deficit cont
racted to 19% of GDP in 2011, 
compared to 25% a year earlier, due to the strong 
growth of merchandise ex
ports as well as a higher 
surplus in the balance of services. Moreover, the 

income balance shifted from a deficit to a surplus, 

while current transfers improved marginally. 

However, net FDI contracted sharply, by almost 

30% y
-o-y, totalling 12% of GDP in 2
011 or 6 pps. 
lower than a year before.

forecast
y-o-y% A bump on the road
 This forecast has been prepared against a 

background of deteriorating EU and global 

economic conditions and related unc
ertainties. The 

exposure of the small and open economy of 
Montenegro to the EU means that external shocks 
are transmitted through the financial, trade and 

investment channels.
 The forecast projects a marked slowdown in 

economic growth to Â½% in 2012 before 

rebounding to 2% in 2013. The main reason is the 

slowdown of domestic demand, which contributes 

only marginally to real growth in 2012, as external 

shocks delay a frank recovery of domestic credit 
growth, and therefore, private consumption.
 Moreover, the r
eliance of the domestic economy 
on external financing (and on FDI inflows in 
particular) will also have a negative impact on the 

development of gross fixed capital formation, 

notably on construction investments. These should 
broadly stagnate in 2012, and r
eaccelerate in 2013 
as preparatory work, building permits, and 
financing for several concessions and construction 

projects is being arranged.
 In consequence, labour market conditions in 2012 
would remain weak despite a resilient tourism 
industry and in vie
w of the possible closure of 
some parts of the already largely downsized metal 

industry. It is expected that unemployment will 

show clear signs of improvement only in the 

second quarter of 2013, with the start of a new 

tourism season and the acceleration o
f construction 
works in several tourism and energy projects.
 Despite subdued private consumption, consumer 

prices will accelerate in 2012 by around 4% on 

average, driven by energy prices (oil products as 

well as new electricity tariffs) but also the increa
se 
in some indirect taxes and excises. Inflationary 
pressures should ease in mid
-2013 as the base 
effect of the rise in electricity prices and taxes 

fades out. However, oil prices are assumed to 

remain high, sustaining average inflation close to 

3% in 2013
, as well as upwards pressure on private 

sector wages.
 Weaker domestic demand will also result in a 

deceleration of imports and a positive, albeit 

minor, contribution of net exports to growth in 

2012. The recovery of the metal industry capacities 

remains q
uite uncertain at present. Yet, while a 
slowdown or discontinuation of aluminium 

production will impact on exports, it would 

simultaneously reduce the large imports needs for 

energy products and raw materials, too. Moreover, 

it is expected that the steel i
ndustry could finalise 

its restructuring and restart full production as of 

2013. In the meantime, exports of services (i.e.

2012-13 lower growth levels than in 2011. Overall, 
the current
-account deficit w
ould remain broadly 
at present levels (around 20% of GDP), as the 
slowdown of exports is roughly balanced by a 
deceleration of imports.
 At the current juncture, the most immediate threat 

appears to be the still weak capacity of the 

economy (public and priv
ate sectors alike) to 
refinance debt. Additionally, a cut
-back in capital 
inflows would delay the restructuring of the 

economy, and some infrastructure projects, but 
also weaken fiscal performance given the reliance 
of indirect tax revenue on imports.
 Reth
inking domestic finances
 Consolidation efforts reduced general government 

expenditure to 43% of GDP in 2011, compared to 

47% a year earlier. However, the weak 

performance of revenues resulted in a consolidated 

budget deficit of around 4% of GDP in 2011, 

compared to 5% a year before. Public debt 
increased to 45% of GDP in 2011, although it 

remains primarily on concessional terms, with 

average interest rates and maturity at about 3.9% 

and 6.7 years, respectively.
 In response to the worsening of the 

macroecono
mic environment, the government 
revised the 2012 budget with additional revenue 

and expenditure measures adding up to one 

percentage point of GDP above the original 
measures. The rebalancing of the fiscal framework 
aims to deepen fiscal consolidation, move
 towards 
fiscal surpluses and reverse debt dynamics. 

However, there is still a high level of uncertainty 
concerning the future of the metal sector and its 
implications on domestic finances. Considering the 

activation of the aluminium plant's state guarante
es 
in early 2012, the accumulation of tax arrears and 

the rising costs of debt financing, the present 

forecast projects the general government balance 
to reach some 
-1.8% of GDP in 2012 and 1.1% in 
2013, compared to a deficit of 1% and a surplus of 
0.5%, r
espectively, in the government original 
plans. As a result, the level of public debt would 

reach 46% of GDP in 2012, falling by 2Â½ pps. in 

2013.  32. SERBIA
 Growth and fiscal challenges
  128 The export
-led recovery has lost momentumâ
 The Serbian economy recovered further in 2011 
from the crisis, with real GDP growth reaching 

1.6%, up from 1.0% in 2010. However, 
output 

growth started to decelerate
 in mid
-2011, as th
e export
-driven recovery began to lose momentum. 
Real GDP growth slowed to 0.7% y
-o-y in the 
third quarter and to 0.4% 
y-o-y in the fourth 
quarter
.  The contribution of net exports to growth 
turned 
negative
 in the fourth quarter
, as 
export 
growth decelerat
ed sharply to 1.2% due to more 
subdued external demand, while 
imports grew 
by 

16.8%.
 Import growth was partly the result of 
str
onger private investment,
 primarily 
in the 
construction sector, 
which was the main driver of 
growth in the second half of 2011, 
while private 
and public
 consumption 
continued to decline. 
Exports, as well as retail trade and industrial 
production deteriorated further in the first two 
months of
 2012. ... and growth is set to slow sharply in 2012
 The forecast projects a significant dec
eleration 
in growth to 0.3%
 in 2012
, due to a deterioration 
in external demand from Serbia's main trading 

partners
. As a result of a marked deceleration in 
export growth
, net exports will contribute 
only 

marginally 
to GDP growth in 2012
. The trade 
deficit
 would nevertheless mildly narrow, 
as 
import
 growth
 gradually moderate
s in tandem with 
a slower growth of domestic demand. The 
slight 

widening in the 
current
-account deficit mainly 
results
 from 
lower transfers from abroad, including 
remittances, and higher 
debt service payments
. Domestic demand will remain subdued. 
As in 
2011, private consumption will continue to register 

a negative growth rate, as real disposable incomes 

remain constrained by low real wage growth and a 
further reduction in employment. 
The s
cope for 
public consumption 
is 
limited 
by 
fiscal constraints
. Growth will
 thus
 continue to 
be mainly driven by 
private investment
. However, its
 pace
 will 
decelerate significantly 
as a result of a more 
moderate activity in the construction sector after 
stro
ng growth in the previous year and more 
broadly as a result of
 lower capital inflows 
(including FDI
), some
 worsening
 in financial 
conditions of firms and
 a deterioration 
in overall 
business sentiment.

 Public finances are under severe pressure. The 
budget performance in 2011 was marked by a 
slowdown in revenue growth which accelerated in 

the fourth quarter
 and a tense 
situation on the 
expenditure side, as a 
result of the unfreezing of 

public sector wages and an increase in transfers 

and subsidies to alleviate poor economic and social 

conditions. 
In spite of 
the 
spending cuts 
implemented by the authorities in the 
last quarter 
of 2011 
(which
 contain
ed the incre
ase in total 
spending at 0.4%
), the general government deficit 
is likely to reach 5
% of GDP
. The 2012 budget 
adopted in December sets a deficit target of 4.3% 

of GDP
, but 
deviat
es on some outlays
 from the 
initial agreement with the IMF
. On 29 March
, faced 
with a rising budget deficit
, primarily due to 
substantially lower than expected revenues in 
February, the Serbian government adopted 
consolidation
 measures amounting to RSD 15.7 
billion
. However,
 further consolidation measures 
are needed
 to limit increase
s in the deficit and 
public debt and to comply with the fiscal 

responsibility legislation adopted in 2010. The 

fiscal projections do not anticipate the measures 

that will be included in the revision of the 2012 

budget expected after the general elections o
f 6 
May. Under a no
-policy
-change assumption, the 
fiscal deficit could reach 5.3% in 2012 before 
being reduced to 4.8% in 2013.

 Engi
neering a soft landing
  130 Growth in 2011 stronger than expected â
 Annual 
GDP growth 
reached 9.2% 
in 2010
 and 
was 8.5% in 2011 (
helped by strong base effects
), 
in spite of sluggish demand
 in Turkey's chief 
export markets
. The major factors behind 
this 
robust performance were the continued buoyancy 
of investment and a
 positive contribution from net 
trade
 in the second half of 2011
. At the same time, 
the economy showed some signs of overheating: 

external imbalances widened rapidly and 
inflationary pressures intensified, in part due to a 
significant rise in core inflation and the uncertain 
outlook for Turki
sh exports.
 In 2012, growth is 
therefore 
expected to moderate to a more 
sustainable pace
 as a result of a more restrictive 
monetary and fiscal policy mix.

forecast
 âbut is set to sl
ow sharply in 2012â
 A marked 
growth 
slowdown 
is expected until end
-2012. In 2011 
consumer spending 
was
 buoyed by 
rapidly increasing access to bank lending and a 
sharp improvement in the labour market
, but 
lending growth to consumers has slowed 
noticeably. 
In addition, 
core
 inflation is picking up
. It has moved up steadily
, reflecting the 
exchange 
rate 
pass
-through
, relatively 
high commodity 
prices
 and 
declining
 spare capacity in the economy 
as a whole. This will undermine consumersâ¢ 

purchasing power.
 As a r
esult of these headwinds, consumer spending 
growth 
is expected to
 slow from 
7.7
% in 2011
 to 
about 3% in both
 2012 and 201
3. While 
investment was still very robust in 
2011, it is also 
set to weaken 
sharply. 
Since the end of 2011, 
lending 
started
 to slow sig
nificantly
, and
 bank 
lending rates 
are significantly
 higher than 
last year
. This development, together with the 
sovereign
-debt crisis
, is likely to make businesses more 
cautious about expanding investment
, particularly 
in the light of 
the
 very strong recov
ery since 2009. 
Annual investment growth 
is expected to slow 
from over
 18% in 201
1 to 
6% in 2012
 and 
5% in 
2013.  The combination of much more subdued domestic 

demand and a more competitive exchange rate 

should ensure that net exports continue to 
support
 GDP growth
 in 2012 and 2013
. However, the scale 
of the boost will be constrained by the weakness of 

demand in the EU
, the main destination of 
Turkeyâ¢s exports. 
Export volume growth is 
expected to 
fall to around 4
% in
 2012, 
more than 
two percentage points lo
wer than in 2011. 
GDP 
growth is forecast to ease to 
3.3
% in 2012, before 
accelerating to 4.6% in 2013
. External deficits pose a major risk
 While signs of improving external balances in 

recent months are clearly welcome, the prospective 

turnaround is still 
set to be comparatively modest, 

with the current
-account deficit shrinking 
gradually from 10% of GDP 
in 2011
 year to 
9.3
% of GDP in 201
2, and 8.7% of GDP in 201
3. This 
represents a large external financing requirement 

during a period of very sluggish globa
l growth and 
fragile financial markets. 
The risk of a disorderly 
fall in the lira's exchange rate 
Å with all its 
negative consequences for the economy 
Å remains 
significant. 
 Fiscal and monetary fine
-tuning may be 
challengingâ
 Turkeyâ¢s fiscal consolidation
 in the past decade 
has been
 an impressive success story. In the wake 
of the 2001 financial crisis, the government 

managed to cut the public debt
-to-GDP ratio from 
75% to about 40%
 currently
. As a result of 
expansionary fiscal policy, public finances 

deter
iorated in 2009 but 
thereafter 
continue
d to 
improve 
through to
 2011. In 2011, the budget 
deficit narrowed to 1.4% of GDP and is forecast to 

increase gradually to 1.8% by 2013. D
ownside

 Modest recovery amid increased fiscal policy uncertainty

 The performance of the US economy improved

 relatively strong in early 2012. After growing by a 

mere 0.1% and 0.3% q
-o-q in the first and second 
quarter, respectively, real GDP accelerated to 0.5% 

in 
the third
 and 0.7% in 
the fourth quarter
 (the 
fastest since 
mid
-2010) Å putting growth at 1.7% 
for the year as a whole.
 According to the advance 
estimate, GDP slowed mildly to 0.5% in the first 

quarter of 2012.
 Private consumption picked up
, benefitting from rising confidence, improved 

labour market conditions and 
rebounding stock 

markets. This was partly due to the disappearance 

of temporary factors that negatively affected the 

US economy in the first half of the year. Oil prices 

declined gradually in the second half of the year 

after peaking in 
the second quarter
, supply chain 
disruptions following Japan's earthquake eased
, and policy uncertainty abated (though did not 

disappear) after the raising of the debt ceiling. 
 Stronger job creation boosted confidence
 Non
-farm job creation accelerated visibly from 
127,000 o
n average in 
the third quarter of 
2011 to 

164,000 in 
the fourth quarter 
and to 212,000 in 
the 
first quarter of 
2012, the highest since early 2006. 
This helped bring the unemployment rate down to 
a 3-year low of 8.2% in March, 
while
 the 
participation rate 
fell 
below 63% in early 2012, the 
lowest since 1983. 
These i
mprovements in the 
labour market
, accompanied by a sharp rebound in 
equity prices in late 2011 and 
early
-2012, translated into stronger household confidence. 

Consumer sentiment bottomed out in

around that level in the first four months of 2012.

 Unspectacular recovery
 The US economy is expected to remain on 
a path 
of a steady but unspectacular recovery over 
2012-13. It continues to gradually work off the 
leg
acy of 
the 
headwinds of the 2008
-09 crisis, but 
a number of drags 
Å such as 
uncertain
ty regarding 
the future course of fiscal policy and rising 
oil 

prices
 Å dim the outlook. 
 Real GDP 
growth is projected to reach 
2.0% in 

2012 and 2.1% in 2013.
 After a robu
st fourth 
quarter of 2011, when GDP expanded at the fastest 

pace since the second quarter of 2010, growth is 
expected to moderate in the first half of 2012 and 
remain subdued on average for the entire forecast 

horizon. A strong build
-up of inventories in t
he 
last quarter of 2011 and a 
drawdown o
f savings to 
finance consumption in 2011 and early 2012 are 

among the key factors 
curbing
 growth expectations 
in the short
 term. 
  Constrained consumption outlook
 Private consumption is predicted to expand at just 

below 2% in both 2012 and 2013. Recent rises in 
gasoline prices have emerged as a new threat to 

consumer confidence and spending. Households 
will also have to continue deleveraging, even 
though the debt
-to-disposable
-income ratio fell to 
117% by end
-2011 Å the lowest since the pre
-crisis 
peak of 135%. The situation of households is 

persistently difficult due to falling property prices, 
which erode net wealth and prevent spending from 
resuming its pre
-crisis pace. Additionally, tight 
fiscal policies at both fe
deral and state levels will 
further restrain incomes and spending.
 The housing market 
will likely remain 
mired in a 
vicious cycle of oversupply and insufficient 
demand and thus exert a 
continued
 drag on 
confidence and spending
 in 2012
. The backlog of 
homes
 in, or entering, foreclosure will continue to 
put downward pressure on property prices, which 
are thus expected to recover only in the course of 

2013. 
 Less robust job creation ahead?
 The recent acceleration in job creation has been 

more rapid than the re
latively modest economic 
growth would justify 
Å leading Fed Chairman Ben 
Bernanke to suggest that a deviation from Okun's 
Law
(39) may be at work. The disappointing March 
employment report (a net employment gain of 
120,000, the lowest in 5 months) lends cred
ence to 

the hypothesis that the temporary disconnect 
between unemployment and production has come 
to an end and the labour market is unlikely to 

continue improving at this rapid pace without a 

sustained acceleration of economic activity. With 

the current s
ub-par growth outlook, this implies a 
marked slowing, if not stalling, of labour market 
improvements in the forecast horizon. This could 
reignite the debate over further monetary easing.

 Uncertain fiscal policy
 While 
less significant 
than 
was 
assumed
 in the 
autumn forecast
, fiscal policies 
will remain a drag
 on growth
 in 2012 (around 1.3% of GDP)
, directly 
Å through contraction in government consumption 
and in
vestment
 Å as well as indirectly 
via
 the 
winding down of crisis
-stimulus packages and 
discretionary spending cuts imposed by the August 

2011 Budget Control Act (BCA). 
Uncertainty 
regarding 
2013 is considerably higher,
 with
 total 
fiscal consolidation under 
current law adding up to 

a massive 3.8% of GDP.

 set to kick in on 
1 January, 2013.
(41)  The fiscal 
consolidation of 3.8% of GDP in 2013 is 
highly unlikely, since Republicans and Democrats 
are aware that this would bring the economy back 
into recession. However they remain far apart on 
their prescriptions on how to achieve long
-term 
fiscal sustainability
. Republicans emphasise cuts to 
non
-defence discretionary and entitlement 
spending, while Democrats favour revenue 
increases (e.g. through higher taxes on the 

wealthy). 
The 
eventual changes to expenditure and 
taxes in the near term as well as the profile a
nd 
composition of the medium
-term consolidation 
programme will depend
 on the new 
post
-election 
balance of political powers.
 For 2013 o
ur baseline 
scenario 
assumes the extension of most expiring 
tax cuts 
as well as 
a significant downsizing of 

sequestration.
 Th
is will reduce the fiscal drag to 
around 1.2
% of GDP 
in 2013.
 Balanced risks
 Risks to the outlook appear evenly balanced. 

Downside risks relate to
 possible further sharp 
                                                           (41) The

 increases in oil prices 
as well as the un
certainties 
regarding the 
domestic fiscal 
and debt outlook. 

The 
latter 
risk may materialise if a damaging 
political stand
-off over fiscal measures 
is repeated, 
for example during the 
next debt ceiling 
debate
, or 
over the question of which tax cuts should be 
extended (both expected
 in late 2012
). This may 
undermine financial markets' confidence in the 
emergence of the political consensus necessary to 

put in place and 
implement medium
-term fiscal 
consolidation. Upside risks include a more 

sustained decoupling from the 
global 
slowdown 
and 
greater unde
rlying momentum generated from 
the recent
 strengthening 
of economic activity. This 
may come through, inter alia, a prompt and 

successful 
emergence of the credible medium
-term
 fiscal consolidation, a faster
-than
-envisaged 
rebound in the housing market and s
tronger job 
creation underpinned by the continuing rise in 

business confidence. Another source of upside 

surprise to growth
 in 2012
 could 
also 
come from 
a milder
-than
-projected rise in oil prices. 
  35. JAPAN
 Recovery after a setback
  137 GDP contracts due to negative net exports
 The effects of the March 2011 earthquake pushed 
Japan back into recession,
 following growth of 
4.4% in 2010 and a 5.5% decline in 
2009. 
Overall, 
GDP for 2011 contracted 0.7%,
 due to
 a sharp 
drop (
-1.8% q
-o-q) in the first quarter and a milder 
retrench
ment
 (-0.3% q
-o-q) in the second quarter.
 With supply
-chain disruptions easing in the third 
quarter, GDP rebounded (1.7% q
-o-q) but was
 again pushed back into negative territory (
-0.2% 
q-o-q) in the final quarter due to deteriorating 
world trade, the strong yen and new supply
-chain 
disruptions caused by the flood in Thailand. These 

factors, and the need to import more oil due to the 

shutd
own of nuclear power plants, caused Japan's 
first trade deficit in more than three decades, and 

net exports made a negative net contribution to 

GDP of 0.7 pp. In addition, the significant 
appreciation of the yen against the Korean won 
had a sizeable negati
ve impact on Japanese exports 
and the profitability of Japanese companies. The 

structural trade surplus has narrowed rapidly in 

recent years and might turn to a deficit relatively 

soon.
 Non
-residential investment grew at 20.7% 
(SAAR) in the fourth quarter 
of 2011.

  Moderate growth likely to be driven by 
investment in 2012
 Japan was the only major country where financing 
conditions loosened in the final quarter of 2
011 
according to the BIS. Access to finance is on 

balance 
conducive for
 investment, although real 
interest rates are not that low for corporations in 

Japan.
 Recent business surveys confirm that 
growth in non
-residential investment is currently 
driven more 
by non
-manufacturing companies than 
by manufacturing companies. If world trade 

recovers, and the yen continues to be weaker than 
it was in most of 2011, manufacturing companies 
might also join the recovery trend and increase 

their investment in the course 
of 2012.  Public 

investment is expected to grow relatively strongly, 

with the biggest quarterly growth expected in the 

second quarter due the supplementary budgets 
aiming at reconstruction following the March 2011 
devastation. It is still not clear when th
e bulk of the 
money will be spent, but signs are that from the 

second quarter onwards, spending related to the 

supplementary budgets will pick up.
 Government consumption will likely grow at a 
fairly moderate pace in 2012 due to salary cuts for 
civil servan
ts, pension cuts and a somewhat 
improving economy. Private consumption was flat 

in 2011, but above 2007 levels. Real incomes are 

rising moderately and give some limited support 

for consumption growth in 2012. The looming 
social security reform, potential t
ax rises, as well 
as purchasing power losses due to higher energy 

prices, suggest that consumers are likely to remain 

cautious. 
 Exports are likely to grow only moderately in 

2012, although the special factors 
that negatively 
influenc
ed their performance 
in 2011 are
 fading
. Moderate expectations for world trade growth and 
trade growth in Asia are likely to prevent a 

stronger rebound for Japanese exports. A major 

factor for export
 growth
 will be the 
evolution
 of 
the REER, which 
reached
 its 
highest
 level 
in several years before the Bank of Japan's decision 
on 14 February 2012 
on its inflation goal and 
the 
expan
sion of
 the asset purchase program
me. Since 
then
, the REER
 has 
weakened and in the middle of 
March 2012
 fell slightly below the 2011 average 
level. Impo
rts are likely to grow due to a higher 
need for imported fossil fuels as all 
but one 
nuclear 
power plant were shut down as of April 2012 and 

it appears 
unlikely 
that many nuclear power plants 
will be operational soon given rising local 

resistance. Mineral 
fuels 
account for almost 40% 
of import
s in early 2012 
and the volume increase 
for LPG and LNG (to operate thermal plants) 
increased the overall import bill by 2.5%
 compared 
to early 2011
. Despite lower q
uarter
-on-quarter
 dynamics
, imports are likely to out
grow exports 
due to the higher carry
-over.

    138 Fiscal consolidation remains an urgent need 
 The very high debt
-to-GDP ratio, low structural 
growth, a narrowing current
-account surplus and 
outstanding government debt that is likely to  
overtake household net a
ssets in a couple of years 
all call for a credible fiscal consolidation plan. 

Since the autumn forecast, fiscal consolidation 
plans have become more detailed. However, in 
April 2012 it was still unclear whether a 

consumption tax hike and other consolidatio
n measures would become law. Delaying the 

implementation of consolidation measures is risky, 

as successful consolidation is much more difficult 

once government
-bond yields increase 
significantly.    
 Monetary policy loosened  
 The decision of the Bank of J
apan to move from 
targeting "price stability" to a more outright 

inflation goal (of 1% for the time being) was a 

significant step and was followed by a weakening 
of the yen. At the same time the central bank 
further expanded its asset purchase programme. I
f needed, the Bank of Japan is also expected to take 

further easing measures in the coming months. 

With headline inflation hovering around 0% and 

few inflationary pressures, the Bank of Japan will 
need to take further measures to reach its new goal. 
Japan 
is expected to remain with very mild 
deflation in 2012 before turning to low (but 
positive) inflation in 2013. 
 Outlook for 2013 
 Moderate growth is expected to continue in 2013. 

A positive growth contribution from net exports is 

expected due to lower mine
ral fuels imports, 

accompanied by renewed market
-share gains. 
Investment, apart from residential investment, is 

expected to grow more slowly than in 2012. Both 

government and private consumption are also 

expected to grow more slowly than in 2012, as 

fiscal
 consolidation becomes more ambitious, 
consumers have fewer incentives to buy durables, 
and the effects of higher electricity and import 
prices lower consumers' purchasing power. 
 Downside risks are more pronounced
 Public investments and exports could be s
tronger 
than expected. Downside risks are linked with 

higher oil prices, energy shortages and to a loss of 

confidence in the government
-bond market.
  36. CHINA
 A benign slowdown amid remain
ing structural challenges
  139 Still on course for a soft landing?  
 China's real GDP grew by 9.2% overall in 2011. 
The quarterly growth rate fell gradually from 9.7% 

in the first quarter, to 8.9% in the fourth quarter as 

activity res
ponded to the tightening of monetary 
conditions initiated in the middle of 2010. 
 Growth in 2011 was largely driven by domestic 

demand, which remains heavily directed towards 

investment (at 48% of GDP in 2011), unchanged 

from 2010. There is so far little s
ign of any 
significant rebalancing between consumption and 

investment demand. The current
-account surplus 
was 2.8% of GDP. This compares with a surplus of 

5.1% in 2010, and a peak surplus of over 10% of 

GDP in 2007. 
 Annual consumer
-price inflation increas
ed steadily 
in 2010 and the first half of 2011, reaching a peak 

of 6.4% in July of 2011. The 
People's Bank of 

China 
(PBoC) raised its 
policy 
lending 
rate five 
times 
between
 October 2010 
and July 2011 and 
introduced a range of measures to limit credit 

growt
h, particularly in the property sector. From 
that point, inflation has fallen back steadily, falling 

below the 
PBoC
's target of 4% in February 2011.

 The general outlook has therefore bee
n one of 

gradually slowing output and price growth. For the 

most part, the slowdown has been benign, with 

output, inflation, and asset price inflation all 

moderating fairly smoothly, appearing to suggest 

that China may be on course for a "soft landing". 
 This outlook has been put into some doubt by 
figures released in the first quarter of 2012. First 

quarter GDP figures came in weaker than 
expected, at 
8.1%, and March trade figures showed 
weak import demand. Our central forecast, 

however, is for growth of 8
.4% in 2012, and 8.2% 
in 2013, though with risks tilted to the downside. 
 The outlook for trade
 As a driver of growth, trade appears to be losing 

significance at the margin. Since the start of 2010 

there has been an apparent downward shift in the 

trend gro
wth rates of both imports and exports, and 
a narrowing of the current
-account surplus. 
Despite this, China remains highly exposed overall 

to global demand shocks, with exports accounting 

for a high percentage of GDP; this is a major risk 

over the forecast 
horizon.

Graph II.36.2:
China - Growth  rate of  imports

y-o-y%
 In the medium term, the question arises of whether 

this shift in trade flows is temporary or part of a 

structural rebalancing of China's growth model. 

Part of the nar
rowing gap between imports and 
exports can be explained by the 10% appreciation 

of the renminbi against the US dollar since the 
middle of 2010. Higher commodity prices and the 
investment
-intensive pattern of demand in recent 
years have also contributed to 
rising imports.  

Moreover, wage levels in coastal provinces with 

concentrated export industries are rising rapidly, 

potentially putting pressure on export margins. The 

longer term outlook for China's trade performance 
therefore remains hard to predict.

     140 Internal risks to growth
 The major internal risk to growth is a sharper than 
expected decline in investment spending, 

particularly in the property sector. In the wake of 

the 2008 financial crisis, China loosened credit 
controls substantially and saw a ver
y rapid growth 
in real estate investment. Residential investment is 

well over 10% of GDP. Although this level is not 
sustainable, an overly rapid fall in investment 

would add to the likelihood of a hard landing.  
 Property prices have also become a concern
 at a 
political level. House price inflation picked up in 
2009 and reached almost 10% in 2010, before 
moderating as monetary policy was tightened. The 
Chinese premier has pledged to reduce prices to a 

more "reasonable" level, following concerns about 

gener
al affordability. The policy challenge is to 
gradually deflate the property bubble without a 

sharp dislocation in demand, or excessive spill
-over effects to other sectors.  
 In the short run, the authorities have significant 
room to react to unexpectedly n
egative 
developments. Government debt levels do not 

constrain fiscal policy at present, even though 

central government debt (officially 17% of GDP) 

excludes a range of contingent liabilities. In 

addition, there is scope to loosen credit controls on 
banks, 
to lower required reserve ratios to expand 
liquidity, and to cut the floor for bank lending rates 
if necessary. However, this relatively optimistic 

assessment has to be qualified in two senses. 
 Firstly, there is a number of potential political and 
economi
c constraints on short
-term policy making. 
For example, on the economic front there is a 
possibility that inflation could tick back up, in 
response to higher food prices and rising global 
commodity prices. Higher inflation is potentially 

destabilising, giv
en the high percentage of 
household wealth held in bank deposits. On the 

political front, constraints on policy may arise 

from the uncertainty surrounding the change in 
political leadership towards the end of the year.  
 Secondly, China has a structural st
ock
-flow 
problem. Very high levels of investment in recent 
years have supported short
-term demand growth, 
but have also contributed to a potential decline in 

capital productivity and a rising stock of bad loans. 

In the event of a sharp downturn, a loosenin
g of 

credit would risk perpetuating these longer
-term 
problems.  Moreover, a continuing build
-up of bad 
debt in the financial system puts pressure on bank 

finances, and may create a further obstacle to the 

liberalisation of interest rates. However, without
 rate liberalisation it will be hard to achieve a 

sustainable shift to a more consumption
-driven 
model of growth
. 37. EFTA
 Signs of resilience despite difficult external conditions
  141 Due to changing external conditions and, in 
particular, the euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis, the 
outlook for both Switzerland and Norway has been 

revised down significantly. However, their sound 
economic policies, their ability to tap in
to new 
markets and solid economic underpinnings are 
making Norway and Switzerland more resilient to 

the euro
-area debt crisis than one would expect on 
the basis of their deep links with the euro area.
 In particular, yields have shown little sign of 

contagi
on, as they have actually fallen amid strong 
capital inflows in Switzerland and, to a lesser 

extent, Norway. As a consequence, monetary 

policy could stay relatively accommodative 

because exchange rates appreciated, which helped 

to keep a lid on inflation. 
 Trade was not as much affected as might have 

been expected, either. Both Norway and 

Switzerland benefit from relatively decoupled 

business cycles in Asia and North America. In the 

case of Norway, this has led to persistently high 
prices for its exports of
 oil and gas. In the case of 
Switzerland, export fall
-out from some euro
-area 
countries was largely substituted by demand from 
emerging market economies, in particular for its 

niche products like machinery and watches.

forecast
  The effect of the euro
-area sovereign
-debt crisis 
may have been felt most in Switzerland through 
changes in consumer and business confidence. 

Consumer confidence fell as quickly as it had 
during the unfolding of the global financial cri
sis. 
Consumer and business confidence in Norway is 
less affected. The Norwegian state has traditionally 
offered more of a buffer to external conditions, not 

least because of the oil fund and the still high oil 

revenues.
 Norway: domestic demand as the main 
growth 
engine
 The Norwegian economy recovered in 2011
, with 
GDP growth 
reaching
 1.6%. Growth is expected to 
edge up
 to around 1.
7% in 2012, as mainland real 
GDP is affected by reduced 
foreign
 demand 
for its 
on-shore produce 
and uncertainty from the euro
-area recession. However, consumer demand, low 
interest rates, high natural gas export volumes, 

high oil prices and robust manufacturing 

production observed in early 2012 can be expected 

to continue 
to 
support the economy during 
the rest 
of the year
. Norwayâ¢s
 substantial sovereign oil 
wealth and the governmentâ¢s efforts to smooth the 

economic cycle will provide a further buffer to the 

economy in times of distress. In 2013 and over the 

longer 
term, the trend fall in petroleum output and 
potentially tighter cred
it conditions are likely to 
weaken average growth compared with the decade 
up to 2008, to around 2%. 
 Investment takes the lead
 Private consumption growth slowed from 3.
7% in 
2010 to 2.
2% in 2011, despite fairly rapid real 
wage growth (2.6%) and robust emp
loyment 
growth (1.4%). 
The savings rate is expected to 
decline somewhat in 2012 and consumption 

growth to rise slightly
, to 2.5% over the year
, as 
part of households' accumulated wealth is used to 

smooth consumption over the business cycle
. Supported by 
improving 
labour market
 conditions
, consumption is foreseen to continue rising by 
around 3% in 2013. After declining for two 
consecutive years, gross fixed investment grew by 

7.2% in 2011, and is forecast to continue growing 
in 2012, driven by off
-shore inve
stment, especially 
in the Barents Sea. This 
in turn 
will support 
investment by many mainland businesses and help 

offset the reduced income from exports to 
the euro 
area
. However, investment is expected to grow 
slightly 
more 
slow
ly in 2013
, mainly because o
f lower forecast off
-shore investment.
 European Economic Forecast, Spring 2012
   142 Oil prices supportive 
 Norway's current account will remain comfortably 
in surplus throughout the forecast period. Oil 

exports will decline gradually over the forecast 

period, as production is now past its peak, altho
ugh gas exports will continue to grow. The growth of 

traditional exports should pick up during the 
second half of the forecast period as external 
demand strengthens. 
The development of
 oil prices 
and 
of the
 US dollar will 
determine whether
 petroleum export
 earnings 
can sustain a large 
surplus on the goods account despite 
the 
declin
e in
 oil production. Relatively robust domestic demand 

should maintain steady import growth 
at 
around 
5%. The current account will also be supported by 

surpluses on the services b
alance.
 Benign inflation developments 
 A strong krone has kept inflation low, despite 

higher global energy costs. CPI growth is expected 

to gain momentum along the forecast period, as 

stronger domestic demand and higher wage 
settlements should stimulate pr
ices to reach the 
central bank's 2.5% inflation target in 2015 and 
2016. Switzerland: between a rock and a hard 
place?
 The current situation is exceptional for 
Switzerland. On the one hand it is perceived as one 

of the few remaining safe havens for global 
capital 

flows and on the other hand it is highly 
economically integrated with the euro area. The 
country combines relatively solid financial market 

institutions with liquidity and the presence of 

major financial institutions. As a consequence of 

high and v
olatile global risk aversion, Switzerland 

is experiencing high capital inflows 
Å in particular 
at the short end 
Å and appreciation pressure on its 
currency.
 Low yields, ample liquidity and domestic credit 

raise the risk of 
irrational
 exuberance in real est
ate. 
The acceleration of house
-price growth over the 
past quarters is not out of line with historical price 

developments, but the national figure covers the 

heterogeneity of house price developments across 

Switzerland.
 Finding new markets while facing appr
eciation
 Uncertainty over income growth in the euro area 

and reduced price competitiveness due to the 
appreciated Swiss franc leads to wavering demand 

from the euro area. At the same time, Swiss 
exporters' specialisation in higher value added 
goods gives S
wiss exports some resilience. For 
instance, the Swiss economy has a competitive 
edge in the exports of goods in some niche markets 
and is able to tap into robust demand in those niche 

markets from the emerging economies. One such 

niche markets is the watch
 making industry, which 
accounted for 10% of all goods exports in 2011. In 

2011, the exported value of watches increased by 
19.2% y
-o-y. More difficulties are being 
encountered by the paper and chemical industries 
where price pressures are significant. Exp
orts to 
Asia grew by 9.6% y
-o-y in 2011, with 
exceptionally strong numbers for China (19.2%), 

Hong Kong SAR (18.8%), and India (15.5%).

 Swiss confidence took a hit
 The f
all in Swiss confidence resembled the fall 
from the second quarter of 2008, as the global 

economic and financial crisis unfolded. This time 

the impact of the fall in confidence on private 
consumption and gross fixed capital formation was 
relatively limited
 and mostly felt in the third 
quarter. In the fourth quarter, private consumption 

showed a robust real growth of 0.4% q
-o-q (seasonally adjusted) and gross fixed capital 

formation grew by 2.5% q
-o-q. A large inventory 
correction caused domestic demand to c
ontract by 

1.5% q
-o-q instead of the 0.8% q
-o-q growth 
which would have resulted from consumption and 

investment demand only. 
 Unemployment has risen mildly in recent months 

and is expected to rise somewhat further before 
improved economic conditions lead 
to stronger 
employment growth at the beginning of next year. 

Unemployment is expected to stay at low levels

 Returning to p
otential growth
 The large inventory correction in the fourth quarter 

implies room for inventories to contribute to GDP 

in 2012. Moreover, the strong fundamentals of the 

Swiss economy, the labour market conditions, and 
improvements in the external environme
nt will all 
support a return to potential growth towards the 
end of 2012, as foreign demand should add to 

domestic forces already in place.
 Labour market conditions should not pose a risk to 
inflation dynamics. Instead, a risk could come 
from the extraordi
nary measures the SNB took to 
stem the appreciation of the Swiss franc. Both 

deflation, in case of further appreciation, and a 

jump in the inflation rate are a possibility, although 

both are rather unlikely. Most probably, 

developments in capital inflows, 
a return to more 
normal monetary policy environment, exchange 

rate developments and a return to potential growth 
will cater for a benevolent outcome.
 Public finances on a structurally sound footing
 The outcome in 2011 for public finances was a 
small surpri
se to the upside, notwithstanding some 
extraordinary outlays. Revenues have been a 

positive surprise in the past year but this is 
expected to wane in 2012. In the case of 
government expenditure, the determining factor 

may well prove to be the developments 
in regional 
public finances. For 2013, revenues could benefit 
from a broader tax base as economic growth 

returns to potential. General government debt is 

expected to decline further as a consequence of 

both economic growth and the small surpluses

forecast
The expansion of domestic demand was a major 

driver of economic growth in 2010. Growth in 

consumer spending and investment activity 
increased in 201
1; both are expected to decel
erate
 slightly in 2012. 
As a result, and i
n the absence of 
a more comprehensive growth strategy, GDP 
growth will remain relatively subdued. Exports 

accelerated in 2010, but the sluggish expansion in 
the oil and gas sector (where some existing fields 
are al
most depleted), combined with the negative 
deman
d effects of the euro
-area
 sovereign
-debt 
crisis, are likely to limit export volume growth to
 around 3.5
-4.5% per year in 2012
 and 2013. In the 
second half of 2011 higher agricultural output 

partially boosted
 exports. Imports
 continued to 
grow strongly 
due to the strengthening of domestic 
demand
 in 2011. A 
deceleration in the growth of 
imports 
is expected in 2012 
as domestic demand
 turns out more weakly
. High energy prices for 
2011 are the main reason behind t
he strong 
current
-account surplus
 (5.7% of GDP)
. Overall, 
the current
-account surplu
s is expected to decrease 
to 4.5% of GDP in 2012 and to 4.1
% of GDP in 
2013. 
The labour market
 situation is improving 
slig
htly. The unemployment rate 
started to edge 
down i
n 2010. In 2011 the unemployment rate 
declined to 6.6% and it is expected to moderate to 

6.2% in 2012
 and to 6.0% in 2013
, returning to 
pre
-crisis levels on the back of a reduction in the 
unemployment gap between rural and urban areas 
and between men and w
omen.  
 Inflation continues to slow down
 Inflation picked up to almost 10% by January 
2011, mostly
 due to higher food prices following 
widespread damage to crops caused by forest fires 

in August 2010
.(42) CPI moderated to 7.4% on 
average in the second half 
of 2011, slowing down 

from 9.5% on average in 
the first half of
 2011. CPI 
continued 
to 
moderat
e in the first months of 2012, 
reaching
 4.2% in January, 
and 
3.7% in February 
and March. This downward trend was largely 

driven by lower food prices, following a 
very good 
harvest in summer 2011.

was unprecedentedly high
 in 2011, amounting to 
USD 80.5 bn, more than doubling the outflow seen 

in 2010, and it is continuing on the same path in 

2012 (USD 35.1 bn in the first quarter). The CBR 

reduced its refinancing rate four times in 2010, 

from 8.
75% in February to a record low of 7.75% 
in June. 
In the light of high inflationary 

expectations and rising oil prices, the CBR 

increased the refinancing rate to 
8.25% on
 3 May 
2011, while cutti
ng it to 8% on 26
 December 2011. 
The CBR 
is targeting an infla
tion rate 
of 5
-6% in 
2012 and 4.5
-5.5% in 2013. 
 Fiscal outlook
 The Russian
 budget was in surplus in 2011 (0.4% 
of GDP), for the first time since 2008. Under the 

curr
ent budget proposals,
 the central government 
deficit is set to shrink to 1.5% of GDP in 20
12, 
before reaching 1.6% in 2013 and 0.7% in 2014. 
According to the Medium Term Expenditure 
Framework, the 
budget is expected to return to 
balance by 2015. This is in line with th
is forecast, 
which expects a deficit of 0.9% of GDP in 2012 

and of 1.4% in 20
13. Additional fiscal spending 

associated with the election cycle, however, 

appears possible in 2012 (according to the Finance 

Ministry the budget in January 
and February 
incurred 
a higher
-than
-expected deficit).
 This, 
could, however be offset by the 
oil p
rice 
increase 
forecast for 2012 by the Ministry of Economic 
Development, to USD 115 from USD 100 a barrel.  

One of the main vulnerabilities of the Russian 

economy remains the non
-oil 
fiscal 
deficit. It 
exce
eded 10% of GDP in 2011 and it should
 only 
decreas
e to 9% by 2014.
