banks to tighten their credit standards and to further deleverage, thereby risking a curtailment of the 


countries.  As a result, GDP declined by 0.5% for the year as a whole, following two years of moderate positive 

beginning of the year to 2.2% in November and December. The average rate for the year as a whole 
was 2.5%, which was only slightly lower than the rate of 2.7% registered in 2011. Persistently

growth rate of loans to the private sector turned negative over the course of 2012, in particular

HAMPERED THE EFFECTIVE PASS-THROUGH 

OF KEY ECB INTEREST RATE CUTSThe lowering of the key ECB interest rates in 

July 2012, which followed two 25 basis point 

cuts in late 2011, led to a further decline in money market interest rates. While bank lending rates 





did not take place in a homogeneous fashion across euro area countries as had been the case in the 



transmission of monetary policy in the euro area. As a result, the cuts in policy rates were to a large 

extent passed on in some countries, but the interest rates charged on bank loans to the real economy 

remained unchanged or even increased in other countries. EUROSYSTEM ADOPTED FURTHER NON-STANDARD MONETARY POLICY MEASURES IN 2012In order to contribute to a more effective transmission of the ECB™s accommodative monetary

determination on the part of governments to take the necessary steps to resolve the crisis and to 

implement agreements made at the European level. Markets particularly focused on the potential 

repercussions of uncertainties in Greece, and on developments in Spain and Italy, amid fears about 

the sustainability of government debt and constrained access to the funding market. These fears 

led to exceptionally high risk premia, related in particular to unfounded concerns on the part of 

investors about the reversibility of the euro. Differences widened particularly in the pricing of

Box 1WHY THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL TRADE? 
Over the last two years there has been a widespread deceleration in world trade growth amid a 


from the euro area sovereign debt crisis, balance sheet deleveraging and, at a regional level, 



import growth has been observed across both 

advanced and emerging market economies 

(see Chart A). Growth in world trade has 

not only declined in absolute terms but has 

also weakened relative to global economic 

activity. Between 1982 and 2007 the ratio of 

global import growth to GDP growth was, on 

average, 1.8, whereas this ratio declined to 1.0 



2012 (see the table below).Why has the recent slowdown been stronger 
than that suggested by the long-run relationship 

between trade and GDP growth? First, the 

decline in trade growth relative to GDP growth 

has been particularly pronounced in advanced 



by developments in the euro area. Second, in 

some regions, the decline in GDP was driven 

by demand components with a relatively high 



inventories. Finally, there is some evidence

countries than in emerging market economies (see Chart A). An important reason for this is 

about 50% of advanced country imports. Since the second half of 2011 euro area GDP growth 

has declined less than import growth and the share of the euro area in advanced country GDP 

has decreased to around 30%. Excluding the euro area and Japan (the latter™s GDP and trade

VOLATILE COMMODITY PRICES IN 2012 
The price of Brent crude oil was overall stable in the course of 2012, albeit masking high levels of 

volatility. Prices were down nearly USD 40 per barrel from peak to trough between mid-March and 

late June 2012, before they rose again and stabilised at around USD 110 per barrel towards the end of 

the year (see Chart 4). Moreover, 2012 was the 

second consecutive year that the average annual 

Brent oil price stood above USD 110 per barrel.As in 2011, a combination of supply concerns 
and demand-side factors explained the sharp 

movements in oil prices. On the supply 

side, the escalation of tensions with Iran, 

culminating with the announcement of a US 

and European embargo on oil imports from the 

country, pushed prices sharply higher in the 



launching of the embargo on 1 July 2012. Prices 

remained elevated even as the market became 

increasingly well supplied by OPEC-led 

output rises, particularly owing to a faster than 

expected recovery in Libyan output. Eventually, 

however, the rising oil supplies coupled with 

an accumulation of signals pointing to slowing 



tensions in some euro area sovereign debt 

markets, led to a reversal in oil prices in the 

second quarter of the year. In the second half of

amid some volatility, but remained throughout the year well below their daily peaks reached during 

2008 and 2011. Metal price movements were primarily affected by uncertainty regarding global

broadly unchanged over the year (see Chart 6). 

By the end of 2012, in nominal effective terms, 

the euro stood 0.4% below its level at the end

5% below its average for 2011.Regarding other major currencies, the euro 
appreciated substantially against the Japanese 

yen, particularly in the second half of 2012, 

as uncertainties in Japan negatively affected 

the value of the Japanese currency. On

assets, particularly by institutional investors. By contrast, the annual rate of growth of loans 
to the private sector (adjusted for the impact of 

loan sales and securitisation activity) declined 

steadily, standing at -0.2% in December 2012, 

compared with 1.2% in December 2011. As a 

consequence, the divergence observed since 

early 2012 in the annual growth rates of money 

and credit to the private sector continued to 

widen in the course of 2012 (see Chart 7). 

At the same time, the impact of the non-standard 

measures adopted by the Governing Council of 

the ECB, in particular the three-year longer-







the funding pressures faced by MFIs. The increase in the volatility of monthly data for money and 

credit was also fostered by developments observed in interbank transactions conducted via central 

counterparties (CCPs), which were traditionally part of the money-holding sector. This led the ECB 

to amend its statistical measurement of broad money and credit to the private sector to adjust for 

repurchase agreement transactions with CCPs with effect from the end-August monetary data.
3 In addition, changes in the regulatory environment and uncertainty regarding further changes to the 



MFIs but also stimulating efforts on the part of the banking system to strengthen its deposit base. 

Overall, looking beyond short-term volatility, developments in broad money and credit indicate 

that the pace of underlying monetary expansion strengthened moderately in 2012 but remained 

subdued.PORTFOLIO CONSIDERATIONS WERE THE KEY DRIVER OF DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPONENTS OF M3As regards the developments in the main components of M3, the heightened uncertainties prevailing 





increase in the annual growth rate of M1, which stood at 6.3% in December 2012 (see Chart 8). 

These portfolio reallocations away from riskier assets were also accompanied by a decline in the 

remuneration of more or less all assets contained in M3, with a resultant decline in the opportunity 

costs of holding highly liquid instruments (see Chart 9). This preference for liquid deposits in the 

presence of very low policy and market rates points to the establishment of cash buffers by the 

money-holding sector, possibly as an intermediate step in the portfolio reallocation process.

money holdings can at times display quite erratic behaviour, so their short-term dynamics should 

not be over-interpreted. At the same time, the agility of these investors endows their money holdings 

with early signalling properties for incipient trends in portfolio allocation, which will only emerge 

with a lag in the money holdings of other, more inert sectors, such as households. Deposits placed 

by general government other than the central 

government also showed dynamic behaviour,

MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUED TO BE AFFECTED BY THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS 
Conditions in euro area money markets continued to be affected by the sovereign debt crisis in 2012. 

The ECB policy decisions which had the most notable impact on euro area money markets were

period of 2012. Partly as a consequence of the increase in excess liquidity, trading activity in 

euro area money markets declined further (see Chart 11 below, showing the decline in EONIA 

volumes over the year). However, the underlying reason for the continued decline in trading 

activity was the continued strong market segmentation caused by the sovereign debt crisis.

liquidity, which stood at •622.7 billion

excess liquidity prevailing throughout 2012, 

short-term money market rates remained close 

to the rate on the deposit facility, exhibiting 

only mild volatility.Chart 12 shows the development of three-month

continued to decline. In July 2012 the Governing Council of the ECB 
reduced the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis 

points. The lowering of the rate on the deposit 

facility to zero was associated with short-term 

money market rates in the vicinity of zero, with 

some trades, especially in the secured segment, 

taking place at negative rates. The EONIA 

continued to stand at interest rates above zero. 

Recourse to the deposit facility declined as a 

result of the lowering of its remuneration rate 

to zero, as many counterparties decided to keep 

funds in excess of their reserve requirements 

in their current accounts. During the last 

maintenance period of 2012, for example, 

average recourse to the deposit facility stood at

 reducing the rating threshold for certain ABSs and (ii) allowing NCBs, as a temporary

Implications for price stability
As discussed above, the expansion of the balance sheet of the Eurosystem between 
December 2011 and December 2012 was largely driven by banks™ high demand in the  

Banks place excess liquidity in current accounts, the deposit facility or weekly liquidity-absorbing 

operations with the Eurosystem.The question may arise as to whether holding such large amounts of excess liquidity poses 
risks to price stability. This is currently not the case. The high demand on the part of euro

of central bank policy action to counter funding constraints in interbank money markets and

as measured, in particular, by M3 growth. However, such monetary growth is essentially unrelated 
to the amount of excess liquidity held by the euro area banking sector. There is not necessarily 

a stable relationship between bank reserves and, in particular, excess liquidity held by euro area 

banks on the one hand and monetary liquidity on the other, as evidenced by the subdued pace 

of money and credit growth observed since late 2010. The reason for the absence of such a 

relationship is related to the nature of central bank reserves, as their ultimate and main value lies

bank loans. As described above in more detail, the direct impact on short-term money market

consequence of the extended maturity of the operations.
Monthly Bulletin, ECB, May 2012.37ECBAnnual Report2012TENSIONS IN EURO AREA GOVERNMENT BOND MARKETS EASED MARKEDLY 
IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2012AAA-rated long-term government bond yields in the euro area fell from around 2.6% at the beginning 

of January 2012 to 1.7% at the end of December (see Chart 13). In the United States, yields on 

long-term government bonds declined only slightly over the same period, from around 1.9% to 

around 1.8%.The most pronounced difference in bond market developments in the two main economic areas 


in the euro area remained broadly unchanged, ten-year government bond yields in the United States 

increased by more than 30 basis points. In the second quarter of 2012 yields in the euro area 

and the United States followed a broadly 

similar downward trend, although yields on 

ten-year US government bonds were generally 

around 30 basis points below those of their euro 

area counterparts.  In the remainder of the year 

yields in the two areas tended to converge.The development of government bond yields 
in 2012 can be broken down into three distinct 



January to mid-March, sovereign bond market 

sentiment was rather positive on both sides of the 

Atlantic. In the euro area, this manifested itself 

in a decline of the spreads between government 



on the one hand, and those of AAA-rated issuers

resolution of the euro area sovereign debt crisis 

played a role in this regard. First, banks in the

From the perspective of the monetary pillar of the ECB™s monetary policy strategy, therefore, the 
additional monetary stimulus resulting from higher asset prices and lower money market rates 

has not translated into a pick-up in growth of monetary aggregates and is therefore not associated 

with risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.Finally, it should be stressed that large quantities of excess liquidity do not prevent the ECB 
from raising interest rates should its comprehensive analysis of risks to price stability point to a 

need to tighten the stance of monetary policy. Chart 13 Long-term government bond yields(percentages per annum; daily data)1.01.5

MFI loans to households when adjusted for loan sales and securitisation. This similarity can be 

explained by the fact that MFIs remain the main provider of loans to households. In addition, 

non-MFI provision of loans to households largely mirrors the loan sales and securitisation activities 

of MFIs, which, depending on national accounting practices, result in household loans being shifted 

from the MFI sector to the OFI sector. Lending for house purchase remained the main driver of growth in MFI loans to households.

2012 the net tightening of credit standards was rather limited, as the ECB™s non-standard policy 

measures (especially the two three-year LTROs conducted in late 2011 and early 2012) helped to 

ease constraints on banks™ lending to households by allowing banks to access medium-term funding 

at low costs. In line with the decrease in market rates, banks™ lending rates for loans for house 

purchase declined over the course of 2012 for the euro area as a whole. 
2012, the annual growth rate of consumer credit 

resumed its decline and remained negative, 

standing at -2.8% in December 2012, down 

from -1.8% in December 2011. The weak 

developments observed in consumer credit were 

due largely to demand factors (affecting this type 

of lending in particular) and were, at the same 

time, in line with the results of consumer surveys. 

Subdued growth in households™ real disposable 

income and the fact that household indebtedness 

remained at very high levels in a number of euro 

area countries continued to dampen demand 

for consumer credit. In line with this, the bank 

lending survey reported both declining demand 

and a slight tightening of credit standards for this 

type of loan. Banks™ lending rates for consumer 

credit declined in the second half of the year

Moreover, in 2012 MFI lending rates remained widely dispersed across euro area countries. Indeed, 

several factors may have contributed to higher lending rate spreads, particularly in some euro area 

countries, some of them suggesting impairments to the monetary transmission mechanism. On the 

one hand, the deteriorating creditworthiness of corporations in some jurisdictions due to a prolonged 

period of weak economic activity and strong uncertainty regarding the growth outlook caused

and excise duties introduced during 2011 and 2012 had a greater impact on euro area HICP

on labour income.

from the HICP at constant tax rates (HICP-CT), which is published by Eurostat. Such an impact 

is mechanical in the sense that it assumes that tax changes are passed on to consumer prices 

fully and immediately. It can therefore be viewed as the likely upper bound for the actual direct 

impact, which is typically lower and spread over time, depending on a number of factors related 


3 The fact that 
consumer demand remains very weak in many of the countries that have introduced increases in 

indirect taxes suggests that the pass-through may have been less than full.On the basis of the HICP-CT, the mechanical upward impact of increases in indirect taxes at 
the euro area level was, on average, 0.4 percentage point in 2012, after 0.3 percentage point 

in 2011 and 0.1 percentage point in 2010 

(see Chart A). This compares with an average 

impact of 0.2 percentage point since 2004. 

Despite the temporary nature of individual 





rate after 12 months, the impact at the euro 

area level has, to some extent, been smoothed 

by the large number of measures taken by 

different countries at different times.In 2012 ten euro area countries saw a change 
in indirect tax rates that had an upward impact 

of ¼ percentage point or more on their HICP 



countries than in any year since the HICP-CT 



size of the impact in 2012 varied considerably 

across countries. The largest impact by far 

was recorded in Portugal (1.9 percentage 

points), followed by Greece and Finland 

(0.9 percentage point). In the case of Greece, 
2 The HICP at constant tax rates is not published for Ireland. This country is therefore not included in the data presented in this box. 
In Ireland, the standard VAT rate went up by 2 percentage points in 2012, which had a significant impact on the country™s inflation.3 Econometric evidence of the pass-through of tax changes is mixed. For example, a study by the Deutsche Bundesbank on the VAT 
increase in Germany in 2007 concluded that, although it was some months before the tax change had any impact on consumer prices, 
overall the pass-through was complete. Another study, by the Banco de España, concluded that the pass-through of the VAT increase in 

Spain in mid-2010 was only around 40% to 60% of the full impact. For further information, see

in the last four months of the year, but only 0.7 percentage point over the year as a whole. This

pressures in the supply chain receded further. On the back of a hike in energy prices associated 
with rising oil prices, producer prices increased temporarily in the summer, before falling again in 

the fourth quarter. The lagged effects of the spike in international food commodity prices, which 

occurred during the summer months and was largely reversed in the autumn, continued to feed 

through the food production chain.On average, producer prices for industrial goods (excluding construction) in the euro area rose by 
2.6% in 2012, compared with 5.9% in 2011 and 2.9% in 2010. The annual rate of growth in industrial 

producer prices excluding construction and energy was also lower in 2012 than in previous years 

(1.3% compared with 3.8% in 2011 and 1.6% in 2010). The easing of price pressures was more 

visible at the earlier stages of the pricing chain (producer prices for intermediate goods) than at the 

later stages (producer prices for consumer goods excluding food; see Chart 22).Underlying inflation Changes in indirect tax rates tend to have one-off effects on the price level similar to those

Monthly Bulletin, ECB, January 2012.54ECBAnnual Report2012DOMESTIC PRICE PRESSURES REMAINED SUBDUED 
IN 2012In 2012 wage data, including compensation per 

employee, showed some signs of moderation 

compared with 2011, amid a weakening in 

economic activity and a rise in slack in the 

labour market. This development should be seen 

against the background of the high level of wage 



a time of improving labour market conditions 

following the latest cyclical upswing.The annual rate of growth in compensation per 
employee was 1.8% in the third quarter of 2012, 

which was markedly lower than the average 

of 2.2% in 2011 (see Table 2). Other wage 

indicators, such as hourly labour cost growth, 

decreased slightly in 2012, in contrast to what 

was witnessed in 2011, when growth in hourly 



wage costs continued to grow at a faster rate 

than the wages and salaries component of euro 

area hourly labour costs. Euro area negotiated wages grew slightly faster in 2012 than in 2011, reaching an annual average of 

2.1% in 2012, compared with 2.0% in 2011. The fact that actual wages, measured by compensation 

per employee, rose more moderately than negotiated wages suggests that some adjustment of wage 

costs at the euro area level is taking place via a negative wage drift. Owing to a slowdown in GDP growth since the second quarter of 2011, annual labour productivity 


compared with 1.2% in 2011. As labour productivity growth per employee in the euro area was 





increased by 1.7% year on year, compared with 1.0% in 2011. Table 2 Labour cost indicators(annual percentage changes, unless otherwise indicated) 2010201120122011

2.4 OUTPUT, DEMAND AND LABOUR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
GROWTH TURNED NEGATIVE IN 2012 
Following the sharp contraction in output in 2009, euro area real GDP recorded positive growth 
for two consecutive years. In 2012, however, growth lost momentum and GDP is estimated to 

have declined by 0.5% (see Table 3). As in the downturn in 2009, both domestic demand and 

changes in inventories made negative contributions to GDP growth in 2012. The pattern of 





supply conditions and tensions in sovereign debt markets mainly caused by worries about the 



made a positive contribution to growth in 2012 despite weak export growth, owing to a decline in 

imports. These developments are consistent with the view that the weakness in euro area economic 

activity in 2012 primarily originated in domestic markets rather than being a global phenomenon, 

which was the case in 2009. Chart 23 Residential property price

58ECBAnnual Report20122012 was one of the highest on record. The decline in imports was mainly driven by the weakness 
in economic activity in the euro area, which led to reduced demand for imported consumption, 

investment and intermediate goods. At the same time, export growth was dampened by the decline 

in foreign demand, amid the global economic slowdown, and therefore remained well below the 

rates seen in 2010 and 2011. Nevertheless, improvements in price competitiveness in the wake of 

the ongoing rebalancing process supported export growth in some euro area countries (see Box 5). 

Looking at the geographical breakdown of euro area exports of goods, exports to the United
 States remained fairly robust, despite decelerating somewhat (see
 Chart 25). By contrast, intra-euro area 
trade slowed markedly, as did exports to non-euro area EU Member States and Asia.Box 5THE REBALANCING PROCESS WITHIN THE EURO AREA1rates persistently above the euro area average. These developments, together with favourable

has declined in most euro area countries with adjustment needs since 2008, helping to restore 

competitiveness (see Chart A). Labour shedding on a large scale led to an improvement in

activity in these countries recovers. However, demand is not expected to return to the excessive 
levels reached prior to the crisis, and the production potential of the affected economies has 

declined as a result of the crisis. In addition, in some countries the current account balance 

 (i.e. replacing imports with domestic production) and gains in export market shares should 

support the external adjustment.
3 Notwithstanding this improvement in current account balances, 
international investment positions have continued to deteriorate in recent years in most countries 

Further efforts to continue the process of rebalancing remain necessary 
Despite the adjustment observed so far, substantial further rebalancing appears necessary in 
order to restore competitiveness positions and unwind remaining imbalances, as indicated by 

To continue this process, countries will need to take further ambitious measures to enhance both 

price and non-price competitiveness. The set of measures that need to be taken and the urgency 

high unemployment rates risk becoming structural and where competition is weak. A number of policy areas are particularly important in supporting the continuing rebalancing 
product markets to facilitate the necessary adjustment of price competitiveness. With respect to 


euro area countries, for example by relaxing employment protection legislation, abolishing wage 

In addition, a permanent increase in productivity facilitates competitiveness adjustment as it both 

lowers unit labour costs and increases potential output. However, raising productivity (by way 

of process and product innovation, labour force skills or business environment factors) typically 

requires structural reforms which can take considerable time to have visible effects (such as 

the liberalisation of closed professions and labour immigration, the reorientation of spending 

towards education and R&D, and reforms of key framework conditions, such as the amendment 

of judicial and regulatory frameworks to enhance their business-friendliness). Moreover, high 


services sectors). Therefore, structural reform measures can address this situation by removing 

obstacles to (international) competition, particularly in sheltered professions, for example by 

This, in turn, will help to reduce the prevailing downward rigidities in prices and enable countries

owing to the limited use of better, more diverse and cheaper inputs.62ECBAnnual Report2012THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN WAS BROADLY BASED ACROSS SECTORSThe economic slowdown in 2012 was broadly based from a sectoral perspective. Value added in

2012, continuing a prolonged period of weakness. 

After a decline of 0.8% in 2011, value added in

the course of 2012 (see Chart 27). As a result, in

(around 90% of GDP and higher) weigh on economic growth. In addition to directly crowding 

out private investment, they are associated with higher risk premia on government debt, which in

CONOMIC AND MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
 IN NON-EURO AREA EU MEMBER STATESECONOMIC ACTIVITY
euro area EU Member States (hereafter also referred to as the EU10 countries) in 2012, especially 
towards the end of the year. GDP growth was considerably lower in 2012 than in 2011. The economic 

recovery was mainly curtailed by the continued deleveraging needs in a number of countries and 

economic weakness in the euro area, which affected above all those economies where growth had 

been driven primarily by external demand in 2011. Domestic demand (excluding inventories) 

continued to be an important driver of GDP growth, with largely positive contributions in those 

countries that saw economic growth. Investment increased in a number of countries including 

Bulgaria, Denmark, Romania and the United Kingdom. Weak or still negative credit growth 

continued to restrain economic growth in a number of countries as a result of both tight supply-side

but smaller than at the peak of the crisis in 2009 (see Table 7). Although slower than in 2011, GDP 

growth remained robust in Latvia and Lithuania, while growth remained well above the EU average

declining risk aversion among international investors. During the second quarter and the summer 

of 2012, increased uncertainty about the economic outlook and the evolution of the euro area 

sovereign debt crisis resulted in higher volatility in central and eastern European foreign exchange 

markets and an appreciation of the pound sterling and the Swedish krona. This trend was reversed 

a result, the pound sterling and the Swedish krona lost some of their earlier gains and in early 

January 2013 traded about 2½% and 4%, respectively, above their levels a year earlier. At the 

same time, the exchange rates of central and eastern European currencies stabilised mostly above 

the levels prevailing in early 2012. In early January 2013 the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty 

traded about 7% and 9% higher than in January 2012, while the Czech koruna stood about 1% 

above its level at the beginning of 2012 and the Romanian leu traded 2½% lower than a year earlier. 

The exchange rate of the Bulgarian lev remained unchanged against the euro throughout the period 

under review given its euro-based currency board arrangement.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTSFinancial market conditions generally improved in the non-euro area EU Member States in the 

course of 2012. Long-term interest rates, as measured by ten-year government bond yields, declined 

for all countries, and for many countries they fell to historically low levels. The declines partly 

resulted from a decrease in perceived tail risks and expectations of low growth. Long-term interest

slightly in Bulgaria and were broadly unchanged in Romania.MONETARY POLICYThe primary objective of monetary policy in all EU10 countries is price stability. Monetary 

policy strategies, however, continued to differ considerably from country to country in 2012 

(see Table 11).The lowering of the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in both December 2011 and July 2012 
set the environment for the measures taken by several EU10 central banks. Interest rate reductions 
took place in a number of central and eastern European countries and Denmark. Following a series

In September 2012 the ECB announced the operational features of a new non-standard measure,

also provide eligible counterparties with liquidity in other currencies (see Section 1.2 of this chapter).SECURITIES MARKETS PROGRAMME The Governing Council decided in May 2010 to establish the Securities Markets Programme (SMP). 

The objective of this temporary programme was to address the malfunctioning of certain euro area debt 

securities market segments and to restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. The 

programme was implemented by Eurosystem portfolio managers carrying out purchases of certain euro 

area sovereign debt securities in secondary market interventions. The purchases were made between 

May 2010 and March 2011 and between August 2011 and February 2012. With the announcement of 

the technical features of the OMTs on 6 September 2012, the SMP was terminated. The liquidity injected 

through the SMP will continue to be absorbed as in the past, and the existing securities bought under the 

SMP will be held to maturity. At the programme™s peak, the Eurosystem held SMP securities for a total 

settlement amount of •219.5 billion, compared with •208.7 billion at the end of 2012.4THE SECOND COVERED BOND PURCHASE PROGRAMME In October 2011 the Governing Council announced a second covered bond purchase programme, 

the CBPP2. This programme was launched with the purpose of easing funding conditions for banks 

and companies and encouraging banks to maintain or expand lending to their customers. It allowed 

the Eurosystem to purchase eligible euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area for 

an intended nominal amount of •40 billion. The purchases were conducted in both the primary and 

secondary markets from November 2011 until the end of October 2012, with the purchases totalling 

a nominal amount of •16.418 billion. The programme was not fully utilised owing to the lack  

of primary market covered bond issuance, along with the positive effects of the three-year LTROs.  

It is intended that the purchased bonds will be held until maturity. programmes available for securities lending. Lending is voluntary and conducted through securities 
lending facilities offered by central securities depositories, or via matched repurchase transactions 

with eligible counterparties. While this lending activity has remained limited in terms of amounts, it 

is considered useful for a proper market functioning that the securities held under the programmes 

are in principle available for lending.

MONETARY 
TRAN
SACTION
S In August 2012 the Governing Council announced the setting-up of the OMTs, the technical features 
5. These OMTs aim to safeguard an appropriate 
monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy in the euro area.A necessary condition for OMTs is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate 
European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF/ESM) programme. 

This conditionality aims to ensure that governments will make the necessary reforms and maintain 

from a monetary policy perspective as long as programme conditionality is fully respected, and 

terminate them once their objectives have been achieved or when there is non-compliance with the 

macroeconomic adjustment or precautionary programme. OMTs will be considered for future cases 

of EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programmes or precautionary programmes (such as an 

enhanced conditions credit line). They may also be considered for Member States already under a 

macroeconomic adjustment programme as they regain bond market access. OMTs would not take 

place while a given programme is under review and would resume after the review period once 

programme compliance has been assured.Transactions would be focused on the shorter part of the yield curve, and in particular on sovereign 
bonds with a maturity of between one and three years. No ex ante quantitative limits are set on the 

size of OMTs. The Eurosystem intends to accept the same (pari passu) treatment as private or other 

creditors with respect to bonds issued by euro area countries and purchased by the Eurosystem 

through OMTs. The liquidity created through the OMTs would be fully sterilised, as continues to 

be the case for the SMP, while the transparency of the OMT portfolio would be greater than that of 

the SMP portfolio. The OMTs had not been activated by the end of 2012.AGENT FOR THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY/EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM 
In December 2011 the Governing Council gave approval for the ECB to act as an agent on behalf 

of the EFSF/ESM in secondary bond market interventions for the EFSF. In June 2012 it was 

announced that all the necessary preparatory work had been undertaken, but no actual transactions 

had been carried out under this agency function by the end of 2012.FINE-TUNING OPERATIONS 
In order to absorb the liquidity injected through the SMP, the ECB conducted weekly liquidity-




























operations were carried out as variable rate tender procedures with a maximum bid rate equal to the 

prevailing MRO rate. Upon termination of the SMP, the ECB announced that the liquidity injected 

through the SMP would continue to be absorbed as in the past. In addition, it announced that any 

liquidity created through OMTs would also be sterilised. Fine-tuning operations to counter the liquidity 

imbalance on the last day of the maintenance periods were suspended from 14 December 2011. 
STANDIN
G FACILITIE
S Counterparties can use the two standing facilities on their own initiative to obtain overnight 

liquidity against eligible collateral or to place overnight deposits with the Eurosystem. At the end 

of 2012 2,321 counterparties had access to the marginal lending facility and 2,910 counterparties 

had access to the deposit facility. The use of the deposit facility remained at high levels during

maintenance periods of 2012, as banks left larger amounts on their current accounts instead, as 

explained earlier in this section. The average daily use of the deposit facility over the 12 maintenance 

periods of 2012 was •484.3 billion (compared with •120 billion for the 12 maintenance periods 

of 2011 and •145.9
 billion for the 12 maintenance periods of 2010). In 2012 the use of the deposit 
facility followed a broadly similar pattern during each reserve maintenance period: the deposit 

facility amounts were lower at the beginning of each period, but increased subsequently as more 

lending facility was •1.76 billion (compared with •2.1 billion in 2011 and •0.62 billion in 2010).MINIMUM RE
SERVE 
SYSTEM 
Credit institutions in the euro area are required to hold minimum reserves on current accounts with 

the Eurosystem. From 1999 to 2011 the minimum reserve requirements were equal to 2% of credit 

institutions™ reserve base. On 8 December 2011 the Governing Council decided, as an additional 

enhanced credit support measure, to reduce the reserve ratio from 2% to 1%, as from the reserve 

maintenance period starting on 18 January 2012. The minimum reserve requirements amounted to 

•106 billion on average during the 12 maintenance periods of 2012, which was half of the amount 

held during the 12 maintenance periods of 2011. As the Eurosystem remunerates reserve holdings 

at a rate corresponding to the MRO rate, the minimum reserve system does not impose a tax on the 

banking sector. ELI

 CREDIT 
OPERATION
S As stipulated in Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, all credit operations of the Eurosystem are 

based on adequate collateral. This is standard central bank practice worldwide. Collateral adequacy 

implies that the Eurosystem is to a large extent protected from losses in its credit operations  

(see below for more details on risk management issues). Furthermore, the Eurosystem ensures that 


the amount of liquidity it deems necessary in its monetary policy operations.The Eurosystem accepts a broad range of assets as collateral in all its credit operations.  
This feature of the Eurosystem™s collateral framework, together with the fact that access to 

Eurosystem open market operations is granted to a large pool of counterparties, has been key in 

operational framework has allowed the Eurosystem to provide the necessary liquidity to address 

encountering widespread collateral constraints.In 2012 the Eurosystem took a number of measures to preserve and increase collateral availability for 
counterparties. Since 9 February 2012 euro area NCBs have been allowed, as a temporary solution 

and following explicit approval by the Governing Council, to accept as collateral for Eurosystem 


 The responsibility entailed by the acceptance of such credit claims is borne by the NCB authorising 

their use. In addition, on 29 June 2012 the eligibility criteria for certain types of asset-backed 

security (ABS) were broadened. Furthermore, on 9 November 2012 marketable debt instruments 

denominated in currencies other than the euro, namely the US dollar, the pound sterling and the 

Japanese yen, and issued and held in the euro area, became eligible until further notice.85ECBAnnual Report2012In 2012 the average amount of marketable assets eligible as collateral was •13.7 trillion, an 8% 
increase compared with 2011 (see Chart 34). This development was related in particular to an 

increase in the eligibility of uncovered bank bonds. Central government securities, which amounted 

to •6.1 trillion, accounted for 44% of total eligible collateral, followed by uncovered bank bonds 

(•2.4 trillion, or 18%) and covered bank bonds (•1.6 trillion, or 12%). As well as marketable 

collateral, eligible collateral includes non-marketable assets, mostly in the form of credit claims 

(also referred to as bank loans). In contrast to the situation for marketable assets, the volume 

of potentially eligible non-marketable assets cannot easily be measured. The deposited amount 

of non-marketable assets reached •0.6 trillion in 2012.The average amount of collateral put forward by counterparties increased to •2,448 billion in 2012, 
from •1,824 billion in 2011 (see Chart 35). At the same time, the average amount of outstanding 

credit increased from •538 billion in 2011 to •1,131 billion in 2012, as a result of the two three-year 

LTROs settled in December 2011 and March 2012. Consequently, the share of deposited collateral 

not used to cover credit from monetary policy operations decreased during 2012, whereas the 

absolute amount increased slightly. The level of over-collateralisation shows that, at the aggregate 

level, the Eurosystem™s counterparties experienced no shortage of collateral. As regards the composition of collateral put forward (see Chart 36), non-marketable assets (mostly 


of the total (compared with 23% in 2011). The share of covered bank bonds increased, while the

live on 21 September 2012.RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES RELATED 

TO CREDIT OPERATIONS 
In the implementation of monetary policy 

operations, the Eurosystem is exposed to 

the risk of counterparty default. This risk is 

mitigated by requiring counterparties to submit 

adequate collateral. However, in the event 

of a counterparty default, the Eurosystem 

would also be exposed to credit, market and 

liquidity risks associated with the resolution of 

collateral assets. In addition, liquidity-providing 

operations in foreign currencies against euro-denominated collateral, as well as euro-denominated 

liquidity-providing operations against foreign collateral, entail currency risk. In order to reduce all 

these risks to acceptable levels, the Eurosystem maintains high credit standards for assets accepted 

as collateral, valuates collateral on a daily basis and applies appropriate risk control measures. As a matter of prudence, the Eurosystem has established a buffer against potential shortfalls resulting 
from the eventual resolution of collateral received from defaulted counterparties. The level of the 

buffer is reviewed annually, pending the eventual disposal of the received collateral and in line with 

the prospect of recovery. 
Eurosystem level and regularly reported to the ECB™s decision-making bodies. In 2012 the Governing Council decided to adopt a number of adjustments to its collateral eligibility 
criteria and risk control framework.With regard to the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF), the Governing Council 
took several decisions in 2012. On 4 April the Governing Council approved the rating tool of 

Creditreform Rating AG for use within the ECAF. In view of their non-compliance with the Basel II 



ECAF sources for the time being, namely those of ICAP, Coface Serviços Portugal and Cerved.

system of Banka Slovenije for use within the ECAF. With regard to the establishment of higher transparency standards for ABSs, the Governing Council 
decided on 5 July 2012 to implement loan-level data reporting as a collateral eligibility requirement 

for ABSs in the Eurosystem collateral framework. The Governing Council also announced the 

dates from which such reporting requirements would apply for the different asset classes, beginning 

with a phasing-in period. Furthermore, the Governing Council announced that in order to monitor 

compliance with the loan-level template requirements and to check the timeliness, consistency and 

completeness of loan-level data, a single loan-level data repository would automatically check ABSs 

The Eurosystem also designed adequate risk control measures to accompany the decisions to preserve 
collateral availability for counterparties taken by the Governing Council in 2012. First, with regard 

to the temporary acceptance of additional performing credit claims described above, the Eurosystem 

adopted common guidelines aiming to ensure the adequacy of eligibility criteria and risk control 

measures, which would be subject to the prior approval of the Governing Council. Second, when 

deciding to reduce the rating threshold and to amend the eligibility requirements for certain ABSs 

effective as of 29 June 2012, the Governing Council also adopted a revised risk control framework for 

these ABSs ensuring adequate protection of the Eurosystem. 
1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS AND OPERATIONS WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS 
In 2012 the Eurosystem did not intervene in the foreign exchange markets. Furthermore, the ECB 

did not undertake any foreign exchange operations in the currencies that participate in ERM II.  

The standing agreement between the ECB and the IMF to facilitate the initiation of special drawing 

right (SDR) transactions by the IMF on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders was not activated 

The temporary liquidity swap line which the ECB established with the Federal Reserve System 
in 2007, which was reactivated in May 2010 to counter strains in the European US dollar funding 

markets, was extended on 13 December 2012 until 1 February 2014. In close cooperation with 

other central banks, the Eurosystem provided US dollar funding to counterparties against eligible 


rate tender procedures with full allotment. In addition to these regular weekly seven-day operations, 

the ECB, in coordination with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and 

the Swiss National Bank, continued to conduct every four weeks US dollar liquidity-providing 

operations with a maturity of 84 days. In 2012 the Eurosystem conducted 50 operations with a 

seven-day maturity, as well as one 14-day operation at the year-end and 13 84-day operations. 

The temporary reciprocal swap lines established in 2011 between the ECB, the Bank of England, 

the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank to enhance their capacity to provide liquidity 

that support money market liquidity by reducing funding risk. These swap lines were extended 
88ECBAnnual Report2012on 13 December 2012 until 1 February 2014. The Governing Council also decided that the ECB 
would, until further notice, continue to conduct regular US dollar liquidity-providing operations 

with maturities of approximately one week and three months.On 12 September 2012 the Governing Council decided, in agreement with the Bank of England, 
to extend the liquidity swap arrangement with the Bank of England up to 30 September 2013.  

The swap facility agreement of 17 December 2010 had been authorised until 28 September 2012. 

Under this facility, the Bank of England can provide, if necessary, up to GBP 10 billion to the ECB 

in exchange for euro. The agreement allows pounds sterling to be made available to the Central 

Bank of Ireland as a precautionary measure, for the purpose of meeting any temporary liquidity 

needs of the banking system in that currency. 1.3

 The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio was originally set up through transfers of foreign reserve 

market value of the invested assets, as well as foreign exchange and gold operations of the ECB. 

The main purpose of the ECB™s foreign reserves is to ensure that, whenever needed, the Eurosystem 

 non-EU currencies. The objectives for the management of the ECB™s foreign reserves are, in order 

of importance, liquidity, security and return.The ECB™s foreign reserve portfolio consists of US dollars, Japanese yen, gold and SDRs.  
The US dollar and Japanese yen reserves are actively managed by the ECB and those euro area 

operations. Under this scheme, each NCB which wishes to be involved in ECB foreign reserve 

management, or group of NCBs acting jointly for this purpose, is as a rule allocated a share in the 

US dollar or the Japanese yen portfolio.6 The value of the ECB™s net foreign reserve assets
 7 at current exchange rates and market prices 
decreased from •65.6 billion at end-2011 to •64.8 billion at end-2012, of which •43.8 billion 

was in foreign currencies and •21 billion was in gold and SDRs. The decrease in the value  

Positive contributions from capital gains and interest income generated by portfolio management 

activities offset some of these losses. Applying end-2012 exchange rates, US dollar-denominated 

assets represented 79% of the foreign currency reserves, while those assets denominated in Japanese 

yen accounted for 21%. The value of gold and SDR holdings increased slightly, driven by the 

appreciation of gold by around 4% in 2012 (as measured in euro terms).

The value of the portfolio at current market prices grew from •15.9 billion at end-2011 to  
•18.9 billion at end-2012. The increase in market value was due to an increase in the ECB™s  

paid-up capital effective on 27 December 2012, an increase in the provision against foreign 

exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks and, to a lesser extent, investment returns.Given that the same business area is responsible for both the implementation of the CBPP2 and 
the SMP (and potentially also the OMTs) and the management of the own funds portfolio, it was 

decided in 2012 to apply a largely passive management style to the ECB™s own funds portfolio. 

This decision was taken to ensure that no inside information about central bank policy actions can

TARGET2 plays an important role in the smooth implementation of the single monetary policy and 

the functioning of the euro money market. It offers a real-time settlement service in central bank 

money and broad market coverage. It processes large-value and urgent transactions without any 

upper or lower limit on the value of payments and has also attracted a variety of other payments. 

The system is based on a single technical infrastructure, the Single Shared Platform (SSP). Three

S The Eurosystem maintains close relations with TARGET2 users. Regular meetings were held 
between the NCBs and national TARGET2 user groups in 2012. In addition, joint meetings of the 

Eurosystem™s Working Group on TARGET2 and the TARGET Working Group of the European 

credit sector associations took place on a semi-annual basis to discuss TARGET2 business issues 

at the pan-European level. An ad hoc group created in 2011 and composed of representatives from 

these two groups continued its work, addressing major changes affecting TARGET2, such as the 

connection of TARGET2-Securities (T2S). Further strategic issues were addressed in the Contact 

Group on Euro Payments Strategy, a forum composed of senior representatives from commercial 

and central banks.MANAGEMENT OF NEW SYSTEM RELEASESThe Eurosystem attaches the greatest importance to the development of TARGET2 in order to 

further increase the level of service offered and to meet the needs of its participants. In view of the considerable effort involved in preparing for T2S, the Eurosystem decided in 2011 that 
there would not be an annual release of TARGET2 in 2012. The Eurosystem nonetheless continued 

to work on the TARGET2 system in 2012, preparing for the adaptations that will be necessary 

to its participants to support their cash activities in T2S. These services will be made available 

to participants when T2S goes live. The Eurosystem also launched a review of the strategy for 

migrating TARGET2 to the new industry standards (ISO 20022). It was decided that all current

T2S entry fee will be waived for them in view of their decision for early participation in the system. 

Furthermore, in June Danmarks Nationalbank signed the Currency Participation Agreement

agreed to make the Danish krone available in T2S as of 2018. The signing of these agreements 

marks the end of more than two years of contractual negotiations, but T2S remains open to new 

participants; non-euro area central banks and CSDs may still sign the Currency Participation 

Agreement or the Framework Agreement at a later stage. However, CSDs will henceforth have to 

pay an entry fee.11 The T2S Framework Agreement is the contract stipulating the rights and obligations of the Eurosystem and of CSDs outsourcing their 
settlement function to the Eurosystem. 12 The T2S Currency Participation Agreement is the contract governing the relationship between the Eurosystem and non-euro area NCBs

were awarded to two value-added network service providers following a tender procedure launched 

in 2011. The Eurosystem also largely completed its legal framework for the dedicated link service

2.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES FOR CROSS-BORDER COLLATERAL Eligible assets may be used to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit operation, not only at the 

domestic level but also across national borders. The cross-border mobilisation of collateral in the euro 

area is conducted mainly via the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) and through eligible 















by the Eurosystem, the latter is a market-led initiative. In addition, cross-border collateral can be 

mobilised on the accounts of NCBs with a non-domestic (international) CSD on an exceptional basis.At the end of 2012 the amount of cross-border collateral (including both marketable and  
non-marketable assets) held by the Eurosystem stood at •643 billion, down from •731 billion at 
94ECBAnnual Report2012the end of 2011. Overall, at the end of 2012 cross-border collateral represented 22.8% of the total 
collateral provided to the Eurosystem (compared with 29.9% in 2011).COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICESThe CCBM remained the main channel for transferring cross-border collateral in Eurosystem 

monetary policy and intraday credit operations in 2012. Assets held in custody through the CCBM 

decreased from •434 billion at the end of 2011 to •354 billion at the end of 2012. Cross-border 

collateral held on accounts of NCBs with a non-domestic (international) CSD on an exceptional 

basis amounted to •134 billion at the end of 2012.The CCBM was initially set up in 1999 as an interim solution and, since it builds upon the principle 
of minimum harmonisation, market participants have called for some improvements. In particular, 

they have requested that it no longer be necessary to repatriate (marketable) assets from investor 

CSDs to issuer CSDs before they are mobilised as collateral through the CCBM, and that tri-party 

collateral management services which are currently only used domestically may also be used on a 

cross-border basis. The Eurosystem supports the inclusion of these enhancements to the CCBM and 

is currently working on their incorporation into the framework in 2014. Issues related to euro securities settlement and collateral mobilisation in Eurosystem credit 
operations were discussed in the Contact Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures, which is a forum 

for representatives of market infrastructures, market participants and central banks.ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMSCross-border collateral can also be mobilised by using links between national SSSs. However, 

such links are only eligible for Eurosystem credit operations if they meet the Eurosystem™s user 

standards. Once the securities have been transferred to another SSS via eligible links, they can be 

used through local procedures in the same way as any domestic collateral. The amount of collateral 

mobilised through direct and relayed links decreased from •175 billion at the end of 2011 to  

•156 billion at the end of 2012.In 2012 one new direct link was added to the list of eligible links and three direct links were 
removed. In total, there were 52 direct and 8 relayed links available to counterparties at the end of 

2012, of which only a limited number are actively used.3 BAN

Stability Board and noted that references to the ratings of credit rating agencies should be removed 

In its opinion on a proposal for a regulation on improving securities settlement in the EU and 
on CSDs,
 32 the ECB strongly supported the Commission™s proposal, especially with regard to 
the enhancement of the legal and operational conditions for cross-border settlement in the EU 

in general and in TARGET2-Securities (T2S) in particular.
33 The ECB recommended that the 
proposed regulation and corresponding implementing acts be adopted before the launch of T2S, 

which is planned for June 2015. This is important in order to ensure a safer, harmonised regulatory 

environment, as well as increased and fair competition among CSDs in the T2S context. The ECB 

also recommended that close and effective cooperation should be fostered between the European 

Securities and Markets Authority, the national competent authorities and the members of the 

ESCB, in their capacity as both overseers and central banks of issue, in particular with regard to 

the development of draft technical standards. Such cooperation should facilitate comprehensive 

supervision and oversight in a cross-border context.27 CON/2012/21. This opinion is discussed in detail in Section 3.2 of Chapter 3.

34 Several Member States consulted the ECB on recapitalisation measures. The ECB stressed 
stability, as well as a precondition for the preservation, by Eurosystem counterparties, of their 

eligible counterparty status. The ECB expressed, in relation to Slovenia,

 a preference for bank 
recapitalisation to be carried out against cash contributions rather than against bonds issued by 

a state-owned bank assets management company, which would reinforce the link between the 

state and the banking sector.

In 2012 the ECB recorded 30 cases of non-compliance with the obligation to consult on draft 
national legislation

legislation. The following 14 cases were considered clear and important.55

a reduction in the salaries of staff and management at the Bank of Greece. The third case, considered 


and Bank of Greece staff matters. Finally, there were two cases related to the recapitalisation and 

resolution of credit institutions where the ECB was consulted late in the legislative procedure.56these cases related to measures to help distressed foreign exchange borrowers and another related 


risks associated with foreign currency loans.
57 Two further cases of non-compliance pertained to 


to central bank independence.
58 Finally, the ECB was not consulted on legislation which, inter alia, 
extended the obligation of a deposit guarantee scheme to compensate a credit institution™s creditors 

to include cases where a credit institution™s winding-up procedure has been initiated. The four remaining cases concerned Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain. The Italian authorities 
failed to properly comply with the obligation to consult the ECB on legislation regarding a guarantee 

scheme for the liabilities of Italian banks and the treatment of outstanding lira banknotes. In its 

opinion,59
The Luxembourg government did not consult the ECB on legislation concerning the increase of 

Luxembourg™s quota with the IMF; this is deemed to be an important case since it is highly likely 

that the ECB would have been critical in its response. The Slovenian Ministry of Finance consulted 

the ECB on draft legislation allowing the recapitalisation of systemically important Slovenian 

banks in accordance with the European Banking Authority recommendations. This consultation 

took place too late in the legislative procedure for the ECB opinion

 to be taken into account before 
the legislation was adopted. Finally, the ECB issued an opinion on Spanish legislation concerning

In the course of 2012 several actions taken by policy-makers in the euro area contributed to 

alleviate the acute funding pressures faced by euro area banks at that time and thereby prevented 

what could otherwise have been a disorderly deleveraging process. Moreover, at the EU summit 

on 28 and 29 June 2012, several decisions to strengthen the foundations of the euro area were taken. 

Notably, these concerned the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism (SSM), a more 

Mechanism, and the possibility of direct banking sector recapitalisation. Market sentiment and bank 

funding conditions, however, only rebounded forcefully after the speech given by the President of 

the ECB in London on 26 July and following the ECB™s announcement of measures to remove euro 

(see also Section 1 of Chapter 2). As a follow-up to the June summit, the Presidents of the European

by the European Council in June to initiate concrete steps towards a banking union and the speech 

by the President of the ECB in London in July, as well as the ECB™s announcement in the late 

regarding policy implementation, weak macroeconomic growth prospects and the fragmentation of 

and sovereign debt write-downs. Net interest income continued to be the main source of income 
banks. Net fee and commission income likewise remained relatively stable, as the negative effects 

from sluggish economic activity and weak lending growth were mitigated by income generated 

from corporate bond issuance. Although characterised by considerable heterogeneity, the average 

earnings outlook for euro area banks remained subdued owing to a combination of economic and 

regulatory forces.The solvency position of euro area LCBGs continued to steadily improve, thus extending the trend 
via deleveraging and risk-weighted-asset optimisation. The European Banking Authority™s 2011 EU 

Capital Exercise, which was concluded in September 2012, contributed to increasing bank capital 

3 in 2012, implying a negative net issuance of close to •200 billion for the euro area banking sector 

processes in some banking sectors.
4 Moreover, the cost of issuing new debt remained highly 
heterogeneous across banks, mainly according to the country of the issuer. In the third quarter 

of 2012 improved sentiment in credit markets contributed to better bank funding conditions, which 

led both to increased debt issuance volumes and to a tightening of spreads on senior unsecured debt 

and covered bonds. As a further sign of improvement, second-tier lenders from distressed countries

over recent years, the capital buffers of large euro area insurers still seemed to include some  

shock-absorption capacity. Reinsurers in particular were able to strengthen their capital base by 


low yields on highly rated government bonds and the fact that liabilities are not marked to market 

in most euro area countries. While the outlook for large euro area insurers is stable, there is a 

high degree of heterogeneity across the individual institutions and countries. Low government bond

of national supervisory authorities. Fifth, the SSM should operate in a manner fully consistent 



involve non-euro area Member States in the SSM to ensure greater harmonisation of supervisory 

practices within the EU, thus strengthening the internal market. Sixth, the ECB is ready to comply 

with the highest standards of accountability when performing these supervisory tasks. Furthermore, 

the ECB is of the opinion that a single resolution mechanism is a necessary complement to the 

established, or at least there should be clear deadlines for its establishment, when the ECB assumes 

its supervisory responsibility in full. Accordingly, the ECB called upon the Commission to urgently 

present a separate proposal for an independent European resolution mechanism, including aspects 

of a common European resolution fund.11 On 12 December the ECOFIN Council agreed on a general approach towards proposals aimed at 

establishing a single supervisory mechanism for the prudential supervision of credit institutions. 

The establishment of the SSM is essential for the functioning of Monetary Union. The independent

assign to the European level a complete set of banking supervision powers over all banks of the 

euro area countries, as well as the banks of non-euro area countries joining the SSM, by conferring 

helping to better address systemic risks in Europe. On 14 December the European Council agreed on a roadmap for the completion of EMU, based on 
deeper integration and reinforced solidarity. The Council concluded that the process would begin 

with the completion, strengthening and implementation of new enhanced economic governance, 

as well as the adoption of the SSM and new rules on recovery, resolution and deposit guarantees. 

This will be completed by the establishment of a single resolution mechanism. A number of 

other important issues will be further examined before the June 2013 European Council meeting, 

concerning the coordination of national reforms, the social dimension of EMU, the feasibility and 

modalities of mutually agreed contracts for competitiveness and growth, and solidarity mechanisms, 

as well as measures to promote the deepening of the Single Market and to protect its integrity.

STITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK2012 was the second year of operation of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The ESRB is 
the ESRB Secretariat with analytical, statistical, logistical and administrative support. In 2012 the ESRB was therefore chaired by Mario Draghi. 
With 25 staff, the ESRB Secretariat supported the day-to-day business of the ESRB, including the 
provision of administrative support to the institutional bodies, the conduct of relevant analytical 


as well as cooperation with supervisory authorities.In terms of its activities in 2012, the ESRB used the powers entrusted to it by Regulation (EU) 
No 1092/2010 and adopted two recommendations: Recommendation ESRB/2012/1 on money 

market funds and Recommendation ESRB/2012/2 on funding of credit institutions.
13 Moreover, 
in accordance with Article 3(2)(g) of the above-mentioned Regulation, the ESRB published in 

indicators aimed at identifying and measuring systemic risk. The ESRB used the various channels foreseen in Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to ensure its 
accountability as a new European public body. This included three hearings in the European 

Parliament where the Chair explained how he intended to discharge his duties, as well as other 


and Vice-Chairs of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.

In the second year of activity of the ESRB, several important legislative initiatives were developed 
at the EU level. In the context of the elaboration of a sound statistical basis for macro-prudential 

policy in the EU, the ECB reviewed the potential impact of forthcoming EU legislation on the 

provision of statistical information to the ESRB.
17 In the framework of its statistical support to the 
ESRB, the ECB contributed to the development by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) 


Group on Data. This group, which was established under the aegis of the ESRB Steering Committee 
to address issues related to the exchange of information among the ESCB, the ESRB and the ESAs, 

in particular promotes further coordination between the ECB and these institutions, facilitates the

the ESAs transmitted to the ECB and to include this information in the ESRB risk dashboard and 

the quarterly macro-prudential review. Finally, the ECB put in place measures to ensure access by 

the ESAs and the ESRB to non-published statistical information collected within the framework of 

the ESCB.3 FINANCIAL REGULATION AND SUPERVISION3.1 BAN
KINGIn 2012 the ECB continued to participate in and contribute to the work being carried out by the 


elements of the new capital and liquidity standards (Basel III). A key area of current policy debate is 

liquidity regulation. In this regard, the ECB welcomes the endorsement by the Group of Governors 

and Heads of Supervision of the Basel Committee™s amendments to the liquidity coverage ratio 

(LCR), as agreed in January 2013. The amendments include a limited recognition of additional 

assets in the range of eligible high-quality liquid assets,
18
These changes are in line with the ECB™s view that, while the need for strict liquidity requirements 

for banks to hold more liquid assets as well as to better price and manage liquidity risk is indisputable, 

the review of the initially proposed framework takes better into account the possible impact of 

the regulation on the interbank market and on the interaction with monetary policy operations.  

The ECB also supported a more gradual implementation of the liquidity framework in order to avoid 

disrupting the recovery process in the banking sector and lending to the real economy, especially 

in light of the stress in some countries and the ongoing macroeconomic adjustment programmes.  

The LCR is planned to come into force in 2015, although banks will now have until 1 January 2019 to 

fully meet the standard. In line with the commitment made by the G20 leaders in November 2010, the ECB to a large 
extent supports national and international efforts currently focusing on a timely and consistent 

implementation of the Basel III standards. The ECB also contributes to the implementation of the Basel standards in Europe and considers the 
European Commission™s proposals for a capital requirements directive and regulation (known as 

CRD IV/CRR), which will transpose the Basel III framework into European law, to be an important 

In this regard, the ECB published its opinion on CRD IV/CRR on 27 January 2012.

stressed the importance of reaching an agreement among EU Member States on the CRD IV/CRR

known as Level 2B assets. This new category may comprise no more than 15% of the total stock of HQLAs. It includes a broader range 

of corporate bonds, a selection of listed equities (both with a 50% haircut), and some highly rated residential mortgage-backed securities

As regards macro-prudential supervision, the ECB considers it important that the regulation make it 

possible for the ECB to apply more stringent prudential requirements than those applied by national 

authorities where systemic or macro-prudential risks arise. Following the publication in November 2011 of policy measures to address the issue of global 
systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the BCBS, in line 

with the G20 mandate, made good progress in completing the framework, by extending it from 

G-SIBs to also encompass domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs).20
when compared with that of a non-systemic institution. Against this background, the D-SIB 

approach adopts a complementary perspective to the G-SIB regime, i.e. by focusing on the impact 

of an eventual failure on the domestic economy.Furthermore, in view of the implementation of the G-SIB framework, work was conducted in 
2012 to enhance both the data quality and the robustness of the methodology underlying the G-SIB 

of G-SIBs based on the most recently available data (as at end-2011), with the important indication 

endorses these new international standards, as they are instrumental in addressing the negative 

externalities related to systemic institutions. In particular, the extension to D-SIBs represents 

welcome progress towards ensuring that all systemic institutions, irrespective of their scope of 

activity, are subject to regulatory requirements commensurate to the risks that they pose to the

especially in times of stress, the ECB welcomed the proposals to introduce appropriate safeguards 

for trading venues offering access to high-frequency traders and measures aimed at facilitating the 

oversight and monitoring of these new trading strategies. Finally, the ECB recommended further 

improvements in the cooperation and exchange of information within the European System of 

Financial Supervision and between supervisory authorities and ESCB central banks.On 2 April 2012 the ECB issued an opinion on a legislative proposal of the European Commission 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies, as well as Directives 2009/65/EC 

and 2011/61/EU.22In the course of 2012 the ECB was also actively involved in the initiatives aimed at strengthening 

the regulation of shadow banking, by contributing to the policy and regulatory debate at the FSB 

level. In addition, the ECB contributed to the Commission™s public consultation on a Green Paper 

on shadow banking
 23 by providing a Eurosystem response.
24 In that response, it was emphasised 
that any regulatory initiative should be consistent with the work of the FSB in order to ensure a 

As regards concrete regulatory proposals, the ECB supported the Commission™s view that a 
permanent process should be created at the EU level for the collection and exchange of information 

concerning shadow banking, suggesting that the European Systemic Risk Board would be well 

placed to play such a role. It also pointed out the need for more transparency with regard to repo 

In this context, the ECB put forward a proposal to set up a central EU database for collecting 

repo data directly from infrastructures and custodian banks, which would improve the visibility of 

stability of the use of central counterparties in repo transactions. Lastly, it supported proposals to

CCOUNTINGIn 2012 the ECB continued to contribute to the accounting work carried out in various fora, 

including in sub-structures of the BCBS and the European Banking Authority.Throughout the year, the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board continued the work on aligning their respective accounting frameworks. Despite 

some progress in 2012, material differences continue to exist in key accounting areas, namely 



 US Securities and Exchange Commission™s much-delayed decision on the adoption of the 

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the United States was pushed back even

123ECBAnnual Report2012ACTING AS A CATALYST FOR PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITIESSEPAThe Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is an initiative aimed at achieving a fully integrated market 
for retail payment services in euro, with no distinction between cross-border and national payments. 

attention was paid to the migration to the new SEPA instruments. According to the SEPA indicators, 

the migration in the euro area from domestic credit transfers to SEPA credit transfers reached 

34.9% in December 2012. As regards the SEPA direct debits, the migration amounted to only 1.9%.  

An end-date regulation to support the migration was adopted in March 2012.
27 The regulation lays 
down rules for the initiation and processing of credit transfer and direct debit transactions denominated 



















euro area, the deadline is 1 February 2014. By this date, existing national euro credit transfer and 

direct debit schemes will need to have been replaced by the SEPA-compliant alternatives. In order to 

promote a timely start of the preparations, especially those by citizens and smaller and medium-sized 

companies, the Eurosystem has stepped up its SEPA communication efforts.of a SEPA Cards Processing Framework, which would connect card processors in order to process 


authorities, evaluation laboratories, terminal manufacturers and the banking industry to develop 

which would at the same time establish a single approval process for terminals to be deployed 

within the EU. These and other elements of information security and fraud prevention in retail 

payments remain under the constant attention of the Eurosystem. The migration to the SEPA schemes and the realisation of an integrated and competitive cards 
market based on common business practices, technical standards and security requirements form the 

of internet payments, the roll-out and usage of this way of making payments has not kept pace with 

the rapid development of e-commerce. Pilot projects for m-payments have been organised in several 

European countries, sometimes followed by actual deployments. The Eurosystem is concerned that 

too little attention is being paid to technical standardisation and business interoperability, which are 

key factors of success also in this area of SEPA. In 2012 the SEPA Council
 28 held in-depth discussions regarding the review of SEPA governance. 
Moreover, the SEPA Council discussed several issues related to the end-date regulation and SEPA 
migration, SEPA for cards, and innovation. On the latter, in view of the limited progress achieved 

provision of EU-wide e-payment services for e-commerce.27 Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 establishing technical and business 
requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009, OJ L 94, 30.3.2012, p. 22.28 This is a stakeholders™ forum, co-chaired by the ECB and the European Commission, which aims to promote an integrated euro retail 

payments market by ensuring the proper involvement of all parties and by fostering consensus on the next steps towards the realisation of 

SEPA. 124ECBAnnual Report2012Finally, in September 2012 the ECB published the results of its study on the social and private costs 
of making retail payments, conducted in cooperation with 13 NCBs.
29 These costs amount to around  
•45 billion, or almost 1% of GDP. If extrapolated to cover all 27 EU Member States, they would be 

around •130 billion. The results underline how much retail payment services matter for European society 

and in the economy as a whole. The ECB and the Magyar Nemzeti Bank jointly organised a conference 

on retail payments, which took place in Budapest on 15 and 16 November 2012. The
 conference enhanced 

















central banks and other public authorities, and likely future developments in the retail payments market.SECURITIES MARKETS To increase transparency in the area of asset-backed securities (ABSs), the Governing Council 

decided in December 2010 to establish loan-by-loan information requirements for ABSs in the 

Eurosystem collateral framework. Since then, preparatory work has been conducted and concluded, 

and a market-led single loan-level data repository, the European DataWarehouse, has been created 

in order to handle the loan-level data. In November 2012 the Governing Council announced that 

loan-level data reporting would be mandatory within the Eurosystem collateral framework as 

of 3 January 2013 for residential mortgage-backed securities and for ABSs whose underlying assets 

include loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, as of 1 March 2013 for commercial mortgage-

loan ABSs. Loan-level data are to be provided in accordance with the templates available on the 

ECB™s website, at least on a quarterly basis.In addition, the ECB acted as an observer and catalyst in two other market-led initiatives in 
funding tools, in particular with a view to improving market resilience in Europe. It is promoted 

by the European Financial Services Round Table and the Association for Financial Markets in 

Europe. This initiative, which is called the Prime Collateralised Securities (PCS) initiative, rests on 

EU-wide standards for ABSs which relate to quality, transparency, standardisation and simplicity. 

These standards are expected to lead to increased liquidity for securities which acquire the PCS 

label.30The second initiative is promoted by the European Covered Bond Council. It aims to establish a 

criteria, such as increased transparency, strong safeguards provided by dedicated national 

covered bond legislation, supervision of both the issuing credit institution and the cover pool, and 

compliance with the requirements of Article 52(4) of the UCITS Directive. This initiative was also 


January 2013.

in the implementation of commonly agreed harmonisation standards. The group regularly publishes 

harmonisation progress reports (the third report will be published in March 2013) and constantly 

monitors the progress made by markets that will be connected to T2S. These reports are presented 

to the T2S Advisory Group and shared with the T2S Board and the ECB™s Governing Council.

1 EURO1 is a large-value payment system for transactions in euro between banks operating in the EU. 

It is operated by EBA CLEARING. EURO1 works on a multilateral net basis, while the end-of-day 

positions of EURO1 participants are ultimately settled in central bank money via the TARGET2 

system, with the ECB acting as the settlement agent.128ECBAnnual Report2012The ECB is entrusted with primary oversight responsibility for EURO1, acting in close cooperation 
with all euro area NCBs. In 2012 EBA CLEARING reduced the mandatory limit to be granted by 

each participant to each other participant from •2 million to •1 million, with effect from 2 July 2012. 

EBA CLEARING adopted this change with the objective of improving credit risk control within 

EURO1. This reduction follows a previous mandatory limit change, from •5 million to •2 million, 

in October 2011. In light of the systemic relevance of EURO1 in the euro area payment landscape, 

the Eurosystem assessed the impact that the envisaged change might have on EURO1™s compliance 

with the currently applicable oversight standards, namely the CPSIPS, and concluded that it 

monitoring the implementation of the recommendations that were made to the system operator 

following the comprehensive assessment of EURO1 against the CPSIPS in 2011. Concerning its 

operational performance, EURO1 operated smoothly throughout 2012 and no incidents occurred.CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM 
The Continuous Linked Settlement system (CLS) was launched in 2002 and is operated by CLS 


























transactions. Through its PvP mechanism, CLS virtually eliminates the principal risk associated 

with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions. CLS currently settles in 17 of the world™s 

most traded currencies, including the euro. Given that CLS Bank is established in the United States, 

the Federal Reserve System accepts primary oversight responsibility for CLS under a cooperative 

oversight arrangement involving the G10 central banks and the central banks of issue of currencies 

settled by CLS. In 2012 CLS Bank was designated in the United States as a systemically important 













continues to apply. The ECB, in close cooperation with the euro area NCBs, is part of this cooperative 

oversight arrangement and has primary oversight responsibility for settlement in euro by CLS. 
In 2012 the ECB™s oversight activities with respect to CLS covered the implementation of CLS 
governance reform, changes in the CLS Board and the senior management team, the progress 

achieved with strategic initiatives and the review of the CLS risk management framework.SWI

Distributed Architecture programme, mainly through the construction of an additional operations 

centre in Europe. Another SWIFT project being closely monitored by the overseers is the renewal 

of the FIN software, which aims to mitigate technology risk and reduce costs, while ensuring 

strategic alignment of IT platforms. Other important activities in 2012 included the review of the 

operational performance and availability of SWIFT™s services and the monitoring of new projects 

critical services. The level of availability of the FIN service in 2012 was 99.992%.5.2 RETAIL
 PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND PAYMENT INSTRUMENTSThe Eurosystem also has oversight responsibility for retail payment systems and payment 

instruments. The 2003 oversight standards for retail payment systems, which draw on the CPSIPS, 

are currently being reviewed to take into account the implementation of the PFMIs and also to 

standards and procedures resulting from the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project. SEPA 

gives incentives to an increasing number of retail payment systems to either establish cross-border 

links with other such systems or to offer services in more than one country. Therefore, the revised 

is no longer appropriate. The revised framework will also incorporate the oversight expectations for

In February STEP2 introduced three additional settlement cycles per day in its STEP2 SCT service, 

in which SEPA credit transfers are processed. In April a batch processing option, which allows 

banks to exchange batches of credit transfers, was introduced in the same service. Neither of these 

changes affected the continued full compliance of STEP2 with the applicable oversight standards.Concerning payment instruments, in 2012 the focus of Eurosystem oversight remained on payment

CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES AND TRADE REPOSITORIESOn 4 July 2012 the European Parliament and the European Council adopted Regulation (EU) 

No 648/2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, also known as the 

of the European Union on 27 July 2012 and entered into force in August 2012. It introduced a 

common EU framework for the authorisation and supervision of CCPs and trade repositories and

the G20 commitment 39. Journal of the European Union on 23 February 2013 and entered into force 20 days thereafter, while 

the technical standard relating to CCP colleges will be adopted at a later stage.The ECB considers the adoption of EMIR and the work of the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (ESMA) on the technical standards a major achievement in terms of ensuring the effective 

implementation of the global commitment to OTC derivatives market reform and welcomes the

central banks will also be established with respect to trade repositories and that existing cooperative 

oversight arrangements, such as those in place for the DTCC Derivatives Repository Limited in the 

United Kingdom, will be continued once ESMA takes over supervisory responsibilities. CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORIESOn 7 March 2012 the European Commission issued a proposal for a regulation on improving 

securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories. This regulation 

will establish a common EU framework for the authorisation and supervision of CSDs. The ECB strongly supports the Commission™s proposal to strengthen the legal framework 
applicable to CSDs, also in the context of the future TARGET2-Securities environment. In its

CY AND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUESanother year of intense cooperation among EU institutions and bodies, in particular the European 
Council, the ECOFIN Council, the Eurogroup, the European Commission, the European Parliament 

and the ECB.The President of the ECB participated regularly in Eurogroup and ECOFIN Council meetings 
when matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB were discussed. Moreover, the 

President of the ECB was invited to take part in European Council meetings, when issues related 

the Euro summit meetings. The President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner for Economic 

and Monetary Affairs participated in meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB, when 

considered appropriate.TOWARDS A GENUINE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNIONThe EU Heads of State or Government asked the President of the European Council, in close 

cooperation with the Presidents of the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB, to 

develop a vision for completing EMU. Reports were submitted to the European Council in June, 

October and December 2012. Moreover, in November 2012, the European Commission presented 

its blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU.These reports outlined proposals for a genuine EMU around four building blocks: (i) an integrated 
framework, and (iv) democratic legitimacy and accountability. (i) I
ntegrated financial frameworkthis fragmentation and to break the interdependency between banks and their sovereigns, which can 

lead to vicious downward spirals. In June 2012 the euro area Heads of State or Government made a political commitment 
to establish a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) for the euro area involving the ECB.  

In September 2012 the Commission issued a draft Council regulation on the SSM, proposing to give

(post-2014) aiming at improving the resilience of EMU through the creation of a shock-absorption 

function at the central level.At its meeting on 14 December 2012, the European Council agreed that it is imperative to break 
the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns and that moving towards the SSM will also require 

a single resolution mechanism. The Heads of State or Government asked the President of the 

European Council, in close cooperation with the President of the European Commission, after a 

process of consultations with the Member States, to present to the June 2013 European Council 

possible measures and a time-bound roadmap for the coordination of national reforms, the social 

dimension of EMU, the feasibility and modalities of mutually agreed contracts for competitiveness 

and growth, and solidarity mechanisms that can enhance the efforts made by Member States that 

enter into such contracts. Moreover, any new steps towards strengthening economic governance 

will need to be accompanied by further steps towards stronger legitimacy and accountability.market union.
2 At the same time, given the interdependencies in EMU, it is important to work in 
parallel on all four building blocks. ESTABLISHMENT OF A PERMANENT STABILITY MECHANISM FOR THE EURO AREAFollowing the European Council agreement of March 2011 to establish a permanent crisis 
management mechanism for the euro area, the Treaty establishing the European Stability 

Mechanism (ESM) entered into force on 27 September 2012. The ESM was inaugurated 

of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union introducing a new Article 136(3) was 

adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2011 and is scheduled to enter into force in 2013.

following its entry into force, with the EFSF™s unused capacity remaining available until July 2013 

On 29 June 2012 the Heads of State or Government of the euro area took two further decisions 
related to the ESM. First, they decided that the bank recapitalisation facility provided by the EFSF 

to Spain would be transferred to the ESM on its entry into force, without the ESM gaining preferred 

creditor status. Second, they decided that the ESM could, following a regular decision, have the 

possibility to recapitalise banks directly when an effective single supervisory mechanism involving 

the ECB was established for banks in the euro area. STRENGTHENED ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IN THE EUstrengthen the EU™s economic governance were adopted in 2012. The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union 
(TSCG) was signed by 25 of the 27 EU Member States in March 2012 and entered into force 

of a balanced budget rule and an automatically triggered correction mechanism at the national level. 

In addition, the TSCG includes provisions to enhance the coordination of economic policies and 

the governance of the euro area. The TSCG also provides for strengthened cooperation between 

the European Parliament and national parliaments of the signatory countries on questions related 

to their budgetary policies and other issues covered by this Treaty. The agreement on the TSCG,

Overall, the two regulations are a welcome initiative to further reinforce the economic governance 
framework in the euro area. Nonetheless, the ECB called for a number of provisions to be more 

ambitious (see Section 6.2 of Chapter 2).THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER AND THE EUROPE 2020 STRATEGY 
In November 2011 the Commission presented its 2012 Annual Growth Survey, which reviews 

progress towards Europe 2020 targets and sets out the key measures for recovery and growth for the 

EU as a whole. The 2012 survey stressed the need for Member States to (i) pursue differentiated,

European Commission on 28 November 2012, reiterates these priorities.which Member States incorporated into their stability or convergence programmes and national 
reform programmes. Following a review of these programmes, including the implementation 

of the voluntary commitments under the Euro Plus Pact, the ECOFIN Council issued policy

effectiveness and credibility of the new framework. THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACTwith the notable exceptions of Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden. For 

Germany, the EDP was abrogated by the ECOFIN Council decision of 5 June 2012, well ahead 

below 3% of GDP. For Bulgaria, the ECOFIN Council decided on 22 June 2012 to abrogate the EDP.

sanction was lifted on 22 June 2012, after the Council decided that Hungary had in the meantime 

EDP deadline of 2012. For Spain, as the economy re-entered a recession, the EDP deadline 

was extended to 2014, after the ECOFIN Council decided on 10 July 2012 that Spain had taken 

effective action in line with its initial recommendation. For Portugal, the ECOFIN Council decided 

on 9 October 2012 to extend the deadline to 2014, against the background of a considerably

reports on the progress made by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, 

Romania and Sweden in meeting the conditions to join the euro area. These reports, which were 

published on 30 May 2012, examined whether a high degree of sustainable convergence (economic 

convergence) had been achieved in these countries and gauged compliance with the relevant statutory 

requirements for NCBs (legal convergence). When assessing the sustainability of convergence,

international organisations such as the IMF and the OECD, as well as fora such as the G20 and G7 

The international economic environment in 2012 was characterised by a weak economic recovery, 
with growth declining to 1.3% for advanced economies (against 1.6% in 2011) and to 5.3% for 

emerging and developing economies (against 6.2% in 2011), according to the IMF. The slowdown 

in global trade and economic activity continued to be accompanied by a narrowing in global 

much lesser extent, internal rebalancing in external-surplus economies, where adjustment through 

changes in relative prices remained limited. An environment of high oil prices also contributed 

to buttressing the external surpluses of oil-exporting countries. As in recent years, the euro area™s 

current account was broadly balanced in 2012. The ECB continued to stress the risks and distortions 

that would ensue if global imbalances were to remain at unsustainable levels and to express 

support for a rebalancing of global demand patterns. In terms of structural factors that would

Mexican presidency these workstreams focused on (i) improving the foundations for strong, 

a particular focus on IMF quota and governance reform; and (iv) stabilising energy and commodity 


instability. In June 2012 G20 leaders adopted the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan, which 

focuses on policy actions to reduce near-term risks and improve the medium-term foundations for 

global growth. In addition, G20 members took stock of previous policy commitments and adopted 

an Accountability Assessment Framework for more effectively monitoring their implementation.Finally, the euro area itself is subject to international policy surveillance exercises by the IMF and 
policies of the euro area, as a complement to its reviews of the individual euro area countries.

This survey also included special chapters on euro area imbalances and euro area governance.REFORMS IN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES AND PRACTICESFollowing standard practice, the ECB monitored and helped to shape developments in the 

international monetary system. In 2012 the IMF secured a substantial increase in its resources, 

IMF surveillance was further developed and given a broader legal foundation, and progress on 

improving IMF governance continued.It was decided that the optimal way to augment IMF resources in the short term was through 
temporary bilateral loans and note purchase agreements with its members. In December 2011 euro 

area countries had already pledged •150 billion in bilateral loans to the General Resources Account 

available for lending to the entire IMF membership, and other EU Member States had also 

indicated their willingness to take part in the process of reinforcing IMF resources. A breakthrough 

was reached at the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in 2012, when member countries

2 COOPERATION WITH C
OUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EUAs in previous years, the Eurosystem organised seminars and workshops with non-EU central 

banks in order to foster policy dialogue. The ECB also actively participated alongside the European 

Commission in the EU™s macroeconomic dialogue with key emerging market economies (e.g.
 Brazil, India and Russia) and EU neighbouring countries. In addition, the technical cooperation provided 

by the Eurosystem remained an important tool for strengthening the institutional capacity of central 

banks outside the EU, especially in the EU™s neighbouring regions, and for enhancing compliance 

with European and international standards. FOSTERING POLICY DIALOGUE 
The ECB continued to deepen its relations with the central banks and monetary authorities of 

various countries. For example, the ECB took part in EU macroeconomic dialogue with Russia. The Eurosystem held its third high-level seminar with central banks and monetary agencies of 
the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council

ECB and Bank Al-Maghrib, the central bank of Morocco, and took place in Casablanca on 12 July. 

3 This reduction has been made possible by the formation in 2012 of a new constituency including Belgium, Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands (with the Executive Director seat rotating between Belgium and the Netherlands), alongside a new central and eastern 

European constituency, in which from 2014 onwards the position of Executive Director will be assigned exclusively to emerging market 

countries, and by changes in the rotation of members in the Executive Director seat for the Nordic/Baltic and Swiss constituencies.4 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

high-level seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American central banks, which was hosted 

by the Banca d™Italia on 27 and 28 June in Rome. The seminar itself, which was co-organised 

by the ECB, the Banco de España and the hosting institution, the Central Bank of Chile, took 

place on 7 and 8 December in Santiago. Discussions focused on current and past determinants 

macro-prudential responses.TECHNICAL COOPERATIONSince 2003 the ECB, together with the NCBs, has implemented several EU-funded technical 

neighbouring countries. Moreover, besides EU-funded projects, the ECB has strengthened its  

long-term cooperation with new countries through memoranda of understanding.In 2012 the ECB and 21 NCBs continued to support the National Bank of Serbia through an 
EU-funded technical cooperation programme. This programme, which started in February 2011, 

covers 11 different areas and aims to strengthen the institutional capacities of the National Bank of 

Serbia. On the basis of the results, it was agreed to extend this cooperation over 2013.The ECB and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey signed a memorandum of understanding 
on 4 July 2012, thereby laying the ground for continued cooperation through regular dialogue at 

the technical and policy levels, technical cooperation and potential staff exchanges. The parties 

international relations, markets and statistics.On 15 October 2012 the Eurosystem commenced a technical cooperation programme with the 
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The ECB and 11 NCBs are participating in this  

EU-funded programme. The purpose of the nine-month programme, which covers ten areas of 

central banking, is to assess the central bank™s current institutional and operational framework 

against EU central banking standards and, on the basis of the outcome, to recommend ways of 

strengthening its institutional capacity.On 30 October 2012 the ECB™s President and the Chairman of the Bank of Russia signed a 
memorandum of understanding laying the groundwork for continued cooperation between the two 

institutions. The partnership is to consist in regular dialogue at the technical and policy levels, 


banking supervision in the initial cooperation phase. The ECB will implement the programme of 

cooperation activities together with euro area NCBs.With regard to the western Balkans and Turkey, a two-year EU-funded programme on strengthening 
macro and micro-prudential supervision came to an end in January 2012. The programme, which 

was implemented by the ECB together with 14 partner NCBs and in cooperation with international 

Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and 

Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo (under UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99). In March 2012 the ECB and the Central Bank of Egypt completed a technical cooperation 
programme on banking supervision which had started on 1 January 2009. Funded by the EU under 
145ECBAnnual Report2012the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the programme assisted the central bank 
in preparing new regulations, guidelines and reporting systems to implement the core components 

of the Basel II capital adequacy framework in Egypt.In 2012 the ECB and the People™s Bank of China continued implementing their memorandum of 
understanding through meetings of their bilateral working group. The memorandum, which was 

signed on 5 September 2008, aims to strengthen cooperation between the two institutions and foster 

information-sharing.By September 2012 approximately two-thirds of the facade and the main structural works had been completed, so that the

element of the monetary policy regimes of both advanced and emerging economies. The decision to 

evidence, both of which show that such a set-up is conducive to maintaining price stability.  

At the same time, it is a founding principle of democratic societies that any independent institution 

bestowed with a public function must be accountable to citizens and their representatives. 

Accountability is therefore an important counterpart of central bank independence.The ECB™s commitment to accountability and transparency is illustrated by its reporting to European 
citizens and their elected representatives, the European Parliament. The Treaty lays down precise 

a quarterly report and an annual report. The ECB goes far beyond these statutory obligations in its 

regular reporting, for instance by publishing a Monthly Bulletin, rather than the required quarterly 

report. The ECB™s commitment to accountability and transparency is also illustrated by the numerous 

speeches delivered by the members of the Governing Council, which deal with a broad variety of 

topics of relevance to the ECB™s tasks. In addition, the President of the ECB appears four times a 

year before the European Parliament. The ECB also replies to written questions from Members of 

the European Parliament (MEPs) and publishes these questions and answers on its website. External communication at the ECB aims to enhance the public™s understanding of the ECB™s 
policies and decisions and, as such, is an integral part of the ECB™s monetary policy and its other 


other statutory tasks. They also support the ECB™s efforts to give a full account of its actions.The ECB™s concept of real-time, regular and comprehensive explanations of its monetary 
policy assessment and decisions, which was introduced in 1999, represents a uniquely open and 

transparent approach to central bank communication. Monetary policy decisions are explained at a 

press conference immediately after the Governing Council has taken them. The President delivers 

a detailed introductory statement at the press conference, explaining the Governing Council™s 

decisions. The President and Vice-President are then at the media™s disposal to answer questions. 

Since December 2004 decisions taken by the Governing Council other than those setting interest 

rates have also been published every month on the websites of the Eurosystem central banks.Council™s monetary policy decisions, the decisions taken by the Governing Council in addition

staff macroeconomic projections, policy positions and information of relevance to the general 
public. The preparation, publication and distribution of the national language versions of the ECB™s 

key publications are undertaken in close collaboration with the NCBs.2 A
CCOUNTABILITY TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTThe European Parliament, as the only EU institution whose members are directly elected by the 

citizens of the EU, plays a key role in holding the ECB to account. Since its establishment, the ECB 

has maintained a close and fruitful dialogue with the European Parliament.The President of the ECB continued to report on the ECB™s monetary policy and its other tasks 
during his quarterly hearings before the European Parliament™s Committee on Economic and 

Monetary Affairs (ECON) in 2012. In addition, at the invitation of ECON, the President attended an 


the Presidents of the European Commission, the Eurogroup and the ECB (see Chapter 4).Other members of the ECB™s Executive Board also appeared before the European Parliament.  
The Vice-President presented the ECB™s Annual Report 2011 to ECON. Jörg Asmussen participated 

in a public exchange of views on the economic and social crisis in Greece with the members 

of ECON and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament.  

In addition, ECB staff were invited to explain the ECB™s views at the expert level. Ignazio Angeloni, 

the ECB™s Director General for Financial Stability, participated in an exchange of views organised 

A wide range of issues were addressed during the various exchanges of views between MEPs and 
ECB representatives in 2012. The European Parliament expressed support for the ECB and its 

and help euro area countries under stress. Beyond macroeconomic developments, other important 

issues that were raised by MEPs pertained to the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism 

a long-term vision for EMU.THE SINGLE SUPERVISORY MECHANISMThe proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) was a key issue in the exchanges 

between the ECB and the European Parliament. Discussions focused in particular on the separation 

of monetary policy and supervisory tasks, the involvement of non-euro area countries, the 

accountability requirements for the new supervisory tasks, the interaction with national supervisors, 

the need to ensure compatibility with the Single Market, and the relationship of the SSM with the 

European Banking Authority. Questions were also raised with regard to the other proposed elements 

harmonised deposit guarantee schemes.The President of the ECB emphasised the knowledge and expertise of national supervisors on which 
the ECB would draw when taking on supervisory tasks. He indicated that non-euro area countries 

would be welcome to join the SSM and stressed that any new supervisory tasks of the ECB must 
149ECBAnnual Report2012be subject to very high standards of accountability. Furthermore, the President emphasised that the 
SSM should be complemented by a single resolution mechanism.OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONSAnother important topic in discussions between the ECB and the European Parliament in 2012 was 

European Parliament welcomed the determined effort by the ECB to respond within its mandate to 

the challenges of the crisis. In this context, the Governing Council decision of 6 September 2012 on 

Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) was a particular focus of the discussions. In his exchanges with MEPs the President explained that the decision on OMTs had been 
indispensable to counter the impairment of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and 

maintain the singleness of the ECB™s monetary policy. He emphasised that OMTs were aimed at 

the correction of redenomination risk premia, which were not consistent with the irrevocable nature 

of the euro and hampered the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Given that the underlying 

macroeconomic imbalances needed to be addressed in order to restore the proper functioning of 

the monetary policy transmission mechanism, OMTs would only be activated if a given country 

adhered strictly to the agreed conditionality under a European Stability Mechanism programme. 

OMTs could also be activated for countries that are already under a full adjustment programme and 

regaining market access.THE LONG-TERM VISION FOR EMU
in this report, the President of the ECB emphasised the need for a shared vision regarding the 

direction of EMU over the next decade. He outlined the importance of a solid long-term anchor 

 time-bound schedule to reach this objective. 3 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES
effective as possible, taking into account the different audiences and the relevant communication 

environments and needs.In 2012 the ECB™s communication activities continued to focus on explaining the events and 

crisis in Europe and related measures decided on by the Governing Council. The vast majority of 

public speeches delivered by members of the Executive Board were related to these issues, as were 

or seeking the assistance of the ECB, in liaison with the European Commission and the IMF. These 

topics also dominated the questions and requests for information received from the media, the public 

and visitors to the ECB. The subject of a banking union and the ECB™s assumption of tasks related to 

the supervision of banks in the euro area featured regularly in the ECB™s communication activities. 150ECBAnnual Report2012The ECB publishes a number of regular and periodic studies and reports. These include the Annual 
Report, which presents a review of the ECB™s activities in the previous year, and the Monthly Bulletin, 

which provides regular updates on the ECB™s assessment of economic and monetary developments 

and detailed information underlying its decisions. The ECB issued 167 press releases in 2012, 

covering all aspects of the ECB™s policies and activities, as well as additional information related 

to the implementation of monetary policy. The ECB also provides a wide range of statistical data, 

primarily by means of the Statistical Data Warehouse and interactive charts on the ECB™s website.All members of the ECB™s Executive Board contribute directly to enhancing public knowledge and 

understanding of the Eurosystem™s tasks and policies by giving testimonies before the European 

Parliament and national parliaments, delivering public speeches and granting interviews to the media. 

Over the course of 2012 the members of the Executive Board delivered more than 200 speeches to 

a variety of audiences and granted over 100 interviews to the media. They also had many articles 

published in journals, magazines and newspapers.In 2012 the ECB organised 15 seminars for journalists at its premises and participated in a 
further 4 seminars organised in Brussels or by the European Journalism Centre. They were all 

aimed at enhancing the knowledge and understanding of the national and international media as 

regards the ECB™s mandate, tasks and activities. The ECB organised some of these seminars on its 

own and others in cooperation with the NCBs, the European Commission, the European Journalism 

Centre and other public authorities and foundations. In addition to the monthly press conference 

aimed at fostering a greater understanding of other ECB policies and actions.The ECB welcomed approximately 800 groups of visitors to its current and future premises in 














given by ECB staff and tours of the site of the new ECB premises. The progress made in the 

construction of the new premises, culminating in the topping out ceremony on 20 September 2012, 

resulted in a greater number of communication activities related to this subject in the course of  

the year.All documents published by the ECB and other information about its various activities are available 
on the ECB™s website. In 2012 the website received 25 million visits; 263 million pages were 

viewed and 67 million documents were downloaded. In 2012 the ECB replied to around 100,000 

enquiries from the public requesting information on a number of issues related to the ECB™s 

activities, policies and decisions. A number of high-level international conferences and events were organised in 2012, including 

On 20 June 2012 the President of the ECB and the governors of the respective euro area NCBs 
presented the Europe-level prizes to the teams that had won the national contests of the Generation 

•uro Students™ Award 2011/12. This competition, which will be held each year, aims to enhance 

the economic literacy of teenagers and to give them a better understanding of the role of the central 

bank in the economy. More than 3,000 students from the euro area, aged between 16 and 19, 
151ECBAnnual Report2012of a multiple-choice test, were invited to participate in the second round. This involved writing an 
essay predicting the Governing Council™s interest rate decision in March 2012 and giving reasons 

a presentation about the June 2012 interest rate decision and the underlying reasoning before a 

jury of central bank experts. The following year™s competition was launched on 1 November 2012.  


with additional registrations following in January 2013 in some countries.The ECB has also expanded its presence in social media. It has a Twitter account, which gained 
some 30,000 followers in the course of 2012, bringing the total number of followers to 42,000. 

This tool is used to highlight publications and speeches; in the course of 2012 more than 600 tweets 

were sent, which were re-tweeted by followers more than 8,000 times. The ECB also maintains a 

YouTube account for the publication of videos of the monthly press conferences as well as other 

contact with the target audience of the competition. In addition, to mark the tenth anniversary of the 

introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2012, the ECB organised an EU-wide 

to increase pupils™ awareness of the euro banknotes and coins.2012 was also an important year in terms of the development of the communication campaign 
related to the introduction of the second series of euro banknotes. The aim of the campaign, which 

was prepared during 2012 and launched in 2013, is to ensure that euro area citizens are aware of 

the new banknotes and their features. To this end, a communication strategy was developed for 


Archaeological Museum in Frankfurt.The ECB also developed a dedicated website which will serve as a hub for all banknote-related 
activities, as well as the Euro Cash Academy, a web-based module and smart phone app aimed at 

making the euro banknotes and their security features more familiar to the public and cashiers.On 28 and 29 April 2012 the ECB organised visitor days, opening its doors to the public as well as 
ECB staff and their families and welcoming approximately 1,300 visitors. The programme included 

guided tours of the building, presentations, workshops on the role and function of the ECB and the 

euro banknotes and coins, educational games and several exhibitions, including one on the euro 

banknotes and coins. As in previous years, in May 2012 the ECB had an information stand at the open day event on the 
premises of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.The EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS of the ECB took place from 17 October until 
14 November 2012 and were dedicated to France. The four-week programme, organised in close 
cooperation with the Banque de France, showcased some of France™s most exciting and innovative 

cultural talents. With over 20 events ranging from chanson, classical music, jazz and dance to 

production, the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS 2012 provided visitors from the Frankfurt area 
152ECBAnnual Report2012and beyond with a unique and varied insight into France™s cultural life. Through its EUROPEAN 
CULTURAL DAYS initiative, which was launched in 2003, the ECB aims to raise awareness of 

the EU™s cultural diversity and foster mutual understanding among Europeans.On 20 September 2012 the ECB held a topping out ceremony to celebrate the completion of the main structural works 
for its new premises in the Ostend. Such a ceremony is a German tradition and is held by the owner of a newly built 

house, primarily in order to celebrate the achievements of the planners, construction companies and their workers, who thus 

account for the majority of the guests. Members of the Executive Board, the Governing Council and the General Council 

concluded with the raising of the topping out wreath and a traditional topping out toast by the construction foreman for the 

high-rise.155ECBAnnual Report2012CHAPTER 7INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

The Eurosystem is the central banking system of the euro area. It comprises the ECB and the NCBs 
of the EU Member States whose currency is the euro (17 since 1 January 2011). The ESCB is 

composed of the ECB and the NCBs of all 27 EU Member States, i.e. it also includes the NCBs of 

the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro.The ECB is the core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures that the operations which form 
part of the tasks of the ESCB are carried out either through its own activities or via the NCBs, to 

which the ECB shall have recourse to the extent deemed possible and appropriate. The ECB is an 

EU institution and has legal personality under public international law. Each NCB has legal personality according to the law of its respective country. The euro area 
NCBs, which form an integral part of the Eurosystem, carry out the tasks conferred upon the

The NCBs also contribute to the work of the Eurosystem and the ESCB through their participation 
in the Eurosystem/ESCB committees (see Section 1.5 of this chapter). They may perform  

functions interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem.The Eurosystem and the ESCB are governed by the decision-making bodies of the ECB: the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board. The General Council is constituted as a third decision-

making body of the ECB, for as long as there are EU Member States which have not yet adopted 

the euro. The functioning of the decision-making bodies is governed by the Treaty, the Statute of 

the ESCB and the relevant Rules of Procedure.
1 Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the 
ESCB is centralised. However, the ECB and the euro area NCBs jointly contribute, strategically and 

operationally, to attaining the common goals of the Eurosystem, with due respect to the principle of 

decentralisation in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB.1.2 THE
 GOVERNING COUNCILThe Governing Council comprises the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the 

governors of the NCBs of the Member States which have adopted the euro. Its main responsibilities, 

as laid down in the Treaty, are:entrusted to the Eurosystem;
intermediate monetary objectives, key interest rates and the supply of reserves in the Eurosystem, 
and to establish the necessary guidelines for their implementation. The Governing Council meets, as a rule, twice a month at the ECB™s premises in Frankfurt am Main, 

Germany. It conducts, inter alia, an in-depth assessment of monetary and economic developments 

usually focuses on issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. 

In 2012 two meetings were held outside Frankfurt, one hosted by the Banco de España in Barcelona 

and the other hosted by Banka Slovenije in Brdo pri Kranju. In addition to these meetings, the 

Governing Council may also hold meetings by means of teleconference or take decisions by written 

procedure.When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem, the 
members of the Governing Council do not act as national representatives, but in a fully independent 


when the number of governors in the Governing Council exceeds 18.1 For the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, see: Decision ECB/2004/2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European

decision-making bodies in the performance of their tasks. At the request of both the Governing Council 



have facilitated the decision-making process. Membership of the committees is usually restricted to 

staff of the Eurosystem central banks. However, the NCBs of the Member States which have not yet

may also be invited. Since the signing of the Accession Treaty in December 2011, and in line with 

the decision to invite governors of central banks of acceding countries to attend the meetings of the 

General Council, experts from Hrvatska narodna banka, the Croatian central bank, have been invited 

to the meetings of ESCB committees in an observer capacity whenever they deal with matters that

the Rules of Procedure, assists the Governing Council in matters related to the ECB™s budget. The 

Human Resources Conference was established in 2005 under Article 9a of the Rules of Procedure 

as a forum for the exchange of experience, expertise and information among Eurosystem/ESCB

CE In addition to the decision-making bodies, the corporate governance of the ECB encompasses a 

number of external and internal control layers, two codes of conduct, an Ethics Framework and 

rules concerning public access to ECB documents.EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe Statute of the ESCB provides for two control layers, namely the external auditor, which is 

appointed to audit the annual accounts of the ECB (Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), and the 

ECB (Article 27.2). The annual report of the European Court of Auditors, together with the ECB™s

2 Good practices for the selection and mandate of external auditors, 
published on the ECB™s website, provide high-level guidance for each Eurosystem central bank 

when selecting external auditors and determining their mandate. The good practices also enable the 

Governing Council to formulate its recommendations to the EU Council on the basis of harmonised, 

consistent and transparent selection criteria. On 14 June 2012 the Governing Council approved a 

revised version of the good practices.INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERSThe internal control structure of the ECB is based on an approach in which each organisational unit 

(section, division, directorate or directorate general) has primary responsibility for managing its own 

unit implements operational control procedures within its area of responsibility in accordance with 

the risk tolerance set in advance by the Executive Board.
Organisation Division is responsible for planning, coordinating, steering and executing all related 
centralised processes as well as for preparing the relevant documentation. It also serves as a second 

level of control and reports to the Executive Board on a regular basis, alerting it to issues where 

necessary.In accordance with its mandate, the Budget Committee assesses the ECB budget planning and 
monitoring reports submitted by the Executive Board and reports on them to the Governing 

Council. It assists the Governing Council in the evaluation of the Executive Board™s annual budget 

163ECBAnnual Report2012proposal before the latter is adopted, and assesses and reports to the Governing Council on budget 
monitoring reports.As far as the operational risks of the ECB are concerned, the Operational Risk Committee, an internal 
ECB committee, is responsible for stimulating and overseeing the development, implementation 

and maintenance of operational risk management by the business areas who own the risks. It also 

supports the Executive Board in the execution of its role in overseeing the management of the 

operational risks of the ECB.In 2012 the ECB continued, together with the NCBs, to implement the operational risk management 
framework and updated the related operational risk assessments for Eurosystem tasks and processes. 

The ECB continued to regularly test and review the business continuity arrangements for its critical 

operations. Furthermore, in cooperation with the NCBs, the ECB conducted a business impact 

analysis to identify the time criticality of Eurosystem functions. 3 is responsible for the risk management framework applicable

Risk Management Committee contributes to, among other things, the monitoring, measuring and

Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors.A Eurosystem/ESCB committee, the Internal Auditors Committee, which is composed of the 
heads of internal audit at the ECB and the NCBs, is responsible for coordinating the auditing of 

Eurosystem/ESCB joint projects and operational systems.An ECB Audit Committee further enhances the corporate governance of the ECB and the 
Eurosystem as a whole. It is composed of three Governing Council members, with Erkki Liikanen

CES MANA
GEMENT 
In 2012 the ECB continued to develop and implement human resources management policies with 
a focus on four areas: working culture, recruitment, professional development and employment 

conditions.WORKING CULTURE 
In 2012 developments related to the working culture of the ECB continued to focus on diversity, 

professional ethics and performance management. The ECB introduced a pilot mentoring programme 

to support the personal and professional development of a group of staff members, giving particular 

attention to female mentees. Meanwhile, the share of female applicants who were selected for junior 

managerial and advisory positions considerably exceeded that of male applicants. With regard to 


were further reviewed in order to maintain an effective regulatory ethics framework.RECRUITMENT 
On 31 December 2012 the actual full-time equivalent number of staff holding employment contracts 

with the ECB was 1,638 (1,609 on 31 December 2011).
13(limited in nature or convertible to permanent contracts) were offered in 2012. By
 contrast, 
following resignation or retirement. Furthermore, to cover for absences of less than one year, 

120 short-term contracts were issued during 2012 (in addition to a number of contract extensions), 

while 114 short-term contracts expired in the course of the year.The ECB continued to offer short-term contracts to staff from NCBs and international organisations, 
thus fostering an ESCB-wide team spirit and cooperation with international organisations. 

On 31 December 2012 142 employees from NCBs and international organisations were working at 

the ECB on various assignments, 7% less than at the end of 2011.In September 2012 the ECB welcomed the seventh intake of participants in its Graduate Programme. 
These participants have various academic backgrounds and are assigned to two different business 

areas for consecutive periods of one year each.As in previous years, traineeship opportunities were offered throughout the year to students and 
graduates with backgrounds in economics, statistics, business administration, law or translation. 

On 31 December 2012 122 trainees were hosted by the ECB (13% more than in 2011). The ECB 

Fellowship Programme.PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
Mobility continues to be an important tool for the professional development of ECB staff, while 

also serving to increase synergies across business areas. In the course of 2012 225 staff members, 

including 59 managers and advisers, moved internally to other positions, on either a temporary or a 

longer-term basis.13

RGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS 168ECBAnnual Report2012The ECB, like all ESCB central banks, actively participates in the external mobility schemes 
promoted by the Human Resources Conference, which enables the ECB to second staff to 

the 27 NCBs in the EU or to relevant international organisations (e.g. the IMF and the BIS) 

for periods of two to twelve months. A total of 15 members of staff were seconded under this 

scheme in 2012 (new cases). The total number of staff members on unpaid leave at the end of 

December 2012 was 56 (compared with 55 in 2011). The ECB also decided to launch a pilot 

programme on career transition in January 2013, so as to support staff members who have served 

the ECB in the same or similar positions for a prolonged period and who are interested in pursuing 

their career outside the ECB.The ECB continued to promote the acquisition and development of relevant skills and the further 
enhancement of the required competencies of management and staff. In addition to a range of 

in-house training opportunities, management and staff continued to follow external training courses, 

including those offered under the ESCB training programme.In 2012 19 area heads, 11 deputy directors general and 50 heads of division participated in a 
multi-source feedback exercise, in which their staff, peers and external counterparts completed a 

questionnaire on their managerial and leadership skills. Overall, the feedback was very positive. As
 a follow-up, these managers devised individual action plans to further enhance their performance.THE HUMAN RESOURCES CONFERENCE 
The activities of the Human Resources Conference covered various aspects of human resources 

management in 2012, including the organisation of a broad range of ESCB training activities as 

well as intra-ESCB mobility. The ESCB Training and Development website, a platform for sharing 

information on training and mobility opportunities with all ESCB staff, was launched in April 2012. 

In 2012 there were 46 sessions of ESCB training activities, hosted by 23 central banks.EMPLOYMENT

ONDITION
S package to staff, also in view of their generally high workload, and to balance the needs of staff 

with those of the organisation. At the end of 2012 258 staff members were working part time, 34% more than in 2011. The number 
of staff on unpaid parental leave as at 31 December 2012 was 25 (compared with 33 in 2011). 

Building on the results of a pilot phase, the teleworking policy was introduced on 1 February 2012. 

In 2012, on average, around 363 staff members teleworked each month. In 2012 as a whole, 

975 staff members teleworked at least once.2.2 S
TAFF RELATIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE The ECB fully recognises the importance of a constructive dialogue with its staff. In 2012 the 

ECB consulted and exchanged information with the elected Staff Committee and the recognised 

trade union IPSO
 14 on changes related to remuneration, employment contracts, staff development, 
performance management, working conditions, health and safety conditions and pensions. In this 

context, 217 letters were exchanged. In addition, the ECB continued to have a frequent dialogue 

through regular meetings with the Staff Committee and IPSO on employment and social matters.14

.the installation of the facades and the closing-off of the connecting atrium are due to be completed 
in spring 2013. The facades of the Grossmarkthalle (the former wholesale market hall) were 

successfully restored in 2012 and the steel structures were erected for the conference area, designed 

as a separate house-in-house element within the spacious Grossmarkthalle, as well as for the entrance 

building, which will house the press centre. The installation of the technical infrastructure and the 

months caused by the complexity of the requisite restoration works on the original fabric of the 

Grossmarkthalle has been incorporated into the existing time schedule.Up to the end of 2012 the ECB had spent approximately •600 million in construction and other 
costs, including the purchase of the site. In 2005 the building costs were estimated at around 

•500 million and the overall investment costs at •850 million, both at constant 2005 prices,  

 The current prognosis, estimated in mid-2012, includes all project costs, past and future indexation 

costs and general construction cost developments until the ECB moves into its new premises in 2014. 

Price rises for construction materials and construction activities from 2005 until the completion of 

the project in 2014 are expected to lead to a •200 million increase in the overall investment cost.The ECB monitors the construction progress, its costs and price developments very closely and 
implements adjustments and amendments where necessary. The Grossmarkthalle presented 

a number of challenges that were not detected in the initial examination conducted prior to the 

coverage was found to be contaminated and therefore could not be disposed of as envisaged; and 

All these factors are likely to account for additional costs of about •300 million to •350 million 
by the time the project is completed in 2014, including the above-mentioned •200 million related 

to indexation costs, on top of the estimated overall investment costs of •850 million based on 

constant 2005 prices.The ECB™s relocation to its new headquarters is planned for 2014.171ECBAnnual Report20122.6 E
NVIRONMENTAL ISSUES The ECB remains committed to making prudent use of natural resources in order to preserve 
the quality of the environment and to protect human health. It has established an environmental 

policy and continuously improves its environmental performance, in particular by minimising its 

ecological footprint and carbon emissions. To systematically pursue environmental sustainability, 

the ECB has adopted an Environmental Management System that complies with the international 

standard EN ISO 14001 and Regulation (EC) No 1221/2009 of the European Parliament and of the 

Council on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit 

scheme. In 2012 the ECB successfully passed its second environmental surveillance audit. The ECB™s main impact on the environment and about 75% of its carbon footprint arise from the 
use of electricity and of energy for heating and cooling. Its carbon emissions have been reduced 

considerably since 2009, mainly through organisational and technical measures. A comparison of 

data for 2010 and 2011 reveals a 24% reduction in carbon emissions resulting from electricity, 

heating and cooling, business travel and paper consumption.In addition, measures continued to be put in place in the context of the environmental programme 
implemented by the ECB. A pilot phase for the implementation of a sustainable procurement 

The ECB is convinced that every staff member can contribute to minimising the ECB™s ecological 
footprint. In 2012 the ECB™s environmental representatives organised staff training sessions, 

a pilot business area for an awareness-raising and behaviour change communication campaign. 

Furthermore, a car-free day was organised on 21 September 2012, successfully encouraging 

almost 200 employees to travel to work by other means of transport.Special attention is also being paid to the establishment of state-of-the-art sustainability features in 
the operation and maintenance plans for the ECB™s new premises.2.7

Article 15 of the ECB™s Rules of Procedure, BUCOM supports the Governing Council by providing 

a detailed evaluation of the ECB™s annual budget proposals and of requests for supplementary 

budget funding by the Executive Board, prior to their submission to the Governing Council for 

approval.In addition, independent audit missions are performed by the Directorate Internal Audit under the 
direct responsibility of the Executive Board. Moreover, in order to further strengthen the ECB™s 

corporate governance, the ECB Audit Committee provides assistance to the Governing Council 

internal controls and the performance of the ECB™s and the Eurosystem™s audit functions.A comprehensive ethics framework for the staff of the ECB provides guidance and sets ethics 
conventions, standards and benchmarks. All staff are expected to maintain high standards of 

professional ethical behaviour in the performance of their duties, as well as in their relations with 

NCBs, public authorities, market participants, media representatives and the general public. Two 

additional codes of conduct deal exclusively with the ethical regime applicable to the members of 

that the rules applicable to Executive Board members and staff are interpreted consistently. An 

Ethics Adviser has been appointed by the Governing Council to provide guidance to its members 

on aspects of professional conduct.Further information relating to the governance of the ECB is provided in Section 1 of Chapter 7 of 
the Annual Report.MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDThe members of the Executive Board are appointed from among persons of recognised standing and 

professional experience in monetary or banking matters by the European Council, upon a recommendation 

from the EU Council after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council.The terms and conditions of members™ employment are determined by the Governing Council, 
based on a proposal from a committee comprising three members appointed by the Governing 

Council and three members appointed by the EU Council.EMPLOYEESThe ECB fully recognises the importance of a constructive dialogue with its staff. In 2012 the 
ECB continued to develop and implement human resources management policies in four areas: 

working culture, recruitment, professional development and employment conditions. Developments 

related to the working culture of the ECB continued to focus on diversity, professional ethics 

and performance management. The ECB introduced a pilot mentoring programme to support the 

personal and professional development of its staff, focusing in particular on female staff members.175ECBAnnual Report2012Mobility and staff development measures remained the main tools for professional development. 
Moreover, the ECB continued to support staff in the areas of childcare and the reconciliation of 

work and family commitments.The average number of staff (full-time equivalents) holding contracts with the ECB

denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen, and an internal own funds investment portfolio 

denominated in euro. In addition, the funds relating to the ECB™s pension plan are invested in 

an externally managed portfolio. The ECB also holds its share of securities for monetary policy 

purposes, acquired in the context of the Securities Markets Programme and the two covered bond 

purchase programmes. The various purposes and objectives of the ECB™s investment and monetary 

policy portfolios, as well as the associated risk management practices, are described in detail in 

Section 1 of Chapter 2 of the Annual Report.securities purchased for monetary policy purposes. They encompass credit, market and liquidity 
risks. The ECB closely monitors and measures such risks on an ongoing basis and, where 

appropriate, mitigates them through the implementation of risk management frameworks, which 

include eligibility criteria for assets and counterparties and a system of exposure limits. These 

frameworks take into account the objectives and purposes of the various holdings of securities,  

PRODUCTION OF THE ECB™S FINANCIAL ACCOUNTSPursuant to Article 26.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are drawn up 

by the Executive Board, in accordance with the principles established by the Governing Council.3The Financial Reporting and Policy Division of the Directorate General Administration is 

responsible for producing the Annual Accounts in cooperation with other business areas and for 

ensuring that all related documentation is submitted in a timely manner to the auditors and thereafter 

to the decision-making bodies.The Directorate Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance and consulting 
and the ECB™s Annual Accounts may be subject to internal audits. Internal audit reports, which 

may include audit recommendations addressed to the business areas concerned, are submitted to the

176ECBAnnual Report2012and Loss Account. It reviews and comments on the Annual Accounts and the related documentation 
before they are submitted to the Executive Board for endorsement.Furthermore, the Annual Accounts of the ECB are audited by independent external auditors 
recommended by the Governing Council and approved by the EU Council. The external auditors 

have full power to examine all books and accounts of the ECB and obtain full information about its 

transactions. The responsibility of the external auditors is to express an opinion as to whether the 

of its operations, in accordance with the principles established by the Governing Council. In this 

regard, the external auditors consider the adequacy of internal controls applied to the preparation 

and presentation of the Annual Accounts and evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies 

used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Executive Board.After the Executive Board has authorised their issuance, the Annual Accounts, together with 
the external auditors™ opinion and all relevant documentation, are submitted to the ECB™s Audit 

Committee for review prior to their submission to the Governing Council for approval.The Executive Board has decided that from 2013 the ECB™s Annual Accounts will be approved at the 

second Governing Council meeting in February of each year and published immediately thereafter.4 FINANCIAL RESOURCESCAPITALIn December 2010 the ECB decided to increase its subscribed capital by •5 billion, from •5.8 billion 

to •10.8 billion. This decision resulted from an assessment of the adequacy of its statutory capital, 

which was launched in 2009. The capital increase was deemed appropriate in view of increased 

volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and gold prices, as well as in view of the ECB™s 

exposure to credit risk. In order to smooth the transfer of capital to the ECB, the Governing Council 

decided that the euro area NCBs should pay their additional capital contributions in three equal 

annual instalments due in December 2010, 2011 and 2012.instalment of their contributions to the increase in the ECB™s subscribed capital. Consequently, the 
ECB™s paid-up capital amounted to •7,650 million on 31 December 2012. Detailed information on 

PROVISION FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND GOLD PRICE RISKSSince most of the ECB™s assets and liabilities are periodically revalued at current market exchange 


to a lesser extent, interest rate exposures. These exposures stem mainly from its holdings of gold 

and foreign reserve assets denominated in US dollars and Japanese yen, which are predominantly 

invested in interest-bearing instruments. The ECB™s investment portfolios and its holdings of 

securities purchased for monetary policy purposes entail a further exposure to credit risk.177ECBAnnual Report2012In view of its large exposure to these risks and the size of its revaluation accounts, the ECB 
maintains a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks. The size 

of and continuing requirement for this provision is reviewed annually, taking a range of factors 

into account, including in particular the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of 


a risk assessment involving calculations of Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is 

applied consistently over time. The risk provision, together with any amounts held in the ECB™s 

general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2011 the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 
price risks amounted to •6,363 million. After taking the results of its risk assessment into account, 

the Governing Council decided to increase the size of the risk provision to •7,529 million as  

at 31 December 2012. This amount equates to the current maximum allowed ceiling.5 FINANCIAL RESULT FOR 2012In 2012 the net income of the ECB prior to the transfer of •1,166 million to the risk provision was 

after this transfer, was distributed to the euro area NCBs.In 2012 net interest income amounted to •2,289
 million, compared with •1,999
 million in 2011. 
The increase in net interest income was mainly due to (a) the lower net interest expense arising from 
TARGET2 balances; (b) the additional interest income generated on the securities purchased under 

the Securities Markets Programme and the second covered bond purchase programme; and (c) the 

lower interest expense arising from the euro area NCBs™ claims in respect of the foreign reserve 

assets transferred by them to the ECB. The effects of these developments were partially offset by a 

decrease in interest income on the ECB™s share of the total euro banknotes in circulation.

accounting policies,
2 which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to be appropriate to the 
nature of central bank activity.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe following accounting principles have been applied: economic reality and transparency, prudence, 

recognition of post-balance-sheet events, materiality, going concern, the accruals principle, consistency 

and comparability.RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAn asset or liability is only recognised in the Balance Sheet when it is probable that any associated 

rewards have been transferred to the ECB, and the cost or value of the asset or the amount of the 

obligation can be measured reliably.BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

on which they were settled.












in foreign currency are recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date. At the settlement date 
the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed and transactions are booked on-balance-sheet. Purchases 

and sales of foreign currency affect the net foreign currency position on the trade date, and realised 

results arising from sales are also calculated on that date. Accrued interest, premiums and discounts 














and the foreign currency position is also affected daily by these accruals.GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIESAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange 

rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate 

prevailing on the recording date. The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities, including 

on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments, is performed on a currency-by-currency basis.Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated 
separately from the exchange rate revaluation.1 The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in Decision ECB/2010/21 of 11 November 2010, OJ L 35, 9.2.2011,  
p. 1, as amended.2 These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, which require a harmonised approach to the 

rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem operations.184ECBAnnual Report2012Gold is valued at the market price prevailing at the year-end. No distinction is made between the 
price and currency revaluation differences for gold. Instead, a single gold valuation is accounted for

are calculated and presented as part of interest income and are amortised over the remaining life of 
the securities.REVERSE TRANSACTIONSReverse transactions are operations whereby the ECB buys or sells assets under a repurchase 

agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.3 A minimum threshold of •100,000 applies for administrative accruals and provisions.
185ECBAnnual Report2012Under a repurchase agreement, securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to 
repurchase them from the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Repurchase agreements 

are recorded as collateralised deposits on the liability side of the Balance Sheet. Securities sold 

under such an agreement remain on the Balance Sheet of the ECB.Under a reverse repurchase agreement, securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement 
to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date. Reverse repurchase 

agreements are recorded as collateralised loans on the asset side of the Balance Sheet but are not 

included in the ECB™s security holdings.Reverse transactions (including security lending transactions) conducted under an automated 
security lending programme are recorded on the Balance Sheet only where collateral is provided in 

the form of cash placed on an account of the ECB. In 2012 the ECB did not receive any collateral in 

the form of cash in connection with such transactions.OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTSCurrency instruments, namely foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign 

exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another 

at a future date, are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating 

foreign exchange gains and losses.Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis. Daily changes in the variation 
valuation of forward transactions in securities and of interest rate swaps is based on generally 

accepted valuation methods using observable market prices and rates, as well as discount factors 

from the settlement dates to the valuation date.POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTSThe values of assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance 

sheet date and the date on which the Executive Board authorises the submission of the ECB™s Annual 

Accounts to the Governing Council for approval, if such events materially affect the condition of 

assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.Important post-balance-sheet events that do not affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the 
balance sheet date are disclosed in the notes.INTRA-ESCB BALANCES/INTRA-EUROSYSTEM BALANCESIntra-ESCB balances result primarily from cross-border payments in the EU that are settled in central 

bank money in euro. These transactions are for the most part initiated by private entities (i.e.

TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETSFixed assets, including intangible assets, but with the exception of land and works of art, are valued 

at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful 

life of the asset, beginning in the quarter after the asset is available for use. The useful lives applied 

for the main asset classes are as follows:Computers, related hardware and software, and motor vehicles4 yearsTechnical equipment 4 or 10 yearsFurniture and plant in building10 yearsThe length of the depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure 
relating to the ECB™s existing rented premises has been adjusted to ensure that these assets are fully 

depreciated before the ECB moves to its new premises. Land and works of art are valued at cost.Fixed assets costing less than •10,000 are written off in the year of acquisition.
Fixed assets that comply with the capitalisation criteria but are still under construction or development 
new premises, costs will be assigned to the appropriate asset components which will be depreciated 

in accordance with their estimated useful lives.THE ECB™S PENSION PLAN, OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER LONG-TERM BENEFITSThe compulsory contributions made by the ECB and the staff are 18% and 6% of basic salary

191ECBAnnual Report2012end of June 2010. The net decrease in this item in 2012 was mainly due to redemptions.Under the second covered bond purchase programme, established in October 2011, the ECB and 
the NCBs purchased euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area with the objective 

of easing funding conditions for credit institutions and enterprises, as well as encouraging credit 

institutions to maintain and expand lending to their clients. The net increase in this item in 2012 was 

due to purchases in that year in the period until the programme ended on 31 October 2012.Under the Securities Markets Programme, established in May 2010, the ECB and the NCBs were 
able to purchase euro area public and private debt securities in order to address the malfunctioning 

of certain segments of the euro area debt securities markets and restore the proper functioning of 

the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The net decrease in this item in 2012 was due to 

redemptions that more than offset the impact of purchases and of the amortisation of net discounts 

in that year. The Governing Council decided on 6 September 2012 to end the Securities Markets 

Programme.14Part of the ECB™s holdings under the Securities Markets Programme comprises debt securities issued 

by the Hellenic Republic. In February 2012 the Eurosystem central banks exchanged their holdings 

of Greek government bonds purchased under the Securities Markets Programme for new securities 

issued by the Hellenic Republic. The newly acquired securities have the same characteristics as 

those purchased under the Securities Markets Programme in terms of their nominal values, coupon 

rates, interest payment dates and redemption dates, and were not included on the list of eligible 

securities that were subject to restructuring in the context of the private sector involvement (PSI) 

initiative. Consequently, the ECB did not incur any realised losses on its holdings of Greek 

government bonds.Securities purchased under the Securities Markets Programme and the covered bond purchase 


tests are conducted on the basis of the information available and estimated recoverable amounts as 

at the year-end.In the context of the impairment test conducted as at the end of 2012 on securities purchased under 
in particular, relating to the holdings of Greek government bonds, which occurred in the course 

Republic in the context of the PSI initiative and the second was the debt buy-back operation carried 

out by the Greek government in December 2012. The Governing Council considered that the 

occurrence of these impairment indicators did not warrant an impairment of the ECB™s holdings 

since, on the basis of the information available as at 31 December 2012, there was no evidence 

the year-end on the ECB™s holdings of Greek government bonds under the Securities Markets 

Programme. Furthermore, no impairment losses were recorded in respect of the other securities 

purchased under the Securities Markets Programme.14 As announced in the ECB™s press release of 6 September 2012 on the technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions.

ROVISIONSThis item consists of a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks 
as well as other miscellaneous provisions.The provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks will be used to the 
extent deemed necessary by the Governing Council to offset future realised and unrealised losses, 

in particular valuation losses not covered by the revaluation accounts. The size of and continuing 

requirement for this provision is reviewed annually, based on the ECB™s assessment of its exposure 

to the above risks. This assessment takes a range of factors into account, including in particular 

the level of holdings of risk-bearing assets, the extent of materialised risk exposures in the current 

Values at Risk (VaR) on risk-bearing assets, which is applied consistently over time. The provision, 

together with any amount held in the general reserve fund, may not exceed the value of the ECB™s 

capital paid up by the euro area NCBs.As at 31 December 2011 the provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold 
price risks amounted to •6,363,107,289. Taking the results of its assessment into account, the 

Governing Council decided to transfer, as at 31 December 2012, an amount of •1,166,175,000 to
