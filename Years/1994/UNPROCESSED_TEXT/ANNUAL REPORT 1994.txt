Annual Report 
of the EMI, which is addressed to 
the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the European Council, 
the EM1 aims to take 
stock of all aspects relevant to its tasks as 
set out in the Treaty establishing the 
European Community and to provide 
the public at large with a broad account 
of its views and activities. 
In accordance with Article 11 of the EM1 Statute, the 
Report covers both 
monetary and financial conditions in 
the Community and 
the activities of the EMI, and 
presents the Institute's 
annual accounts. In 
addition, the Report assesses progress 
towards convergence, 
the preparatory work for 
Stage Three and the institutional features 
of national central banks, thereby also fulfilling the reporting requirements 
of Article 7 of the EM1 Statute. Finally, this year's Annual 
Report encompasses the years 
1993 and 1994, reflecting the fact that the 
EM1 took over the tasks 
of the Committee 
of Governors of the EC central banks with effect from 
1 st January, 1994 and that no Committee 
Report for the year 1993 was published. Following standard practice 
for Annual 
Reports, the text 
does not assess developments beyond 
31st December 1994; events such as the ERM 
realignment of early March 1995 thus fall outside 
the time frame 
of the Report and 
are not considered. 
Chapter I describes and analyses the 
major economic, financial and monetary 
developments in the EU by focusing on their implications 
for the achievement and 
maintenance of price stability. On balance, the progress towards price stability achieved 
during the past 
two years is 
notable. Nevertheless, important challenges remain. First, 
price stability has not yet been achieved in the European Union 
as a whole, and in the 
context of the widespread recovery currently 
under way 
it may become considerably 
more difficult to make further progress. Thus monetary policy-makers will have to remain 
vigilant. Second, public finances 
in many Member States continue to 
be a cause 
for serious concern. Decisive action will be necessary to reduce budget deficits and to 
restore acceptable levels 
of public debt. Medium-term consolidation 
has to proceed at a 
satisfactory pace, and should 
be strongly weighted towards expenditure restraint. This is 
all the more important 
in those countries where the policy 
mix implies too heavy a burden 
for monetary policy 
in the pursuit of price stability. The period ahead 
will be particularly important as 
it will be crucial for the first assessment 
of convergence under Article 109j(l) of the Treaty, which is to be conducted 
independently both by the EM1 and by the Commission in the course 
of 1996. Chapter II presents the role 
of the EM1 in the field 
of co-operation and co-ordination 
during Stage Two and 
in the preparatory 
work for 
Stage Three. In Stage Two, the 
EM1 has the task 
of strengthening the monetary policy co-ordination 
of Member States 
with the aim 
of ensuring price stability. 
In carrying out its duties, 
the EM1 provides a forum 
for consultations and exchange 
of views and information 
on policy issues, while 
the conduct of monetary policy remains the exclusive responsibility 
of the national authorities. 
Regarding the preparatory 
work for 
Stage Three, the Treaty establishing 
the European Community requires the 
EM1 to prepare and specify by 
the end of 1996 the regulatory, organisational and 
logistical framework necessary 
for the European System 
of Central Banks to perform its tasks. In 
view of the very wide range 
of issues to 
be addressed in detail and the limited time 
available for 
the preparatory work, the 
EM1 Council has 
organised its work on the basis 
of a comprehensive agenda 
which acts as 
a guiding instrument for organising, monitoring and assessing the activities 
of the EM1 staff, the 
Sub-Committees and the Working Groups. 
Chapter Ill deals with the institutional features 
of national central banks, 
in particular in respect of the Treaty provisions concerning 
the implementation of central banking independence and the primary objective 
of promoting price stability. Institutional 
changes in 1993 and 1994 
are highlighted, current features 
of EU central banks 
are described and prospective changes in legislation 
are indicated. This chapter 
also addresses the role 
of the EM1 in monitoring compliance 
of the central banks 
with the prohibition of monetary financing 
of the public sector and its privileged access 
to financial institutions. The Report addresses 
a wide range of issues, reflecting 
the comprehensive range of tasks to be performed 
and the heavy agenda for the EM1 in the years ahead. In 
order to meet the requirements laid down in 
the Treaty a great deal 
of commitment and dedication will 
be necessary both 
from the national central banks and their staff members 
serving on the Sub-Committees and Working Groups 
of the EM1 and from the staff 
members of the EMI. To all of them, and first and foremost 
to the members 
of the EM1 Council, I wish to express my gratitude for the work which has been accomplished during 
the past two years, and 
in particular during last year's institution-building phase. In 
November 1994 
the EM1 moved from its provisional base in Basle to its premises in the 
"Eurotower" in Frankfurt: following 
the recruitment of additional personnel, it is 
now in a position to deal effectively with 
the tasks entrusted to it 
by the Treaty establishing the 
European Community. 
A. LAMFALUSSY President Frankfurt, 7Ih March 1995 
CHAPTER I ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE EUROPEAN 
UNION SUMMARY AND 
OVERVIEW 1. Economic, monetary and financial conditions in the 
EU in 1 993-94 1993 witnessed a recession 
in most - but not all - of the twelve 
EU Member States, 
with Union GDP falling by 
0.3%, while 1994 
saw a recovery to 
an estimated growth rate 
of 2.6%. Owing to rapid growth outside 
the EU, positive contributions from net exports 
were important in many member countries, mitigating the effects 
of the recession 
and providing a significant impetus to growth 
in 1994. As a consequence, 
the external balance of the Union improved significantly 
in 1993, and further smaller improvements 
took place in 1994. Domestic demand, which had been 
weak in 1993, recovered in 1994, in line 
with the cyclical upswing. Besides the general increase in activity, growth rates 
in EU countries were considerably more synchronised in 1994 than in 1993; 
economic growth was positive in all Union countries in 1994, 
for the first time since 1989. 
The average rate 
of increase in consumer prices 
in the European Union fell from 
4.3% in 1992 to 
3.1% in 1994, thus continuing the decline that had been observed 
since 1991; there was also a marked convergence 
of inflation. While the trends towards 
lower inflation rates in the Union reflected wage moderation and substantial productivity 
gains, attention should 
also be drawn 
to other factors. 
In particular, a significant change 
in economic policy thinking has taken place, and price stability 
is now considered to be one of the major objectives 
of economic policy in general, and the primary objective 
of monetary policy in particular. Furthermore, the progressive completion 
of the Single Market has enhanced competition, and some structural reforms to improve 
the flexibility of labour markets have been implemented. 
However, though 
the progress towards price stability achieved in 
EU countries during the past 
two years is notable, the 
result cannot yet be considered 
wholly satisfactory. Whereas some countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) reached 
or maintained annual inflation 
rates below or around 2-2.5% 
in 1994, Germany recorded a consumer price increase 
of 3% and inflation rates 
in Spain, Italy and Portugal remained 
in the range of 3.9 to 5.2%. Greece showed an inflation rate 
of slightly below 
11 % in 1994. Unemployment, which usually lags behind developments 
in activity, peaked 
in the EU as a 
whole at almost 12% in 1994, before beginning to decline slowly. Considerable 
differences remained among individual countries, but a common factor appears to be the 
existence of substantial structural problems. A 
wide range of measures have 
already been implemented 
in member countries since the late 
1980% but further supply-side 
measures are needed. A major cause 
for concern in 1993-94 was the continued deterioration 
of fiscal positions in EU countries. 
After standing at 5.0% in 1992, the 
general government deficit 
of the Union 
as a whole increased in 1993 
- partly for cyclical reasons 
- to 6.0% 
of GDP, the highest level recorded 
since the creation 
of the EEC. In 1994 
it fell only marginally 
to stand at 5.6% despite the cyclical improvement. According to certain estimates, this 
modest reduction reflects 
on average cyclical 
rather than structural effects. Overall, the 
gross public debt ratio 
of the Union climbed to almost 69% 
of GDP in 1994, compared 
with nearly 61% two years 
earlier, although deficits and debts continued to 
vary substantially among 
Member States. Monetary expansion, albeit moderate at an 
EU level, differed significantly 
in individual countries, sometimes posing problems 
of interpretation for the monetary 
authorities. In Germany, where 
the Bundesbank continued 
in 1993-94 to be guided 
by an 
intermediate money supply 
target for M3, it was judged on balance that rapid monetary 
growth could 
largely be accounted 
for by exceptional or temporary factors, and monetary 
developments at the end 
of 1994 confirmed this assessment. 
The conduct of monetary policy 
by ERM members 
was complicated by volatility on foreign exchange markets. 1993 
in particular was notable for a continuation 
of the turbulence in the Exchange Rate Mechanism 
of the EMS which had begun 
in the late 
summer of 1992. In August 1993, as a consequence 
of overwhelming market pressure, 
the decision 
was taken by 
EU Ministers of Finance and central bank Governors to 
widen the fluctuation bands while confirming the prevailing central rates. Immediately 
after the widening of the ERM bands, 
the currencies previously in 
the narrow band traded 
below their former lower limits against 
the Deutsche Mark (the exception 
was the Dutch guilder, 
which remains 
within a narrow margin vis-a-vis 
the Deutsche Mark) but rather 
rapidly recovered towards their central parities. The Spanish peseta and 
the Portuguese escudo (which were devalued in 
the first half of 1993) stayed above their former limits. Overall, 
central banks 
of ERM countries used the flexibility inherent in the 
new framework prudently to accommodate only short-lived market pressures. 
At the same time, the 
wider fluctuation margins proved to be 
an efficient means 
of deterring speculative movements, 
alleviating the related constraints 
on monetary policy. 
As a result, from the 
end of 1993 and during most 
of 1994 the ERM operated relatively smoothly, without major tensions. 
Currencies of EU countries outside 
the ERM experienced greater 
volatility. Over the period 
as a whole, the Italian lira and 
the Greek drachma weakened vis-a-vis the 
strongest ERM currencies, reflecting among other factors concerns about the stance 
of fiscal policy, the 
outlook for inflation 
and, in 
Italy, political uncertainties. 
At the end 
of 1994, the 
sterlingtDM rate was similar to the end-1992 level. The monetary policy 
strategies of these countries' central banks tended to focus directly on domestic inflation, 
while also taking into account related indicators and not disregarding the importance 
of exchange rate stability. 
While bond markets in 1993 
were characterised by optimism, a decline in 
long- term yields and a compression 
of differentials, early 1994 witnessed a dramatic revision 
of expectations. Bond yields rose 
steeply in all industrialised countries 
,and, despite contrasting cyclical positions, there 
was a simultaneous movement 
of US and European 
bond markets. Within 
the EU, however, country-specific factors 
were clearly also important, as indicated by the fact that bond market yield differentials 
widened considerably in some cases. 
The monetary policy implications 
of bond market developments depend 
on the extent to which rises in nominal yields 
are caused by higher (risk-free) real interest rates, 
increasing inflation expectations 
andtor rising risk premia. While 
the overall judgement of the central banks 
in most EU 
countries was that there 
was no risk 
of an immediate upturn in inflation, the behaviour 
of long-term bond yields 
was nevertheless considered to 
indicate important long-term concerns 
in the markets, particularly over fiscal positions, as 
well as 
an increased focus 
on countries' long-term records 
of price and exchange rate 
stability. In the 
context of these real and financial developments, central banks remained 
aware that 
it was important to emphasise the steady conduct 
of anti-inflationary monetary 
policies, based on a 
clear statement of objectives and assumptions, and a willingness 
to act when 
the fulfilment of the objectives 
was threatened. Within this framework, central 
banks in 
the Union considered it appropriate 
for most of 1993-94 to continue their 
policy of gradually lowering official 
or key 
interest rates, thus allowing short-term interest rates 
to decline until 
the summer of 1994. In the 
second half of 1994 a 
few countries started to 
raise interest rates 
again, either because prospects 
for further disinflation had 
weakened or in response to perceived threats to price stability. 
In retrospect, the restoration of exchange rate stability, 
especially within the 
ERM, in combination with the continued 
slowdown in the rate of inflation across the Union and a 
narrowing of inflation differentials between countries, may 
be seen as evidence that the 
course of monetary policies in individual countries was broadly appropriate. Of course, 
in making this assessment, the prospects 
for inflation must also 
be taken into account. In 
this context, monetary policy again risked becoming overburdened 
when other economic policies did 
not contribute sufficiently to the achievement 
of medium-term price stability, 
and, consequently, to stability in financial markets. In this respect fiscal policies bore a 
substantial responsibility. 
2. Prospects and challenges 
Viewed from 
the end of 1994, the overall growth perspective 
for 1995 has clearly 
brightened further, both 
for the twelve existing Member States and 
the three new entrants. Economic 
activity is growing faster than expected and the rise in unemployment 
rates has come to 
an end. At 
the same time, the external balance 
of the Union is expected to continue to improve. 
On a less favourable note, 
however, high levels 
of structural unemployment, the pattern of fiscal deficits 
and levels of public debt continue to constitute major challenges. 
The fall in inflation to below 
3% expected in 1995 is, to some extent, related to the 
previous recession, which had opened 
up significant output gaps in several countries. In 
addition, wage flexibility 
may have increased in some countries as a consequence 
of recent agreements between the social partners 
andlor labour market reforms. There 
are, however, risks inherent 
in the forecast for inflation which call 
for vigilance on the part 
of central banks 
in respect of their interest rate policies, 
not only 
to safeguard 
the progress made thus far 
in fostering price stability, but also to enable further progress in countries 
where inflation is still relatively 
high. Pre-emptive tightening measures have been taken 
in some Member States. 
More generally, continued wage restraint 
as well as determined structural 
adjustment measures 
- including fiscal consolidation 
- are critical to enhance the 
durability of a non-inflationary recovery. The 
scope for wage increases should 
not be misjudged and fiscal consolidation efforts should 
be pursued with determination 
in a period in which the cyclical upswing tends to mask the underlying structural problems. 
The upturn offers 
an opportunity to take 
the necessary steps in fiscal adjustment and 
at the same time minimises 
the social costs 
of fiscal restriction. Without continued efforts to 
reduce structural fiscal deficits, 
no lasting progress can 
be made towards a viable fiscal 
position in 
the Union and a more balanced policy 
mix. In particular, it is 
essential that the 
commitments included 
in convergence programmes 
be respected, with the emphasis 
being put 
on expenditure cuts rather than 
on increases in revenue. Consolidation will be 
all the more important in those countries where monetary policy is overburdened. 
Labour market reforms are also urgently 
needed. Such reforms could also 
be expected to lend 
support to the pursuit 
of price stability. 
The achievement 
of a high degree 
of sustainable convergence will be 
of crucial importance. In particular, in the context of the Maastricht Treaty 
on European Union, the 
countries entering Economic and Monetary Union are required to have 
met the necessary 
conditions for the adoption of a single currency. 
The criteria which will be examined focus 
on price stability, sustainability 
of government financial positions, exchange rate stability 
and the convergence of long-term interest 
rates, although other factors will also be taken 
into consideration. On balance, 
whereas progress towards price stability 
was notable in the past, deficiencies remain, and at present most EU countries would 
not qualify for Monetary Union, in 
the majority of cases because 
of their fiscal positions. 
If, however, outstanding structural and cyclical challenges are met, convergence within the Union 
will make further progress. 
A. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING 
OF 1993 1. Macroeconomic background 1.1 Global patterns 
in major industrialised economies 
Cyclical positions 
There were marked contrasts 
in the evolution of the global business cycle between 
1993, a 
year which witnessed a pronounced desynchronisation 
among major industrial 
countries, and 1994, during 
which growth rates tended to converge (see Chart 
1). The United States, which was the first country to move into recession, has experienced 
sustained growth since reaching a trough in 
1991. With an increase in GDP of 4.0% in 1994 the US economy 
is operating close to full capacity. The most dynamic components 
of the expansion have been private consumption and investment, which have been 
increasing above historical trend rates, causing the level 
of imports to rise rapidly and 
thereby widen the trade deficit. 
In the EU as a 
whole, output growth began to slow in 1990 and reached its 
low point in early 1993. This reflected contrasting developments. 
In the United Kingdom, 
which had experienced two 
years of falling output from 
mid-1990 to mid-1992, the 
economy entered a phase 
of renewed growth during the course 
of 1992. In most other EU countries both 
the timing and the intensity of cyclical developments were strongly 
influenced by the spillover effects 
of the German unification 
boom. As discussed in Section 1.2 below, the contraction in output in 1993 
was followed by a stronger than 
expected recovery in 
1994. Among the last of the major economies to 
go into recession 
was Japan. Owing to 
depressed consumer and 
business confidence and partly reflecting 
the real appreciation 
of the yen, private consumption and investment 
were very 
subdued in 
1993, with output 
growing at l .O% in 1994, still 
well below the trend 
rate. In a number 
of countries financial fragility 
was a special feature 
of the recent 
recession. In 
the United States, 
the United Kingdom, Japan and 
some other countries, 
the length and depth 
of the economic downturn were aggravated 
by the efforts of households, firms and financial institutions to correct 
disequilibria in their balance-sheet 
positions. Chart 1 Main developments in major industrialised economies

1 In 1993 and 1994 annual inflation rates 
in the major industrialised economies 
declined. In the United States inflation 
was below 3% in both 1993 and 
1994, one of the lowest rates 
of price increase of the post-war period, although quarterly rates have shown 
some fluctuation. The Federal Reserve tightened monetary conditions 
in February 1994 
for the first time 
in five years 
in response to concerns about 
an increase in underlying 
inflationary pressures. Between February and December 1994 
the federal funds rate was 
raised six times; initially, the Federal Reserve opted for relatively small increases

(of 25 basis points each), but these apparently did 
not reassure the markets. The increase 
of 75 basis points in mid-November 
1994 brought the federal funds rate to 
5.5% (from 3% in early February 1994); this was one of the largest increases 
of the post- war period and seems to have strengthened the financial markets' confidence in the 
anti- inflationary stance 
of the US monetary authorities. 
In the EU 
the average rate of inflation fell continuously; 
in 1994 it stood close to 
3%. In Japan, monetary easing started 
in early 1991 and the discount rate 
was held at 1.75% from September 
1993 onwards. Owing to 
weak domestic demand and the strong appreciation of the yen, the inflation rate stood 
at 1.3% in 1993 (compared with 1.7% the year before) and declined further in 
1994. In order to stimulate economic activity the 
monetary authorities adopted 
a very accommodating stance, although the 
real appreciation of the yen in 1994 partly offset the effects 
of low nominal interest rates. 
Exchange rate developments 
A significant feature 
of the foreign exchange markets throughout 
the period under review was the relative weakness 
of the dollar during both years vis-a-vis 
the yen and 
in 1994 vis-a-vis all currencies, and the considerable strengthening 
of the yen. During 
these two years the dollar depreciated in nominal effective terms 
by around 5% and the 
yen appreciated by 
about 30%; movements in their real effective exchange rates were 
roughly of the same order. Viewed in 
a medium-term perspective, this could help to 
reduce external imbalances between 
the two countries 
by increasing the competitiveness 
of US goods 
and services. In the short run, however, 
it had pro-cyclical effects 
on the US and Japanese economies. 
The appreciation 
of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark 
of around 7% in the course of 1993 was followed 
in 1994 by a depreciation of around 10%. The dollar's initial 
appreciation was partly related to changing expectations concerning short-term interest 
rate differentials after 
the Bundesbank began a series of interest rate reductions, thus 
generating expectations 
of a progressive narrowing 
of the short-term interest rate 
differential between the two countries. 
However, the tightening 
of monetary conditions 
by the Federal Reserve 
in February 1994 drew the market's attention to the stronger than 
anticipated growth and failed to calm increased inflationary expectations. 
Another important factor 
was the temporary halt in the bilateral trade talks 
with Japan, which 
drew attention to 
the widening US external imbalance. Finally, the recovery in Europe, 
which turned out to be stronger than expected, also played 
a part in the dollar's 
weakening. A number of central banks intervened 
on occasion in foreign exchange markets 
in 1994 to smooth or check the dollar's fall, and there 
were a few co-ordinated rounds 
of joint intervention. The Japanese 
yen went 
through two main phases vis-a-vis the Deutsche 
Mark in 1993 and 1994. Between January and August 1993 the yen appreciated sharply before 
stabilising with minor fluctuations at around 
DM 1.60 per Yen 
100. Vis-a-vis the dollar the 
yen experienced a sharp appreciation over 
the whole period, moving from Yen 
125 in January 1993 to around 
Yen l00 at the end 
of 1994, notwithstanding heavy intervention purchases of dollars by the Japanese monetary authorities. 
1.2 Economic developments in the EU For the EU as a whole, the 1993-94 period 
was characterised by a return to growth 
following the recession. Several successive years 
of declining GDP growth rates in the 
Member States collectively had 
been capped by a decline 
of 0.3% in the real level 
of economic activity 
in 1993, the first fall 
in GDP for twelve years. 
By contrast, GDP growth in 1994 
is estimated to have been around 2.6% 
for the EU as a whole. 
Putting these developments into historical perspective, it is evident that the recent 
recession in 
the EU as a whole was 
not unusually severe when compared with previous 
recessions, although 
in some countries it was 
the deepest in decades. The fall 
in GDP was 1.3% from peak to trough, with 
the low point in activity being reached 
in the spring 
of 1993. By comparison, GDP in 
the Union in 
the early 1980s fell by 
1.4%, with an even greater decline amounting to 
2.1% in 1974-75. As regards the pace 
of the current upturn, 
a growth rate 
of 2.6% does not appear to be exceptional for the first year of recovery: while growth was sluggish 
for several years following 
the recession in the early 1980s, the EU average growth rate 
was 4.5% in 1976, the first year 
of recovery following the 
previous recession. 
In most countries cyclical behaviour was quite synchronised, with developments 
in real GDP reflecting closely those in the EU as a whole. However, some 
economies showed contrasts either 
in terms of the amplitude of the cycle, or in terms 
of its timing 
(see Chart 2). 
Chart 2 GDP growth 
in EU Member States* 
(annual percentage changes) 
Source: National 
data. Aggregate EU figures, here and elsewhere 
in the Annual 
Report, are 
gmerally constructed using purchasing 
power parity (PPP) exchange rates. 
However, trade 
data use actual exchange rates 
in 1989. Rates and indices 
(except CPI) 
are based on 1989 GDP weights. In Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, ltaly and Portugal overall 
economic activity declined 
in 1993 but recovered significantly in 
1994. In some countries the 
positive contribution from 
net exports was particularly important 
in determining developments both 
in 1993 and 1994. 
In 1993, positive changes in trade balances 
partly offset the weakness of domestic demand (thus mitigating the severity 
of the downturn) 
and in 1994 the strength of net trade provided a significant impetus to growth. In this 
context, the buoyancy of world trade in 1994 benefited all these countries, while 
in Spain and ltaly export growth in the course 
of 1993-94 was further strengthened 
by the gains in competitiveness which 
had followed the substantial exchange 
rate depreciations of 1992-93. Domestic demand, which 
had been 
a major source 
of weakness of real activity in 
most of these countries in 1993, made a positive, albeit a fairly 
modest, contribution to growth in 1994. Consumer sentiment, which 
had been 
severely affected by the 
recession and in some 
countries by the 1992-93 exchange 
rate crises, recovered gradually over 
time. This led 
to a gradual improvement in 
private consumption and an accompanying 
decline in the saving ratio. Stock building 
has also given a significant stimulus to growth 
in most 
of these countries, but investment, despite a marked improvement 
in 1994, provided only a modest stimulus 
to economic activity. Furthermore, 
in spite 
of sizable fiscal deficits, 
the direct contribution 
of government consumption to GDP growth remained small or even 
negative in 
most of this group 
(see Section 
3.1 for 
a discussion 
of fiscal policy). 
Growth remained positive 
in Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands and the United 
Kingdom throughout 
the two 
years covered by this Report, although in 
some countries a 
slowdown in activity was experienced 
during the course 
of 1993. In both 1993 
and 1994 GDP growth in Ireland was 
the highest in the Union and it was above 
the EU 
average in Denmark. Domestic 
demand in Denmark, Ireland 
and the Netherlands was 
either broadly unchanged or fell in 1993, but 
GDP growth was 
supported by 
net trade. 
Rapid growth 
in Denmark over 
the period under review was also attributable 
to an expansionary fiscal stance. 
In the United Kingdom, 
GDP growth was positive 
in both 
years. However, this 
followed a prolonged 
and severe recession 
between mid-1990 and 
mid-1 992, which 
had been 
related to private sector balance-sheet difficulties 
and the 
high level of nominal interest rates between 1988 
and 1990. The recovery, which began in 
mid-1992, was principally associated with a 
turnaround in private consumption 
and was boosted by the reduction in interest rates, which 
had begun as early 
as 1990. Net 
exports, which 
had supported the economy during the earlier downturn, 
had a much 
less positive influence during 
the initial stages 
of the recovery in 1993 since 
these coincided with the cyclical deterioration in continental Europe. However, 
as the 
recovery gathered 
pace in 1994 net 
exports provided an increasing contribution 
to growth as fiscal tightening 
slowed domestic demand. 
1994 also witnessed an increasing 
convergence of growth rates, with, 
for the first time since 1989, all Union countries simultaneously experiencing positive economic 
growth. The standard deviation 
of growth rates, which 
stood at 2.3% in 1991, declined 
to 0.7% in 1994. As a consequence 
of the cyclical desynchronisation 
of the Union 
vis-a-vis third countries, the external balance 
of the EU as a whole improved significantly 
in 1993. A 
further, smaller improvement also 
took place in 1994 (see 
Table 1). Trade balances 
improved in 
almost all 
EU countries in 
1993 and the 
overall EU trade surplus 
increased in 
1994, to reach 1.3% 
of GDP. Over this 
period the EU's deficit on invisibles increased 
slightly from 0.6% to 
1% of GDP, but this 
did not prevent the current 
account from 
moving into a surplus 
of 0.2 and 0.4% of GDP in 1993 and 
1994 respectively. 
Improvements in the trade balance in 1993 amounted 
to over 2% of GDP in Spain, lreland and Italy, both 
as a result 
of gains in competitiveness and, particularly 
in Spain and Italy, as 
a consequence 
of the depressed state of domestic demand. 
In general, the improvements in trade balances 
in 1994 were on a smaller scale, with improvements 
of between 0.5 and 1% of GDP in Germany, 
Italy and Ireland. However, 
some countries experienced either 
a deteriorating or a constant trade balance in 1994 due to 
the strength of domestic activity (although 
in Denmark the trade balance and the current account 
remained comfortably 
in surplus). Table 1 Trade and current account

BLEU Denmark Germany Greece Spain France Ireland Italy Netherlands Portugal United Kingdom EU-I 2 (bl(cl Differences in 
the timing and severity 
of the recession in 
the Member States would 
suggest that, while growth rates 
may have converged during 1994, the margins 
of slack existing in individual countries continued to vary considerably. Such 
a margin can be 
proxied by the "output 
gap", which is the difference between actual and potential output 
where potential output is the level 
of output that would be sustainable 
in the economy without putting upward pressure 
on the inflation rate. Estimates of this are subject to 
considerable uncertainty but confirm 
the view that output gaps, although showing some 
convergence during 1993 and 
1994, still varied considerably within 
Europe. I Unemployment, which usually lags behind developments in activity, peaked in the 
EU as 
a whole at around 18 million (or close to 12% 
of the labour force) in 1994, before 
beginning - albeit slowly 
- to decline. The unemployment rate in 
the Union had risen 
by more than three percentage points during 
the downturn from 
a low point of 8.3% during the previous expansionary phase 
of economic activity in 
the early 1990s, and had either 
stabilised or started to decline in 
most Member States during 
the second half of last year. 
However, considerable differences remained among the rates 
of unemployment in individual countries. 
At the end of 1994 unemployment 
was below the 10% level 
only in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
the United Kingdom. A sizable part 
of the recorded increase 
in unemployment in the Union since 
the late 1980s was the result 
of the slowdown in economic activity. 
However, the recent peak level of unemployment was higher than that reached in previous cycles (the average 
unemployment rate in 
the 1970s never exceeded 6%, and the peak rate 
in the mid-1 980s Trade balances

rates seen in most EU countries in 1993-94, both relative 
to their own past experience and 
compared with those in other major countries, represented 
a considerable waste 
of resources and an 
important source of social (as well as budgetary) 
costs to Member 
States. As is widely acknowledged, 
the high levels and 
rates of unemployment can 
be attributed primarily to a 
poor record of employment creation rather 
than to 
changes in the labour force. Between 1980 and 1994, for instance, only around 
3.5 million additional jobs were 
created within the EU, far fewer 
than in either 
the United States 
(19.3 million) 
or Japan (1 0.5 million). Improving this performance requires structural 
reforms to the 
functioning of the labour market. Such 
reforms could 
also be expected to lend support 
to the pursuit 
of price stability. EU unemployment rate and

2. The specific features 
of labour markets in 
~ndividual EU countries vary considerably 
- as indeed do the precise characteristics of 
the unemployment problem (see the table) - and consequently the particular policy priorities in 
terms of reform vary across countries. 
Moreover, creating more jobs in 
the EU requires greater competitiveness and implies 
that policy should also focus 
on product markets and deregulation 
more generally. At the Union level, as well as 
at the 
level of individual Member States, 
attention has 
been increasingly focused on labour market issues in 1994, and proposals to improve labour 
market performance 
were published in 
a White Paper. Labour market reforms may 
be considered as falling into 
two categories: those affecting the terms and 
conditions of 
employment and others that focus directly on 
the unemployed. Factors that have 
been identified as having an influence on 
the functioning of the labour market and which may 
be of particular relevance to 
the EU include the following: labour 
costs (including both wage and

the degree 
of real wage 
flexibility (related to the extent of centralisation of wage bargaining, wage indexation, minimum 
wage regulation, union density 
and strike legislation), hiring 
and firing costs, unemployment 
insurance schemes and training 
programmes. A wide range of labour market 
reforms have been implemented 
in Europe since 
the late 1980s. Changes to unemployment insurance schemes 
have been 
widespread, taking the form of changes in 
the level of net benefits received, the duration of benefit entitlement andlor eligibility. In France, 
for example, 
the pattern 
of payments was revised, 
so as to decline with unemployment duration. 
In 1994, the ratio of unemployment benefit 
to average earnings was 
reduced in Germany, while in Ireland and Spain unemployment 
benefits were made taxable. Forms of wage indexation have been 
changed in several countries. In 
Belgium the link has been changed to exclude price rises in alcohol, fuel and 
tobacco, while in ltaly the "scala mobile" has 
been replaced by a system 
linking wage rises to 
targeted inflation. In Greece, 
wage indexation was abolished in 1991. Minimum wages 
have been frozen in 
the Netherlands since 1992, and remaining 
restrictions in a number of industries were abolished 
from 1993 
in the United Kingdom. Progress has also been made in reducing 
non-wage labour costs, for example in Belgium and in France, where employers' social 
insurance contributions have been 
reduced (in Belgium, 
for low-income earners 
and when hiring young workers). 
A number of 
measures have been 
taken in Luxembourg, aimed, inter 
alia, at reducing non-wage labour 
costs. The introduction 
of new hiring procedures and the 
relaxation of restrictions governing redundancies were 
carried out in Spain, 
as part of a wide-ranging reform of the labour market in 1994. Finally, training 
programmes have 
been extended in many 
countries, with a particular focus on 
improving the skills and qualifications 
of the young and long-term unemployed. 
was 11%). 
It was also significantly above 
the recent peaks reached 
in both 
the United States (7.4% in 1992) 
and Japan (where the 
maximum observed to date 
is around 
3.0%). As shown in 
Box 1, 
unemployment in the EU has tended 
to drift upwards in each 
cycle since the 1970s, highlighting the existence of substantial structural 
problems that need to be addressed; the important corollary 
is that current 
levels of unemployment are 
only partly cyclically determined. 
The most recent 
trough in unemployment (in 
1990) was considerably higher 
than the 
average unemployment 
rate seen in 
the 1970s. Moreover, 
an OECD 
study published in 1994 showed that unemployment in Europe was particularly 
high for certain 
categories within the labour force, 
e.g. for those 
under 25 
years (over 20% of whom were 
unemployed in 1993) 
and the 
long-term unemployed (over 40% of the total in 
1992). Consumer price inflation in 
EU countries declined 
on average 
from 4.3% 
in 1992 
to 3.1% in 1994. 
There was also 
a marked convergence 
of inflation, with 
the standard deviation of inflation falling 
from 2.1% in 
1992 to 1.5% in 1994. Although 
the achievement of the past two years 
cannot be considered wholly 
satisfactory, it represents notable 
progress for 
the Union as a 
whole. Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, 
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom reached or 
maintained inflation rates of, or below, 
2-2.5% in 1994, while 
Germany made headway 
and recorded 
an inflation 
rate of 3%. Further reductions in annual consumer price increases 
took place in 
ltaly and Portugal, where inflation in 
1994 stood 
at 3.9% and 
5.2% respectively, while 
in Spain the inflation rate rose 
marginally to 
4.7%. Greece showed an inflation 
rate of slightly below 
11% in 1994, compared with almost 
16% in 1992. The following paragraphs focus 
on the 
major factors accounting for 
the trend towards 
lower inflation 
rates in the Union, with the 
emphasis on 
short-term cost elements 
(see Table 
2); other causal 
factors such

of 4.6% in 1992, to 2.4% in 1993 and 
0.4% in 1994. Wage restraint was the principal underlying factor in 
1993; against the background of the recession and increasing levels 
of unemployment the rise in nominal wages declined from 
over 6% in 1992 
to 3.8% in 1993. At the same time, and also as a result 
of the recession, 
labour productivity growth 
slowed, but this 
only partly offset 
the impact of nominal wage restraint. In 1994 
the recovery in activity and a further increase in the level 
of unemployment in the Union as a whole 
was associated with a sharp rise 
in labour productivity. This development, together with continuing wage moderation (with nominal 
wage increases falling to 
3.5%), underlay the further deceleration 
in unit labour 
costs overall. In a number 
of countries, rises in unit labour costs were kept below 
3% in 1993 and below 
2% in 1994. In 1994 
unit labour costs actually fell in 
Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Italy. Increases above the EU average were recorded in Spain, Luxembourg 
and Portugal 
over 1993-94, although a marked 
slowdown occurred, and in Greece costs 
continued to rise 
very rapidly, exceeding 
11% in both years. Other factors 
- unrelated to cyclical developments 
- contributed to the favourable inflation performance 
of EU countries in 1993-94. In some, structural reforms to improve flexibility 
in the labour markets have been implemented (see 
Box 1). Furthermore, there 
are indications of enhanced competition 
in product markets, partly related to 
the progressive completion 
of the Single Market. 
Patterns of import prices differed sharply across countries 
in 1993. In several 
Member States import prices declined, but sharp increases occurred 
in Greece, Spain, 
ltaly and 
in the United Kingdom, and smaller ones 
in Ireland and 
Portugal, as a result 
of intra-EU currency devaluations 
or depreciations in 1992-93. Nevertheless, 
the pass- through of these exchange rate changes was 
not complete in most of the countries concerned as importers accepted a compression 
of their profit margins 
and exporters reduced home-currency prices as a result 
of weak demand. 
In 1994, import prices were 
influenced by a partial restoration 
of margins and rising commodity prices, supplemented 
in some countries, such as Greece, Spain, ltaly and Portugal, by further exchange rate 
effects. Over 
the two-year period, however, 
the impact of weaker exchapge rates on overall consumer price inflation has been limited, compared with past experience. 
The general tendency towards declining inflation rates 
in 1993-94 was apparent both in sectors producing goods and services traded 
on international markets, and 
in those producing domestic goods and services. While the difference 
between inflation rates in the sheltered and non-sheltered sectors increased 
on average in the first two 
years of this decade, 
it has declined more recently 
in most Member States, reflecting the 
effects on inflation of moderate wage developments and increased competition 
in the sheltered sector. The further development 
of the Single Market 
may lead to a broader 
range of goods and services being traded among Member States, contributing further to 
lower inflation rates 
in traditionally sheltered sectors. 
Finally, notwithstanding the above, consumer price rises in the 
EU were 
boosted by increases in indirect taxes. Reflecting the state 
of public finances, 
such increases were common to most Member States in 1993-94. 
2. Financial market developments 
Trends in foreign exchange and bond markets differed markedly 
in 1993 and 
1994. 1993 was notable for a continuation 
of the exchange rate tensions which had arisen 
in the late summer 
of 1992, until they were defused 
by the decision to widen the ERM 
exchange rate bands 
in August. Bond markets, meanwhile, experienced a bullish 
period, with rising prices and historically low yields being attained. In contrast, 1994 
was marked by a rapid reversal 
of these bond market trends, but comparative calm 
on the foreign exchange markets. 
2.1 Developments in 
foreign exchange markets 
Exchange rate developments 
In 1993, exchange rate relations in the EMS experienced substantial strains. In the 
first half of the year, the persistence 
of tensions led to two realignments, 
in addition to the three that had been carried 
out in the last four months 
of 1992 and 
the suspension of their ERM membership 
by the Italian lira 
and the pound sterling. In 
the face of unprecedented speculative pressures, fluctuation margins were widened in August 
1993. Thereafter, more stable conditions were re-established 
in foreign exchange markets, 
as the new system performed relatively smoothly from the end 
of 1993 and during 
most of 1 994. In the 
first half of 1993, recurrent episodes 
of speculative tensions affected most 
currencies. After intense pressure, the 
Irish pound was devalued by 
10% on 1st February. In the days 
which followed, the tensions affecting the Danish krone 
were successfully subdued 
in the wake 
of a rise in official interest rates, co-ordinated 
intervention and a reduction in German interest rates. 
In March, the French franc 
came under pressure in the run-up to 
the French legislative elections, but recovered 
after the new Government re-affirmed its commitment to exchange rate stability. In 
April, the Spanish peseta 
was affected by the announcement 
of early legislative elections 
in Spain. As tensions grew, spilling 
over onto the Portuguese escudo, the Spanish authorities 
requested a realignment 
on 13th May; 
the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo 
were devalued by 8% and 6.5% respectively from 14th 
May. In July 1993, after a short period 
of relative stability, intense market pressure re- 
emerged, focusing in particular on the French 
franc. The turnaround in market sentiment 
was intensified by expectations 
of diverging paces 
of economic activity in 
the member countries, combined 
with uncertainties about the future stance 
of monetary policies. 
After substantial co-ordinated intervention in the 
foreign exchange markets, official rates 
were raised in France and 
Denmark. Speculative capital flows were temporarily contained, 
following a joint public statement 
by the Banque de France and the Bundesbank and 
additional policy measures 
in France. The 
Bundesbank decided on 29th July 
to reduce 
the lombard rate and announced a further lowering 
of the rate on repurchase agreements 
while leaving the discount rate unchanged. This 
was followed by renewed market 
pressure, which in the end could not be resisted despite massive intervention by 
all the central banks involved 
and the announcement 
by the Bundesbank that it would 
allow short-term market rates to fall below 
the discount rate. Ministers and Governors 
confirmed the prevailing central rates and took the decision to widen the ERM fluctuation 
bands to +15% on 2nd August 1993. As a result 
of a bilateral agreement, the 
former Chart 3 Position of currencies in the

of +2.25% continue to 
apply between the Dutch guilder and the 
Deutsche Mark. In the 
wake of the widening of the ERM bands, the currencies previously 
in the narrow band, with 
the exception of the Dutch 
guilder, started to trade below their former 
lower limits 
against the Deutsche Mark, reflecting expectations that 
the greater scope 
for monetary differentiation allowed 
by the wider ERM bands would 
be used by the member 
countries concerned to ease monetary policy. Between August and mid-October 
1993, the bilateral deviations vis-a-vis their Deutsche Mark central rates ranged from 4% to 
8.5% for the lrish pound, 
the French franc, the Belgian 
franc and the Danish krone. For 
the currencies previously in the 
wide band, the impact of the decision 
was less marked, 
as the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo fluctuated within their former limits 
vis-a-vis the 
Deutsche Mark. From mid-October, bilateral deviations 
of exchange rates 
started to narrow 
in response to growing market awareness that 
the room for manoeuvre allowed by the 
new ERM margins would 
only be used to absorb self-reversing market 
movements. Interest rate policies were implemented accordingly. 
During most of 1994, the bilateral deviation between the strongest and the weakest 
participating currencies remained close to 
6%, except for three episodes (in January, 
June and 
December 1994) when it reached 
8%. The Dutch guilder, the lrish 
pound and the Belgian franc were 
the strongest of the former narrow band currencies. Vis-a-vis the 
Deutsche Mark, in 
1994, the French franc and 
the Danish krone remained stable, 
on average, around their former 
lower bilateral limits and the Spanish peseta and the 
Portuguese escudo stayed above their former limits. The latter experienced temporary 
tensions in 
May and June 1994, leading 
the Banco de Portugal to resort to intervention 
sales and 
higher official and market interest rates. 
In December 1994, the 
Spanish peseta weakened below its 
former lower bilateral limit. 
Developments in other indicators tend to confirm that 
the ERM regained 
substantial stability in 
the course of 1994. Short-term interest rate differentials vis-a-vis 
the Deutsche Mark were less volatile and, 
on average, comparable to levels before the 
crises. Intervention activity 
in support of currencies under downward pressure 
was substantially reduced and closer 
to the average recorded between 1988 and 
1992. Replenishment of reserves was undertaken by some central banks. The volatility 
of exchange rates, which had increased significantly (except 
for the Dutch guilder) following 
the 2nd 
August 1993 decision, declined noticeably in 
the course of 1994, although 
it did not return to pre-crises levels. 
Following their withdrawal from the ERM in September 1992, the pound sterling 
and the Italian lira depreciated sharply. From March 1993 until the end 
of the year sterling recovered some ground, but depreciated again 
in 1994. Its movements against ERM 
currencies were greater than those in its effective rate because 
the UK currency moved 
in part 
with the US dollar. Sterling ended 1994 some 13% below its 
August 1992 level 
against the Deutsche Mark, although it depreciated 
by only 1% between end-1992 and 
end-1994. The Italian lira, while stabilising 
or even recovering 
on several occasions, 
followed a downward trend during most 
of 1993 and 
1994, depreciating overall 
by over 27% with respect to the rate prevailing at end-August 
1992 against the German currency, 
leading to a substantial over-correction 
of the competitive position. Political factors 
may have played an important role in influencing the exchange rate of the lira.

of market tensions. The first, 
in August-September 1993, was 
linked to the widening 
of the ERM band and followed the 
removal, in May 
1993, of most foreign exchange restrictions on medium and long-term 
financial transactions. The second, in May 1994, was a result 
of expectations that the 
lifting of all remaining restrictions 
on short-term capital movements, scheduled 
at the end of June 1994, would be accompanied 
by a devaluation 
of the currency. 
In both cases the 
Bank of Greece resisted the depreciation 
of the drachma beyond 
its target by taking appropriate steps, thereby demonstrating the Greek authorities' continuing commitment 
to an exchange rate policy aimed 
at not fully 
accommodating inflation differentials. 
The main underlying factors 
The protracted tensions experienced in the EMS during 
the first half of 1993 resulted from the combined effects 
of a set 
of factors, the relevance 
of which differed 
among member countries and changed over time as 
the crisis unfolded. External factors 
played a lesser 
role than in 1992, as the US dollar appreciated vis-a-vis European 
currencies after 
the weakness recorded in 1992. Likewise, intra-EMS competitive 
positions represented a less important source 
of tensions, since the misalignments which had built 
up prior to 
the summer of 1992 had been, to a large extent, corrected in the 
remainder of the year. The main factor underlying the recurrent episodes 
of tensions in 
the first half of 1993 was 
the markets' perception that the authorities 
were facing policy dilemmas 
and that the commitment to defend 
the prevailing central rates had weakened. The markets 
saw a potential conflict between, 
on the one hand, the interest rate level consistent 
with low inflation and weak economic 
activity in some countries and, 
on the 
other, the level 
of interest rates needed 
to maintain exchange rate stability in the ERM, given the domestic 
monetary policy requirements in Germany arising from an unbalanced policy 
mix and persisting inflationary pressures after unification. The behaviour 
of market participants, 
which followed a pattern 
of "self-fulfilling attacks", as reflected in 
the serial nature 
of some episodes of tensions, with profits from previous realignments leading to further expected 
profits from 
new attacks, also contributed to fuel tensions. Finally, the credibility 
of the ERM itself had deteriorated as a result 
of the repeated realignments in 
1992-93. The policy responses The interest rate instrument 
was resorted to repeatedly in 1993 to counteract market pressure 
by raising the cost 
of speculative positions. It 
was ineffective in some 
cases, as market participants considered that interest rate increases were creating 
or exacerbating policy dilemmas and 
were therefore regarded 
as unsustainable. This 
was particularly the case in member countries whose economies are 
highly sensitive to short- 
term interest rate increases, owing 
to a more rapid transmission mechanism from official 
to market interest rates. 
Intervention, both intra-marginal and 
at the margins, was undertaken before the 
widening of the ERM bands 
on an 
even larger scale than in 1992. However, despite the 
amounts involved, intervention in several episodes 
of tensions could not 
entirely absorb market pressures and 
may even, on certain occasions, have exacerbated 
them. The widening 
of the ERM fluctuation bands decided 
on 2nd August 1993 aimed at 
restoring a 
two-way risk. This approach 
was deemed to be more appropriate than a 
realignment, since a change 
in ERM central rates was 
not considered to be warranted 
by underlying economic developments 
in the member countries, and would have further 
undermined the credibility of the system. 
The wider fluctuation margins combined with cautious interest rate policies 
were effective in deterring speculative movements. The satisfactory performance 
of the new ERM setting 
was also facilitated by the further gradual easing 
of monetary policy in 
all member countries in 
the autumn of 1993 and 
by the fact that 
the three main factors 
behind the market tensions experienced in 1992-93, namely misaligned real exchange 
rates, an unbalanced policy 
mix in Germany and cyclical divergences in a context 
of decelerating economic activity, had all been eliminated 
by the end 
of 1993. 2.2 Developments in bond markets In 1993 a global decline in long-term bond yields occurred (see Table 
3). During the year, 
the US 10-year bond yield declined 
by 85 basis points while 
the equivalent German yield decreased 
by 140 basis points 
and the 
weighted average 
of EU yields fell 
by 250 basis points. Within the EU bond yield differentials tended to narrow. However, 
inflation expectations 
in the United States turned upwards 
in late 1993 
as commodity prices began to rise while the rate 
of unemployment fell sharply and expectations 
regarding future economic growth 
improved. These patterns contributed to a turning-point 
in US long-term bond yields in October but left European yields initially unaffected. 
Despite this change 
in sentiment in the United States, bond market investors' 
expectations for 1994 were relatively optimistic since the 
US economy continued to 
expand with little evidence 
of inflation, while continental European interest rates 
were expected to decline 
on the basis 
of a weak recovery accompanied by 
low inflation and 
Japanese interest rates were expected 
to remain low as the economy remained 
weak. A number 
of factors underlay the dramatic revision 
of global expectations 
which took place in 
early 1994. First, 
the increase in the federal funds rate from 3 
to 3.25% 
on 4th February 1994 
was perceived as the turning-point 
in the interest rate cycle. Second, 
the breakdown 
of the US-Japanese trade talks in 
early February 1994 and the 
subsequent weakening 
of the dollar increased 
the exchange rate risk 
of holding US 
bonds. Third, the publication 
of revised data 
in March indicating an annualised increase 
of 7.5% in US GDP 
at the end of 1993 may have fuelled expectations that the US 
economy would experience inflationary pressure during 1994. 
All these factors 
contributed to a further sharp decline 
in US bond prices, which had a knock-on effect in 
other bond markets 
- particularly in Europe 
- despite the fact that most 
European countries were behind the United States 
in the business cycle. In 1994 10-year 
US bond yields rose 
by 201 basis points. 
The yield curve differential increased 
by somewhat less, owing to 
the rise in short-term rates as monetary policy was progressively tightened.

Japan Comparable bond yields in the 
EU rose on average by about 
267 basis points 
- albeit varying from country 
to country - and the 
yield curve steepened considerably and 
became positive in countries 
where it previously had 
an inverted slope. Several factors 
may have contributed to the strong correlation 
of yields on the US and European bond 
markets (see Chart 
5). Coupling may have partly reflected the general trend towards the 
growing integration 
of capital markets, large increases 
in cross-border capital flows and 
a greater desire 
for international diversification. More specifically, 
some purchases of European bonds in 1993 
were leveraged at lower US interest rates, while the exchange 
rate risk was 
hedged. When US interest rates 
rose, running such positions became more 
costly and they were often 
unwound. However, although such technical 
or speculative factors may explain the short-term impact 
of increases in US bond rates on European 
ones, they do not explain the persistence of the trend throughout the 
year. A number of factors underlay 
the world-wide rise 
in long-term bond rates 
in 1994 which, in most cases, 
was broadly similar 
in size to the fall 
in 1993. There 
was a general upward movement 
in real interest rates, 
which, in an 
environment of highly integrated financial markets, tended to correlate across 
the world. This trend 
was driven by a continuation of both long-term factors and cyclical developments. The late 1980s

2.01 1.55 period characterised by 
low propensities to save internationally, partly reflecting the 
impact of financial liberalisation 
and deregulation, which reduced 
liquidity constraints on borrowing and entailed a movement 
away from non-price credit rationing to market 
risk assessment. Furthermore, expected returns 
on investment increased 
world-wide, reflecting structural reforms and 
the relatively lower inflation environment in OECD 
countries, economic developments in eastern Europe, Latin America and the 
Far East, 
and the liberalisation 
of international trade. Overall, this contributed to an expected 
imbalance in saving 
and investment. Cyclical factors also played an important role 
in boosting real interest rates. The 
unexpected strength 
of the recovery 
in Europe, vigorous growth 
in the United States and 
a general improvement in the outlook 
for the industrialised countries 
may have 
put upward pressure on real interest rates, reflecting 
an expected future shortage 
of capital. At the same time, 
the high current and relatively high projected government deficits 
fuelled these expectations. Some evidence 
of the overall increase in the real rate 
of interest that 
took place in 1994 is provided 
by yields on index-linked 
UK and Danish bonds, which exclude inflation premia. These 
show an increase 
of around 90 basis points. Apart from an increase in real interest 
rates, two further factors explain 
the overall increase in bond yields and the steepening 
of the yield curve. One 
was the revision of market expectations 
about future inflation. This revision might 
have been partially caused 
by the strength 
of the economic recovery and 
the impact of the projections 
for government deficits. 
In addition to their expansionary influence 
on aggregate demand, large deficits can increase 
the incentive for governments to 
allow inflation to rise 
andlor allow their currencies to weaken. The 
other factor was uncertainty about both expected 
future inflation and the expected real 
rate, which 
typically generates a 
risk premium. The relatively high volatility 
of European bond markets in 1994, indicated 
by measures derived from options prices, suggests that uncertainty 
may have played 
an important role 
in the rise in bond yields. A 
number of influences can be identified. First, 
when econdmies enter a turning-point in the business cycle, uncertainty about both future 
real and inflationary developments tends to increase. Second, 
if inflation is expected to 
be higher in the future, then uncertainty 
about inflation tends also to be higher, reflecting 
past experience 
of the coincidence 
of high and volatile inflation. Third, political uncertainty 
seems to have been a 
key factor in some countries. Finally, as seems 
to have been the 
case in the United States during 
the year, uncertainty 
about the response 
of the monetary authorities to expectations 
of future inflation may also 
have been a causal 
factor. However, expectations 
of an increase in inflation 
in Europe had not materialised 
by the end 
of 1994. Although the economic recovery in 1994 was 
more robust than had 
been originally expected, there 
was no evidence of a general rise 
in inflation, either from 
surveys of agents' expectations in the real 
economy or 
from economic forecasts.

16 - - 16 The explanations provided above relate 
mainly to fundamental 
economic factors and rely to a 
large extent on the assumption that bond markets behave rationally 
at all times and take into account 
all information relevant to 
the valuation of bonds. However, 
bond prices 
can become detached from underlying fundamentals 
for short periods. 
For example, it 
seems likely that 
the sharp reduction 
in bond yields 
in 1993 reflected such a 
partial detachment since extrapolative 
or "chartist" expectations 
of future decreases 
in bond yields became self-fulfilling. 
As mentioned above, the accumulation 
of negative information about bond markets in the United States 
in the early part of 1994 resulted 
in a correction of bond prices which had a knock-on effect 
in European bond markets. It 
may be argued that 
an aspect of this correction 
was that a growing number 
of traders retreated from the markets and that this may in turn 
have led to a sharp increase 
in volatility. 14 12 Although the pattern of European bond yields 
over 1993-94 can to some extent be 
explained by international factors, country-specific factors 
also played an important role, - 1 l,\ V t -l: - . -. I - ,I 1 I I\ ,I X ,, 1 ,l - 14 12 10 4 2 0 - - - 0 4 2 400 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993

1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 
as indicated by the fact that the changes 
in bond yields varied 
among countries. For example, falls 
in yields in 1993 amounted to around four percentage points 
in Spain, Ireland and Italy, and 
over two percentage points 
in Denmark, Greece, France and the 
United Kingdom. In other EU countries the declines were less sizable. 
In 1994 Belgian, German and Dutch long-term bond yields rose by 189, 
213 and 
226 basis points respectively, while those 
in Spain and ltaly rose 
by 367 and 350 basis 
points respectively. Among the 
new entrants, similar yields increased 
in Sweden by 333 
basis points and in Finland 
by 338 basis points. The reasons 
for such 
differences may vary between countries. However, 
in general it appears that the relative increases in most 
countries' bond yields 
in 1994 are largely explicable 
in terms of past inflation 
performance, previous exchange rate developments and 
the evolution of fiscal positions, 
all of which may affect the perceived 
risk to the value of bonds of individual countries. 
Hence, countries such 
as ltaly and Spain 
- as well 
as Sweden and Finland 
- which have relatively high historical inflation rates 
andlor large past devaluations 
or depreciations, and had relatively high fiscal deficits at 
the time, experienced larger increases 
in long- term yields in 1994. Consistent 
with this, countries such 
as Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Germany and France 
- as well as Austria - with better inflation track records, more stable 
exchange rates and lower current fiscal deficits, experienced considerably smaller 
fluctuations in long-term bond yields (see Chart 6).

in European bond yields in 1994 
was closely associated with the assessment 
of economic fundamentals, underlying real rates and increased 
uncertainty, expectations 
of a significant increase 
in future inflation were not supported 
in Europe as a 
whole on the basis 
of price trends, central 
bank forecasts of inflation or surveys conducted 
in the real economy. Allied to this, a dampening influence 
on inflation expectations across 
the Union should have been provided 
by recent structural changes 
in European labour markets to increase real 
wage flexibility, institutional changes in 
some countries towards increased central bank independence, 
and the increasing attention 
paid to 
the maintenance of low inflation. However, the inflation forecasts 
of financial markets seem to have differed from official forecasts 
for some 
countries, reflecting the 
length of time needed to 
earn credibility from financial markets and related concerns 
about fiscal deficits. Finally, non-fundamental factors 
may have played a role, and the 
increased integration 
of capital markets together 
with leveraged trading strategies 
appear to have led to a strong coupling 
of US and European bond 
markets. 2.3 Developments in other asset markets 
In 1993 the 
general trend in European equity market prices 
was upward. By the beginning of 1994, national 
stock market indices 
were either at or near their previously 
recorded highs. This upward trend, which 
was fairly well synchronised across the major 
European stock markets, marked 
the continuation of a pattern which 
was established towards the end of 1992, as troughs 
in economic activity 
and subsequent recoveries 
were foreseen. Strengthening indications 
of economic recovery and an 
upturn in corporate profits were the major factors behind 
the rise, supported by declines in both 
long and short-term interest rates. 
In some countries the increase in equity prices 
was also given further impetus in 1993 
by the depreciation in exchange rates 
which had occurred during the previous 
year. However, 
in the course 
of 1994 the upward trend 
came to 
an end across Europe and prices even declined in a number 
of markets. To some extent, 
the falls may have reflected portfolio balance considerations, as 
higher bond yields require a 
higher return on equity to encourage investors to hold them. That 
said, the scale of the decline in equity prices 
was fairly limited relative to bond prices, 
and in most cases 
only offset rises in 1994 prior to the downturn. Overall, European stock 
markets ended the 
year close to the levels reached at the end 
of 1993. Developments in residential and commercial real estate markets have played a 
major role in the recent 
economic cycle both in a number 
of European countries 
and elsewhere. In particular, the scale 
of the declines recorded 
in nominal property prices 
often had serious implications 
for the financial positions 
of households, property 
companies and banks. In most Member States for which data are available residential 
property prices were stable in 1993-94. However, some increases occurred in 
Denmark and the Netherlands, reflecting country-specific factors. In 
the United Kingdom residential 
property prices stabilised 
in 1993-94 after a large and protracted decline. Stability 
also gradually returned to prices 
in commercial real estate markets in most countries after the 
falls of recent years 
(as measured by property price indices based 
on sales in prime city 
locations). Prices in Spain and the United Kingdom, 
for example, 
showed some growth 
after several years 
of decline. 3. Policy developments 
in the EU As has been 
seen in Sections 1 and 2 above, monetary policy-makers in 
EU countries have experienced increasingly favourable economic conditions 
in 1993-94, while at 
the same time facing difficult challenges posed by developments in foreign 
exchange and bond markets. Moreover, 
the development of fiscal balances remained 
a matter of serious policy concern. Section 
3.1 presents the background on fiscal policy, 
and is followed by assessments 
of monetary policy (Section 
3.2) and the macroeconomic 
policy mix (Section 3.3). The data used 
for fiscal indicators are those provided by the 
Commission in its autumn 1994 
forecast; data for 1994 are estimates. 
3.1 Fiscal policy The early 1990s marked 
a sharp reversal 
of trends in general government deficits 
in the Union. Following 
a prolonged period 
of decreasing deficits, fiscal balances 
deteriorated significantly from 1989 onwards. 
After standing at 5% of GDP in 1992, 
deficits in the Union reached 6% 
of GDP in 1993, 
the highest level 
on record since the 
foundation of the European Community. 
In 1994 the aggregate public deficit came down, 
albeit marginally, 
to 5.6% of GDP (see Table 4). 
Developments in individual countries were broadly 
in line with these overall 
patterns. While in 1993 the 
public deficit rose in nearly 
all Member States, deficits tended 
to fall 
in 1994, although 
not by enough to offset 
the sizable increases 
seen in 1993. Hence developments over the 
two-year period entailed 
for most countries 
a deterioration relative to 
the reference value 
of 3% of GDP laid down by 
the Maastricht Treaty. 
At the same time, substantial cross-country differences in 
deficit/GDP ratios prevailed 
in 1994. At the upper end 
of the range, Greece and 
Italy continued to record 
the largest deficits, 
while the majority of Member States had imbalances 
of around 4 to 6%. Only Germany 
and Ireland had deficits 
of below 3%, while Luxembourg recorded 
a surplus. In assessing recent trends in 
public deficits in greater detail, various estimates 
by international organisations 
of cyclical and structural components 
of the actual budget deficits can 
be used. While serious methodological caveats 
argue for 
a cautious application of such estimates, they can provide useful information, in particular with 
regard to assessing changes in 
the structural balance (as opposed to levels). 
I On the basis 
of recent estimates 
by the Commission of structural deficits in the 
EU, it appears that fiscal developments 
in the Union as 
a whole in 1993-94 were 
predominantly, if not entirely, a reflection of cyclical factors. 
In 1994 the structural deficit 
at the aggregate level 
was virtually unchanged, suggesting that the improvement 
which had taken place 
in the aggregate deficit 
was due to the resumption 
of growth. The 
deterioration of the deficit positions in 
1993, too, seems to have been strongly affected 
by the recession, while structural deficits declined slightly on average. 
Consideration of the structural and cyclical components 
of fiscal deficits raises the 
issue of the extent to which future improvements 
in the fiscal deficits 
of EU countries will be related to the expected continuation 
of economic growth. 
As observed in 1993-94, the 
economic response 
of the government's budget to 
the cycle is rather straightforward, 
functioning through automatic stabilisers. 
In an upturn, these include 
higher direct tax receipts resulting from stronger 
activity as well 
as the reduced need 
to disburse unemployment benefits, and vice versa in 
a recession. However, these effects can

balances are needed not 
only to render 
the fiscal position sustainable, but also to help to 
address long-term problems faced 
by the Member States. In particular, 
the problem of an ageing society puts upward pressure 
on expenditure on, 
for example, pension payments 
and health care, which tends 
to be funded out of current revenue. Given the fact that the 
recession has come to 
an end and economic activity has picked up considerably, 
it appears that overall economic conditions are 
now favourable to fiscal consolidation. 
Continuous efforts towards reducing the size 
of the public sector are 
also desirable. The overall rise 
in deficits since the beginning 
of the decade has 
been General government lending (+)/borrowing

public spending and public 
revenue, which will need 
to be restrained (see Chart 
7). In 1993 total expenditure and receipts 
reached new record levels in 
the Union as a whole, at around 51.5% and 45.5% of GDP respectively. In 1994 the expenditure ratio fell slightly to 
51%, while the level 
of public revenues was maintained. The rise in expenditures in 1993 
was to a large extent 
attributable to a rise 
in public consumption and transfer payments. 
As a consequence, 
the general government primary balance (public deficits before interest payments 
on public debt) deteriorated into a deficit equivalent 
to 0.6% of GDP in 1993 and recovered 
only slightly in 1994. 
Chart 7 Public revenues 
and expenditures in the 
EU (as a percentage of Union GDP) Source: European Commission. 
Revenues - - - - - . Expenditures It is important to add that the figures 
for expenditures and revenues mentioned 
above mask, once 
again, some rather marked divergences between countries. For 
example, in 
1993 increases in expenditure ratios were 
above average in Denmark, 
Greece, Spain, France and Italy, 
whereas in 1994 preliminary estimates suggest that 
there was a decline 
on average, with 
the exception 
of Denmark, Greece, France and 
Portugal. Over the medium 
term however, most EU countries have increased their 
expenditure and revenue ratios substantially, 
and in only a few cases have corrections 
taken place more recently. A long-run tendency towards increasing 
expenditure1GDP ratios will generally be difficult to offset 
by rising revenue ratios, particularly 
in those countries where actual revenue ratios 
are comparatively high. In particular, as 
tax pressures increase there is often increased evasion as well as adverse affects 
on incentives and economic efficiency. 
Overall, it is of concern that the rise in deficits 
was accompanied by a significant 
expansion in public expenditure. This is the cause 
of a number 
of structural rigidities 
in EU economies, which 
in turn contribute 
to reducing competitiveness vis-a-vis 
the rest of the world. 
Against this background, fiscal consolidation 
in most Member States should 
focus primarily on cutting current 
public expenditure rather than 
on further increasing the 
tax burden of the private sector.

1993 1994 As a result 
of the developments highlighted 
above, the gross 
public debt ratio 
of the Union climbed by more than five percentage points to 
66% in 1993, and by almost three percentage points to 69% in 1994 (see Table 
4). The rapid rise 
in the debt ratios 
in both years reflected the large new 
net borrowing requirements 
of the governments 
of Member States, and in 1993 it 
was also boosted 
by the slow growth 
of nominal GDP 
during the recession. However, in some countries special factors such as government 
deposits with central banks and valuation effects related to exchange rate depreciation 
(for debt denominated in foreign currency) should 
be taken into consideration, since they 
accounted for some significant variations in 
the debt ratio. This was particularly the case in Denmark, Greece, 
Spain, ltaly and Portugal. Between 
1992 and 1994 debt ratios 
increased in 
all EU countries except Ireland 
and the Netherlands. In Greece 
the ratio rose 
from 92 to 121%, in ltaly from 108 to 
124%, in Spain from 48 
to 64%, in Denmark from 69 to 78%, in France from 
40 to 50%, in the United Kingdom from 
42 to 50%, and in Germany from 
45 to 51%. Overall, there 
was a tendency for 
those countries (with the 
exception of Luxembourg) with debt ratios below the 60% threshold 
of the Maastricht 
Treaty to approach 
this value rapidly while other countries (with the exception 
of Ireland) with debt ratios well above 60% diverged even 
further. From an analytical point 
of view, the evolution 
of debt ratios depends 
on the differential between nominal GDP growth and the interest rate applying to the stock 
of debt, and 
on the development 
of the primary 
balance. While stronger nominal GDP 
growth and 
lower interest rates 
may help to improve the debt ratio, 
the need for greater efforts to redress 
the primary balance will 
be unavoidable. A sustained imbalance 
in the fiscal policy stance 
of the order 
of magnitude currently observed implies serious risks 
for price stability, as well as 
for potential growth 
in the longer run. A large share of the public sector 
in the economy also creates a less 
favourable environment 
for the pursuit 
of stability-oriented monetary policies. The issue 
of the mix between monetary and fiscal policy is discussed in Section 
3.3. 3.2 Monetary policy 
This section reviews monetary developments in the EU Member States, focusing 
on short-term interest rates, monetary aggregates and 
other monetary indicators. 
Furthermore, account 
is taken of the changes and continuity in monetary policy strategies 
after the widening 
of the ERM fluctuation bands. 
Short-term interest rates For most 
of 1993-94, central banks in the Union continued their policy 
of gradually lowering official 
or key 
interest rates, thus 
allowing short-term market interest rates to 
decline further (see Chart 8). However, in some member countries short-term interest 
rates rose sharply 
for short periods, reflecting the exchange rate tensions discussed 
in Section 2.1. Overall, the process 
of lowering official 
or key interest rates continued until 
the summer 
of 1994. Only Greece and Portugal reduced their official rates later in the 
year from the high levels they had maintained 
in late spring 1994 
when defending their respective currencies against speculative pressures.

or key interest rates were 
only reduced in small successive steps, 
a substantial 
overall reduction has been achieved. The German discount rate, 
for example, was lowered 
by 4.25 percentage points 
from its peak in July 1992 to stabilise at 
a level 
of 4.5% since May 1994. Over the 
two years up to July 
1994, the German rep0 rate fell by 
4.85 percentage points, after which it was maintained 
at a level 
of 4.85% for 
the rest of 1994. In general, and partly as a result 
of the cautious manner 
in which ERM participants 
relaxed their monetary policies, the exchange rate tensions 
of July 1993 that had led to 
the widening of the fluctuation bands 
in August abated. Participating currencies moved 
back within their former intervention limits 
or fluctuated close to their former lower 
bilateral limits against the Deutsche Mark. 
For many 
countries, the restoration 
of stability within the ERM was accompanied by a return to pre-crises short-term interest rate 
differentials vis-a-vis Germany (see 
also Chart 4), as well as by a reduction 
in volatility. Belgian three-month interbank rates increased substantially in the summer 
of 1993, but 
fell sharply afterwards and were 
again equal to German rates towards the end 
of 1994. Dutch short-term rates fluctuated slightly below their German equivalents, but moved up 
to that level 
in mid-1994. French 
money market rates maintained a relatively stable 
differential against their German counterparts 
for most of 1994. At the year-end there 
was some slippage 
of the French franc and an increase 
in the short-term interest rate 
differential caused by political developments. Similar but more pronounced factors 
were responsible for triggering some instability in exchange rates and short-term interest rates 
elsewhere, particularly 
in Spain. Outside the 
ERM, following indications 
of a deterioration in 
the outlook for 
inflation, the central banks 
of Italy and the United Kingdom decided on pre-emptive moves 
to raise their official interest rates in the second 
half of 1994, underlining their commitment to 
achieving and maintaining price stability. 
Monetary aggregates 
During the course 
of 1993-94 there were significant divergences in the pace 
of monetary expansion in individual countries. 
To a substantial degree, 
however, these divergences can be accounted 
for by 
exceptional or temporary factors, most notably 
in Germany and France, where monetary aggregates were distorted in opposite directions. 
This situation complicated 
the conduct of monetary policy 
for those central banks setting 
monetary targets 
or monitoring ranges and 
led some countries to focus on a 
wider variety of indicators. Monetary growth 
in Germany continued to be fuelled 
by rapid credit expansion and 
exceeded the target range 
for most 
of 1993. After a considerable overshoot in 
early 1994, which to a large 
extent was 
caused by changes in tax legislation and rising uncertainty 
in global bond markets, the growth rate 
of M3 decelerated appreciably 
in the following 
months and entered 
the target range towards year-end (see Table 
5). The slowdown of German M3 
was mainly accounted 
for by 
the restructuring of the portfolios 
of non-banks towards long-term bank liabilities 
not included in the target aggregate following the 
normalisation of the yield curve and 
higher long-term interest rates. The fading influence 
of tax-related special factors and outflows 
of capital further contributed to this 
development. Investment 
by the public in Deutsche Mark-denominated 
money market funds (authorised 
in 1994 and 
not included in M3) also played a role.

* Fourth quarter-fourth quarter 
or December-December (UK: March-March). (a) Medium-term object~ve from 1994. (b) Med~um-term reference from 1995. Other countries which had set monetary targets 
or monitoring ranges 
also experienced some difficulties 
in keeping money growth on the right track 
in 1993 and 
1994. In France 
the rate of monetary expansion turned negative 
in the summer 
of 1993 as private households, stimulated by fiscal changes, made substantial transfers from 
short-term financial instruments (in particular investments in 
money market funds 
which are included in French M3) into a special government bond and into shares 
of privatised companies. One of the factors underlying the decline 
in M3 was the stagnation of private credit growth. In the 
course of 1994, growth of M3 accelerated but remained well 
below its medium-term target. Gross total domestic debt was used as a supplementary 
monetary indicator after the beginning 
of 1994. Its growth also decelerated substantially 
in 1994, but due to the strength 
of credit demand from the government it remained 
positive. Germany Greece Spain France Italy Spain 
United Kingdom Money demand 
in Spain was 
fairly volatile in 1993 and 1994 as a result 
of portfolio shifts against 
the background of ongoing financial innovation and increasing uncertainty 
in bond markets. The monetary aggregate 
ALP (liquid assets held 
by the public) exceeded the reference range in both 1993 and 
1994. This was also 
the case 
in ltaly in 1993, partly 
in connection with balance-of-payments surpluses. In the course 
of 1994, broad money M2 growth in ltaly exceeded the target range in 
the first half of the year, but 
showed a sharp deceleration 
in the second half, resulting 
in a fourth-quarter increase 
distinctly below the lower limit 
of the target range 
for the year. In 
the United Kingdom the 
growth rate 
of narrow money (MO) rose well above its monitoring 
range in 1994. This 
can be related 
to past interest rate reductions which brought down 
the opportunity costs 
of holding money and to relatively strong growth 
in retail sales. M4 growth 
in the United 
Kingdom stayed close 
to the middle of its monitoring range. 
After an earlier upward 
trend, monetary growth 
in Greece started to decelerate, moving 
within the target range towards the end 
of the year. Target variable

5.6 When aggregated, the growth 
of broad money (harmonised M3) 
at the Union level gradually decelerated 
in 1993 and stabilised 
at an annual average growth rate 
of just over 5.0% in 1994. This 
slowdown in the rate 
of monetary expansion was accompanied by a 
fall in short-term interest rates and the recovery 
of nominal income growth in the 
Union. These developments, however, have to be seen against the background 
of diverging trends at the individual country level. 
Other monetary indicators 
Short-term real interest rates 
in the Union, measured 
as the difference between the 
short-term nominal market interest rate and 
the past twelve-month rise 
in consumer prices, were 
higher than usual in 
1993 considering the stage reached in 
the business cycle. For the EU as a 
whole they nevertheless came down appreciably from their 
peak of 8% in the autumn 
of 1992 to a low 
of 3.5% in August 1994. A slight increase in short- 
term real interest rates 
was however recorded following 
the strong pick-up 
in economic activity. The yield curve showed a significant turnaround during 1993-94, moving from a 
downward to a more normal upward slope in 
all Member States (with 
the earliest shifts 
being seen in 
Italy and the United Kingdom) although, contrary 
to historical experience, the economic recovery 
in continental Europe set in even before the yield curve had 
turned positive. The turnaround initially reflected 
the gradual easing 
of monetary conditions highlighted above before the sudden surge in long-term interest rates 
took over as the dominant factor. Although in a few countries real estate markets were buoyant, asset prices 
in general were subdued in 1994 and therefore offered few grounds 
for concern about 
inflation (see Section 
2.3). The prices 
of short-term interest rate futures, 
however, indicated more concern about 
the outlook for 
inflation. In the first quarter 
of 1994, three- 
month Euro-Deutsche Mark interest rate futures showed a turnaround 
- reflecting a 
change in expectations from a prospective further relaxation to a tightening 
of German monetary policy. Three-month sterling futures indicated a 
yet more substantial turnaround 
in expected short-term interest rates. Such implicit expectations should be considered 
with caution, however, as these futures contracts seem to overreact to new information 
and may also reflect 
higher risk premia 
in view of increased uncertainty in financial 
markets in general. Change and 
continuity in monetary policy strategies 
After the widening 
of the fluctuation bands 
in the ERM 
on 2nd August 1993 (see 
Section 2.1), the central banks 
of the participating countries had 
in principle the 
opportunity to use the increased room 
for manoeuvre to set monetary policies with less 
emphasis on the exchange rate. This was seen by many commentators 
at the time as 
a solution to the perceived policy dilemma in several countries 
- namely that of having to 
maintain short-term interest rates 
at a level which 
was thought to be 
at variance with weak economic growth and 
low or decelerating inflation, as well 
as being inappropriate 
in the context of the differences 
in monetary transmission processes (see 
Box 2). The 
solution of downgrading the exchange rate as 
a nominal anchor was, however, not generally pursued, thereby confirming that 
the ERM continued to function as 
a co- ordinating framework 
for national monetary policies. Nevertheless, 
some changes in monetary policy strategies occurred 
in several EU countries in 1993-94. 
What has not changed is the final objective 
of monetary policy, namely price 
stability, which is 
a precondition for sustainable economic growth and employment. This 
primary objective may be defined as 
the achievement of an inflation rate that no 
longer distorts the saving 
and investment decisions 
of private agents. 
Within the ERM, the Bundesbank continued 
in 1993-94 to be guided by 
an intermediate money supply target 
for M3. Central banks 
of most participating countries 
adhered to the exchange rate as their key intermediate target 
for achieving the primary 
objective or, in the case of the Banque 
de France, maintained 
an intermediate objective 
both for the external value 
of the currency and the growth rate 
of M3. Some 
other ERM countries had found it useful 
in the past to publish 
an intermediate monetary target 
with the aim of providing additional support for 
the exchange rate objective. More recently, 
however, they were confronted with the question 
of whether and 
how to adapt their 
monetary policy strategies to the deregulation 
of financial markets, the liberalisation 
of international capital flows, increasingly strong 
economic and financial integration, the 
distortions resulting from financial innovations and the 
new ERM setting. Central banks 
of a few larger and less open ERM economies 
have tended to adjust 
their monetary targeting practices, 
or have opted 
for an alternative. From 1994 the 
Banque de France placed its M3 target 
in a medium-term context 
of 5% growth and 
supplemented it with total domestic debt as an important indicator 
of financial conditions. 
In addition, developments in long-term interest rates and 
the balance of payments were taken into account. After the liberalisation 
of cross-border capital flows 
in February 1992 the Banco 
de EspaAa experienced increasing difficulties 
in controlling its central 
monetary aggregate 
ALP. The emergence 
of new financial instruments (primarily mutual 
funds) and frequent portfolio switching by 
the public further added to recent stability 
problems. Under these circumstances it 
was recognised as 
of 1994 that 
ALP could only provide a quantitative reference framework 
for assessing whether monetary conditions 
Box 2 Differences in monetary transmission processes 
A central bank, 
as monopoly supplier 
of base money, is in 
a position to influence 
strongly, if not control, money 
market interest rates 
by determining the conditions at which it 
provides or absorbs liquidity. 
The various channels through which such 
changes in official 
or key interest 
rates are transmitted to output 
and inflation 
together make 
up the monetary transmission process. Whereas there is broad 
similarity between these channels 
in EU countries, transnational differences in transmission 
processes imply that 
a given change in 
the interest 
rate will affect 
prices and output 
across Member States differently over time. 
In Stage Two, differences in transmission 
processes might become a 
source of policy conflicts 
in individual Member States 
if the interest rate 
policy needed to preserve exchange rate 
stability were 
to differ from that 
deemed consistent with domestic policy objectives. They 
will also have important implications for 
a future Monetary Union, as discussed in Chapter 
II. Some important areas 
of divergence between 
Member States concern: the relative importance 
of financing at long-term fixed 
rates versus variable 
or short-term rates; the size and 
composition of balance-sheet positions 
of the non-financial sectors; the degree 
of openness of the economy and 
the importance of 
the exchange rate channel; the speed with which money market 
rates and 
changes in official 
interest rates 
feed through to lending and 
borrowing rates; differences in 
the wage-price mechanism. 
Various problems may arise for monetary policy when 
there are 
divergences in these 
areas. When private 
sector financing 
at short-term or variable rates is 
predominant, monetary policy will have 
a greater impact on an economy for 
a given composition of private 
sector balance sheets. 
In the 
EU, lending at short-term rates 
is of relatively minor 
importance for 
both households and enterprises in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and 
Sweden, and 
to a 
lesser extent Belgium, France and Austria. 
The size and 
composition of private sector balance-sheet positions will 
affect the 
degree to which 
these potential effects actually impinge on behaviour. 
A high proportion of lending linked to short-term 
or variable rates (as 
in the United Kingdom and Ireland) contributes to 
a relatively rapid and pronounced 
pass-through of changes in official 
rates to 
aggregate spending. Even 
if debt is largely long-term 
and fixed rate, high indebtedness 
(as in Sweden) 
may have an effect on transmission. 
If a large proportion 
of public sector 
debt is 
at variable rate or is short-term, as in 
Portugal, Italy and Greece, this implies 
that monetary contraction may relatively rapidly 
be offset by fiscal expansion, as 
long as increased interest 
payments on existing 
debt accrue to 
domestic residents. This effect will vary with public sector indebtedness 
(see Table 
4). But in 
the medium term there may 
be a 
contractionary effect, as rising interest 
payments and 
the threat of a spiral in interest obligations 
forces the 
public sector 
to tighten fiscal policy. 
In this context there is a strong correlation 
between governments' ability to issue long-term fixed 
rate debt and 
past inflation. Moreover, 
a high proportion of debt in 
foreign currency introduces a relation from monetary policy to fiscal policy via 
the exchange rate. 
The degree of openness of 
Member States determines, inter alia, 
the speed and 
magnitude of the pass-through of exchange rate changes provoked by monetary policy 
actions to 
output and inflation. Total openness, and hence sensitivity to external 
developments, is tending to increase in some EU countries in line with 
the process of integration. However, to 
the extent that Member 
States succeed in maintaining stable 
intra- EU exchange rates, differences in 
extra-EU trade 
flows are the 
best measure of the scope 
of difference in transmission via 
the exchange rate. Extra-EU openness is particularly high 
- exports plus imports are over 25% of GDP - in the BLEU and Ireland, and 
is significantly more important in Germany and 
the United Kingdom than in France and Italy. 
Box 2 (Cont'd) Transmission may also differ between 
EU countries since 
the speed with 
which money market rates feed through into bank lending and deposit 
rates varies, and because 
differences in wage-price behaviour affect the degree 
to which changes in excess demand 
arising from monetary policy have an impact on output 
and inflation. While it is relatively easy 
to detect individual differences in structure, 
it is less 
straightforward to assess the extent to which these differences, 
when they 
are aggregated to a 
macroeconomic level, have 
a significant impact on the overall transmission process. 
The most significant result which emerges from 
a comparison of simulations using 
macroeconomic models 
is that, among the four largest Member States, 
the pass-through of changes in official interest rates 
to nominal GDP is faster and stronger in the United 
Kingdom than in Germany, France 
or Italy. But structural breaks in empirical relationships, 
which might change 
or undermine the applicability 
of these results 
to the current situation, 
cannot be ruled out. 
Some of these differences in transmission processes are likely 
to diminish in the coming 
years as 
a consequence of the increasing convergence 
of inflation rates across Member 
States (which 
may, for 
example, encourage long-term 
fixed rate financing), as 
well as effects of growing international competition 
and financial integration (which 
may make the 
pass- through from money market 
rates to 
bank lending 
rates more uniform). In addition, there 
have been various institutional changes affecting financial markets and labour markets 
recently which may also increase convergence (on labour markets, see 
Box 1). But some 
differences in openness and in net asset positions, most notably those arising from 
differences in agents' preferences, are likely 
to persist. were compatible 
with progress towards price stability. 
As of 1995 the 
Banco de 
Espaiia replaced its monetary target 
by a direct inflation objective 
for the medium term (see Table 
6), while reaffirming its exchange rate commitment and continuing 
to examine various 
complementary indicators, among which 
ALP has a prominent position. Finally, 
with effect from the beginning 
of 1993 some smaller 
open economies such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal chose 
to abandon 
their respective intermediate targets 
for (the domestic counterpart 
of) monetary expansion.

to redefine their 
monetary policy strategies in 
a more fundamental 
way, trying to find 
new ways to convey their commitment 
to price stability to the public. 
To this end, 
the UK monetary authorities 
developed a monetary policy framework centred around 
a direct inflation objective (see 
Table 6). Interest rate decisions are based on 
a careful assessment 
of the medium-term 
outlook for 
inflation, taking account 
of the information contained 
in all available indicators, 
including narrow and broad monetary aggregates (for which monitoring ranges are set), 
the effective exchange rate and asset prices. 
In Italy, a quantitative monetary target 
gained importance 
after the floating of the lira, although it was monitored in combination 
with other indicators, notably a credit aggregate and the exchange rate. However, against 
the background of recent turbulence 
in credit and financial markets affecting 
M2 growth and making its interpretation more tenuous, 
the Banca d'ltalia decided to announce 
for 1995 a central reference target 
for M2, of 5%, and to use 
a variety of indicators of future inflationary pressures, with the exchange rate continuing to 
play an important role. 
The Bank of Greece set an intermediate target 
for the expansion of M3, consistent 
with a declining rate 
of inflation. In addition, it followed 
a non-accommodating exchange 
rate policy, allowing effective depreciations 
only partially to compensate 
for higher 
inflation against foreign competitors. Following 
the gradual liberalisation 
of capital movements, which 
was completed in May 1994, 
the exchange rate target 
was given 
more weight, while less emphasis was placed on the monetary target. 
Of the new entrant countries, Austria has traditionally maintained 
a close link 
with the Deutsche Mark as its nominal anchor, whereas Sweden and Finland announced 
explicit inflation targets after the decision to float their currencies. 
Appropriateness of monetary policies in the EU The appropriateness 
of the monetary policy stance cannot 
be assessed adequately 
on a Union-wide basis 
alone, but requires individual country analyses. The reasons 
for this are straightforward. First, national central banks remain responsible 
for their own monetary policy stance in Stage Two. Second, besides cyclical differences, structural 
differences between 
EU countries - which, for example, affect monetary transmission 
mechanisms (see 
Box 2) - continue to exist and 
are likely to 
be reduced only very 
gradually. For 
the time 
being, central banks 
will thus be confronted 
with different operating environments. 
In Germany, 
economic conditions in 1993-94 were 
such that the Bundesbank could 
carry forward its policy 
of carefully reducing official 
and key interest rates, which 
it had initiated in September 1992. The improving 
outlook for inflation 
- to which 
a strong Deutsche Mark, 
the prospect of fiscal consolidation and 
the conclusion of moderate wage agreements contributed 
to a considerable extent 
- provided the major justification 
for this. Furthermore, the steady decline in German long-term interest rates in 1993 and 
early 1994 seemed to confirm that financial markets were confident that, 
over the longer term, inflation would come 
down. Although the growth rate 
of M3 exceeded the target range for 
a long period 
of time, a substantial part 
of this overshooting 
was considered to 
be a 
temporary phenomenon related to various exceptional factors, and not to indicate 
higher future inflation. Nevertheless, given 
the difficulty of assessing underlying monetary 
conditions, a cautious approach to interest rate policy was warranted so as not to 
endanger credibility and not 
to add 
to uncertainty in financial markets. 
In retrospect, the 
Bundesbank succeeded both 
in reducing monetary expansion to target levels and in 
bringing inflation down 
to a lower level, while maintaining the credibility 
of its monetary 
targeting strategy 
and not endangering the economic 
recovery. There is some evidence that 
other EU central banks have gained credibility 
in financial markets during the past 
two years in terms of their determination to maintain 
an anti-inflationary policy stance. In 
the latter part 
of 1993 and early 1994 central banks 
of ERM countries carefully reduced official and key interest rates and managed to bring 
down short-term interest rate differentials relative to Germany while avoiding major 
exchange rate tensions 
for much of 
the period. Besides 
the progress made in the 
convergence of inflation rates, the synchronised nature 
of the economic upswing also seems to have played a favourable role in this regard. 
On the 
other hand, 
a few brief 
periods of exchange rate instability have occurred, typically related to domestic political 
uncertainties, which temporarily pushed 
up short-term interest rate differentials. 
Furthermore, long-term interest rate differentials vis-a-vis Germany tended to rise in the 
course of 1994, indicating among 
other factors the persistence 
of underlying economic 
problems (see Section 2.2). 
Outside the ERM, the monetary authorities 
of the United Kingdom 
have increased their credibility, following the resolution with which they raised interest rates twice in 1994 
to avert inflationary dangers. 
As already noted, in weighing the risks for inflation, the UK monetary authorities make use 
of a wide range of indicators, combining them into 
an inflation projection 
for the following two years based 
on an 
assumption of unchanged policies. When this projection revealed 
an increasing likelihood 
of an overshooting of the target range set 
for the end of the current Parliament 
(1-2.5%), early steps in raising 
official short-term interest rates 
were judged to 
be warranted - even though the prevailing 
rate of inflation was at its lowest level 
for 27 years. In Italy monetary policy 
was also tightened following indications 
of a pick-up in inflation. Just as 
in Greece, the monetary 
authorities also had to carry 
the burden of fiscal imbalances that 
seriously disturbed the appropriate policy 
mix. To summarise, the uncertainty created by the ERM turmoil 
of 1992-93 had made it 
essential that monetary policy should continue to provide a credible 
anchor for 
nominal stability. Interest rate policy thus had to 
be carried out in a cautious manner, without 
taking undue risks, especially because it remained unclear 
in many countries whether fiscal policy and wages would follow the same stability-oriented course. 
The,restoration of stability within the ERM, in combination 
with the substantial slowdown in the rate of inflation across the Union, 
may be seen as prima facie evidence that the course 
of monetary policies 
in individual countries and 
in the Union as a whole was 
broadly appropriate. Section 
4.1 of this chapter reconsiders the concept 
of appropriateness in a 
forward-looking sense. 
3.3 The macroeconomic policy mix 
The maintenance 
of price stability requires the co-operation and support 
of fiscal policy so as to create a balanced policy mix. 
In this context, 
the task of the monetary 
authorities in recent years has 
not been an easy 
one, and has been complicated 
by increasing public deficits and high public debt 
in many Member States. 
First, persistently high public borrowing requirements could generate doubts about 
the sustainability of a non-accommodative monetary policy stance, leading to 
expectations of increased inflation and exchange rate depreciation. It 
is possible that 
such expectations induce economic agents to incorporate these into prices and 
wage negotiations. Second, rising public debt as a result 
of such deficits puts a strain on capital 
markets and makes fiscal positions increasingly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, 
rendering the task of central banks more difficult. 
Fiscal policy in the Union created an environment in 
the early 1990s which 
was not conducive to price stability. Given the lack 
of progress in fiscal consolidation 
monetary policy was overburdened. Central banks had no option but to maintain a 
non- accommodative stance, setting higher levels 
of short-term interest rates 
for much longer than would have been the case had fiscal policy been more supportive. In retrospect, the 
unbalanced policy 
mix kept inflation too high 
for too long 
and has certainly not 
been optimal for economic growth. If confidence 
in the monetary policy framework had 
been combined with a more supportive fiscal policy, the results 
for inflation and activity might 
have been better.

EU Member States Austria, Finland and Sweden joined

EU countries, growth in the Austrian economy picked up 
in 1994 
after stagnation in 1993, while consumer price inflation decreased. Compared 
with those in the 
other new entrant countries, public finances in Austria seem less unbalanced, though further 
improvement is necessary in order to meet the reference values 
of the Maastricht Treaty 
criteria on public finances. 
The Finnish 
and Swedish economies are recovering from severe recessions and 
experienced positive growth rates 
in 1994 
after declines in output in the preceding years. 
The severity of the Finnish recession was largely due 
to the loss of export markets 
stemming from 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. In both countries export growth has helped 
the economy out 
of recession after substantial depreciations 
of the exchange rate. 
Substantial public deficits emerged in 
both countries as 
a consequence of unemployment benefits acting as automatic stabilisers. In Sweden, 
the tax reform plan passed by 
Parliament in 1989190, which came into full effect from 1991, contributed 
to the increase in 
deficits. Fiscal deficits have, during recent years, led 
to marked rises in public debt in 
Finland and Sweden. 
At the beginning 
of the 1990s a banking crisis 
and financial support by 
the governments also contributed to the increase in public debt. Furthermore, long-term 
interest rates 
in Finland and Sweden were above the 
EU average in 1994 despite 
the low inflation rates. Inflation in Sweden reached 
a trough in spring 1994. To counteract rising 
inflationary pressures, Sveriges Riksbank raised official interest rates in the autumn 
of 1994. In Finland, Suomen Pankki raised its tender rate in December 
1994 by 50 basis points. 
All the new EU countries have become members 
of the European Monetary System, 
but only Austria has decided 
to enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism with effect from January 
1995. The Austrian schilling has demonstrated 
a high degree of exchange rate stability sustained for 
a long period vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark. Finland 
and Sweden abandoned the 
policy of pegging their currencies 
to the 
ECU in 
the autumn of 1992 after 
a period of severe pressure on the Finnish markka 
and the 
Swedish krona. Following the decision 
to float their 
currencies, the authorities 
in both countries adopted 
a new monetary policy framework 
based on inflation targets, without the exchange 
rate as an intermediate target. 
Owing to the present macroeconomic imbalances in 
the Finnish and the 
Swedish economies, the 
authorities in 
the respective countries have decided 
to postpone their participation 
in the ERM. The enlargement 
of the EMS and ERM membership 
did not lead to any 
change in the existing parity 
grid or in the composition 
of the ECU basket (the 
latter being fixed under the 
Treaty). 4. Prospects and challenges 
In making 
an assessment of the factors 
likely to influence monetary policies in 
1995 it is important to consider the broad macroeconomic prospects 
for 1995, and the 
appropriate monetary policy 
for the EU as 
a whole in 
the light of these, before going 
on to assess the main challenges 
- namely the risks to the central forecasts, the maintenance 
of exchange rate stability, bond market developments and fiscal 
policy issues. It should be noted that this part, too, 
mainly refers to the Community 
of twelve when reference is made to the Union 
or EU. Background information regarding the 
new entrants is provided 
in Box 3. 4.1 Prospects Short-term economic prospects According to the latest 
economic forecasts from the European Commission, the 
OECD and 
the IMF, real 
economic developments outside the 
Union are likely to continue to provide 
a favourable stimulus to 
the economic recovery in 
Europe. Output in 
the United States is expected to 
grow by around 
3% in 1995, while at the same time the 
Japanese economy is gradually 
entering a period of recovery, with growth forecast to pick up to 
2.5% in 1995. It is 
not yet clear-whether or to what extent the economic damage caused 
by the Kobe earthquake will retard 
the recovery. In other regions, notably South-East 
Asia, a continuation of growth is also anticipated. World trade is expected to 
grow by 6%. As regards external influences 
on inflation, continued price increases in all categories 
of traded goods are foreseen. The impact 
of these developments 
on prices in 
the Union will also depend on the pattern 
of exchange rates in 1995.

Economic prospects 
for EU countries 
in 1995 must also be viewed against the 
increasingly favourable background 
of trends in 1994, with economic activity accelerating 
and the rise 
in rates of unemployment coming 
to an end. 
Real GDP Investment '"l Employment GDP deflator 
General government deficit 
Ib' Current account 
Ib' According to forecasts 
by the European Commission, 
the IMF and 
the OECD (see 
Table 7), activity in 
1995 is expected to 
pick up throughout the 
EU-12, with real 
GDP growth averaging nearly 
3%. A marked synchronisation 
of growth is forecast; 
only in 
Ireland and Denmark (as well as in Finland) 
is activity expected to 
grow somewhat faster than on average, while 
in Greece a continuation of relatively slow growth is anticipated. 
As regards the composition of growth, net trade - largely growth in exports 
- is expected to continue to provide 
a major impetus. With business sentiment improving steadily, 
investment activity is expected to expand strongly 
in 1995. Private consumption, 
which was subdued in 1994, is 
likely to 
be more buoyant given that consumer confidence 
has improved in recent months 
and the increase in unemployment rates has come 
to a halt. On the 
other hand, consumption may be adversely affected by tax 
increases already announced or due to come into force in many countries. 
1996 Reflecting the 
dominance of external demand, both trade and current 
account balances of the Union as 
a whole are 
expected to improve further in 1995. 
Among the individual countries, the most notable improvement in the current account balance 
in 1995 is anticipated in Italy; some deterioration is, however, forecast 
in Denmark, reflecting particularly strong growth in domestic demand. 
EC 3.2 6.3 1 .l 3.0 -3.9 0.6 1995 In the Union as 
a whole, a slight deceleration 
in inflation to 
just below 3% is anticipated from 1994 to 
1995. As for 
real growth, 
a further convergence 
of inflation rates is expected: forecasts 
suggest that inflation will be in 
a range of around 2-3% in 
most OECD 3.2 5.9 1 .l 2.6 -4.2 0.6 EC 2.9 5.7 0.8 2.8 -4.7 0.5 OECD 3.0

and to a lesser extent Spain, 
Italy and Portugal, will be the main 
exceptions. A key factor contributing to the central projection 
for inflation is expected to be 
wage behaviour. Although some pick-up 
in wage inflation and unit labour costs is 
expected in 
1995, increases in most countries are likely to remain significantly below 
those recorded in previous recoveries. In most countries, reductions 
in unemployment rates and positive employment growth are anticipated in 
1995. However, levels 
of unemployment are expected to remain well above those seen 
at this stage in former 
recoveries, which is an indication 
of the rise in the level of structural unemployment 
in the interim. Moreover, there are significant risks 
for inflation, as discussed 
below. The following sections assess monetary policy in the context 
of the above- mentioned projections. 
Monetary objectives in individual countries A number 
of announcements have been made regarding the intermediate targets 
and final objectives 
of monetary authorities in 1995. In the context 
of the respective national monetary policy frameworks, all 
of the announcements aim to 
underpin the objective of price stability, both in the presence 
of the resumption of economic growth 
and in the medium term. 
Among the ERM countries, 
the Bundesbank announced a target 
for German M3 
of 4-6%, identical to that adopted 
for 1994, which is considered to 
be compatible with potential growth 
and price stability. The target assumes a normative inflation rate 
of 2%, together with 2.75% 
growth in productive potential and a 
1% fall in trend velocity. The target also seeks to offset most 
of the excessive monetary growth that occurred 
over 1994 on average. In addition to 
its ERM commitments, the Banque 
de France set a medium-term objective 
of 5% growth for French M3 and a ceiling 
of 2% inflation both 
for 1995 and 
in the medium term. The Banco 
de Espaiia, while reaffirming its commitment 
to exchange rate stability, has set an inflation objective 
of below 3% to be achieved by 1997. Other ERM countries intend to 
rely exclusively on the exchange rate 
to ensure price stability. 
Of the non-ERM countries, the authorities in 
the United Kingdom 
have reaffirmed their inflation objective 
of 1 -4%, with the intention 
of it being in the lower 
half of this range by April 1997 at the latest, and 
the Banca d'ltalia will set monetary policy to 
seek to attain 
the Government's inflation target 
for 1995, 
which was set at 
2.5% at the end 
of September 1994. 
If there are signs 
of inflationary pressures emerging 
in Member States as growth 
rates pick up, and given 
the lags in the response 
of the economy to 
monetary policy, it is 
important that monetary policy 
be tightened at an early stage. This applies 
to all Member States; particular vigilance 
is required in those where inflation 
is relatively high and hence 
convergence is incomplete. 
The mutual compatibility of national monetary 
policies and conditions in the 
Union For countries which attach priority to stable exchange rates, national 
monetary policies may be seen as compatible 
if they contribute 
to convergence towards price 
stability without major exchange rate pressures arising. 
For other countries, it appears 
more relevant to define national monetary policies 
as compatible if they promote 
convergence towards price stability. 
According to these criteria, monetary policy objectives 
may be considered to be 
broadly compatible 
in 1995. Nevertheless, 
at the time 
of writing, some cyclical differences 
continue to exist. Some countries are more advanced in 
the cycle than others. Over and 
above that, some economies started the recovery with a narrower output 
gap than others 
and with 
higher market interest rates. 
At the present juncture, structural differences probably pose a greater threat to 
mutual compatibility than cyclical 
ones. Indeed, structural differences across Member 
States (in public and private debt levels and debt structures, unemployment rates, 
inflation rates, 
etc.) imply different environments 
for national central banks to operate 
in (see Box 2). In this context, adverse developments such as a lack 
of fiscal consolidation 
in countries 
in a critical fiscal situation could affect exchange rate stability for those 
countries. In 
the longer term, mutual compatibility 
may be more readily attainable as structural convergence proceeds. 
As regards the implications 
of the rise 
in long-term yields during 1994 
for mutual compatibility, the impact of a given change 
in long-term rates differs across countries, 
again depending on 
the financial structure 
of the economies. Some countries where the 
rise in bond yields has been particularly strong have private sectors 
whose long-term fixed rate borrowing is relatively limited, thus 
the importance of higher yields 
is limited. 
This is 
the case in Spain and Italy. Nevertheless, a more pronounced differentiation 
of long-term interest rates across countries might become a source 
of compatibility problems, since it could adversely affect investment and potential output 
in the medium 
term, as well 
as complicate fiscal consolidation, particularly in countries 
with high stocks 
of public debt. 
4.2 Challenges for the future 
Inflationary risks in 
the economic outlook 
The central forecast 
for inflation appears favourable given 
the strength of the upturn. This is to some extent related to the previous recession, 
which had caused 
significant output gaps to emerge 
in several countries. 
In some countries, actual GDP 
growth is expected to be below 
or only 
slightly above potential growth in 1995, 
which would imply that 
the output gap 
is closing only slowly. In other countries, the output gap 
seems to 
be rather small already. However, an exact assessment 
of the amount 
of slack is difficult. Potential output 
may have 
been adversely affected 
by the rise 
in structural unemployment and low 
investment; furthermore, price increases might 
also result from 
bottlenecks in individual sectors 
of the economy. Countervailing factors arguing against 
concern over output gaps 
may be that flexibility 
in the use of capital is greater than in the 
past. The behaviour of wages is an important element 
of uncertainty in the inflation 
outlook. After two years 
of modest wage rises there is a risk 
of stronger wage pressure in the wake 
of the economic upturn. On 
the other hand, unemployment is high and in some 
countries wage flexibility 
may have 
increased as a consequence 
of recent agreements 
between the social partners 
andtor labour market reforms. 
The successful pursuit 
of stability-oriented policies may also 
be jeopardised in other respects by the functioning 
of the labour market. There is widespread evidence that 
the level of structural unemployment has continued 
to rise in recent years, implying that 
the cyclical upswing will 
only be able to resolve a part 
of the unemployment problem. 
Consequently, although unemployment rates are 
high, a continuation 
of moderate wage increases cannot 
be taken for granted as economies could rapidly 
hit bottlenecks or meet skills shortages. Moreover, 
if a large proportion 
of unemployment were to persist in a 
boom this could also risk losing public support 
for policies which 
aim at achieving and 
maintaining price stability. The solution to 
the structural unemployment problem calls 
for supply-side measures which mainly address labour market rigidities. Progress in this 
area is vital in order 
to ensure price stability. 
There are further risks 
for inflation prospects in countries 
whose currencies have depreciated in recent 
years. So far, the effect 
of recent changes 
in exchange rates 
on domestic consumer prices has been smaller than could have been expected on 
the basis of past experience. 
However, as the depreciation 
of exchange rates has led to a 
reduction in real incomes, there 
is a risk that those who have lost 
out will attempt to 
use the more favourable economic climate to restore their income 
positions. Upward inflationary pressure may also come from developments outside the 
Union. For example, the rise in commodity prices could become a serious source 
of concern. Maintenance of exchange rate stability 
in the ERM The widening 
of the exchange rate bands in August 1993 
has served the desired objective of reducing the incidence 
of "one-way bets" on exchange rates, inducing instead 
a two-way risk 
for speculators. As the convergence of inflation towards low levels 
makes further progress, ensuring that competitive positions 
do not get sharply out 
of line, this will 
be the 
best guarantee 
of limiting exchange rate tensions in the future. Moreover, the 
expected close convergence in growth rates 
in 1995 will reduce tensions between 
economies growing more slowly and those undergoing rapid growth 
- tensions which 
in 1992 caused a conflict 
of internal and external objectives 
for some countries in 
the former group. More generally, 
the progress of sustained convergence and optimism regarding 
the economic outlook increases the perceived consistency 
of economic polic,~. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that there have been periods 
of exchange rate tension, in particular during late 1994. These have illustrated the fact that markets 
are alert to any perceptions 
of policy conflict, notably 
in countries with high public 
debt andlor political uncertainties. 
Monetary policy implications 
of bond market developments 
Following the discussion in Section 
2.2, the policy implications to 
be drawn for 1995 from recent bond market developments depend 
on the extent to which rises 
in long-term nominal yields were caused by increasing inflation expectations, 
higher real interest rates 
or rising uncertainty. 
In most 
EU countries, it appears that the general rise in bond yields does not 
signal an immediate upturn 
in inflation, and 
hence a monetary policy response 
would be inappropriate. However, in countries where the risks 
of inflation are more immediate, 
a tighter monetary stance is required. 
The rise 
in long-term interest rates 
is probably partly 
a reflection of the increase in world real interest rates due to more favourable growth prospects 
at a global level and 
hence does 
not seem 
to require policy 
action. However, to the extent that the rise in real 
interest rates at 
a national level also reflects a crowding-out effect arising from current 
and planned government deficits, there 
is a clear risk of burdening the 
economic recovery currently under 
way and stifling future prospects 
for growth. Cross-country differences 
in changes in bond yields are considered 
to indicate important concerns 
in the markets, particularly 
about fiscal positions, as 
well as an increased focus 
on relative long-term records 
of exchange rate and price stability. 
Besides the crowding-out effect noted above, the principal concern 
in terms of fiscal policy appears 
to have 
been heightened uncertainty 
over the sustainability 
of fiscal positions and related fears 
of an easing 
of the counter-inflationary stance. The implication 
of these patterns is that 
the appropriate response 
to higher 
yields is fiscal tightening. 
To reduce uncertainty, monetary policy 
must be geared to ensuring the long-term credibility 
of the counter-inflationary framework. 
Fiscal policy perspectives According to Commission estimates, the average fiscal deficit in the 
Union fell by 
0.4 percentage points 
in 1994 to 
5.6%. In 1-995 reductions in actual deficits are expected 
in virtually all Union countries, bringing the 
EU average to 
4.7%, although only a few countries will meet the 
3% reference value (see Table 
8). The improvement 
in 1995 will stem largely from cyclical factors, 
but some structural improvements are also anticipated. 
Despite this, structural deficits will probably remain high 
in many countries, and 
longer- term projections suggest that actual public deficits in several countries will remain at 
very high levels despite the maturing 
of the recovery. On average, debt ratios are 
likely to worsen, to 
73% of GDP in 1995, compared with 69% in 1994. Meanwhile, 
if the current 
pattern of real interest rates and growth rates 
is maintained, the objective 
of stabilising or reducing debt ratios might 
be harder to achieve, particularly in countries 
with exceptionally high levels 
of outstanding debt. 
Fiscal policy 
will play a crucial role 
in ensuring the durability 
of a non-inflationary recovery. There is 
a clear need 
for governments in the EU to take determined structural 
budget adjustment measures, 
but there is 
a risk that consolidation efforts 
may not 
materialise in 
a period in which the cyclical upswing tends to reduce actual deficits. The 
experience of the late 
1980s, when many 
governments effectively loosened fiscal policy 
in the face of strong economic growth, 
must be seen as 
a lesson in this respect. Progress 
towards fiscal consolidation is 
not only needed to bring budgets back onto 
a sustainable path and help to restore acceptable levels 
of public debt 
but also to 
help reduce bond 
yields. Such progress is 
also essential towards checking inflationary pressures in 
a cyclical phase 
in which activity approaches potential. Without continued efforts to reduce 
the structural part 
of the fiscal balance, 
no lasting progress can be made towards 
a viable fiscal position and 
a more balanced policy 
mix in the Union as 
a whole. Fiscal consolidation is 
all the more important in those countries 
where monetary policy 
is already overburdened. In this respect, 
it is of major importance that the commitments 
included in convergence programmes 
be respected and that more attention 
be paid to the Table 8

of potential inflationary 
pressures and helping 
to guarantee sustainable growth 
for European economies.

1. The role 
of the EM1 in assessing convergence 
The Treaty establishing 
the European Community requires 
the countries entering Economic and Monetary Union to have fulfilled 
in advance the necessary conditions for 
the adoption 
of a single currency. Under the Treaty, 
the EM1 is assigned an important 
role in the assessment of convergence. Article 
109j (1) provides that 
the EM1 and the Commission shall 
each prepare a report to the 
EU Council, focusing particularly 
on the achievement of a high 
degree of sustainable convergence 
by reference to the following criteria: "the achievement 
of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of 
inflation which is close to that 
of, at most, the three best-performing Member States 
in terms of price stability; 
the sustainability 
of the government financial position; this 
will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive, 
as determined in accordance with 
the Treaty; the observance 
of the normal fluctuation margins provided 
for by the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, 
for at least two years, 
without devaluing against the currency 
of any other Member State; 
the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State and 
of its participation 
in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System being reflected 
in long-term interest rate levels". 
The reports 
of the Commission and the 
EM1 shall also take account 
of the development of the ECU, the results of the integration of markets, the situation and development of the balances 
of payments on current account 
and an examination of the development of unit labour costs and other price indices. 
The report 
of the EM1 will assess the convergence 
of individual countries 
and will be submitted in the course 
of 1996. In addition, under Article 7 of its Statute, once a 
year the EM1 shall address a 
report to the EU Council 
which shall, inter 
alia, include an assessment 
of the progress towards convergence in the Community. This Annual Report 
of the EMI, in addition to the 
requirements of Article 11 of the Statute, also fulfils the 
obligations of Article 7 and thus 
addresses issues 
of convergence. It is seen as a first step 
by the EM1 towards the 
preparation of a fully-fledged Article 
7 report, forthcoming later this 
year. The main text 
of this section draws on the analyses 
of prices, fiscal developments, 
exchange rates and long-term interest rates provided in previous sections, and puts 
them into perspective 
in terms of the issue 
of convergence. Data are summarised in Table 
9. Other factors to be taken into account in the assessment 
of the degree 
of sustainable convergence will be considered 
in future Article 
7 reports. As the new Member States 
joined the Union 
on 1 st 
January 1995, this section 
on convergence in 
1993-94 focuses exclusively on the then twelve EU countries. While 
the statistical data for a final 
assessment of convergence in the report required under Article 
109j (1) will 
be provided by the Commission, this 
Report uses data from several sources, which are 
of a non- definitive nature, but 
are considered to approximate to 
the function required. In 
addition, in order 
to clarify these and 
other issues 
in more 
detail, boxes are used 
to highlight the legal background, statistical questions 
and issues for 
further consideration in 
the light of the provisions 
of the Treaty on convergence. Table 9 Economic indicators

in the Treaty and the Protocol are 
discussed separately 
in this Report, it 
should be stressed that they constitute a coherent 
and integrated package. 
By the time 
of their formal application, they must 
be satisfied in their totality, without trade-offs among individual provisions. The individual criteria should 
be interpreted and applied in a strict manner. 
Thus, they will help to strengthen overall 
monetary and economic policy co-operation in Stage Two, and prepare for a 
stability- oriented single monetary policy in Stage Three. 
2. Price stability 2.1 Inflation rates in 1993-94 
As shown in Table 
9, the annual average inflation rates 
of each of the three 
best- performing countries in the 
Union, in both 1993 and 
1994, were maintained at levels 
close to those generally regarded as price stability, 
viz. inflation rates 
of 2% or less. In 1993, these countries 
were Denmark, Ireland and the United 
Kingdom,' which had 
inflation rates ranging between 
1.3 and 1.6%. In 1994, France, 
Denmark and Luxembourg recorded the lowest 
rates, within a range 
of 1.6 to 2.1 %. Several Member States came close to 
the inflation rates 
of these best-performing 
countries. In 1993 they 
were France, the Netherlands and Belgium, with inflation rates 
of between 2.1 and 2.8%. In 1994 they were Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom, which had inflation rates of around 
2.5%, followed by Germany with an 
inflation rate 
of 3%. In the four countries which evidently still have most to catch up in terms 
of price stability, inflation rates have come down considerably in the past few 
years. In Italy, the rate of inflation 
has decreased continuously since 
1990, reaching 4.3% in 
1993 and 3.9% 
in 1994, while in Spain the average inflation rate remained somewhat above 
4.5% in both 
years under consideration. Portugal has reduced 
its inflation rate by more than 
half over 
the past four years to reach 
6.5% in 1993 and 
5.2% in 1994. Greece has 
also made progress, but still recorded double-digit inflation (1 
4.5% in 1993 and 
10.8% in 1994). 2.2. Assessment 
of price stability 
Overall, the process 
of convergence towards price stability has made marked 
headway over the past two 
years. As 
discussed in 
Part A, one important factor in 
explaining this favourable performance is certainly the recession. Demand pressure 
was weak and wage growth 
was moderate, and particularly in 
the course of 1994 substantial 
productivity gains could 
be achieved. These developments were sufficiently strong to 
counteract inflationary impulses stemming from substantial depreciations 
of currencies in 
several countries. A further, perhaps even more important factor, however, is the 
significant change in economic policy thinking. Price stability is 
now considered to 
be one of the major objectives 
of economic policy in general, and the primary objective 
of monetary policy in particular. It should 
be noted, however, that the average inflation rate 
1 Based on 
the Retall Price Index 
(RPI). The measure excluding 
mortgage interest 
payments (RPIX), which is closer to the 
harmonised definition of consumer 
prices currently under 
consideration, rose 
by 3.0% 
in 1993 
and 2.4% in 1994. 
Box 4 Price stability 1. Legal basis 
The Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 
109j (1) requires: 
the price criterion to be judged on the basis of the relative inflation performance, which 
is "close to that 
of, at most, the three best-performing 
Member States in 
terms of price stability"; The Protocol (No. 6) on 
the convergence criteria referred 
to in Article 109j (1) of the Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 1, stipulates: "The criterion on price stability 
referred to in the 
first indent 
of Article 109j (1) of this Treaty shall mean that a Member State 
has a price performance that is 
sustainable and 
an average rate of inflation, 
observed over a period 
of one year before 
the examination, that does not exceed by 
more than 
1% percentage points that 
of, at most, the three best- performing Member 
States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the consumer price index 
(CPI) on a comparable 
basis, taking into account differences in 
national definitions". 
2. Statistical questions 
Even though methodologies for calculating consumer 
price indices in 
the EU countries 
share a number 
of common features, 
there are 
also important differences. Before formally assessing which countries fulfil 
this criterion it is 
necessary to make significant progress with 
the work 
undertaken by 
the European Commission (EUROSTAT) in order 
to develop harmonised consumer 
price indices which 
are comparable at a 
Union level, with 
the assistance of its Working 
Party on the harmonisation of consumer prices. This work is 
carried out in 
close liaison with 
the EMI. To this 
effect the 
Commission has submitted to 
the EU Council 
a proposal for 
a Regulation. Depending on 
further progress, Member States 
would, in principle, 
be able to 
compile the first harmonised twelve-month CPI data 
for January 1997. For 
the reports 
by the Commission and the EM1 in the course 
of 1996 
an interim solution is envisaged, which will allow 
the reports to draw on 
figures which are harmonised to 
the largest extent possible using available data. For 
the time 
being, comparisons made in this section 
are based 
on national CPls. 3. Issues for further consideration 
The wording in Protocol 
(No.6) Article 1, does not unambiguously define 
to which reference 
value the inflation criterion 
should apply, as 
it mentions the notion of "at most, the three best-performing countries". In addition, the wording raises the issue 
as to how the "sustainability" of price performance is to 
be assessed. in the European 
Union of around 3% was still above that regarded 
as being consistent 
with price stability. 
In order 
to strengthen the credibility of policies geared towards attaining this 
objective, the achievements of the past must 
be maintained 
and enhanced in the 
future. As the economies of the EU countries 
are recovering, the 
risks of inflationary pressures could increase and progress towards 
lower inflation rates may be considerably more 
difficult to achieve than in the recent past. Therefore, 
it is important for 
the social partners 
to agree on wage 
settlements which do not 
jeopardise price stability, 
for companies 
to continue adjustment efforts to improve productivity 
growth, and for fiscal policies 
to exploit fully the 
opportunity of the economic upswing to take structural measures to reduce the deficit, rather 
than to rely 
on cyclical improvements in fiscal balances 
or on 
increasing the 
burden of indirect taxation, 
thereby affecting inflation 
expectations. The period 
ahead, therefore, will be 
a test 
of the ability of Member States to maintain and 
deepen their 
commitment to price stability. 
For monetary policies 
a high degree of vigilance is required. It is 
the task of all the EU central banks to ensure that 
slippage elsewhere in their 
economies will not be accommodated, and that timely action 
is taken 
if inflationary pressures arise 
or inflation expectations deteriorate. This will help 
to ensure sustained growth without inflation. Monetary policy 
alone, however, 
will be overburdened if it is not supported by consistent behaviour in other areas. 
3. Sustainability of fiscal positions 
3.1 Fiscal positions in 1993-94 
The fiscal data which are shown in Table 9 were presented 
by the European 
Commission in autumn 1994 and 
may be subject to revision. These data 
show that deficit 
to GDP ratios 
in 1994 improved slightly 
in many EU 
countries but continued to remain 
at worrying levels. Debt 
ratios soared in most countries between 1993 and 
1994. Measured against the reference value 
of a deficit to GDP ratio 
of 3%, two countries 
remained below this level 
in 1993 (Ireland and Luxembourg), whilst in 1994 the number 
of countries increased to three (Germany, lreland and Luxembourg). 
Among the remaining countries substantial differences persisted. In 
1994, the Netherlands and 
Denmark recorded ratios 
of 3.8 and 4.3%, while several other Member States still 
ran deficits in the range of 5.5 to 7% of GDP (Belgium, Spain, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom). 
Finally, there 
were sizable deficit ratios in Italy and Greece (9.6 and 
14.1% respectively). In terms of debtlGDP ratios, only Germany, France, Luxembourg and the United 
Kingdom maintained ratios 
of below 60% in 1993 and 1994. Spain exceeded 
the 60% ratio in 1994. A number 
of other countries (Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal) fell 
in the range of 70 to 90% in 1994, and 
two of these countries were able to reduce their 
debtIGDP ratios between 1993 and 
1994. Greece and Italy had ratios 
of between 1 
15 and 124%, which increased further 
over the reference period, while Belgium's ratio 
was close to 140% in both years. 
3.2 Assessment of the sustainability 
of fiscal positions 
The Maastricht Treaty acknowledges 
the serious risks associated with 
an unbalanced fiscal policy stance. It therefore provides 
for a regular 
examination of the budgetary situation in individual Member States 
by the EU Council as from the start 
of Stage Two 
of EMU and 
for sanctions against Member States with excessive deficits 
as from the start 
of Stage Three. On the basis 
of the data available during 
the first half of 1994 and the opinions 
of the Commission and 
the Monetary Committee, the 
EU Council decided in September 1994 that ten member countries (all but Ireland and Luxembourg) 
had an excessive deficit. 
In the 
case of Ireland, which recorded a deficit ratio 
of 2.4% and 
a debt ratio 
of almost 90% in 1994, compared 
with 2.5% and 
96% in 1993, account was taken of the progress made 
in the reduction of the debt ratio during the past. Following 
the requirement under Article 
104c (7) of the Treaty, 
the EU Council adopted 
recommendations for the Member States which were aimed at bringing the fiscal 
positions back onto a sustainable path. 
Box 5 Public finances 1. Legal basis The Treaty establishing the European 
Community, Article 109j (1) requires: 
"the sustainability of the government financial position; 
this will be apparent from having 
achieved a government budgetary position without 
a deficit that is excessive, 
as determined in accordance with Article 
104c (6)". The Protocol (No. 
6) on the convergence criteria (Article 2) stipulates that this 
criterion "shall 
mean that 
at the time of the examination the Member State is 
not the subject of an EU Council decision under Article 
104c (6) of this Treaty that 
an excessive deficit exists". 
Article 104(c) sets the excessive deficit 
procedure. According to Article 104c (2 and 
3) the 
Commission shall prepare a 
report if in a Member 
State: a) "the ratio 
of the planned or actual government deficit to gross 
domestic product exceeds a reference value 
(defined in the Protocol as 
3% of GDP), unless either the ratio 
has declined substantially 
and continuously and reached 
a level that 
comes close 
to the reference value; 
or, alternatively, 
the excess over 
the reference value 
is only exceptional 
and temporary and the ratio remains 
close to 
the reference value; b) "the 
ratio of government debt to gross 
domestic product exceeds a reference 
value (defined as 60% of GDP in 
the Protocol) unless 
the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and 
approaching the 
reference value at a 
satisfactory pace". In addition, 
the report prepared 
by the Commission should 
take into account "all other 
relevant factors". 
The Commission may also prepare 
a report if, 
notwithstanding the fulfilment of the requirements under the criterion, 
it is 
of the opinion that there is a 
risk of an excessive deficit in 
a Member State. 
The Monetary Committee (respectively the Economic and Financial Committee) shall 
formulate an opinion on the report of the Commission. Finally, according to Article 
104c (6), the EU Council, on 
the basis of the recommendation 
of the Commission, shall, 
acting by qualified majority, decide, after an overall assessment, 
if an excessive deficit exists in 
a Member State. 2. Statistical questions 
The statistical base for examining fiscal developments is 
comparable data assembled 
on a National Accounts 
basis, in compliance with the European System 
of Accounts (2nd edition). These 
data are 
provided by 
the Commission, which in 
turn bases its figures upon 
data reported by Member States. 
The figures presented 
in this Report were published by 
the Commission in November 1994. 
3. Issues for further consideration 
Application of the following provisions 
of the Treaty will 
require further consideration: 
- "the (deficit) ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached 
a level that comes close to 
the reference value, or ..., alternatively, the ... excess ... is only exceptional 
and temporary and the 
ratio remains close to the 
reference value"; 
- "unless the (debt) 
ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching 
the reference value at a 
satisfactory pace"; 
- "other relevant factors". 
The EM1 is seriously concerned about fiscal developments 
in Member States. The 
deterioration in fiscal balances which started 
in 1990 continued 
in 1993 and 
was only slightly reversed in 1994. In most cases 
only part of the marked deterioration since 
1990 can be attributed to the recession, 
with a significant proportion being the consequence 
of a structural deterioration observed over 
a lengthy period. Moreover, the improvement 
in deficit ratios in 1994 
was largely determined by 
the cyclical upswing, 
and, with some 
exceptions, no significant progress 
was made 
in reducing structural deficits. 
It is also worrisome that 
the recent rise 
in deficits was accompanied by a significant expansion in 
both public spending and public revenue. This has adverse effects on 
the supply side 
of the economy and on medium-term growth prospects. 
Even a lasting economic recovery will not bring 
about a radical improvement 
in fiscal balances 
if underlying structural imbalances persist. 
If the economic climate should 
eventually deteriorate, 
with fiscal positions again being affected by a cyclical 
slowdown in revenue growth and 
an increase in expenditure, existing structural imbalances would 
quickly reappear in actual deficit figures. 
But even if 
continued growth 
over a longer period of time did contribute to a substantial reduction 
of actual deficit figures, 
for example to around 
3% of GDP, these could 
not necessarily be considered 
as sustainable. A deficit to 
GDP ratio of this order at a time 
of buoyant economic activity 
would rather be considered as insufficient 
for achieving lasting progress 
in redressing fiscal balances. 
This is why the objective 
of budgetary policy should be to use 
the coming upswing 
to achieve an adequate degree 
of fiscal consolidation. The recovery under 
way in all EU Member States provides an opportunity to reverse 
the fiscal trend 
of the past years. An environment of sustained growth should be more conducive to bringing expenditure under 
control and to undertaking sweeping reforms 
of the functioning and size 
of the public 
sector. This would restore flexibility to fiscal policy, allowing automatic stabilisers to 
operate in future recessions without driving budget deficits above values 
of 3% of GDP. More fundamentally, a timely reversal 
of adverse fiscal trends is essential 
for improving the prospects 
for sustainable growth and enhancing the effectiveness 
of monetary policy 
in achieving price 
stability. In assessing fiscal policy convergence important issues are raised, too, 
when considering the existing stock 
of debt and its trend over time. In countries 
with very high 
debt to GDP ratios clear evidence 
of a reduction must be shown and policies must be 
followed that will ensure that the debt ratio referred to in the Treaty is sufficiently 
diminishing and approaching 
the reference value 
at a satisfactory pace. 
For countries whose debt ratios currently exceed 
60% of GDP, the higher the starting debt ratio, the 
lower the required fiscal deficit ratio. In 
some cases this implies high primary surpluses, 
if not a sustained overall surplus position. This implicit relation between trends 
in deficits and debts underlines the view that the achievement 
of a deficit 
of around 3% of GDP cannot be considered as appropriate in all 
cases. 4. Exchange rate 
stability 4.1 Exchange rate developments 
in 1993-94 Exchange rate developments have been presented in more detail 
in Section A.2. This section gives 
a very brief summary. 
The legal background and 
an opinion of the EM1 Council is given in 
the box. In 1993, as in the preceding year, exchange rates 
in the EMS experienced 
substantial strains. 
In the first 
half of 1993 two realignments took place (the lrish pound, 
the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo were devalued); on 2nd 
August 1993 unprecedented exchange market pressures led Ministers 
of Finance and central bank Governors to take the joint decision 
to widen the ERM fluctuation margins 
for compulsory intervention to +15%, while leaving central rates unchanged. 
As a result of a bilateral agreement, the former fluctuation limits 
of *2.25% continue to 
apply between the Dutch 
guilder and the Deutsche Mark. 
Immediately after the widening 
of the bands all currencies previously participating 
in the narrow band, with the exception 
of the Dutch guilder, traded below their former 
lower limits against 
the Deutsche Mark. Between August and mid-October 
1993, these deviations ranged between 
4 and 8.5% for the lrish pound, 
the French franc, the Belgian 
franc and the Danish krone. The Spanish peseta and 
the Portuguese escudo fluctuated within their former wider limits vis-a-vis 
the Deutsche Mark. 
During most 
of 1994 the actual use 
of the wide bands remained close 
to 6%, 
except for three short-lived episodes 
when it reached 
8%. In January and December 
1994 the peseta weakened, likewise 
the Portuguese escudo in June. The Belgian franc, 
the Dutch guilder and, temporarily, the lrish pound 
were the strongest currencies during 
these periods. 
Three countries remained outside 
the ERM in 1993-94, 
namely Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom. 
As noted elsewhere, 
the overall impression 
of abating exchange rate pressures 
since the widening of the bands was largely confirmed by declining trends in exchange 
rate volatility, less volatility 
in short-term interest rate differentials and substantially 
reduced intervention activity in support 
of currencies under downward 
pressllre. 4.2 Assessment of exchange rate stability Several lessons 
may be drawn from the experience 
of the past few years. The 
economic fundamentals, and particularly all factors determining the development 
of inflation rates, are important forces 
in shaping exchange rate behaviour. When reacting 
to news or revising expectations markets will 
not only 
take into account the present state 
of convergence but will 
also consider past experience. They need to be convinced that 
overall macroeconomic policies are effectively geared to price stability. Credibility 
is strengthened most effectively by 
a steadfast conduct 
of policies and an appropriate adaptation of the institutional framework, including the independence 
of central banks. 
However, political factors 
or unexpected events 
of major importance cannot be ruled out, 
and hence exchange market reactions 
may occur 
to the extent that 
such phenomena entail uncertainty. 
Box 6 Exchange rate stability 
1. Legal basis The Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 
109j (l), requires: "the observance 
of the normal fluctuation margins 
provided for by 
the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism of the European Monetary System, for 
at least two 
years, without devaluing 
against the 
currency of any other Member State". The Protocol (No. 
6) on the convergence criteria 
referred to in Article 
109j (1) of the Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 
3, stipulates: "The criterion on participation in 
the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European 
Monetary System referred to 
in the third indent of Article 109j (1) of this Treaty shall mean 
that a Member State has respected 
the normal fluctuation margins provided for by 
the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary 
System without severe tensions for 
at least 
the last two 
years before 
the examination. In particular, the 
Member State shall not 
have devalued 
its currency's bilateral central 
rate against any other 
Member State's currency on its own initiative for 
the same 
period". 2. Assessment On 7th October 1994 the EM1 Council gave 
the following opinion which later was 
endorsed by 
the EU Council 
on the ERM fluctuation 
bands: "1. On 2nd August 1993, the Ministers of Finance and central 
bank Governors jointly took 
the decision to widen 
the ERM fluctuation bands for compulsory intervention to 
15% while leaving central parities unchanged. Experience since 
then indicates that the 
wider band has helped to 
achieve a 
sustainable degree 
of exchange rate stability in the ERM. It 
has done 
so by deterring speculative attacks 
on ERM currencies, thereby 
preventing large 
exchange rate depreciation or excessive exchange market intervention 
and their potentially inflationary 
consequences. In 
the light of this experience and 
in the 
current circumstances, 
the EM1 Council considers it advisable 
to maintain the present arrangements. 
2. At the same time the 
EM1 Council recommends that 
member countries should continue 
to aim 
at avoiding significant exchange 
rate fluctuations by gearing their policies 
to the 
achievement of 
price stability and the 
reduction of fiscal deficits, thereby 
contributing to the fulfilment of the requirements set out in Article 
109j (1) of the Treaty and the relevant Protocol". It was against this background that the 
EM1 Council gave an opinion to the 
EU Council on the ERM fluctuation bands (see 
Box 6). The 
EM1 Council considered it 
advisable in the prevailing circumstances to maintain the present arrangements and 
to continue to aim at avoiding significant exchange rate fluctuations by gearing 
member countries' policies to the achievement 
of price stability and the reduction 
of fiscal deficits. 
This view was endorsed by the 
EU Council. 5. Convergence in long-term interest rates 
5.1 Long-term interest rates 
in 1993-94 
This section refers to data presented 
in Table 9. While not 
fully comparable, the 
long-term interest rates used are deemed to 
be the most relevant. Efforts to develop 
the most representative and comparable 
set of long-term interest rates continue. 
The convergence 
of long-term interest rates displayed a similar pattern 
in both years under consideration. In 1993 and 1994, a group 
of eight member countries (all but 
Greece, Spain, ltaly and Portugal) recorded annual average levels within a relatively 
narrow range 
of 6.4-7.7% and 6.4-8.1% respectively. Long-term interest rates in Spain, 
ltaly and Portugal were at 
or somewhat above 
10%, while in Greece they 
were above 20%. 5.2 Assessment of convergence in long-term interest rates As mentioned in the Treaty, 
the durability of the convergence achieved 
by a Member State and 
of its participation 
in the ERM should be reflected in the convergence 
of long-term interest rates. In this respect 
the Treaty provides 
for the use 
of the long-term interest rates 
of those countries with the lowest inflation rates as reference 
values. The implication of this provision 
is that it is not necessarily the lowest long-term interest rate 
or rates which are used as a yardstick 
for measuring the durability 
of convergence. For example, in 1994 the best performer 
in terms of inflation was France, but its average 
long-term interest rate 
of 7.2% 
exceeded the levels recorded in Luxembourg 
(6.4%), the Netherlands (6.9%) and Germany (7.0%). Depending 
on the pattern of inflation and 
long- term interest rates in individual countries, this 
may at times lead to different positions 
of Member States 
when comparing actual performance 
in terms of both inflation 
and long- 
term interest rates. 
Considering the results 
for 1993-94, 
overall changes in terms 
of convergence appear rather small. 
As most of the countries, on balance, recorded 
an increase in average long-term interest rates 
of around 50 basis points 
in 1994, differentials changed 
only marginally. Some Member States with comparatively high levels 
of long-term rates 
(Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal) 
even showed a reduction 
in differentials vis-a-vis the 
best performers 
in 1994. These 
annual average values, 
however, mask 
a considerable 
widening of interest rate differentials 
in the course 
of 1994, in particular between the 
best- performing countries and Spain, ltaly and Portugal. 
If end-1994 patterns 
of long-term interest rates persist, they will 
have a negative impact 
on the overall picture 
of convergence. As analysed in detail in Section 
2.2, this can be considered to indicate important concerns 
in the markets, particularly over fiscal positions, as 
well as an increased focus on countries' long-term records 
of exchange rate and price stability. 
Cross-country differences in this respect, leading to a 
widening of bond yield differentials 
over the course 
of 1994, indicate that the progress towards overall convergence still 
needs to 
be strengthened by sustained efforts on the part 
of policy-makers in all quarters. Box 7 Long-term interest 
rates 1. Legal basis The Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 
109j (1) requires: 
"the durability 
of convergence achieved by 
the Member State and 
of its participation in 
the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System being reflected in 
the long- term interest rate levels". The Protocol (No. 
6) on the convergence criteria referred to 
in Article 
109j (1) of the Treaty establishing 
the European Community, Article 
4, stipulates: "The criterion on 
the convergence of 
interest rates referred to in the 
fourth indent 
of Article 109j (1) of this Treaty shall mean 
that, observed over 
a period 
of one year 
before the 
examination, a Member State 
has had 
an average nominal long-term interest rate that 
does not exceed 
by more than two percentage points 
that of, 
at most, the three best-performing 
Member States in terms 
of price stability. 
Interest rates shall 
be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds 
or comparable securities, taking into account differences in 
national definitions". 
2. Statistical issues 
The Treaty provisions imply in statistical 
terms that 
the representative long-term 
interest rate statistics should reflect as accurately as 
possible any changes in market sentiment with respect to 
the durability of the convergence performance and the 
participation in 
the ERM of the Member State concerned. The possible 
distorting effects of other determinants should 
be as limited as possible. As for 
the other statistics to 
be used for 
the application of the Protocol or the convergence criteria, 
the Commission is responsible for supplying the required statistics. Given 
its expertise in this area, the 
EM1 is currently contributing 
to a 
harmonised definition 
of the interest rate statistics that fulfils the requirements mentioned 
above. The figures used 
in Table 9 reflect these 
ongoing efforts 
and, for the time 
being, are deemed to 
be the 
most relevant. 
3. Issues for further 
consideration In the case 
of this criterion similar issues 
arise to those involved 
in assessing the price 
stability criterion, namely 
the choice of the country or countries to 
be used in calculating 
the reference value for the application 
of the criterion. 6. Overall convergence 
and sustainability Notable progress has been made towards price stability and convergence also 
increased in some other areas. This is reflected in the return 
to a 
higher degree 
of exchange rate stability 
in 1994. At the same 
time, however, deficiencies remain. Several 
countries still record unsatisfactory levels 
of inflation rates, and convergence is not 
established firmly enough 
to discourage challenges 
to policy from developments 
on foreign exchange and bond markets. 
The largest single problem continued 
to be the 
worrisome state of most EU countries' fiscal positions. Although governments are 
fully aware of the issues at stake and 
have started to prepare and 
to take corrective 
measures, these need to be strengthened and continued on 
a permanent basis. Visible 
reductions are required not 
only in 
actual but also 
in underlying structural fiscal deficits. 
Moreover, convergence 
is more likely to 
be sustainable if further progress is made 
to improve the structural performance 
of labour and goods markets. 
On the basis 
of the developments described above 
it appears that the overall achievements 
in convergence are still insufficient. 
CHAPTER ll ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE 
OF GOVERNORS AND OF THE EM1 INTRODUCTION: FROM THE COMMITTEE OF GOVERNORS TO THE 
EM1 With the establishment 
of the EM1 on 1st January 1994, 
the Committee of Governors of the EEC central banks ceased 
to exist. 
The Committee had been 
established in 1964, 
in pursuit of the principles underlying the Treaty 
of Rome, to act as the principal forum for co-operation between 
the central banks 
of the member countries. 
Several developments have taken place since then. 
In 1971, following the 
recommendations derived 
from the Werner Report, 
the Council adopted a decision 
on the strengthening of co-operation between central banks. 
An agreement was signed by the EEC central banks 
on 10th April 1972 
on the narrowing 
of the margins of exchange rate 
fluctuations (the "snake" arrangement), 
and the 
European Monetary Co-operation Fund 
(EMCF) was 
set up in 1973. 
After the difficulties experienced by 
the process of European monetary integration 
in the aftermath of the first oil shock, the Committee 
of Governors acquired new responsibilities with 
the establishment of the European Monetary System 
(EMS) in 
1979, in particular in the management 
of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) 
of the EMS. The Committee contributed to 
the process of monetary unification, 
which was relaunched 
in the 
second half of the 1980s with the Single European 
Act in 1985, the 
Delors Report, which provided 
an outline for the realisation of economic and monetary 
union in stages, and the Maastricht Treaty, which amended 
the Treaty of Rome to 
allow for the realisation of economic and monetary union (EMU). 
In the first stage 
of EMU, which started 
on 1st July 
1990, the tasks 
of the Committee of Governors were further strengthened, in particular to foster the co- 
ordination of monetary policies in 
the Member States with the aim 
of promoting price 
stability. The Committee 
of Governors also started preparatory 
work in order to enable 
the EM1 to conduct its tasks in Stage Two, which started 
on 1 st January 1994. 
In view of the relatively short time available and 
the complexity of the tasks involved, the preparatory 
work for 
Stage Three 
of EMU was initiated by the Committee 
of Governors. As indicated in 
the 1992 Annual Report 
of the Committee of Governors, the first step was to identify all the issues which should be examined 
at an early stage, 
establish a 
work programme until the 
end of 1993 and define accordingly the mandates 
of the three existing sub-committees and 
the five working groups established 
for that purpose. On 29th October 1993, the Governments of the Member States at 
the level of Heads of State or of Government agreed 
on the seat of the EM1 - Frankfurt - and nominated the President. On 1 st November, 
the Treaty entered into 
force and hence also the attached Protocol 
on the Statute 
of the EMI. 
On 1st January 
1994, the EM1 was established and assumed the functions attributed to it 
in the Treaty. Owing to the 
delays regarding the ratification 
of the Treaty and the postponement 
of the decision on the seat 
of the EM1 and on its President, provisional arrangements 
had to be made in order to allow the 
EM1 to perform its tasks 
in the first 
phase of its existence. Until November 1994 
the main functions were performed in Basle, 
with the co-operation and 
from the premises 
of the BIS, which had hosted 
the Secretariat of the former Committee 
of Governors. Following the decision of March 1994 
on the site of 
the EMl's premises in the "Eurotower" in Frankfurt, preparations for 
the move to Frankfurt and 
the hiring of staff continued in the 
following months. The 
EM1 Council held its first meeting on its premises in Frankfurt 
on 15th November 1994. 
The following sections summarise 
the main tasks and functions 
of the EM1 and its 
organisational structure. 
A. THE ROLE AND STRUCTURE OF THE EM1 l. Objectives, tasks 
and functions of the EM1 The Treaty (Article 
109f) and the attached Protocol 
on the Statute of the EM1 set out the objectives, tasks and functions 
of the EMI. The overall objective of the EM1 is to contribute to the realisation 
of economic and monetary union, in particular by preparing 
the conditions necessary 
for the transition to 
the third stage. Within this general framework, 
the EM1 shall: - strengthen central 
bank co-operation and 
the co-ordination of national monetary 
policies with a view to improving convergence and ensuring price stability; 
- make the preparations required 
for the establishment of the European System 
of Central Banks (ESCB), and for the conduct 
of a single monetary policy and 
the creation of a single currency in the third stage. 
Several operational and 
advisory functions derive directly 
or indirectly from these 
objectives. In particular, the 
EM1 shall: - facilitate the use 
of the ECU and oversee its development, including 
the smooth functioning of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System; 
- monitor the functioning 
of the EMS and assume the functions previously exercised 
by the EMCF; - hold consultations concerning issues falling within the competence 
of national central banks and affecting the stability 
of financial institutions and markets; 
- be consulted by 
the Council on any proposed Community legislation, and 
by national authorities on draft domestic legislation, 
which falls within its field 
of competence; - report annually to 
the Council 
on the progress made in the fulfilment 
by the Member States 
of their obligations regarding the achievement 
of EMU; - have the possibility to hold and manage foreign exchange reserves 
as an 
agent for, and 
at the request of, national central banks. 
1.1 Strengthening central bank co-operation 
and monetary policy co-ordination In Stage Two, the EM1 is expected to strengthen policy co-ordination 
with the aim of promoting a high degree of macroeconomic convergence. In carrying 
out this task, the 
EM1 acts in accordance with the same objectives and principles laid down 
for the ESCB, 
in particular that the primary objective 
of monetary policy is to promote price stability. 
In fulfilling its duties, the 
EM1 provides a forum for 
consultations and exchanges of views and information on policy issues, while 
the conduct of monetary policy remains the 
ultimate responsibility 
of the national authorities. 
The EM1 may formulate opinions or recommendations on the overall orientation 
of monetary policy and exchange rate policy 
as well as 
on related measures introduced in 
each Member State. The 
EM1 may submit opinions or recommendations to governments and to 
the Council on policies which might 
affect the internal or external monetary situation 
in the Community 
and, in 
particular, the 
functioning of the EMS. It holds consultations 
on issues falling within the competence 
of national central banks and affecting the stability 
of financial institutions 
and markets. 1.2 Preparation for the establishment of the ESCB Under Article 
109f (3) of the Treaty, the 
EM1 has been accorded 
a distinct responsibility: "At the latest by 31st December 
1996, the EM1 shall specify the regulatory, 
organisational and logistical framework necessary 
for the ESCB to perform 
its tasks in the third stage". The regulatory, organisational and logistical framework required 
for the ESCB to 
perform its tasks covers, inter alia, 
the following areas: 
- the definition 
of the concepts and framework 
for conducting the single monetary 
policy and the preparation 
of the ESCB's operational rules 
and procedures; - the implementation 
of a single foreign exchange policy; 
- the promotion 
of efficient cross-border payments; 
- the collection and harmonisation, where necessary, 
of reliable and timely statistics 
to support the conduct 
of the single monetary policy; 
- the supervision 
of the technical planning 
of the printing and issuing 
of a European banknote; - the harmonisation 
of accounting rules and standards 
of the national central banks 
and the setting-up 
of an adequate information systems architecture for the ESCB. 
In view of the complexity 
of the task, the interaction between areas 
of activity and 
between the institutions involved, and the short time available 
for the preparatory 
work, the EM1 Council has organised this 
work on the basis 
of a comprehensive plan 
establishing the main lines 
of action. This 
plan, which 
acts as 
a guiding instrument 
for organising, monitoring and assessing the activities conducted 
by the EM1 staff, the Sub- 
committees and Working Groups, encompasses the main topics which need to be 
addressed in 
the context of preparatory work; 
it outlines the work schedules involved 
for the different Sub-Committees and Working Groups, and establishes the chronological 
order of deliberations on these topics in the 
EM1 Council. The EM1 has to ensure that 
the preparation for Stage Three undertaken 
in various areas gives rise to 
a coherent project which 
is internally consistent and implemented 
accordingly. Implementation must be possible, according to 
the Treaty, by the end 
of 1996. This calls 
for devising workable solutions: contingency mechanisms 
may have to be considered, especially in the light 
of the sometimes long implementation lags. 
To ensure that preparatory activities are 
on schedule, in terms of both content and 
deadlines, progress will 
be continuously monitored. 
Reports on progress 
in preparatory work will 
be communicated to third 
parties, in particular the European Commission, the Monetary Committee and, annually, 
to the Council of Ministers in accordance with Article 
7.1 of 
the EM1 Statute. 1.3 Oversight of the development of the ECU In accordance with Article 
4.1 of its Statute 
the EM1 "shall facilitate the use 
of the ECU and oversee its development". This task involves mainly assessing the legal setting 
in EU countries to examine the regulatory obstacles 
to the 
private use 
of the ECU. In this 
context the EM1 co-operates with the European Commission. Regulatory impediments 
to the use 
of the ECU should be removed. However, 
it is agreed that the ECU should not be 
endowed with 
the attributes of a national currency during Stage Two so as not 
to impinge on the Member States' sovereignty over monetary policy. 
The EM1 also conducts 
an annual review 
of the developments in the financial and 
non-financial use 
of the ECU. In addition, 
the EM1 plays a consultative role, on its own 
initiative or at the request 
of other Community institutions and 
the Member States. This 
includes, in particular, providing clarification on 
the transition to a single currency 
in Stage Three and on the continuity 
of ECU-denominated contracts 
and instruments. 1.4 Other tasks 
The EM1 has been entrusted with other operational and advisory 
tasks which are 
described in Chapter II, Section B. In accordance with Article 
6.4 of its Statute, the 
EM1 is also entitled 
to hold and manage foreign exchange reserves 
as an 
agent for, and at the request of, national central banks. Thus 
far, however, no such request has been made. 
It is also worth noting that, in accordance with Article 
109f (7) of the Treaty, the 
EM1 may have additional 
tasks for the preparation 
of Stage Three conferred upon 
it by the Council 
of Ministers. 2. The organisational structure 
of the EM1 The European Monetary Institute 
is an organisation 
of the European Union, with 
legal personality and established according 
to the 
provisions of the Treaty. 
The members of the EM1 are the 
central banks 
of the Member States. 
In conducting its tasks the 
EMl's staff works in close collaboration with three sub- 
committees and five working groups on specific issues. 
The structure of the EM1 is described below. 
2.1 The EM1 Council The EMl's decision-making body is the 
EM1 Council. According 
to Article 109f (1) of the Treaty and Article 9 
of the EM1 Statute, the Council directs and manages the EMI. 
The Council is composed 
of the President of the EM1 and the Governors of the central 
banks of the Member States. The 
President of the Council of the European Union and 
a member of the European 
Commission may 
also participate 
in the EM1 Council meetings, without the right 
to vote. The EM1 Council, whose proceedings are 
confidential, is 
scheduled to 
meet at least ten 
times a year. In exercising the powers 
and performing the 
tasks and duties conferred upon them by the Treaty and the Statute, the members 
of the EM1 Council who are the representatives of their institutions 
act on 
their own responsibility. The 
Council of the EM1 may not seek 
or take any instructions from 
other Community 
institutions or bodies or governments of the Member States. The Community institutions 
and bodies, as 
well as the governments of the Member States, undertake to respect this principle 
of independence. Each member 
of the Council has 
one vote 
and the 
Council normally 
acts by simple majority 
of its members. A qualified majority 
of two-thirds is required, inter alia, in the case 
of the adoption of opinions and recommendations relating to monetary 
or foreign exchange policy, for decisions on 
financial resources 
or for the adoption 
of guidelines on the methods 
for the implementation 
of conditions necessary for 
the ESCB to perform 
its tasks. Unanimity is required in 
particular for decisions concerning 
the specification of the ESCB's regulatory, organisational and 
logistical framework, for 
publishing opinions and recommendations 
or for granting 
third countries' 
monetary authorities the status 
of "Other Holder" 
of official ECUs. Following a long-standing tradition within the 
European Community, 
after the 
signing of the Act of Accession by 
the Heads of State or of Government in Corfu 
in June 1994, the central 
banks of the applicant countries, Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden, were invited by the EM1 to participate 
as observers in the meetings of the Council, the Committee 
of Alternates and the 
Sub-Committees and Working 
Groups. Following the outcome 
of the referendum in Norway in November 1994 
on accession to the European Union, with 
a majority of votes against, the representatives 
of Norway's central bank abstained from 
further participation in 
EM1 meetings. When the Act of Accession came into force 
on 1st January 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden formally 
acceded to the European 
Union and their central 
bank Governors became members 
of the EM1 Council. 2.2 The President of the EM1 In accordance with the provisions of 
the Treaty and of the EM1 Statute, the 
President of the EM1 is appointed for 
a three-year term by common 
accord of the governments of the Member States 
at the level 
of Heads of State or of Government, on a recommendation from the 
Committee of Governors or the EM1 Council and after 
consulting the European 
Parliament and 
the EU 
Council. The President's tasks 
comprise preparing and chairing the 
EM1 Council meetings, the 
day-to-day management 
of the EM1 and presenting the 
views of the EMI. In 
the absence of the President, his duties are 
performed by the Vice-President, who is elected 
from among 
the Governors who are members of the EM1 Council, likewise for a three-year period. 2.3 The internal organisation 
of the 
EM1 At its establishment 
on 1st January 
1994, the EM1 started with the 
28 staff members of the Secretariat of the Committee of Governors. In April, after the decision was made 
regarding the premises, the Administration Department was established 
in Frankfurt to set up the infrastructure 
of the EMl's new offices, to recruit personnel and 
to prepare the relocation from 
Basle. As 
of 31st December 1994 the number 
of staff was 126. Members of staff have generally been appointed on three-year fixed-term contracts. 
It is currently planned that 
staff numbers will reach a level 
of 1 99 
by end-1 995. 
The management currently includes the Director General and four Heads of 
Department. The main responsibilities 
of the Director General 
are to assist 
the President in his tasks, 
in particular in the day-to-day management 
of the EMI. The four departments 
are: the General Secretariat, the Monetary, Economic and Statistics Department, the 
Administration Department, and the Information and Communications Systems 
Department. The General Secretariat consists 
of two divisions. The 
Policy Division is responsible for: (a) preparing 
the Council meetings, maintaining inter-institutional 
relations, supporting 
the production and distribution 
of the EMl's reports and maintaining 
the EMl's archives; (b) overseeing the ECU Clearing and Settlement System, monitoring 
Member States' payment systems and preparing 
for the EU-wide payment systems 
in Stage Three; 
(c) supporting the activities 
of the Monitoring and Concertation Groups, 
monitoring the functioning 
of the EMS, facilitating the use 
of the ECU and overseeing its 
development, carrying 
out EMS-related operations and preparing the foreign 
exchange market operations to be carried 
out by the ESCB in Stage Three; (d) conducting 
background analyses 
for the consultations 
on issues affecting the stability 
of financial institutions and markets; and (e) co-ordinating the preparatory 
work for 
Stage Three, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress made against 
the timetable of the Treaty. The division 
works closely with and provides support to 
the Foreign Exchange Policy and Banking Supervisory Sub-Committees and 
the Working Groups on 
EU Payment Systems, Accounting Issues and Printing and Issuing a European Banknote. 
The Legal Division is responsible 
for handling all legal issues within the EMI. 
These include assisting 
in the fulfilment 
of the EMl's mandate, 
in particular as regards the 
legal aspects of the preparation 
of the regulatory and institutional framework 
of the ESCB and questions related to the interpretation 
of the Treaty. 
In addition, the Legal Division assists 
in the preparation 
of EM1 opinions when consulted by the EU Council 
or national 
authorities on draft Community or national legislation falling within 
its field of competence. The staff of this division provide legal advice to the 
EM1 management on administrative 
matters. The General Secretariat is also responsible for 
the EMl's Press and Translation 
Service. The Monetary, 
Economic and Statistics Department consists 
of three divisions, 
provides secretarial support to the Monetary 
Policy Sub-Committee and is responsible 
for the EMl's library. The Stage Two Division provides economic analyses on issues related 
to the strengthening of monetary co-operation among central banks 
and the co-ordination of monetary policies with a view to promoting price stability during Stage Two. It 
may also 
assist the Council 
in formulating opinions and recommendations 
on macroeconomic policies, including those relating to the convergence criteria, and provide analyses 
on issues regarding financial markets. In support 
of these functions, 
economic research in 
the division focuses mainly on short and long-term aspects 
of economic and financial 
behaviour in 
EU countries and cross-country comparisons. The Stage Three Division is 
responsible for providing analyses 
on the concepts, framework and rules 
for the single 
monetary policy 
in Stage Three 
of EMU, in particular as regards the definition 
of the instruments, procedures and intermediate objectives 
of monetary policy. It contributes to 
the analysis 
of the practical implementation 
of foreign exchange policy in Stage Three. 
Furthermore, it undertakes economic research with 
a view to analysing long-term trends 
and strategies, and advises on operational matters related to the preparation and 
the start-up of Stage Three at an 
EU-wide level. Both divisions 
work closely with the Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange 
Policy Sub-Committees. The Statistics Division has the principal duties 
of contributing to the improvement 
of the statistical information which is 
needed for 
promoting the co-ordination 
of monetary policies in Stage Two and preparing the harmonised concepts and approaches and 
specifying the regulatory, organisational and logistical framework 
for the statistics 
which will be needed by the ESCB to perform 
its tasks. It works closely 
with the Working Group 
on Statistics in carrying out these duties. The division also has the task 
of ensuring the general availability 
of the statistical data and facilities required throughout the 
EMI. The lnformation and Communications Systems Department currently comprises 
one division, sub-divided into three functional sections, and is responsible 
for devising and implementing a technical strategy 
for the information and communications systems 
for the EM1 and the future ESCB. This 
work is performed in close co-operation 
with the Working Group 
on lnformation Systems 
for which the ICS Department provides the 
secretariat. Furthermore, the ICS Department is responsible 
for providing technical 
support for the users 
of the EMl's information and communications 
in the EM1 itself and, 
under the oversight of the Working Group 
on lnformation Systems, 
for the monitoring, co- 
ordination and further development 
of the communications systems 
already in place between the 
EM1 and the central banks. 
The Administration Department consists 
of three divisions. The personnel Division 
is responsible for: (a) recruitment and personnel policy; (b) salary-related matters and 
(c) training. The General Services Division is responsible for: (a) premises; 
(b) procurement and office services; and 
(c) organisation of conferences, meetings and 
travel. The Management Services 
Division deals with: (a) the 
EMl's internal financial 
accounts; and (b) management accounting and general organisational issues. 
Since Article 
6.4 of the Statute entitles the 
EM1 to hold and manage foreign 
exchange reserves as 
an agent for, 
and at the request of, the national central banks, 
the EM1 will establish 
a Financial Department 
if needed. EUROPEAN MONETARY INSTITUTE President's Office

H 2.4 Committees, sub-committees 
and working groups 
In the performance 
of its tasks, 
the EM1 Council is assisted by several committees 
and working groups, according 
to the 
following structure: 
The Committee of Alternates, chaired 
by the Director General 
of the EMI, is 
composed of senior representatives 
of EU central banks, appointed 
by the respective 
Governors as their Alternates 
in the EM1 Council. The main task 
of this Committee is 
to contribute to the 
preparation of the meetings 
of the EM1 Council. The Financial Committee 
is chaired by 
the Vice-President and also consists 
of the two most senior members 
of the EM1 Council serving for one year on 
a rotation basis. 
The Committee's 
main responsibility is 
to examine on the Council's behalf 
the President's proposals on 
the annual budget 
and the annual accounts as well as periodical statements 
of expenses incurred 
by the EM1 during the financial year 
and deliver its opinion thereon to the 
EM1 Council. The sub-committees and working groups, 
composed of experts from 
the national central banks, were established under the Committee 
of Governors, and the 
EM1 Council decided to continue their activities. 
The chairmen of the sub-committees and working 
groups have each been appointed for 
a three-year term commencing on 1st January 
1994. The Monetary Policy Sub-Committee assists the Council in strengthening the 
co- ordination of national monetary policies in the European Union. 
To this end, in the 
framework of the ex ante and ex post exercises, 
it contributes to the 
periodic consultations regarding the monitoring 
of monetary policies, in particular 
by examining the monetary policy objectives and strategies envisaged by the Member States and their 
compatibility with 
the aim of achieving price stability throughout the Union. Furthermore, 
the Sub-Committee annually reviews developments in the budgetary field. 
The Sub- committee also undertakes the necessary studies 
to facilitate the EMl's task of making the preparations required for 
the conduct of a single monetary policy. In particular, 
it studies methods and organisational aspects 
of the execution of the single monetary 
policy, with 
a view to the preparation 
of the instruments and procedures necessary for 
fulfilling the 
ESCB's monetary policy tasks in Stage Three. 
The Foreign Exchange Policy Sub-Committee assists 
the Council in the preparation of discussions on exchange rate developments, the functioning 
of the EMS 
and developments in the use 
of the private 
ECU. The Sub-Committee also regularly 
exchanges information 
with non-EU central banks in the framework 
of the "concertation procedure" involving representatives 
of the central banks 
of nineteen industrialised 
countries, which provides for sharing data 
on market developments, intervention and 
other official foreign exchange transactions. Furthermore, the Sub-Committee is involved 
in assisting the 
EM1 to prepare the groundwork 
for the ESCB's foreign exchange-related 
functions. The Banking Supervisory Sub-Committee holds 
regular consultations on issues affecting the stability 
of financial institutions and markets. 
In the cases where the national 
central banks 
do not have 
legal responsibility 
for banking supervision, 
a representative of 
the respective national supervisory 
authority participates in the Sub-Committee. 
The Working Group 
on EU Payment Systems is, under 
the aegis of the EM1 Council, responsible 
for co-ordinating central banks' activities in 
the field of payment systems, for analysing ways 
of facilitating cross-border payments within the context 
of the Single Market and as 
a preparation for Stage Three, and 
for preparing the EM1 Council decisions concerning the oversight 
of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System. 
The Working Group on Printing and Issuing 
a European Banknote assists the 
EM1 in carrying out its task 
of supervising the technical preparations 
for the introduction 
of ECU banknotes. This area 
of work involves studying the various possible 
options for 
the design and production 
of European banknotes and the issuing, distribution, sorting and 
handling of the notes once they have been produced. 
The Working Group on Statistics contributes to the improvement 
of the statistical 
information which is 
needed for promoting the co-ordination 
of monetary policies in Stage 
Two, and 
also for 
developing the statistical base necessary 
for the conduct 
of the single 
monetary policy in Stage Three. 
The Working Group 
on Accounting Issues developed the accounting 
methodology applied by the EM1 (see the enclosed Annual Accounts). 
It is responsible 
for preparing the ground for recommendations for the harmonisation 
of accounting rules and standards 
in the ESCB 
with particular regard to 
the statutory provisions on monetary income, the 
paying-up of capital and the transfer 
of foreign exchange reserve assets. 
The Working Group on Information Systems is responsible 
for assisting the 
EM1 in devising and implementing 
a technical strategy 
for information and communications 
systems for the EM1 and the ESCB. 3. The financial resources 
of the EM1 Under Article 
16 of its Statute, the 
EM1 has been endowed 
with financial resources 
amounting to 
ECU 615.6 million (see the notes to 
the enclosed Annual 
Accounts). The level of resources required 
was determined by 
the EM1 Council on 
the basis of the annual interest stream that would need to be generated 
in order to cover the estimated current 
expenditure in 
a normal year of operation (some ECU 
44 million), together 
with an allowance for initial investment 
in equipment for the EM1 and working balances 
of cash. Any surplus arising at year-end will be 
dealt with in the following manner: 
firstly, an amount to be determined 
by the EM1 Council will be transferred to a 
reserve fund, which is repayable together with the initial contributions to the central 
banks at the liquidation 
of the EMI; secondly, 
any remaining surplus not transferred to the EMl's reserves 
will be repaid to the central banks. 
The EMl's financial 
resources were provided 
by its member central banks 
in accordance with a key based 
on the share 
of each country's 
population and GDP, 
according to the same method to be used 
in Stage Three 
for the ECB. Table 10 Central banks' share

The EM1 is entrusted with 
the task of strengthening the co-ordination 
of the monetary policies 
of the Member States 
with the aim 
of ensuring price stability. 
In this context, the EM1 should hold regular consultations concerning the course 
of monetary policies, which in Stage Two are 
the responsibility of national authorities. It is 
normally to be consulted by the national monetary authorities before they take decisions 
on the course of monetary policy in the context of the common framework 
for ex ante co- 
ordination. The 
EM1 also monitors the developments 
of the EMS. To this end, the EM1 has continued and intensified 
the work which had 
been initiated and carried 
out in the first stage 
of EMU by the Committee of Governors. In this context, economic 
and monetary developments 
and policies are monitored regularly with 
the aim 
of furthering common assessments 
of prevailing conditions and appropriate 
policy responses. The procedure involves reviewing current exchange market 
and interest rate developments, 
at the level of experts, on a weekly basis. The main factors 
with a potential bearing on exchange rate developments, 
in individual Member States 
or at the level 
of the EMS as a whole, are assessed and 
an examination is made 
of recent economic developments 
or prospects, of economic policy decisions taken 
in the monetary and budgetary fields 
and of financial market expectations 
about future exchange rate and interest rate movements. During its regular monthly meetings 
the EM1 Council reviews 
the economic and financial situation prevailing in individual 
Member States and current developments in international financial markets. 
Furthermore, a forward-looking analysis, 
the ex ante exercise, is regularly carried 
out in the autumn before 
the national authorities take public decisions on 
the future course of monetary policy. 
In this framework, 
the EM1 analyses economic, monetary 
and financial trends and discusses 
the appropriateness of monetary policy stances 
in the individual Member States. The overall stance 
of monetary policy 
in the Union is examined, as well as the mutual compatibility 
of national monetary and foreign 
exchange policies. The 
ex ante analysis is followed up by an 
ex post surveillance exercise, 
which is 
normally undertaken in the late spring. The 
ex post analysis reviews monetary policies, 
comparing recent economic 
developments with earlier forecasts and examining 
economic and monetary policy prospects 
for the remainder 
of the year. The analytical foundations 
of the monitoring framework are continuously reviewed 
and updated. In 
1994, special emphasis 
was given to 
the monetary transmission process 
and the implications 
of differences in national transmission processes 
for the co- 
ordination of monetary policies 
in the Union. The EM1 also has the right to formulate opinions and recommendations 
on the overall orientation 
of monetary policy 
as well as to make recommendations to the 
monetary authorities 
of the Member States concerning 
the conduct of their monetary 
and foreign exchange policies. So far, 
the EM1 has seen no need to make use 
of this provision. In 1994 the 
EM1 also continued 
the practice of the Committee of Governors of studying in detail, once a year, developments in public finance and their implications 
for the co-ordination of monetary policies. The 
EM1 recognises the crucial importance 
of sound fiscal positions 
for the pursuit 
of stability-oriented monetary policies. In 
the spring of 1994 the EM1 expressed its concern to the Council on two occasions 
about the state 
of public finances in the Union. 
2. Preparatory work for Stage Three One of the main tasks 
of the EM1 is to 
prepare the ground 
for the ESCB to be able 
to perform its tasks from the start 
of Stage Three. This involves conducting preparatory 
work in numerous areas 
of central bank activity, 
in particular: monetary policy; foreign 
exchange policy; statistics; payment systems; and issuing banknotes. 
2.1 Monetary policy The Treaty lays down the Statute 
of the future ESCB and sets the maintenance 
of price stability as its primary objective. But as regards the 
modus operandi of the single monetary policy, 
the Statute states 
only general principles; 
for example, the principle 
of open markets 
with free competition, the 
ban on central bank financing of public deficits, and the possible decentralisation 
of the execution of the ESCB's operations, so that 
recourse can be made to 
the national central banks 
"to the extent 
deemed possible and 
appropriate". The preparatory work involves detailed technical analysis 
of the various 
instruments potentially available 
or already in use 
in member countries in 
order to identify 
institutional differences between countries 
(a description of the current strategies and 
instruments of monetary policy in 
EU Member States is provided in 
Annex 1). It also 
entails a general review 
of the main principles applicable for 
the elaboration and 
implementation of monetary policy in 
the European Union leading to decisions on matters 
that imply strategic options. The final answers to 
most of these questions will not 
be given until a later stage, as they will largely depend 
on the economic 
and financial conditions prevailing at 
the time of entering Stage Three. Nevertheless, the lead time 
needed to introduce a 
new operational framework 
is such 
that it is necessary to 
go ahead with preparations. 
Work in this large area is in progress. 
A central issue in 
the conduct of monetary policy in Stage Three is whether the 
ESCB should target price stability directly 
or employ 
a strategy relying 
on the adoption 
of an intermediate target. 
The effectiveness of both strategies requires a 
high degree of transparency and credibility and implies the existence 
of a sufficiently predictable 
relationship between monetary 
policy measures and price developments. The choice 
of strategy requires 
an empirical assessment which 
can only 
be made 
fully at a later stage, 
but will nevertheless need to be based to a large extent 
on past experience and available 
data. It should be emphasised that, regardless 
of the choice between 
the direct and 
the indirect approach and between various intermediate targets, 
the ESCB will need 
to monitor other indicators which could give information 
on the current and future monetary, 
economic and financial situation and 
on the appropriateness 
of the stance of monetary policy. It is intended to return 
to these issues in 
1996. In order to assess the impact 
of the single monetary stance 
on prices and 
output it is useful to analyse the differences 
in the transmission process across countries 
which might complicate the conduct 
of the single monetary policy. A preliminary study (see 
Box 2 in Chapter I) shows that such differences 
are very 
closely related 
to structural and institutional factors. While the growing integration 
of markets and the move to Stage 
Three will lead to more convergence in financial areas, it is neither desirable 
nor possible for all other structural differences across countries to disappear. Such differences 
also exist within national 
borders. In the day-to-day implementation 
of monetary policy the ESCB will focus 
on one or several short-term interest rates. 
In influencing this rate (or these rates) it will 
convey information to market participants. The ESCB must therefore be able to give clear and 
unambiguous policy 
signals, which must not be hampered by differences 
in local interest 
rate conditions. 
The requirements 
for a single monetary stance lie both 
in the field of instruments and procedures and in the integration 
of interbank markets and payments systems. A 
high degree 
of harmonisation of the instruments and procedures 
is indispensable in order to provide uniform monetary policy signals in 
every country. Another crucial condition 
is the presence 
of sufficient arbitrage possibilities 
for banks. 
Only when banks can transfer 
central bank reserves across national borders freely and within the same 
day will 
changes in interest rates be quickly and uniformly transmitted throughout the Union. This 
has strong implications 
for the required degree 
of integration of payment and settlement 
systems (see Section 
2.4 below). The evaluation 
of alternative monetary policy instruments and operating 
procedures must 
be based on a number 
of basic principles: 
efficiency: the monetary policy instruments and procedures must enable 
the ESCB to 
control its targets efficiently. 
An important element 
of an efficient operational 
framework is that 
it ensures that 
the monetary policy signals 
of the ESCB will 
be uniform and consistent; 
conformity with market principles: monetary policy implementation should be "in 
accordance with the principle 
of an open market economy with free 
competition, favouring an efficient allocation 
of resources" (Maastricht Treaty, Article 
105); equal treatment: the 
ESCB should treat all 
groups of financial institutions that 
have access to its facilities 
equally and regardless 
of their country 
of origin; simplicity and transparency: the monetary policy and procedures should 
be simple and 
be employed with clarity, 
so as to contribute towards meeting the criteria 
of equal treatment and conformity with 
market principles in a decentralised central 
bank system; decentralisation: the 
ESCB shall have recourse to 
the national central banks to carry 
out operations "to the extent deemed possible and appropriate" (Article 
12 of the ESCB Statute). The fulfilment 
of this principle 
may be of practical relevance, in 
particular as 
the ECB can take advantage 
of national central banks' experience and 
knowledge of local markets; 
continuity: the transition to the new operational framework at 
the beginning of Stage Three may be facilitated 
by relying as much as possible 
on the initial infrastructure 
and employing instruments that can 
be adapted to the changing environment. 
Discussions about 
the operational framework 
for the implementation 
of monetary policy by the ESCB (selecting the policy instruments which could be used, defining their 
desired features and the relevant operational procedures) are currently under 
way. Based on a careful examination 
of the individual policy instruments on the basis 
of national experiences, a comparison will have to 
be made of the possible alternative options 
for the overall operational framework 
in view of the expected characteristics 
of the economic and financial environment 
in Stage Three. 
The features 
of a possible system 
of reserve requirements will have to be prepared 
at an 
early stage so that, if necessary, existing systems 
can be adjusted and new systems can 
be introduced in time. The same applies to 
the general features 
of standing facilities and 
of open market operations. It will also 
be necessary to define the types 
of securities which would be eligible as collateral 
for standing facilities and 
as underlying securities for open market operations. Moreover, a technical analysis 
of the feasibility and 
features of a decentralised execution 
of open market operations is 
needed. Finally, 
the results of these separate studies will need to 
be considered together in 
order to allow discussion of the overall operational framework 
of the ESCB. These analyses will, 
however, in no way constrain the freedom 
of the ESCB in deciding 
whether and how to use these instruments. 
2.2 Foreign exchange 
policy From the start 
of Stage Three 
of EMU the ESCB has to be 
ready to conduct a 
single foreign exchange policy. 
To enable the ESCB to perform this task, several issues 
have to 
be prepared ahead 
of time. These 
include, in particular, 
the transfer of foreign reserve assets from the national central banks to the European Central 
Bank (ECB), the 
management of the ECB's and national central banks' reserves, 
the organisation of foreign exchange intervention and exchange rate relationships with 
the currencies of Member States not participating in Stage Three. 
The EM1 has planned to examine these topics in the course 
of 1995 and 
1996. A preliminary analysis started 
in 1994 on the organisation 
of foreign exchange 
intervention. By analogy with 
the single monetary policy, although 
the main decisions 
will be made by the ECB, the organisation of the execution 
of foreign exchange operations has to be 
defined and prepared prior to the start 
of Stage Three. In particular, 
it will have to be ascertained whether and to what extent foreign exchange operations will 
have to be centralised or decentralised. The technical feasibility 
of alternative organisational frameworks as well as their respective efficiency in terms 
of policy implementation will be 
assessed before a definite solution is endorsed. Another issue to 
be examined is the 
implications for the organisation of foreign exchange policy 
of the relationships 
between the new single currency and 
other currencies, in particular non-EU currencies, 
on the one hand, and those of the Member States 
with a derogation, on 
the other. 2.3 Statistics The Treaty requires the EM1 to "promote the harmonisation, where necessary, 
of the rules and practices governing 
the collection, compilation and distribution 
of statistics in the areas within its field 
of competence". This involves ensuring the availability 
of properly articulated 
Monetary Union statistics in Stage Three and supporting 
the EMl's efforts towards 
"strengthening the co-ordination 
of monetary policies with a view to 
ensuring price 
stability". Given the long 
lead time involved 
in the development 
of statistics, the Committee of Governors started the preparatory 
work for Stage Three 
in 1992. A provisional 
arrangement was subsequently agreed with the Commission that 
the Committee and its successor, the EMI, should be primarily responsible 
at the European Union level 
for the conceptual development 
of money and banking statistics generally, and 
for statistics relating to financial 
flows in the balance of payments and related stocks. The current 
arrangement is 
under review, together with 
the arrangements for co-operation in 
statistical matters 
at the EU level. It 
is intended to define in 1995 
the fields of competence and responsibility in the different 
areas of statistics between 
the future ESCB and the 
European Commission (EUROSTAT). 
The first task 
was to establish likely needs 
for statistics in Stage Three. The results 
indicated a need 
for a wide range 
of monetary, financial and balance-of-payments 
statistics for the conduct of a single monetary policy. They included properly articulated 
monetary statistics covering 
the Monetary Union, available monthly and to a prompt 
timetable, and timely 
monthly balance-of-payments data 
for the Monetary Union, covering 
at least 
the key items in transactions 
with third countries. 
As a first 
follow-up, the Committee 
of Governors agreed in September 1993 that all 
central banks would exploit the existing scope for improving 
the timeliness of the "essential" money 
and banking statistics and balance-of-payments statistics. It agreed 
also that, 
in order to ensure that properly articulated monthly monetary statistics covering 
the Monetary Union could be compiled from the start 
of Stage Three, provision 
should be made in every Member State to allow a breakdown 
of banks' external positions into those 
vis-a-vis Monetary Union Member States 
and those vis-a-vis 
other countries. Inventories of statistics already available in member countries and statistics 
which, if not available, were 
already planned or could be made available with relative 
ease, were compiled. Comparing the results 
of these exercises helped to identify 
gaps, and indicated 
where harmonisation 
was necessary. There proved to 
be a large common element 
in the statistics of member countries, with a good correspondence to 
the stated requirements 
for Monetary Union. But there are numerous differences 
of detail, and some more 
substantial differences, reflecting different emphases 
in policy and varying financial 
structures and practices. By the end 
of 1994 the Council 
of the EM1 had agreed on 
the concept of "Monetary Financial Institution" whose balance sheet should be incorporated in the consolidated 
balance sheet 
of the banking system 
of the Monetary Union and on the format for this 
consolidated balance sheet. The Council had also agreed on 
the need for monthly 
balance-of-payments statistics covering 
the Monetary Union, and on the definition 
of residence and economic sector. 
A clear but flexible view 
of the need for harmonisation, which need 
not mean an identical approach, must 
be maintained. In some areas 
of close concern 
to the ECB, a 
reasonable comparability across countries in the prospective Monetary Union 
may suffice, in particular since 
the structure and functioning 
of national financial markets 
may (still) differ significantly. However, where statistics have 
to be aggregated, and especially 
where cross-border consolidation is necessary, a close fit is required. Such 
considerations will influence the priority given to individual tasks 
of harmonisation. With respect 
to further work, sections of the stated requirements remain 
to be examined, e.g. central banks' balance sheets, interest rates, financial market statistics 
and financial accounts, mutual funds and 
the international investment position. These, 
together with technical issues 
such as aggregation procedures, will receive 
early attention. Furthermore, while it 
is the European Commission's responsibility 
to provide the data required for 
the application of the convergence criteria, 
the EM1 must take a 
close interest 
in order to report on them, as 
it is required to do under 
the Treaty; increased effort will therefore be devoted to 
the examination of the statistics required 
for the assessment of convergence. Although the statistical 
work of the EM1 must focus on 
the operational need for 
statistics arising from 
the conduct of a single monetary policy 
in Stage Three (and from 
the co-ordination of monetary policies in Stage Two), 
the EM1 accepts international and 
European Union statistical standards while seeking to influence their development. 
Moreover, the 
EM1 is conscious of the costs incurred 
by reporting institutions 
in supplying statistics and wants to avoid imposing additional burdens as 
far as possible. The EM1 thus attaches great importance 
to close co-operation, not only 
with the statistical 
authorities in member countries, 
but also with the European Commission (EUROSTAT) 
and with 
international organisations in statistical matters. This 
is promoted through 
participation in 
the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance-of-Payments 
Statistics, comprising representatives 
of the EEA central banks 
and statistical institutes, 
the European Commission and the EMI, and through membership 
of other international committees, working parties and 
task forces. 2.4 Payment systems 
One of the main tasks 
of the EM1 is to prepare the framework 
to enable 
the ESCB to promote the efficiency and soundness 
of cross-border payments from 
the start of Stage Three. In this respect, the Treaty does 
not distinguish between large-value and 
retail payments. However, preparatory 
work up to now 
has focused 
on large-value payments, which are 
the core elements of payment systems in modern economies. 
Less attention has been devoted to retail payments (since 
the level of risk involved is 
lower) and, so 
far, to securities settlement systems. 
Analysis of the implications of the move to Stage Three 
in the field 
of payment systems was begun under the aegis of the Committee of Governors in 1992 
and has 
been continued 
by the EMI. In November 1994 
the EM1 issued a note on "The 
EMl's intentions with regard to cross-border payments 
in Stage Three" which 
was communicated through the central banks to 
the national banking communities. 
At present, payment relations between 
EU countries rely mainly 
on correspondent 
banking. Although the traditional drawbacks 
in terms of rapidity and 
risk have diminished (and may continue to decrease 
in parallel with technological progress and 
the careful monitoring of risks), correspondent banking alone will not suffice to handle future 
large- value interbank payments 
or those stemming from 
the monetary policy operations of the ESCB. As with 
the present national systems, it must be possible to make large-value 
payments within 
the EMU area in central bank 
money through systems which meet 
very high standards 
of security, speed and efficiency. 
In accordance with 
the principles adopted at the national level, a high proportion 
of large-value payments in Stage Three 
will be effected in central bank 
money on a real-time gross basis 
in order to minimise the 
risks for participants and the payment system as a whole. 
An EMU-wide system will 
have to be established in 
order to 
enable the impact 
of monetary policy decisions to be transmitted quickly and efficiently to all participants 
in the unified money market which 
will cover all Member States participating in 
EMU. It is apparent that the time and resources required to 
design and implement 
any new system are such that preparatory 
work must start 
several years 
in advance. The 
EM1 and the EU central banks 
should provide the private sector 
with guidelines to enable it to make choices and plan its investments 
in the run-up to Stage Three. The development 
of an EMU-wide real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system 
should follow three basic principles which derive from 
the Treaty on European Union: efficiency, market-orientation and decentralisation. New payment arrangements offered 
by the ESCB should, in particular, enhance technical efficiency, minimise systemic 
risk and, as 
far as possible, 
be cost-effective. To be market-oriented, participation 
in the EMU-wide RTGS system 
will not be compulsory 
for credit institutions. Only transactions 
related to monetary policy operations will have 
to be processed through 
the proposed TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer) 
system. Other systems will remain for retail payments and 
may also 
remain for large- 
value ones, provided that these meet adequate safety standards which are 
not significantly lower than those 
of the EMU-wide RTGS system. Finally, following the 
decentralisation principle, 
the future system will be organised around infrastructures 
and settlement accounts 
to be maintained 
at the level 
of the national central banks. 
In accordance 
with these principles, 
the EU central banks and 
the EM1 have adopted a strategy based 
on a minimum harmonisation 
of national systems and a 
common infrastructure 
necessary to implement a new payment arrangement 
for Stage Three - the TARGET system. It will include 
one RTGS system 
in each country and 
an "interlinking" system 
- a web 
of infrastructures and procedures 
to be used to connect 
RTGS systems 
in order to process cross-border payments. 
The operational features 
of the system will be defined in the course 
of 1995 by the EM1 in close co-operation 
with EU 
central banks and other parties (such 
as credit institutions) which are involved 
in these issues. 
2.5 Preparation of European banknotes 
In the third stage 
of EMU a single currency will be issued 
by the ESCB, in particular in the form 
of banknotes that will replace the existing national 
ones. The 
EM1 has the specific task 
of supervising the technical preparation 
of these banknotes. 
The process of printing and issuing banknotes is a lengthy one, comprising a 
considerable lead time before a 
new banknote series is 
ready to be introduced as a 
replacement for an existing one. The replacement 
of all banknotes denominated 
in national currencies by a series 
of single-currency banknotes is a 
far more extensive 
undertaking, in terms of timing and problems 
to be addressed. As an indication, there 
were 12 billion banknotes in circulation 
at the end 
of 1994 in 
the fifteen Member States, 
with a further 
8 billion notes held 
in store. In 1994 6.5 billion new notes were printed for EU central banks. 
A few issues related to 
the preparation of European banknotes 
have already been 
addressed by the EMI, 
in particular with respect to the number and 
value of denominations and the boundary between coins and banknotes denominated in 
the single currency. First, with respect to the 
notelcoin boundary, a consensus 
has been 
reached that the highest value 
for coins would be 
ECU 2 and that 
ECU 5 would be 
the smallest denomination 
of banknote. This view is shared 
by the Mint Directors' Working 
Group, with which the 
EM1 has been co-operating closely. Second, with respect to 
the sequence, number and value 
of denominations of banknotes, the agreed working 
assumption is the sequence 1:2:5 and seven notes from 
ECU 5 to 
ECU 500. 
Third, the 
range of options regarding 
the appearance of European banknotes 
has been narrowed 
down to two: a completely identical 
banknote to be issued throughout the single monetary 
area; and banknotes which are identical 
on one side, but which 
have a limited national 
feature on 
the other. Further work is planned regarding the legal, institutional and organisational aspects 
of the issuing and post-issue handling 
of notes. Work has also started 
on the selection 
of themes on which 
to base the design 
of a banknote series. For this, the EM1 has set up 
an advisory committee consisting 
of experts in history, psychology 
and graphic design. 
European banknotes will 
have a technical specification incorporating the most 
advanced security features to prevent counterfeiting and to assist different user groups 
in readily recognising counterfeits. The 
specific purpose of each security feature will be 
carefully considered in order to integrate into 
the design those which will optimise the 
security effectiveness 
of the single-currency banknotes. 
Preparatory work is also continuing 
on the practical aspects 
of the launching 
of the new European banknotes. Several 
options are 
being examined, taking into 
account such 
matters as timing, technical feasibility, costs, 
public acceptability and political 
considerations. Since this 
is an area 
of crucial importance 
for the credibility and 
acceptability of the single currency, 
the EM1 is seeking close collaboration with 
the other competent bodies. 
2.6 Establishment of the ESCB The establishment of the ECB and 
the ESCB requires considerable preparatory 
work in several technical and institutional 
areas. One area where 
work has already started is that concerning 
the harmonisation of accounting procedures to make possible 
the construction of a consolidated balance sheet 
of the ESCB from 
the start of Stage Three. Indeed, harmonisation of accounting rules and standards is 
an indispensable prerequisite for the conduct 
of the single monetary policy and 
for the application 
of the ESCB Statute's provisions 
on the allocation 
of the monetary income 
of national central 
banks and 
on foreign exchange transfers. 
As a first step, 
an inventory of the accounting methodologies applied by EU central 
banks was made. 
This work laid the basis for the development 
of an accounting 
methodology for the EMI. This methodology elaborated on, inter 
alia, the principles 
for the valuation 
of assets and liabilities and 
for the recognition 
of income, a chart 
of accounts, capitalisation and depreciation rules, accounting techniques and control 
procedures. Work is now 
under way on 
preparing the ground for the harmonisation 
of accounting rules and standards 
in the ESCB. In developing 
an appropriate framework 
of accounting principles due regard must 
be given to 
the analytical and operational 
requirements for the proper functioning 
of monetary policy while also taking into account 
that an adaptable and transparent framework is desirable 
for all national central banks. 
Consideration has also been given to the 
legal issues involved 
in implementing the 
recommended harmonised accounting rules and standards in 
each Member State. 
Preparatory work is under way on the method of calculation of monetary income to 
ensure an equitable, controllable and transparent 
system. The time schedule 
for the preparatory 
work leaves sufficient room 
for national 
central banks 
to implement the recommendations endorsed by 
the EM1 Council including, 
if need be, through changes 
in domestic legislation. 
Another field where preparatory 
work for the establishment 
of the ESCB has started is the information and communications system needed between the ECB and the 
national central banks. A 
number of tasks of the ECB and ESCB 
have been identified 
for which information and communications systems need to 
be prepared. First, a flexible and effective teleconference facility will 
be required for the conduct of all ESCB activities in Stage Three. The present facility available 
to the EM1 is limited 
primarily by a 
lack of expansion capabilities. Second, the information systems need 
to be able to support 
the exchange of non-statistical information within 
the ESCB, such as that 
necessary for policy decisions 
by the ECB and 
for ensuring the effective operation 
of the single monetary policy in Stage Three. They 
also need to be able to support the 
exchange of statistical information, such 
as data from monetary and foreign 
exchange policy operations 
as well as data concerning accounting and note issue functions and the 
financial and economic data required 
to conduct the common monetary policy. 
Third, technical analysis 
has to be conducted on 
the extent to which the execution 
of open market operations and foreign exchange market intervention 
can be decentralised; the 
information systems 
for the conduct 
of such operations will 
have to be designed 
accordingly. Fourth, 
an adequate information systems architecture 
is needed for the ECB's foreign exchange management and foreign exchange operations. Finally, 
in order to be able to process large-value payments safely and efficiently in Stage Three 
- in particular those stemming from the implementation 
of the single monetary policy - adequate information and communications systems will have to 
be implemented to 
support the TARGET system, to 
be established by interlinking national RTGS systems. 
With the exception of the study on replacing the teleconference facility, 
specific development work on all the projects mentioned above can 
only commence when the relevant user requirements have been identified. 
It is intended that these functional 
requirements will 
be determined by 
the relevant EM1 sub-committees and working 
groups as soon as possible. 
3. Use of the ECU and oversight of the ECU Clearing 
and Settlement System 
3.1 Use of the private ECU 
in 1993 and 1994 
The use 
of the private ECU 
in 1993 and 1994 
was strongly influenced 
by developments in the economic, legal and institutional environment. The tensions 
in the ERM in the first 
half of 1993 created uncertainty over 
the development of interest rates 
and exchange rates 
of the basket components and therefore 
over those of the ECU, both in the immediate future 
and in the longer term. The widening of the ERM fluctuation 
bands to +15% on 2nd August 1993 heightened the markets' 
awareness of such risks. However, the ensuing gradual return to more orderly market conditions and the return 
of most currencies to levels within, 
or very close to, their former limits contributed to more 
stable market expectations. 
At the legal and institutional level, the end 
of the uncertainties surrounding the 
ratification of the Treaty on European Union, and its entry into force as 
of 1st November 1993, brought the prospects 
for EMU back to the fore. 
In accordance with Article 109g of the Maastricht Treaty, the composition 
of the ECU basket was frozen as from the coming into effect 
of the Treaty, reducing uncertainty about the future value 
of the ECU. In April 1994 the European Commission adopted three legal documents aimed 
at reassuring markets about 
the current and 
future legal status 
of the ECU in financial 
and other 
contracts. The package included a proposal 
for a Council Regulation consolidating 
existing legislation 
on the currency composition 
of the ECU basket, subsequently adopted 
by the Council, a Commission Recommendation on 
the legal treatment 
of the ECU and 
of contracts denominated in 
ECUs, and a Commission Explanatory Note 
on new clauses in 
its bond issue prospectuses ensuring 
legal continuity between the basket 
ECU and the 
future single 
currency. Notwithstanding the progress made on 
the legal and institutional framework, 
remaining uncertainties and adverse developments in bond markets world-wide 
for most of 1994 prevented a return to 
the more favourable conditions which had been enjoyed 
before the ERM turmoil. However, 
on the whole, the 
ECU markets have 
shown some resilience in the face 
of the difficult period 
of ERM tensions, the changing market 
perceptions regarding the timetable 
for EMU 
and, more recently, world-wide depressed 
bond markets.

by 9.2%, although they 
were still 3.5% 
larger than in September 1991. In the banking sector, 
ECU lending and borrowing activity 
has not yet 
recovered from the decline experienced in the second 
half of 1992. After having stagnated 
throughout the first three quarters 
of 1993, total outstanding amounts 
of ECU- denominated international bank assets and liabilities fell by 9.9% and 
9.7% respectively in the year up to end-September 1994. 
lnterbank transactions remained predominant, 
accounting for almost 70% 
of outstanding ECU-denominated assets and nearly 
85% of banks' liabilities. Given 
ttie expansion in international lending and borrowing activity, the 
ECU's market share dropped to 
2.7%, compared with 3.0% at end-September 1992. This 
downward movement occurred despite 
a sizable build-up of central banks' private 
ECU holdings. The ECU bond market also suffered from 
the ERM turmoil 
in 1992 and 1993. 
However, issuing activity, 
which had almost dried up 
in late 1992 and early 1993, resumed again thereafter. 
Led initially by EU Member States and institutions committed 
to developing 
the ECU markets and to maintaining satisfactory liquidity conditions, 
issuing activity has more recently also involved private sector participants. Nevertheless, 
activity remained subdued compared 
with the levels reached before the ERM crisis. 
Gross issuing fell slightly short 
of redemptions during 1993 and 
1994, leaving the total outstanding stock stagnating 
just below the end-September 1992 level. Secondary bond 
market liquidity, which had suffered in 
the second half of 1992, recovered partly 
thereafter. The number 
of market-makers in 
ECU bond transactions fell as 
a result of depressed market conditions. Only 
a few large 
ECU bond issues could be regarded 
as truly liquid by end-1994. Investors either shifted 
the maturity of their ECU holdings 
towards shorter maturities 
or closed their ECU positions to switch to other more liquid 
bond markets, particularly those in Deutsche Mark, French francs and US dollars. 
The relatively small market 
for ECU-denominated short and medium-term paper 
in the Euro-market 
was broadly flat in absolute terms throughout the reporting period, 
compared with well-sustained activity 
in other currencies, which led to 
a fall in market share. Outstanding amounts in domestic ECU Treasury bills were constant in 
the United Kingdom and declined in 
Italy. The evolution 
of the ECU derivatives markets mirrored developments in the 
underlying markets. Turnover in 
the MATlF long-term interest rate 
ECU bond futures 
contract had already settled down in 
early 1993 from 
its peak in 
1992 and was again 
approaching the levels seen before the ERM turmoil by 
the second quarter 
of 1994 before stabilising thereafter. In 
the LIFFE, three-month interest rate futures contracts 
recorded historically high turnover in the months preceding and following 
the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands. Thereafter, turnover fell back 
again but stabilised 
in the second half of 1994 around levels well above those recorded before the ERM tensions. 
In contrast with 
the second half of 1992, the ERM tensions 
in the first 
half of 1993 did not result in the emergence 
of a significant spread between the theoretical basket 
value and the market exchange rate 
of the ECU, except in the period before and after the 
widening of the ERM fluctuation bands 
when the spread rose 
to 150 
basis points. The 
gradual return to calmer exchange market conditions helped to narrow 
spreads substantially towards the end 
of 1993. From the second quarter 
of 1994 onwards, spreads widened again to 50 basis points and remained around this level until 
end- September 1994. In the last quarter 
of 1994 the spread was partly reabsorbed. The 
above-mentioned sell-off of ECU bonds in rather illiquid market conditions 
may help to 
explain this latter development. 
The spreads between 
the market and theoretical interest rates remained within a 
comparatively narrow 
range throughout 1993 and 1994. 
For short-term maturities 
(three- month Euro-deposit rates), 
the spread was alternatively positive and negative, 
remaining within a range 
of 50 basis points. 
For longer-term maturities, changes in the spread 
between market and theoretical yields traced contemporaneous developments 
in short- term interest rate spreads more 
closely than in 
the past. Until the first half of 1994, market rates were slightly below theoretical yields (in a range 
of 10 to 50 basis points); 
in the second half of 1994, virtually no spread 
was observed. Regarding the 
legal status of the ECU, a survey carried out by 
the former Committee of Governors in November 1993, following a comprehensive review by the 
EU Commission on the existence of regulatory obstacles to the use 
of the ECU, confirmed 
that in all but 
two EU Member States the 
ECU is formally regarded 
as a foreign currency. 
Furthermore, the lifting 
of remaining exchange restrictions on capital flows 
has reduced the differential treatment 
of foreign currencies, including 
the ECU, in relation to 
national currencies. Recently, several initiatives have been undertaken to improve 
the statistical coverage of the use 
of the ECU in non-financial transactions, 
the denomination of financial flows within 
the EU budget, and ECU-denominated transactions in balance-of- 
payments statistics. 
As one 
of these initiatives, in late 1994, the European Commission 
conducted a survey based on an analysis 
of the transactions which give rise 
to settlements processed through the 
ECU Clearing and Settlement System. The 
sample results suggest that the total yearly value 
of non-financial ECU transactions is 
equivalent to around ECU 
88 billion, which accounts 
for approximately 1% 
of all ECU transactions 
settled through 
the ECU Clearing and Settlement System. 
3.2 Oversight of the ECU 
Clearing and Settlement System 
The ECU Clearing and Settlement System was set 
up in February 
1986 and became fully operational in April 1987. 
It is a private system conceived and developed 
in order to 
replace the old clearing scheme 
for the settlement of ECU balances based 
on mutual settlement accounts denominated in the basket component currencies, 
which had been set up in 1982 by a small group 
of commercial banks active in the ECU market. It is 
the only system which processes and settles transactions 
in ECUs. Participating clearing 
banks process their 
own payment orders and those executed 
on behalf of their correspondent banks which maintain 
ECU accounts with them. Clearing banks settle their 
multilateral net positions through accounts held at 
the Bank for 
International Settlements.

45 clearing banks participated 
in the System, which processed about 
6,000 transactions per 
day with an average 
daily turnover of ECU 50 billion. The 
ECU Clearing and Settlement System is 
the third-largest automated net settlement system in 
the European Union after 
the EAF in Germany 
and CHAPS in the United Kingdom. The oversight 
of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System started 
in 1992 within 
the framework 
of the Committee 
of Governors. As of 
January 1994, 
the EM1 took over 
this responsibility 
by virtue of the tasks 
assigned by the Treaty. The oversight 
of the ECU Clearing and Settlement System has the fundamental objective 
of assuring EU central 
banks that: 
(a) the operations of the clearing do not 
pose unacceptable systemic risks 
either to the 
ECU market or 
to EU domestic markets; (b) the risks 
run by the banks by 
virtue of their participation in the 
system are controlled. 
Within this framework the 
EM1 seeks to ensure that 
the ECU Banking Association 
(EBA), which manages the System, 
takes action to reduce substantially the level 
of systemic risks involved. This policy is consistent with the risk reduction policies which are 
being followed 
by the EU central banks in their own countries. Through regular contacts 
with the EBA Secretariat, the 
EM1 receives information on 
the functioning of the clearing on a regular basis and keeps 
EU central banks informed 
of its findings. Direct 
discussions between the clearing banks and their respective central banks complement 
the action of the EMI. 
Over time there has been an intensive dialogue with the EBA 
and a series 
of steps have been taken towards improving compliance with the safety standards laid down in 
the 1990 Report 
on lnterbank Netting Schemes. 
The first measure, implemented 
in 1993, is a system of limits for the multilateral net positions which participants are allowed 
to incur at the end 
of each working day. 
The purpose of this measure is to encourage the 
banks to manage their payment flows better in order 
to reduce the risks they run and 
those they generate for other participants. These limits provide the basis for a liquidity 
sharing and loss sharing agreement designed 
to ensure the end-of-day settlement 
of the clearing, even 
in the event that 
the largest debtor bank 
is unable to settle its obligations 
at the end of the day. 
The present arrangements provide 
only for financial sanctions when limits 
are breached, but do not prevent the System from accepting a payment which would lead 
one clearing bank to exceed 
its limits. The EBA has therefore accepted 
the need to 
introduce binding intraday limits which will be enforced 
by June 1996 
on a continuous 
basis during the working day. Moreover, although the technical facility for intraday limits 
will not be fully implemented before June 1996, the capacity 
to monitor intraday positions 
will be in place sooner and should allow 
for an earlier voluntary agreement 
by the clearing 
banks not 
to exceed the limits. In addition to 
these measures, the 
EM1 Council has 
also drawn the attention of the EBA to the need to introduce collateral facilities in the 
settlement process and to the 
need to improve the 
legal basis of the clearing through 
contractual arrangements. 
Concerning the future 
of the ECU 
Clearing and Settlement System in Stage Three 
of EMU, the System may continue to operate 
in Stage Three as a private net settlement 
system in parallel 
to and competing with other systems provided that 
it complies with 
acceptable safety standards. 
4. Co-operation between central 
banks 4.1 Payment systems 
Co-operation between the national central banks in the field 
of payment systems 
has focused on three main issues: (a) 
the co-operative oversight 
of payment systems; 
(b) the achievement of minimum common features 
in domestic payment systems; and 
(c) prepaid cards. 
Co-operative oversight 
in the field 
of payment systems The central banks 
of the Member States oversee developments 
in their domestic 
interbank markets and 
in the payment and settlement systems 
which support these 
markets. This task stems directly from their primary function 
of provider of central bank 
money, the ultimate means 
of payment in 
the economy. The main objective 
of oversight is to 
seek to ensure the smooth functioning 
of payment systems and 
to protect the financial system from possible "domino effects" which 
may occur when one or 
more participants in the payment systems incur credit 
or liquidity 
problems. In contrast 
with banking supervision, payment systems oversight aims 
at a given system 
(e.g. a funds 
transfer system) rather than at individual participants. 
Principles for co-operative oversight 
of cross-border participation in domestic 
payment systems were established by EU central banks as a response 
to the challenges arising from 
the implementation of the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive 
(2BCD) adopted by the EC Council in 1988. The Directive laid down principles according 
to which primary responsibility 
for the supervision 
of branches of credit institutions authorised 
in another EU country was to be 
given to 
the authorities of the "home.country" (i.e. the Member State 
in which the credit institution has been incorporated), while limited 
competence was to be left to authorities 
of the "host country" (i.e. the Member State 
where the payment system 
is located). As of end-November 1994, 
162 branches of foreign credit institutions participated directly 
in other EU large-value funds transfer 
systems, including 107 branches 
of banks of other EU countries and 
55 branches of non- EU banks. Without co-operative oversight, the "host" central banks could 
have lacked the 
information needed for the purpose 
of overseeing their country's payment system, which 
was previously obtained from the direct supervision 
of those foreign branches. 
Arrangements for co-operation among 
the various authorities 
were established in 
1993 within 
the framework of the Committee 
of Governors. They consisted 
of general agreements governing 
the exchange of information between central banks and other 
banking supervisors within 
the limits of the secrecy obligations 
of supervisors. It was agreed that 
under normal circumstances 
the exchange of information across borders 
would only take place between central banks 
or between bank supervisors, 
and that an "Observatory" of EU Payment Systems would 
be established at the 
EMI. The Observatory, which 
was created in September 1994, collects and despatches 
information with a low degree of confidentiality, and keeps up-to-date records on: the 
operational rules 
of member countries' interbank funds transfer systems; the 
list of senior managers at EU central banks who 
may be contacted should problems arise 
in the field of payment systems, in 
order to facilitate the flows 
of information between central banks 
especially in the event of crisis situations; and cross-border participants (and remote 
participants, if any) in 
EU interbank funds transfer systems. 
Definition of the minimum common features for 
EU payment systems 
A comparative analysis 
of payment systems in 
the EU was conducted by the 
Committee of Governors in 
1992 and is contained in a report, published in September 
1992, on "Payment Systems in EC Member States", also known as the "Blue Book" 
(a new edition of which will 
be published in 1996). The report revealed significant differences 
among EU countries' large-value funds transfer systems, especially 
in terms of access conditions, risk control measures, legal and technical aspects, pricing policies and 
opening hours. Differences between domestic interbank payment systems can affect the 
smoothness of cross-border payments and distort competitive conditions. They 
may also 
create risks for 
the integrity and stability 
of domestic and cross-border payment 
arrangements since the integrity 
of the system as a whole depends on its 
weakest element. Finally, differences 
may create opportunities 
for regulatory arbitrage, inducing 
participants to effect their payments through 
less costly but possibly insufficiently 
protected systems. The effects 
of these distortions 
may increase in a unified monetary 
area. To 
avert these risks, it 
is necessary that interbank funds transfer systems 
share certain minimum common features 
on which the integrity and security 
of the systems as a whole 
depend. The EU central banks' objectives 
in this field are described in the report 
on "Minimum common features 
for domestic payment 
systems", published by the Committee of Governors in November 1993. The report sets 
out ten principles 
for the harmonisation of domestic systems, relating to access, risk control and legal, technical 
and operational characteristics. 
The most important line 
of action, with a view to minimising 
the systemic risk inherent in interbank payment circuits, is to establish in all member countries a real-time 
gross settlement (RTGS) system 
for large-value payments. This type 
of system makes 
it possible to eliminate 
the risks stemming from the 
delay between payment 
message transfer and settlement inherent 
in net settlement systems. In 
addition, it provides 
an important facility 
not only for the ultimate settlement 
of obligations arising from 
transactions routed via 
other netting systems 
but also for a variety 
of different forms 
of delivery-versus-payment arrangements in securities markets and 
in foreign exchange markets. Furthermore, real-time gross settlement systems will be linked so 
as to build 
an EMU-wide RTGS system 
for Stage Three. 
A second line 
of action is to 
allow large-value net settlement systems, which settle 
via central bank accounts, to continue operating in parallel with RTGS systems, provided 
that they settle on a same-day basis and meet 
fully the safety standards set 
out in the 
Report on lnterbank Netting Schemes, published by the 
Bank for 
International Settlements in 1990. 
A third line of action emphasises the need to set standards to control access to 
payment systems. Access to interbank funds transfer systems should 
be strictly restricted to credit institutions subject to supervision, as defined in the 
2BCD, some public entities and some adequately supervised financial institutions, because 
only these institutions are able to meet appropriate standards 
in terms of financial strength, 
management skills and the ability to provide liquidity within a 
very short period 
of time. No discrimination between home-based credit institutions and credit institutions authorised in 
other EU countries should exist 
in this field. Moreover, transparent requirements for 
access, as well as procedures 
for excluding or suspending participants from a system, 
should be set out in a 
public document. Finally, 
other principles concerning 
the legal basis of domestic payment systems, the need 
for compatible banking standards and 
efficient channels 
of communication between domestic payment systems, central banks' 
pricing policies and 
the operating hours 
of the major 
EU payment systems are discussed 
in the above-mentioned 
report. With the help of EU central banks, the 
EM1 conducted a general assessment 
of the main features 
of EU interbank funds transfer systems vis-a-vis 
the principles set out 
in the November 1993 report. 
The main results are contained in a report 
on "Developments in EU payment systems 
in 1994", which represents 
the follow-up to 
the 1993 report and 
was released to the banking communities 
in February 1995. The report confirms that the most important 
work currently in progress in the field 
of payment systems is 
the design and implementation 
of RTGS systems in all 
EU countries. Although RTGS systems are 
in operation in 
only six 
countries and most 
large- value payments are settled through net settlement systems, it is now envisaged that 
RTGS systems 
for large-value payments 
will be in operation 
in all EU countries but 
two by end-1996. 
In nine EU countries RTGS systems are expected 
to process all large-value 
payments by that time. Therefore, co-operation should continue between credit 
institutions and central banks in 
order to avoid delays in the implementation 
of these systems, in particular in view 
of the realisation 
of the TARGET system in Stage Three. 
Risk control measures have been introduced 
in some net settlement systems. In 
some countries such systems are likely to disappear, 
at least for large-value transfers, 
when RTGS systems are 
fully operational. Moreover, 
new fields of action for the EM1 and EU central banks have been 
envisaged. First, the conditions under which credit 
institutions which have no physical presence in a Member State 
can become direct 
participants in that country's payment system (the "remote 
access" issue) requires further 
study. Second, 
work will continue 
in order to ensure that the legal basis 
of domestic payment systems is sound and 
enforceable. Work is currently in progress in 
order to eliminate by 1996 current uncertainties within, and inconsistencies between, domestic 
legal systems. 
Finally, closer attention will be paid to 
the issues related to retail payments, 
in keeping with 
the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, which entrust 
the EM1 with the task 
of "promoting the efficiency 
of cross-border payments" ahead 
of Stage Three. In 
particular, the EM1 will encourage the banks to avoid the proliferation 
of non-compatible standards. Prepaid cards 
The multi-purpose prepaid card 
(or electronic purse) 
is a 
plastic card which contains effective purchasing power for 
which the customer has paid 
in advance. Cards 
which can be used for one 
purpose only (e.g. telephone cards) 
or for a limited range of services (e.g. within the premises of a corporation) are 
not considered as being in this 
category. Although developments 
in the field of electronic purses are 
only at an 
early stage, there is a 
real possibility 
of the proliferation of such cards 
in the future. In particular, if electronic purses were used in a 
great number 
of retail outlets, they would 
become a 
direct competitor 
not only to other cashless 
payment instruments but also to 
banknotes and coins issued by 
central banks and 
other monetary authorities. 
Given the 
potential of prepaid cards to attain widespread acceptance, 
the matter 
has been 
analysed by the 
EM1 and the EU central banks. 
A report 
on prepaid 
cards was released to the banking 
community and to the other interested institutions in May 
1994. The analysis set out in 
the report had two objectives: (a) 
to check that the introduction of this new 
payment instrument would 
have no 
adverse effect on public confidence 
in the 
payment system 
and in payment 
media; and (b) to evaluate the practical implications 
of the possible developments of prepaid cards 
on central banks' activities. The most important conclusion of the analysis is that the 
right to issue electronic purses should be limited to credit institutions 
in order to: (a) 
protect consumers from the 
consequence of the failure of the issuers; (b) protect the integrity of retail payment systems; (c) facilitate the conduct of monetary policy; 
and (d) ensure fair competition 
between issuing institutions. 
In the 
case of prepaid card schemes 
already in operation 
before May 
1994, the respective national central bank may agree 
that electronic purse issuers do not 
have to be fully-fledged credit institutions provided that: 
first, they 
provide only domestic 
payment services; second, they are subject 
to appropriate regulations, 
in particular with respect 
to liquidity requirements; and, third, 
they are 
supervised by the national authority 
responsible for supervising credit institutions. 
Under the aegis 
of the EMI, EU central banks will continue to exchange information 
on any major 
prepaid card scheme and 
monitor the development of this new payment instrument. 4.2 Banking supervision 
According to the EM1 Statute, it 
is a 
primary task 
of the EM1 to "hold consultations 
concerning issues falling within 
the competence 
of the national central 
banks and affecting the 
stability of financial institutions and markets". 
While responsibility for 
executing prudential supervision remains within 
the competence 
of national authorities, 
the EM1 is entrusted 
with the task of promoting co-operation on issues 
of a macro- prudential nature having a 
bearing on 
the stability of financial institutions and 
markets. To fulfil this duty the EM1 is assisted by 
the Banking Supervisory Sub-Committee, which 
is composed of representatives of central banks and 
specialised supervisory bodies. 
In 1993-94 the consultations among national supervisory authorities 
dealt with a number 
of issues including: (a) the implementation 
of the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive; 
(b) crisis management; (c) insolvency; (d) financial fragility; (e) central credit registers. 
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive 
(2BCD) On 1st January 1993 the 2BCD was implemented, thereby setting up the Single 
Market for the banking sector. This Directive provides EU-based credit institutions 
with the freedom to 
supply financial services throughout 
the European Union via the 
establishment of branches and on a cross-border basis. In this context, supervisory 
activity is based on the principle 
of "home country control", according to which the 
responsibility for supervision rests primarily 
with the authorities 
of the Member State 
where the credit institution has been authorised. This principle 
is also applicable to credit 
institutions which have been authorised 
by countries which are parties to 
the EEA Agreement (except 
in cases where different reciprocity provisions vis-a-vis third countries 
exist). The implementation 
of this principle requires close co-operation between 
the home and the host country supervisory authorities. This objective has been pursued 
by means of bilateral agreements (memoranda 
of understanding) between the supervisory 
authorities of the Member States. The consultations among supervisory bodies 
have devoted considerable attention to the analysis 
of several policy aspects related to the 
practical implementation 
of the Directive that have arisen in particular 
in the course of the completion of the memoranda of understanding. Crisis management 
Against the background 
of the implementation 
of the 2BCD and the difficulties faced by some international banks, consideration has been given to issues related to the 
origin of banking crises and their management from the perspective 
of the supervision of EU-based credit institutions. 
In particular, the exchange 
of views focused on the need 
for both the sharing of information among banking supervisors and the co-ordination 
of supervisory action 
in an emerging crisis situation, given that the memoranda 
of understanding deal 
mainly with exchanges 
of information on 
an ongoing basis and to a 
lesser extent 
with co-operation in the management of banking crises. 
Although every crisis has unique features and 
has to 
be managed in 
the light of the particular circumstances, 
it was deemed to 
be worthwhile to draw up a set 
of principles to assist banking supervisors 
who are confronted 
with an emerging crisis involving a 
bank with a multiple presence 
in the European Union. One of the main principles 
is that the 
home country supervisor should 
be the 
co-ordinator ("lead supervisor") 
of the information flows and 
any supervisory action. 
To be fully effective these principles have to take 
account of the action 
of non-EU supervisors 
in cases where credit institutions engage 
in operations outside the European Union. 
In the context of the management of banking crises, the interface between the 
banking supervisory activity and the "lender 
of last resort" function has been analysed 
with the aim 
of providing a descriptive survey 
of the current situation in the Member 
States. Insolvency issues 
Consultations dealt with 
aspects relating to 
the orderly liquidation of a bank with a 
multiple presence 
in the European Union. It was recognised that 
the different judicial arrangements and insolvency procedures in 
each Member State 
may create difficulties 
for the co-ordination 
of supervisory action. First, there is the question 
of the consistency between 
the principle according to 
which the main responsibility 
for the prudential supervision 
of branches rests 
with the home supervisor and insolvency proceedings, which remain subject 
to national legislation. In particular, the EU countries' supervisors, as host authorities, 
do not all 
have identical powers to initiate action against a branch 
of a foreign bank, 
which could represent an obstacle to 
the co-ordination of activity with supervisors in 
other Member States. Second, insolvency proceedings initiated against a bank in the home country 
may not be recognised in 
other jurisdictions where 
this bank has branch operations. Third, the 
existence of various liquidation regimes which entail a different treatment 
of assets (the 
single-entity and separate-entity approaches) 
may result in discrimination among 
depositors in the 
Member States. These issues were submitted to the Council 
of the European Communities by 
the Chairman of the Committee of Governors, who urged that 
work be continued as a matter 
of priority on the proposal for a Winding-Up Directive with a view to establishing 
harmonised insolvency arrangements across 
the European Union. Given the fact that 
insolvency proceedings 
may involve countries outside 
the European Union, the parallel 
work carried out in this field 
by the Basle Committee 
on Banking Supervision 
was also taken into account. 
Financial fragility 
The financial fragility 
of credit institutions (the existence 
of actual or prospective pressures which could undermine the financial soundness 
of an institution), is 
at the core 
of the supervisory function. Difficulties experienced 
by an individual institution 
may affect other banks in a 
way which could threaten 
the banking system as a whole (systemic risk). 
In the context 
of the consultative process, a survey has been conducted 
on the ways 
in which financial fragility manifests itself 
in the banking system and 
the related effects. 
One of the main findings 
which emerges from this analysis is that 
the degree of fragility within 
the banking system 
may have increased significantly over the past few 
years. Particular attention has been devoted to the fact that credit risk remains 
the principal category 
of risk to which credit institutions are exposed 
and has been the primary source 
of losses. In a changing operating environment, credit institutions 
are confronted with 
intensified competitive pressures, 
not only 
within the banking system itself but 
also, to some extent, from 
non-bank financial institutions. Traditional lending activities 
are carried out in a more competitive context and this may 
be leading to a longer-term 
weakening of credit institutions' profitability. Moreover, 
the competitive pressures, along 
with technological developments, induce credit institutions to move 
away from traditional 
banking business and to search 
for profit opportunities 
in new areas of activity (securities, 
derivatives, non-financial instruments, etc.), which expose them to a wide range 
of potential risks. The rapid evolution 
of the financial system poses new challenges 
for the supervisory function, which is required to assess the 
adequacy of the credit institutions' 
strategy in 
the light of their management resources and overall market conditions. 
In this respect, the above-mentioned survey highlights some supervisory concerns which arise 
from an analysis 
of the banks' responses to market forces. 
In the light of the outcome of the survey, it 
was decided to undertake further 
work in this field, focusing on 
the changes which have occurred over the past few years in the 
ways in 
which banks manage their credit risk, with particular regard to their risk selection, 
pricing and monitoring activities. In future, attention will 
be given to the 
early warning signals of financial fragility 
and the factors which could affect 
the competitive viability 
of banks in the long term. 
Central credit registers 
An analysis of the features and functions 
of central credit registers 
(CCRs) in the 
Member States and 
the impact of the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive on their 
potential effectiveness represented another issue 
for discussion. In 1994 a six-month experiment was conducted among 
the credit registers 
of five countries (Belgium, France, Germany, 
Italy and Spain) to exchange information 
on borrowers for supervisory purposes. 
The experiment proved successful and it 
was therefore decided to continue the sharing 
of information on a permanent basis; this 
will include the 
other two EU countries which maintain credit registers (Austria and Portugal), 
as soon as 
they overcome a number 
of legal problems. 
In order to allow Member States which 
do not 
have a credit register to assess the 
usefulness of such an instrument, these countries will 
be permitted as an 
experiment to 
have access 
- free of charge, for a limited period 
of six months and 
only for 
supervisory purposes - to the data held 
in the registers; in return, these countries will have 
to provide data on large exposures, 
if requested to do so 
by their counterparties. 
Most of the CCRs are designed 
to provide data 
for the reporting 
banks, since this 
is deemed to 
be an integral part 
of the supervisory process. The information contained 
in the registers 
may actually be used by banks to improve their credit 
risk management procedures. Therefore, the technical and legal problems which prevent 
the reporting banks from having access to the registers on a cross-border basis are being analysed 
with a view 
to finding some solutions. 
5. Other tasks 
5.1 Operational tasks (EMSIEMCF) Pursuant to 
Article 109f (2) of the Treaty, 
the EM1 took over the tasks previously 
performed by 
the European Monetary Co-operation 
Fund (EMCF) with effect from 1st 
January 1994. These tasks relate to 
the administration of the mechanisms of the European Monetary System (EMS) (the 
Very Short-Term Financing mechanism, the 
Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism, the creation 
of ECUs for the purpose 
of implementing the EMS Agreement), and the administration 
of borrowing and 
lending operations concluded 
by the Community 
under the Medium-Term Financial 
Assistance mechanism. In accordance 
with Article 1.3 of the Statute 
of the EMI, all assets and liabilities 
of the European Monetary Co-operation Fund (EMCF) were automatically transferred to the 
EM1 with effect from 
1st January 1994. However, 
the administrative aspects 
of the EMl's operational functions have 
so far 
been performed by the BIS on 
the basis of an agreement between the latter 
and the EMI. As from May 1995 this administrative function 
will be fully taken over 
by the EMI. EMS mechanisms The EM1 carries out operations associated with 
the creation, utilisation and 
remuneration of official ECUs. This involves, in particular, swap operations with the EU 
central banks participating in 
the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), 
or contributions of reserve assets against official ECUs 
on a voluntary basis. 
As a result 
of these swaps, official ECUs are issued 
to participating central banks against the contribution 
of 20% of their gold holdings and gross 
US dollar reserves. These swap operations are renewed 
every three months, 
which allows for the necessary adjustments to 
be made in order to: first, ensure that 
each central bank's contribution to the 
EM1 continues to represent at 
least 20% 
of its gold and US dollar reserve holdings at 
the end of the month preceding 
the renewal 
date; and, 
second, take account 
of changes in the price 
of gold and in the 
US dollar exchange rate vis-a-vis 
the ECU. The results 
of these operations are shown 
in the Annual Accounts enclosed with this 
Report. The amount 
of official ECUs issued 
by the EM1 under the last three-month swap 
transaction within 
the period of reference, which took place on 
1 lth October 1994, reached ECU 56.6 billion. Compared with 
end-1993, the stock of ECUs created through 
swaps rose 
by more than 
ECU 3 billion. This increase 
was primarily due to a rise 
in contributing central 
banks' US dollar assets and in the price 
of gold, while a decrease 
in the US dollarIECU exchange rate 
was a negative contributory 
factor. Given their status 
of "Other Holders" 
of ECUs, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank 
and the 
Swiss National Bank acquired 
ECUs through swap operations with some EU 
central banks; at end-1994 the official ECUs held 
by the two central banks amounted 
to ECU 60 and 63.5 million respectively. 
Following the accession of Austria, Finland 
and Sweden to the EU on 1st January 
1995, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Suomen Pankki and Sveriges Riksbank 
became parties to 
the Agreement of 13th March 1979 laying down the operating 
procedure for the European Monetary System (EMS) and the Agreement 
of 9th February 
1970 setting 
up the Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism 
(STMS). The 
Oesterreichische Nationalbank became a member 
of the ERM, with effect 
from 9th January 1995, which entailed its participation in 
the ECU swap mechanism 
from that date; its status of "Other Holder" was consequently terminated. While Suomen Pankki 
and Sveriges Riksbank decided not 
to participate for 
the time 
being in the ERM, they 
expressed their intention 
to make voluntary contributions 
of gold and US dollars against 
ECUs to the 
EMI. Suomen Pankki made 
its initial voluntary contribution 
on the occasion 
of the quarterly renewal 
of swaps on 
l 1 th January 1995. 
In addition 
to the creation 
of official ECUs, 
the EM1 also deals with 
the utilisation of the participating central banks' ECU holdings. This involves transfers 
of official ECUs 
between the 
central banks' 
ECU reserve accounts, 
in particular in respect 
of the settlement of debts and claims arising 
from intervention funded through the 
Very Short- Term Financing mechanism 
(VSTF), voluntary transactions between the central banks 
participating in 
the EMS, the payment 
of interest calculated on central banks' net 
ECU positions and operations under the ECU mobilisation mechanism. 
The latter mechanism 
has not been activated since 1986. 
The EM1 records in 
its books - in ECUs 
- the debts and claims vis-a-vis the 
EM1 of the EU central banks participating in 
the ERM, which arise from intervention carried out 
by those central banks in other member countries' currencies and funded through the 
VSTF. It also records 
the settlement of these balances under 
the VSTF. No use 
was made of the VSTF in 1994. Following an early repayment by 
the Banque de France, 
all remaining debtor 
and creditor accounts were closed in January 1994. 
The EM1 enters in its books the operations carried out in the framework 
of the Short-Term Monetary Support mechanism (STMS), which was established 
to enable a 
participating central bank 
to apply for short-term financial support in case 
of need as a 
consequence of a temporary balance-of-payments deficit, 
due to 
unforeseen difficulties 
or to conjunctural divergences. However, this facility has not been activated since 1974. 
Community loans In accordance with Article 
10 of Council Regulation 
(EEC) No. 
1969188 of 
24th June 1988, 
the EM1 administers the borrowing 
and lending operations concluded 
by the Community under the Medium-Term Financial Assistance mechanism. 
The mechanism provides for loans 
to be granted to Member States which are experiencing or are 
seriously threatened with difficulties 
in their balance 
of payments (current or capital 
account). The 
EM1 effects payments arising from these borrowing and lending operations. 
It verifies the maturity dates laid down 
in the borrowing and lending contracts 
for the payment of interest and repayment 
of the principal and reports to 
the Commission on the operations carried 
out for 
the account 
of the EU. In 1994 
the EM1 continued to receive from borrowers, namely Greece and Italy, 
and to 
pay to creditors vis-a-vis the Community, the sums due in respect 
of interest, commission and expenses 
on outstanding loans. The following table shows, as 
at 31st December 1994, the total of outstanding Community lending operations. 
Table 12 Outstanding Community loans

Source: EM1 Greece Italy Total 5.2 Advisory functions 
Article 109f (6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and 
Article 5.3 
of the Statute of the EM1 require that 
the EM1 be consulted by the Council 
of the European Union 
or the responsible national authorities, as appropriate, on 
any proposed Community or national legislation within 
its field of competence. The limits and conditions 
of consultations on draft legislation 
by national authorities are set out in Council Decision 
9317171EEC of 22nd November 1993. Article 1 
of this Decision states that "Member 
States shall consult the 
EM1 in particular on: 
Outstanding amounts 
in Deutsche Mark 
536 3,900 4,436 - currency legislation, the status 
of the ECU and means 
of payment; - the status and powers 
of national central banks and 
the instruments of monetary policy; Outstanding amounts 
in ECUs 740 1,975 2,715 - the collection, compilation and dissemination 
of monetary, financial, banking and 
balance-of- payments statistics; 
Total outstanding 
amounts in ECUs 
1,021 4,022 5,043 - clearing and payment systems, in particular 
for cross-border transactions; 
- rules applicable to financial institutions, insofar as they influence the stability 
of financial institutions and markets". 
Twelve requests 
for consultations were received 
in 1994: five came from the 
Council of the European Union and seven originated from national authorities. 
The consultations from the Council 
of the European Union concerned: a Council 
Regulation on the consolidation 
of the existing Community legislation 
on the definition of the ECU following the entry into force 
of the Treaty of the European Union; a Council 
Regulation on Community action in the field 
of statistics; an amendment 
of a Directive 
on a solvency ratio 
for credit institutions 
as a result 
of the acceptance of various forms 
of (bilateral) contractual netting; 
an amendment of a Directive on Undertakings 
for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS); and 
an amendment of a Council 
Decision establishing a Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance-of-Payments 
Statistics. Out of the seven consultations by national authorities, 
four dealt with the status 
and powers 
of national central banks 
or instruments of monetary policy, whilst 
in two cases the stability 
of financial institutions and markets 
was involved. The EMl's benchmark for the assessment 
of the consultations was primarily the 
compatibility of the proposed legislation 
with the Treaty establishing the 
European Community, whilst 
the potential impact 
on future arrangements 
for Stage Three 
of EMU and, in appropriate cases, 
the question as to whether the stability 
of financial institutions 
and markets would 
be affected by the legislation were also examined. 
5.3 Co-operation with other institutions 
In the 
performance of its tasks the 
EM1 co-operates with other 
bodies of the European Union in a number 
of forms and 
on an number of levels. According to 
Article 11 .l and 11.2 of the Statute, the President 
of the Council 
of the European Union and a member 
of the European Commission may participate in 
the EM1 Council meetings, without the right to 
vote. In turn, the President 
of the EM1 shall be invited 
to attend meetings 
of the Council 
of the European Union 
whenever matters relating to the 
objectives and tasks 
of the EM1 are discussed. This includes the President's attendance 
at informal ECOFIN Council meetings, 
normally held twice a 
year. The President of the EM1 may also appear before 
the competent committees 
of the European Parliament 
at the request 
of the European Parliament 
or on his own initiative. 
At the working level, 
the EM1 is invited to attend 
the meetings of the Monetary Committee as an observer. Co-operation linkages exist also 
with the European Commission, including EUROSTAT 
(its statistical office) and through the Committee 
on Monetary, Financial and Balance-of-Payments Statistics. Furthermore, the 
EM1 co- operates with the national Mint Directors, representing the institutions 
which are 
responsible for producing the coins 
which will 
be circulated alongside 
the single European banknotes in Stage 
Three. Contacts also exist 
with several institutions outside the Community. 
For example, 
within the framework of the "concertation procedure", which provides 
for an exchange of data on exchange market developments, intervention and other official foreign 
exchange transactions, the Foreign Exchange Sub-Committee regularly exchanges information 
with non-EU central banks 
- essentially central banks which 
are members of the Group 
of Ten countries. The linkages 
with the central banks 
of Norway and Switzerland that 
had been 
established under the Committee 
of Governors have been continued and consultations 
on matters of coinmon interest have been held regularly. Furthermore, bilateral swap 
agreements with 
the central bank 
of Norway, which were concluded 
for the first time 
in December 1990 
in order to provide access 
to short-term funds 
for the implementation 
of Norway's exchange rate policy, were extended 
for a further one-year period 
at the end 
of 1 994. The EM1 maintains a range 
of important links with 
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which since 1964 has provided the human and technical resources for 
the functioning of the 
Secretariat of the 
Committee of Governors and provided technical 
support for the setting-up of the EMI. After 
the move of the EM1 to Frankfurt, 
the co- operation has continued, in particular in 
the statistical field. The BIS has continued to 
perform the function 
of Agent for the EM1 on an interim basis (see Section 
5.1 above). The EM1 has also established contacts with 
the Bretton Woods institutions: the 
EM1 has been invited to attend the Annual Meetings 
of the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the World Bank 
as an 
observer. At the technical level, co-operation between 
the IMF and the 
EM1 takes place in 
the field of statistics and in the framework 
of the IMF's increasing emphasis on regional surveillance. 
CHAPTER Ill INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES 
OF NATIONAL CENTRAL BANKS 
INTRODUCTION The Treaty implies that several institutional features 
of national central banks 
have to be modified in the course 
of the realisation 
of EMU. In accordance 
with Article 
108 of the Treaty, each Member State shall ensure, 
at the latest 
at the date of the establishment of the ESCB, that its national legislation including 
the statute of its national central bank is 
compatible with the Treaty and 
the Statute of the ESCB.' Article 109e (5) stipulates that 
the process leading to 
the independence of central banks should start during Stage 
Two. The prohibition on central banks extending overdrafts 
or any other type 
of credit to the 
public sector provided 
for in Article 104 
of the Treaty applies as from 
the start of Stage Two (see Article 
109e (3) of the  treat^).^ Furthermore, any measure granting privileged 
access by 
public bodies to financial institutions should 
have been eliminated by 1st 
January 1994. A. STATUTES AND INDEPENDENCE 
Before the start of Stage Three, the statutes 
of the central banks 
of the Member 
States have to 
be adapted in order to 
be compatible with those of the ESCB, in particular 
in respect 
of the provisions concerning independence and the primary objective 
of promoting price stability. Progress towards compatibility 
with the Treaty is a matter 
on which the EM1 is required to report to the Council 
of the European Union 
in accordance with Article 109j (1). The 
EM1 envisages producing a first report 
of this kind 
in the autumn 
of 1995 under Article 7 of the EM1 Statute. The Treaty on European Union lays down a clear mandate 
for the ESCB to 
maintain price stability. 
To fulfil this mandate, it is important that 
the decision-making authorities of the ESCB are not subject to directives from other bodies 
which could conflict with this objective. 
In consequence, the Statute 
of the ESCB lays down a number 
of provisions to 
ensure that 
the System will 
be independent in the performance of its assigned tasks. 
In particular, the Statute specifies that 
the ECB, the national central banks and 
any member of their decision-making bodies shall 
act without receiving instructions from national 
or Community authorities. Moreover, the Statute guarantees that members 
of the decision- making bodies 
are provided with assured tenure to carry 
out their duties. In addition 
to the provisions specifying political 
or institutional independence, the economic or practical independence of the System is confirmed 
by functional, operational and financial 
provisions embodied in 
the Statute. ' This provision does 
not apply to the United Kingdom as long as it does not participate in the third stage 
of EMU (see Sections 
5 and 11 
of the Protocol 
on certain provisions relating 
to the United Kingdom). Furthermore, the 
Decision taken by the Heads 
of State or of 
Government at their Edinburgh Summit meeting 
on l lth and 12th December 1992 
Implies that Denmark (which has given notification that 
it will not participate 
in Stage Three 
of EMU) will retain its existing powers in the field 
of monetary policy according 
to its national laws and regulations, 
including the powers 
of Danmarks Nationalbank in the field 
of monetary policy. 
Subject to Section 11 of the Protocol 
on certain provisions relating 
to the United Kingdom, which grants the 
Government the right 
to maintain its "ways and means" facility 
with the Bank 
of England as long as 
the United Kingdom does 
not participate in Stage Three 
of EMU. The Protocol 
on Portugal also provides 
for a temporary exemption for the interest-free overdraft 
facllity of the Autonomous Regions 
of Azores and Madeira 
with the Banco de Portugal. 
1. Highlights of institutional changes in 1993 and 
1994 The 1992 Annual Report 
of the Committee 
of Governors (Chapter 
Ill and Annex II) contained a description 
of the institutional features 
of the central banks 
with particular focus on their independence. A summary 
of these features 
was given in Table 
7 of that Report. Since 1992, various national central banks have undergone changes in their 
institutional features in preparation 
for Stage Three in order to comply 
with the requirements of the Treaty. The two most important examples are 
the Banque de France and 
the Banco de Espaiia. The legislation regarding 
the National Bank of Belgium, the Deutsche 
Bundesbank, the Banca d'ltalia and the Nederlandsche Bank was 
also adjusted. 
The legal regime 
of the Banque de France was amended by 
Acts 93-980 of 4th August 1993 and 93-1 
444 of 31 st 
December 1993, which came into effect on 1 
st January 1994. These 
new laws deal with independence in the conduct 
of monetary policy and the 
prohibition of central bank financing of public institutions. The formulation and 
implementation of monetary policy is the responsibility 
of the "Conseil de 
la politique monetaire", which must not 
seek or 
receive instructions from the Government. A 
representative of the Government 
may attend meetings 
of the Conseil, but 
without voting 
or vetoing rights. Members 
of the Conseil are subject 
to exclusivity and secrecy rules, 
and their appointment and substitution are precisely defined. The Conseil deals purely 
with monetary policy decisions, whilst a "Conseil General" exercises all 
other management responsibilities at the Banque 
de France. The "Conseil General" comprises 
the members 
of the "Conseil de 
la politique monetaire" plus 
one Government representative and one representative 
of the staff. The status 
of the Banco de Espaiia 
was amended by 
Act 1311994 of 1st June 1994 on 
the Autonomy of the Banco 
de Espaiia. This law had the explicit purpose 
of introducing the provisions 
of the Treaty on European Union on monetary policy and the 
independence of central banks. The law, therefore, sets price stability as 
the primary objective of monetary policy and gives 
the Bank full capacity and independence to define 
and implement monetary 
policy. In particular, 
the law explicitly forbids the Government 
or any other public authority from giving instructions to 
the Bank regarding either the 
objectives or the implementation of monetary policy. Other provisions referring to the 
appointment, term of office and termination 
of the appointment 
of the Governor and 
Council members also reflect generally accepted requirements 
for the independence 
of decision-making bodies 
of central banks. The 
law also addresses 
other substantive matters: a 
new legal regime is laid down for the acts and decisions 
of the Bank and for its budgetary status; 
the responsibilities and functions 
of the Bank are determined 
in detail, with particular regard 
to the formulation and implementation 
of monetary policy and the 
Bank's relationship with the Government 
with respect to exchange rate policy; payment 
systems and issues concerning banknotes are also provided for. In 
other areas, however, the law does not entail significant changes in the status 
of the other functions that current 
legislation assigns to 
the Bank. In particular, the 
Bank's supervisory functions will still be 
regulated by Law 2611988 of 
29th July 1988 
on Discipline and Intervention 
of Credit Institutions, and other applicable legislation. 
In Italy, Law 82 
of 7th February 1992 
vested the 
authority to determine the discount rates in the 
Governor of the Banca d'ltalia (prior to this 
Law, discount rates were 
fixed by the Minister 
of the Treasury). 
Furthermore, Law 483 
of 26th November 1993 cancelled the permanent credit 
line granted to the 
Treasury by the Banca d'ltalia 
and gave to the Banca d'ltalia the 
responsibility for 
setting bank reserve requirements within 
given limits. In Belgium, a law of 22nd March 1993 
introduced provisions 
adjusting the competence of the Government in controlling the decisions 
and operations of the National Bank of Belgium. Prior 
to this 
law, while 
there was no right of instruction from 
political authorities, the Government 
Commissioner and 
the Minister 
of Finance each 
had the right of suspension and 
the right to oppose any decision of the Bank which was contrary 
to the interests 
of the State, the 
law or the statutes 
of the Bank. The new law 
restricted these suspension and opposition rights in matters concerning the definition 
and implementation of monetary policy, the 
conduct of foreign exchange operations, 
the holding and management of official foreign reserves, and the promotion 
of the smooth operation of payment systems. Such 
rights can now only be 
exercised when decisions 
in these matters are 
not in conformity with the 
law and the 
statutes of the Bank. Thus 
a high degree of autonomy of the Bank has 
been established 
in the field 
of monetary policy. 
In the 
Netherlands, a law of 9th December 1993 introduced 
a provision 
requiring the Government to obtain the advice of the Nederlandsche Bank in decisions concerning 
exchange rate 
arrangements or changes in central rates and to make such advice public. 
A law of 15th December 1994 
entrusted the 
supervision of exchange offices 
to the Nederlandsche Bank. 
2. Present features 
of European Union national central banks 
The 1992 Annual Report 
of the Committee 
of Governors included a 
detailed description of the institutional features 
of the national central banks 
of the Community Member States at the time. Table 13 below 
contains the 
basic institutional features of national central banks 
of the European Union. 
According to 
Article 7 of the EM1 Statute, a special report of the EM1 will analyse 
the institutional 
features of the national central 
banks and 
will assess 
the progress towards convergence 
in the statutory 
requirements to be fulfilled for national central banks to 
become an 
integral part 
of the ESCB. Table 13 Institutional features

3. Prospective changes 
in legislation In Luxembourg, a draft 
Law on the lnstitut Monetaire Luxembourgeois (IML) 
was submitted to Parliament in December 1993, the enactment of which 
is still pending. 
The draft states in 
its "Expose des Motifs" its purpose 
of implementing all Treaty 
provisions concerning Stage Two and also 
of introducing some features for national central banks 
which are to 
be set in place before 
Stage Three. The principal objective of 
the IML is to ensure price stability and its secondary objective to support the 
economic policy of the Luxembourg Government. A clear definition 
of the competences 
of the IML 
is also given, which include the definition and implementation 
of monetary policy. The 
IML is to conduct its affairs in accordance with the principle 
of a market economy. 
However, the monetary association between Belgium and Luxembourg will remain unchanged 
during Stage 
Two. The draft reflects Article 107 
of the Treaty 
and provides for the independence 
of the IML from Government by prohibiting instructions 
or guidelines from public 
authorities. Article 24 of the draft introduces 
the content of Article 104 
of the Treaty into national 
legislation by prohibiting 
all financial facilities to public administrations. Other articles 
of the draft reflect the contents 
of the system provided 
for in the Treaty for the ESCB, thus 
adapting national legislation to 
the requirements of Stage Three. The draft declares that 
additional legislation will 
be required in due time 
for Stage Three. Preliminary work has been undertaken 
in Finland to prepare a law introducing 
some provisions 
of the Treaty concerning national central banks, namely 
autonomy in monetary matters and the prohibition 
of monetary financing 
of the public sector. A draft is 
being examined 
by the Finnish Government and has not 
yet been submitted to 
Parliament. The draft 
law defines the primary objective 
of the Bank of Finland as being to 
"safeguard the value of the money" and the secondary objective as 
the attainment of other economic policy targets. It also provides 
for independence from Government, both 
by institutional amendments and by stating that no instructions may 
be requested or accepted from governmental authorities. 
The Nederlandsche Bank is currently investigating, in co-operation 
with the Ministry of Finance, which Treaty provisions require further elaboration in, 
or adjustment of, national legislation. Similar investigations are currently being carried 
out at the National Bank of Belgium. In Portugal, preliminary 
work is being undertaken to prepare 
amendments to the Statute 
of the Banco 
de Portugal in order to reinforce its 
independence. In Ireland, although no significant institutional changes are 
envisaged, a number of adjustments of a minor nature will be included 
in forthcoming legislation. The 
Swedish Government 
has announced that legislative changes which are necessary 
in order to comply with the requirements 
of the Treaty will be proposed during the current 
parliamentary period. 
B. MONETARY FINANCING 
AND PRIVILEGED ACCESS 1. General remarks and the role 
of the EM1 Historical as well as recent experience has shown that a monetary policy oriented 
towards price stability 
may be jeopardised 
by the involvement 
of central banks 
in financing government budgets. Therefore, prohibiting the public sector from receiving 
monetary financing 
or having privileged access to financial institutions is a central aspect 
of the institutional framework underlying EMU (Articles 104 
and 104a of the Treaty). 
Central bank financing and privileged access to financial institutions are prohibited 
not only in Stage Three but also in Stage Two 
of EMU, since they are considered 
incompatible with the process of convergence towards monetary 
~tability.~ Therefore, these prohibitions have applied from 1st January 1994 (see Article 
109e (3) of the Treaty). The definitions 
for the application of these prohibitions are specified in the 
related secondary legislation (Council Regulations (EC) 
No. 3603193 and No. 3604193 of 13th December 1993). The provisions prohibiting monetary financing cover, inter 
alia, the abolition of overdraft facilities and 
other types of credit facilities 
to the public sector as 
well as of direct purchases 
of public sector debt instruments. "Other types 
of credit facilities" include a wide range 
of other forms of central bank financing arising through 
various transactions 
or services which the central banks perform 
for the public ~ector.~ The provisions concerning privileged access 
by the public sector prohibit 
any legal 
instrument which obliges financial institutions to acquire 
or hold liabilities 
of the public sector, or any indirect measures 
such as tax advantages which 
may benefit only financial institutions or financial advantages which do not 
comply with the principles 
of a market 
economy in order to encourage the acquiring or the holding by those institutions 
of such liabilities. Departure from this principle 
may be justified only on 
the basis of prudential considerations. In accordance with Article 
l69 of the Treaty, it is the task of the European 
Commission to ensure 
the legal compliance 
of Member States with the provisions 
of the Treaty, whereas, under Articles 
109f (9) and 180 (d) 
of the Treaty, the 
EM1 has been 
entrusted with the task 
of monitoring central banks' compliance with the Treaty. 
The Committee 
of Governors examined this issue prior to 
the start of Stage Two 
and was involved in 
the preparation of the secondary legislation. In 1994 the 
EM1 set up a 
regular procedure to monitor central banks' fulfilment 
of their obligations 
under Articles 104 and 104a 
of the Treaty and the related secondary legislation. This monitoring 
is carried out 
at quarterly intervals. 
See footnote 
2. In the case 
of Italy the national Foreign Exchange Office (Ufficio italiano 
dei cambi) is to be considered, 
for this purpose, jointly with the 
Banca d'ltalia. 2. Compliance with the prohibition on the provision 
of central bank credit 
to the public sector Most of the Member States anticipated the requirements set out 
in Article 104 and 
Council Regulation 
(EC) No. 
3603193 and adapted their respective national legislation 
before the beginning of Stage 
Two. The monitoring procedure carried out 
by the EM1 in 1994 suggests that the measures necessary 
for ensuring compliance with 
the prohibition have to a large extent 
already been taken. A few minor adjustments are still 
under consideration. The Council Regulation allows stocks 
of public debt to be held 
by national central 
banks as long as the claims were acquired before 1 
st January 1994 and 
are of a fixed 
maturity, irrespective 
of the date of maturity and whether 
or not the claims are remunerated at a market 
rate. Most outstanding non-negotiable claims have 
been converted into fixed-term assets. 
In a few Member States, some residual claims 
of the central bank against the public sector remain to 
be converted; these matters are currently 
under review. Table 
14 provides an overview 
of the outstanding stocks 
of non-negotiable claims of central banks against the public sector at 
end-l 994. Table 14 Central bank claims 
against the public 
sector* (Situation as at end-December 1994) Source: National central banks

not subject to market 
conditions excluding coins, 
float arising from cheque clearing, and 
claims against publicly owned credit 
institutions acquired

on Portugal provides for 
an exemption for 
the interest-free overdraft facility 
of the Autonomous Regions 
of Azores and Madeira 
with the Banco de Portugal. (b) The Treaty Protocol 
on certain provisions relating to 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland 
provides for 
an exemption for 
the "ways and means" facility 
of the Government 
of the United Kingdom. (C) NO non-negotiable claim has 
a fixed maturity. 
(d) Rates (partly)

(e) Interest rate

the first year (1993) the interest rate applied 
was 10% of the Treasury 
bill annual base rate announced 
by the Banco 
de Portugal (1.e. the annual weighted 
average rate of the last twelve 
issues of Treasury bills); this 
percentage will increase 
10 percentage points each year until maturity. 
In 1993 the interest rate applied 
was 1.3%. On 31'' December 1994, the Treasury 
bill annual base rate announced 
by the Banco de Portugal was 
10.5%. Total amount of claims (as % of GDP) of which: claims without fixed maturity

'C' - 1.3- "' 5.5 10.5 (d)(e) The prohibition of overdraft facilities 
of the public sector 
with the national central 
banks has generally been respected. Occasional overdrafts have been observed 
in some cases, mainly caused either by imperfect transitions to new arrangements 
or by delayed 
payments by third parties. However, these were considered by 
the respective central 
banks as not being 
of a structural nature and as having no impact 
on the conduct of monetary policy. 
Steps are being envisaged to abolish these anomalies. 
No primary market purchases 
of debt instruments issued by the domestic 
public sector were observed in 1994. The acquisition 
of debt instruments 
of the public sector on 
the secondary market 
is in compliance with 
the Treaty to 
the extent that it 
is not 
used to 
circumvent the objective 
of Article 104. In 1994 significant 
amounts of secondary market 
purchases of government debt were carried out 
by a few central banks; 
such purchases were deemed not 
to be incompatible with 
the ban on direct purchases 
of public sector 
debt instruments. 
In performing the role of fiscal agents for 
the public sector, central banks must not 
provide any form of credit to public entities. 
The Council Regulation provides 
for a few 
exceptions to this general rule and permits, inter 
alia, within certain limits 
or under certain conditions, intraday credit to 
the public sector and credit arising from the collection 
of cheques on behalf 
of the public sector and from central bank holdings 
of coins issued 
by the public sector. These exceptions 
are granted on 
the grounds that a complete 
prohibition of claims arising from these practices would be unnecessary from 
an economic point 
of view and might prove 
very costly to 
implement.' lntraday credits are permitted 
by the Regulation as they assist 
the smooth operation of payment systems. Therefore, intraday credit is compatible with 
the objective of Article 104 
of the Treaty provided that 
no extension to the following 
day is 
possible. Against this background, in those Member States where the possibility 
of intraday credit 
exists, provisions have been implemented in 
order to prevent intraday credit from 
becoming overnight credit. 
For example, some governments are holding 
relatively large deposits with the central banks so as 
to avoid the risk of a debit position on the 
government's accounts at 
the end of each business day, or 
governments have arranged overdraft facilities with commercial banks that they can use 
at the end of each business day. Central banks' cheque collection procedures 
may result in a temporary and 
interest-free credit to the public sector 
if cheques are credited 
to the public sector's account before they 
are collected. The Council Regulation therefore sets strict limits on 
credits arising from cheque clearing on behalf 
of the government by 
only permitting "exceptional" credits "which 
are of a small amount and average 
out in the short term". 
In most Member States the collection 
of cheques had ceased to result in 
any float in favour of the public sector by 
the end of 1994. The financing by central banks 
of obligations falling upon 
the public sector vis-a-vis the IMF 
or resulting from the 
implementation of the med~um-term financial assistance facility 
of the European Union is also 
exempted uncondlt~onally. Finally, credit 
to the public sector may 
also arise if a central bank holds coins 
issued by the public sector 
and credits these coins 
to the account 
of the public sector. 
The Council Regulation has set 
an upper limit on such credits. It has determined that the 
amount of central bank holdings 
of coins which were issued 
by the public sector 
and credited to the public sector's account shall 
be less than 10% of the amount 
of coins in circulation."his provision was generally respected in 1994, although 
in the first four 
months of the year the limit was exceeded in 
one case. 
3. Compliance with the prohibition 
on granting privileged access 
to financial institutions 
As with 
the prohibition on monetary financing, most Member States anticipated the 
requirements set out 
in Article 104a and Council Regulation (EC) 
No. 3604193 on the 
prohibition on granting privileged access 
to financial institutions by the 
public sector. The 
Member States revoked measures which could be construed as a form 
of privileged access even before the ratification 
of the Maastricht Treaty. This took place against the 
background of: firstly, the Directive 
on the liberalisation of capital movements, which had 
entered into force for the majority 
of the Member States on 1st July 
1990; and, 
secondly, the growing competition in the financial 
services sector, which had increased the 
exposure of the public sector's funding activities to the rules 
of market forces, including 
the requirement to pay interest 
at market rates. 
The prohibition 
on granting privileged access is principally aimed 
at the relationship 
between the public sector and financial institutions. According to 
the Council Regulation, 
national central banks are 
neither considered to be financial institutions 
nor to form part 
of the public sector. Nevertheless, central banks are affected by 
the Regulation, most 
notably as regards their rules 
on the mobilisation or pledging of debt instruments. 
However, an examination of these rules by the 
EM1 did not suggest that these rules 
currently grant any form 
of privileged access. 
Another area where central bank rules could potentially grant the public sector 
privileged access is in 
the field of minimum reserves. Until recently, in some 
Member States, public debt instruments 
such as Treasury bills were considered eligible assets 
for meeting reserve requirements. Such rules did 
not comply with the respective provisions 
of the Treaty and the Council Regulation and have been adjusted accordingly. 
In the case of Germany, following unification, 
the permitted 
upper lim~t is 15% until the end of 1996. 110 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS OF THE EM1 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

Frankfurt am Main 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements 
of the European Monetary Institute. The Management of 
the European Monetary lnstitute is responsible 
for the preparation of the accounts. 
It is our responsibility 
to form an independent 
opinion on these accounts 
based on 
our audit, and to report our opinion 
to you. We conducted 
our audit 
in accordance with International Standards 
of Auditing. An audit includes examinations, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and 
disclosures in the accounts. 
It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates 
and judgements made in the preparation 
of the accounts, and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the European Monetary Institute's circumstances and 
adequately disclosed. 
In our opinion, 
the financial statements, which have been prepared under 
accounting policies set 
out in Section 
2 of the notes on the accounts of the European Monetary Institute, give a true and fair view 
of the financial position 
of the European Monetary lnstitute at 31st 
December 1994 and the results of its operations 
for the year then ended. 
Frankfurt am Main, 14th February 1995 
C&L TREUARBEIT DEUTSCHE REVISION 
Aktiengesellschaft (Wagener) Auditor (Kern) Auditor 1. Introduction 1 .l Under Article 
16 of its Statute, 
the EM1 shall be endowed with its own resources 
by the National Central 
Banks, and these resources are 
to be used to generate income 
deemed necessary to cover 
the EMl's administrative expenses. Pursuant to Article 
16.2, these resources were 
to be paid up 
at the establishment of the EMI. It was not possible 
to decide on the 
precise level 
of the resources required 
for this purpose until 
the EM1 had reached a level 
of operations that permitted a reasonable forecast 
of continuing levels 
of administrative expenses, and NCBs therefore made payments to enable 
the EM1 to commence its operations, to equip its premises and recruit staff, and 
to cover recurrent 
day-to-day expenses. A total 
of ECU 31 million was paid during 
1994, in three 
instalments (in accordance with the key specified 
in Article 29.1 of the Statute of the ESCB), by 
the twelve NCBs which were then full members 
of the EMI. 1.2 Of these initial contributions, 
ECU 18.3 million was used to cover current 
administrative expenses and provisions, 
of which ECU 
6.9 million were one-time costs in 
connection with 
the acquisition and preparation 
of the premises and recruitment, 
relocation and installation 
of staff in Frankfurt am Main. The 
EM1 started the year 
with no general reserve fund 
or income of its own, and that part 
of the NCB contributions used to 
cover these expenses 
- ECU 18.0 million net of interest income 
on cash balances 
- has been treated as a payment under Article 
17.6 of the Statute, which provides 
for the funding of shortfalls of income compared to expenses. 
1.3 The remaining ECU 
13.0 million of the NCBs' 1994 payments has been treated 
as a contribution made under Article 
16.2 of the Statute to 
the EMl's resources. 
Of this, ECU 6.6 million represents investment 
in fixed assets net 
of depreciation and ECU 
6.4 million unearmarked working balances. 
1.4 At its meeting 
on 3rd January 
1995, the Council 
of the EM1 was able to decide 
on the full level 
of resources required. Further contributions 
of ECU 602.5 million were paid 
by the NCBs on 17th January, using a 
key recalculated to take account 
of the new members of the Council (Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Suomen Pankki and Sveriges 
Riksbank) from 
1 st January 1995; Article 16.2 contributions made 
in 1994 were reallocated in accordance 
with the new key. The total contributions 
under Article 16.2 amount to ECU 
615,573,495. Of these resources, ECU 
597.2 million have been placed 
in time deposits to generate 
the income deemed necessary to cover 
the EMl's administrative expenses. The remainder comprises investments in tangible assets, and 
working balances. 
2. Accounting Policies 
2.1 The annual accounts were drawn 
up in accordance with accounting principles 
established by the Council 
of the EM1 pursuant to Article 
17.3 of its Statute, and are 
expressed in official 
ECUs. 2.2 Although the EMI, as a body 
of the European Communities, 
is not subject to 
national laws and regulations 
on accounting practices, 
its accounting policies follow 
internationally accepted accounting principles, unless specific 
EM1 issues require 
otherwise. Notwithstanding 
the limited life 
of the EMI, 
the accounts have been prepared 
on a "going 
concern" basis. 2.3 EMS-related assets and liabilities are shown 
at cost. Short-term discount securities 
are shown at cost plus accrued interest. Securities 
other than short-term discount 
securities are shown at year-end market value. All 
other financial assets and liabilities are 
shown at nominal 
value. 2.4 Tangible assets are valued at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis, beginning in the quarter after acquisition, over the expected lifetime 
of an asset. 
2.5 Apart from EMS-related 
assets and liabilities, foreign currency translation 
of balance-sheet items into ECUs is based 
on the official rates published by 
the European Commission applying 
at 31st December 1994. Foreign currency transactions reflected 
in the Profit and Loss Account are valued at the average official rate 
for the period covered. 
For 1994, such transactions in 
the EMl's books took place with effect from 18th 
April. 2.6 Income and expenses are recognised on 
an accruals basis. Unrealised gains 
arising from the revaluation 
of assets vis-a-vis 
the purchase price are 
not recognised as 
income but taken into a revaluation account; unrealised losses are charged against 

previous unrealised gains in the revaluation account and 
any remaining losses charged 
against profit. 
2.7 In accordance 
with Article 17.4 of the Statute, the Council has appointed C 
& L Treuarbeit Deutsche Revision as independent external 
auditors. 3. Notes on the Balance Sheet 3.1 EMS-Related Assets 
and Liabilities These items relate to the three-month revolving swaps 
of official ECUs created 
in exchange for NCBs' contributions to 
the EM1 of 20% of their gold and 
US dollar reserves. 
These operations are described in Chapter 
II B.5.1 of the Report. The respective assets 
and liabilities are shown in the 
EMl's books. The entries do 
not imply any interest payments or receipts. lnterest 
on official reserves swapped for 
ECUs continues to accrue 
to the underlying owners. lnterest on 
ECU holdings arising out 
of swaps only 
becomes due where a central bank's holdings exceed its forward ECU 
liabilities; in such 
cases, payments are covered 
by interest due from central banks whose forward liabilities in 
ECUs exceed their holdings 
of ECUs. On 1st January 
1994, the EM1 took over 
the assets and liabilities 
of the European 
Monetary Co-operation Fund, each in the amount 
of ECU 56.96 billion. 
Of this, ECU 53.48 billion were in respect 
of the issue 
of ECUs to EC central banks against gold and 
US dollar reserves, and 
ECU 3.48 
billion in respect 
of Very Short-Term Financing 
operations. 3.2 Other Assets 
II (1) Cash and bank sight 
accounts: Cash balances were held on a current 
account in Deutsche Mark, 
in which currency almost all 
of the EMl's day-to-day transactions are payable. This account 
was used exclusively to deal 
with payments and 
receipts relating to the day-to-day administration 
of the EMI. 
11 (2) Securities: Excess cash balances were employed 
on a daily basis 
in Treasury bills 
of the Federal 
Republic of Germany. No other securities were held at 
31 st December 1994. 
11 (3) Tangible assets: 
These comprised, 
at year end: Equipment Computers and software Other Total ECU 4,676,422 ECU 1,717,027 ECU 202.546 ECU 6,595.995 "Equipment" includes the capitalised costs 
of special installations in the EMl's 
quarters in the Eurotower building in Frankfurt am Main required 
to meet its particular 
operational needs. Items are shown net 
of depreciation totalling ECU 
231,382, all 
of which was 
charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account for 1994. 11 (4) Other Assets: 
This item principally represents a claim against the 
German Federal Ministry 
of Finance in respect of recoverable value added and 
other indirect taxes paid on goods and services. Such taxes are refundable 
under the terms 
of Article 3 of the Protocol 
on the privileges and immunities 
of the European Communities, 
which also applies to 
the EM1 by virtue of Article 21 
of its Statute. 
3.3 Other Liabilities II (1) Creditors and other liabilities: 
This item principally comprises payments 
due to suppliers, together 
with income tax deducted at source from salaries pending 
pay-over to the European Communities, and accumulated pension contributions 
with interest thereon repayable to staff. Under 
the provisional arrangements 
in force at the 
balance- sheet date, staff contribute to 
the pension scheme a percentage 
of their basic salary 
(matched by a contribution 
of twice that amount 
by the EM1 -'see 11 (2) below); the staff 
contribution is repayable 
at the termination of the employment contract together 
with accrued interest 
thereon. 11 (2) Provision for Pensions and similar obligations: 
This item comprises the 
accumulated contributions 
of the EM1 towards the staff pension scheme. 
These contributions are required 
to cover the eventual cost 
of severance grants and 
any ill- health pensions. 
11 (3) Otherprovisions: These comprise funds set aside in respect 
of restoration of the EMl's premises at the end 
of its lease (see notes 
on the Profit and Loss Account); 
the production 
of the Annual Report and the accounts for 1994; and payments that 
will be due to 
the Bank for 
International Settlements 
in respect of their work as Agent 
for the EMI. 11 (4) Revaluation Account: 
The appreciation 
of the Deutsche Mark against the 
ECU during 1994 resulted 
in an unrealised gain in the net value 
of assets held 
in, or denominated in, Deutsche Mark, which 
has been taken into this account. 
11 (5) Contributions from National Central Banks pursuant to Article 
16.2 of the Statute: These represent the balance 
of contributions made 
by the National Central Banks in 1994 that remains after the operating shortfall 
for the year has 
been covered 
(see Introduction above and note "Allocation 
of deficit" on 
the Profit and Loss account); 
the amount has been treated as a prepayment 
of the contributions to 
be made under Article 16 of the Statute. 4. Notes on the Profit and Loss 
Account 4.1 Income This item represents interest earned on employment 
of excess cash balances 
in Treasury bills (see Other 
Assets, Note 11 (2)). 4.2 Expenses Staff costs: 
This item relates 
to salaries and general allowances, and 
to employer's contributions to pensions and health and accident insurance, 
in respect of staff employed by the EMI. 
At 31 
st December 1994, the EMl's establishment consisted 
of the President and 126 staff, 
of whom five held senior management positions. Costs 
of staff employed by the BIS in Basle (mainly from 
the previous Secretariat 
of the Committee 
of Governors) before their relocation to Frankfurt am Main during November and December 
formed part 
of a general service agreement with the BIS pending 
the full establishment 
of the EM1 at its seat, and 
are included under "Other Administrative 
Expenses". Salaries and allowances 
of staff, including emoluments 
of holders of managerial positions, 
are modelled in essence on, and comparable to, 
the remuneration scheme 
of the European 
Communities. Other Administrative Expenses: 
These cover 
all other 
current expenses, 
viz. rents, maintenance of premises and equipment, goods 
of a non-capital nature, professional 
fees, and 
other services (including those provided temporarily 
by the BIS) and supplies. 
Of the total amount, "initialisation costs" comprise 
the extraordinary expenses 
of a non- capital nature incurred during the 
year in the process of establishing the 
EM1 at its seat, 
in particular for refurbishment of the premises, 
agency fees 
in connection with leasing 
and fitting out, and the expenses involved in recruitment, relocation 
and installation of staff. These costs also include a provision against 
the contractual obligation 
of the EM1 to restore rented premises 
to their normal condition 
at the end 
of its tenure. 
4.3 Allocation of deficit Since the 
EM1 had no 
general reserve fund 
at the start 
of the year, the operating 
deficit was covered entirely 
out of the payments 
made during 1994 
by the NCBs, in accordance with the provisions 
of Article 17.6 of the Statute. ANNEXES ANNEX 1 THE PRESENT STATE 
OF MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES 
AND INSTRUMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL EU COUNTRIES 1. Strategies There is agreement among EU central banks that 
the final target 
of monetary policy is 
the achievement and maintenance 
of price stability. However, as described in 
Chapter I.A.3.2, a variety 
of monetary strategies 
is currently employed in individual 
member countries (see Table 15). Within the 
ERM, most countries use 
an indirect strategy. This is based, in 
one country (Germany), on a monetary aggregate as the 
intermediate target, 
in some others, on exchange rate targets. One 
of these (France) 
simultaneously targets a monetary aggregate and monitors total debt, while 
another country (Spain) directly targets inflation and monitors 
money growth. 
EU countries 
outside the ERM, while continuing 
to attribute importance 
to exchange rate stability, 
make use 
of a monetary intermediate target 
or a direct inflation 
target. These divergences should nevertheless 
not be exaggerated, 
as both the indirect and the direct approach have recently been implemented pragmatically. 
On the one hand, monetary aggregates and 
the exchange rate have been closely monitored in the 
countries using 
the direct approach. 
On the 
other hand, 
in those countries where 
an intermediate monetary target is used, central banks, to some extent, also assessed the 
relevance of changes in these aggregates in the light 
of other indicators of inflationary developments, taking into account labour costs, fiscal deficits, import prices 
or measures of the deviation 
of actual from potential 
GDP. 2. Instruments The set 
of monetary policy instruments currently used 
by EU countries is broad. They can be grouped in three main categories: systems 
of compulsory reserves, standing 
facilities and open market operations. Under systems 
of compulsory reserves, banks 
are required to keep a minimum amount 
of reserves in deposit accounts with the central 
bank, which may 
or may not 
be remunerated; these minimum reserves are 
usually calculated as a percentage 
of the banks' monetary liabilities. Standing facilities represent 
standing offers 
by central banks 
to engage in certain types 
of operations (discount, 
refinancing, acceptance 
of deposits) at the initiative 
of commercial banks, but at 
conditions pre-announced by the central bank; access to these facilities 
by individual commercial banks 
may be subject to quotas. Open market operations are transactions 
carried out by the central bank at its own initiative 
with private market participants 
either to inject liquidity into 
or to absorb liquidity from the market; they 
may consist in 
either outright or reversed transactions, and may involve different types 
of financial assets 
(public debt, private paper, central bank paper and foreign exchange). 
The specific features 
of the various instruments and their respective roles 
vary from country 
to country, as shown 
in Table 15. For example, in some countries 
where the systems of required reserves 
(Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Austria and Portugal) 
or standing facilities (the 
Netherlands) contain averaging provisions 
(i.e. where the requirements or quotas apply to average amounts 
over a certain computation period), this can contribute 
to the stabilisation of short-term market interest rates. 
As a result, 
only a relatively 
low frequency of central bank intervention in the 
money market is required. 
Conversely, in countries where reserve requirements either 
do not exist 
or are not mainly designed to 
stabilise interest rates 
(e.g. Belgium, Ireland and 
the United Kingdom), this task falls 
more heavily on frequent fine-tuning operations by 
the central bank 
or on standing facilities. To limit the variability 
of short-term interest rates, most EU central banks 
also use varying combinations 
of standing facilities (marginal lending, deposit 
or discount facilities), through which liquidity can 
be absorbed or injected at 
the initiative of commercial banks at pre-announced rates 
set by the central bank. These rates 
usually also function as a signal 
of the monetary policy 
stance. In several countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, 
Finland and Sweden), two 
of the rates on the standing facilities form a corridor within which short- 
term market rates 
normally move. Although in some countries 
the quantitative importance 
of standing facilities in providing (or withdrawing) liquidity is relatively high, in most cases 
this role is 
now performed primarily by open market operations. Considerable differences 
across countries nevertheless exist with regard to 
the type of open market operations 
predominantly used (outright transactions in Greece and Finland, repurchase agreements 
in most other countries), as well as with regard to 
the type of assets involved, 
the auction procedures and 
the frequency of operations. However, some convergence 
can be observed. Overall, the share 
of open market interventions has grown in recent 
years, probably also reflecting 
the authorities' efforts to foster the development 
of markets and 
to rely increasingly on market mechanisms. Moreover, this tendency has 
been accompanied by the widespread recourse by national central banks 
to reversed transactions. A more precise description 
of the main monetary policy instruments 
may contribute to a better understanding 
of the variety 
of operational frameworks in the 
EU. 2.1 Reserve requirements In a majority 
of EU countries, reserve requirements are imposed 
on the banking system, usually with the aim 
of achieving a combination 
of different monetary 
policy purposes: (a) enlarging 
the banks' demand for 
reserves; (b) contributing to the 
stabilisation of short-term interest rates through 
the effect of averaging provisions, 
where they exist, thereby reducing the need for frequent central bank interventions; (c) 
stabilising and making more predictable the 
money multiplier; and (d) increasing the 
responsiveness of demand for money 
to interest rate movements by driving a 
wedge between the interest rates on monetary and non-monetary 
assets. The emphasis given to 
the various functions often differs across countries. In countries where reserve 
requirements do 
not exist (i.e. Belgium, Denmark and Sweden), 
or where their primary 
purpose is not related to monetary policy (the United Kingdom), some 
of the above functions are performed through 
other instruments, e.g. by 
adjusting the size and frequency of open market operations. 
The technical features 
of reserve requirements 
also differ significantly across 
countries (see Table 
16), reflecting in part 
the emphasis on different functions and in part 
structural differences between national financial systems. The main differences concern: 
(a) the definition of the bank liabilities that are subject to the reserve requirements (types 
of instrument, currency denomination, holding sectors); (b) the length 
of the computation and maintenance periods and the lag between the 
two; (c) the inclusion 
or otherwise of averaging provisions; (d) 
the level of remuneration (which is zero in some countries, 
positive and below market rates in others, and close to market rates 
only in the 
Netherlands); (e) the level and differentiation 
of reserve ratios on different 
types of liabilities; and (f) the range 
of institutions subject 
to such requirements. 
In recent years 
there has been a general tendency 
for reserve ratios to converge towards relatively lower 
levels, reflecting in part 
the need to reduce incentives 
for financial disintermediation and 
delocalisation, which, however, also depend on 
the extent to which required reserves 
are remunerated. Nevertheless, there are still important cross-country differences in the 
overall size 
of reserve requirements, both as a percentage 
of the liabilities base and as a 
ratio to GDP. 2.2 Standing facilities Although standing facilities are nowadays used less intensively than in 
the past, they are nevertheless likely to continue to play 
an important role. 
All EU 
central banks, 
with the sole exception 
of the Banco de Espaiia, currently make use 
of standing facilities 
in the 
implementation of monetary policy. However, important differences exist across 
countries regarding 
the combination of facilities in use, their principal features and the 
functions assigned to them. Overall, there are three main types 
of standing facilities: (a) 
marginal refinancing facilities 
at a penalty rate, which exist 
in all EU 
countries but three; 
(b) lending facilities at below market 
rates, which exist 
in six EU countries; and (c) deposit 
facilities (or 
other facilities performing equivalent functions), which exist in 
six EU 
countries. Only in Belgium are all three types 
of facilities currently 
in use. Marginal refinancing facilities usually play 
an important role in facilitating the 
operation of the payment system through the financing 
of end-of-day clearing 
imbalances, at a penalty rate. Similarly, deposit facilities are used to absorb excess 
liquidity. In countries where either 
of these facilities, 
or both, do not exist, these functions 
can be performed by open market operations. Lending facilities at below market rates, 
e.g. discount facilities, are used 
in several countries, although their quantitative 
importance in 
the overall refinancing varies across countries. Since this facility provides a 
subsidised form 
of refinancing, access to it 
by banks is 
normally subject to individual 
quotas. 2.3 Open market operations 
Open market operations have grown in importance 
in most EU countries over the 
last decade, mirrored 
in the diminishing use 
of standing facilities to provide liquidity and a 
lowering of reserve requirements. Most EU central banks 
now use open market 
operations both on a regular basis and 
for fine-tuning purposes. 
An important advantage 
of open market operations from the point 
of view of the central banks is that they function 
in accordance with market principles, since they 
do not imply subsidies 
or implicit taxes 
and make use 
of market mechanisms in distributing liquidity and conveying policy signals. 
Another desirable aspect is that they are seen 
as conducive to 
the development of deep domestic money markets. Reversed transactions 
in domestic securities are now used in all 
EU countries and, in most 
of them, constitute the most important monetary policy instrument. The maturity 
of operations lies mainly 
in the range 
of one day 
to one month; 
only in Greece is it up to 
six months. 
The attractiveness of these transactions stems from the fact that they 
can be implemented with 
great flexibility and that the central bank retains the initiative 
in deciding upon the frequency, timing, maturity and amount (or, alternatively, interest rate). 
Also, repurchase transactions 
may reduce to some 
extent the problem of having to assess the 
quality of the underlying asset and have 
less significant effects 
on the market price 
of this asset relative to other types 
of assets. Outright open market transactions are currently used in five 
EU countries but are a 
major policy instrument 
only in Finland, Greece and 
the United Kingdom. These 
transactions are 
mainly carried out on government paper with a residual maturity 
of less than three months, except 
in Italy, where long-term securities are also involved, 
in Finland, where central bank paper and bank 
CDs are exchanged, and in the United 
Kingdom, where commercial bills are dominant. 
Foreign exchange swap transactions (a combination 
of a spot and a forward 
transaction) can 
be used in most EU countries 
but are for the most part executed 
on an 
occasional basis 
for purposes of fine-tuning. The issue 
of short-term paper 
by the central bank is possible in seven countries, 
but in 
only four (Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Finland and 
the United Kingdom) are these 
operations conducted 
on a regular basis. In 
four countries (Belgium, Greece, the 
Netherlands and Finland) 
the central bank can conduct lending and borrowing operations 
in the money market. In Ireland and Sweden, the central 
bank can offer fixed term 
deposits. This general overview 
of the current situation regarding the monetary 
policy strategies, instruments and procedures in use 
in EU countries indicates that, 
on the one hand, a certain degree 
of convergence is taking place towards greater reliance 
on market-based instruments, although considerable differences remain both in 
the combination of instruments used in each country and in the specific features 
of the individual instruments. 
On the other hand, 
the differences that exist in 
the monetary policy strategies followed 
by individual central banks are, in 
many cases, principally 
related to historical factors, differences in financial systems and underlying 
economic conditions, as well as to the different positions 
of the various countries 
in the context of the EMS. Table 15 Monetary Policy Strategies,

at the same time. 
Direct participants (access) in IFTS: 
participants in 
an IFTS who are

an agreement between participants in a clearing system regarding the allocation 
of any liquidity risk arising

day). Official ECU: official ECUs are created through swap operations against 20% 
of the US dollar and gold assets held 
by the central banks participating in the EMS. The value 
of the ECU is calculated as a weighted average
