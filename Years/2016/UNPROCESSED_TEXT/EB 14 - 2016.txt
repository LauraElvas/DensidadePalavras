 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 8 September
 2016, the Governing Council 
assessed the economic and monetary data which had become available since 
the July meeting and discussed the new ECB staff macroeconomic 
projections.
 The comprehensive policy measures 
that have been adopted 
continue 
to ensure supportive financing conditions and underpin the momentum of the euro 
area economic recovery. As a result, the Governing Council continues to expect real 
GDP to grow at a moderate but steady pace and euro area inflation to rise gradually
 over the coming months, in line with the path already implied in 
the
 June 2016 staff 
projections. Overall, while the available evidence so far suggests resilience of the 

euro area economy to the continuing global economic and political uncertainty, the 
baseline scenario rem
ains subject to downside risks.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 
8 September
 2016
 Moderate global growth continued in the first half of 2016. 
Looking ahead, global 
growth is expected to rec
over gradually. Low interest rates, improving labour markets 
and growing confidence support the outlook for advanced economies, although the 
uncertainty generated by the referendum in the United Kingdom 
on EU membership 
will weigh on demand in that country
. As regards emerging market economies, 
economic activity in China is expected to slow, while the outlook for large commodity 

exporters remains subdued, despite some tentative signs of stabilisation. Risks to 
the outlook for global economic activity remain
 on the downside.
 Between early June and early September euro area and global financial 
markets remained relatively calm, apart from the immediate period around the 
UK referendum. 
In the period leading up to the referendum on 23 June, global 
financial mark
ets exhibited increasing volatility, which spiked on the day following the 
referendum. Since then, financial market volatility has receded and most asset 
classes
 have
 recovered their losses. 
At the same time,
 long
-term euro area bond 
yields remain
ed signif
icantly below their pre
-referendum levels, 
and bank equities
 continue
d to underperform the wider market index.
 The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. 
Euro area real GDP 
increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2016, af
ter 0.5% in 
the first quarter. 
Growth was supported by net exports as well as 
a continued positive 
contribution from domestic demand. 
Incoming data point to ongoing growth in the 
third quarter of 2016, at around the sam
e rate as in the second quarter
. Looking ahead, the Governing Council expects the economic recovery to 
proceed at a moderate but steady pace.
 Domestic demand remains supported by

 Œ Economic and monetary developments
 Overview
 3 the pass
-through of 
the
 monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable 
financing conditions and improvem
ents in the demand outlook and in corporate 
profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Sustained employment 
gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms and still relatively low oil 

prices provide additional support for ho
useholds™ real disposable income and thus for 
private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be 
mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018. However, 

the economic recovery in the euro area i
s expected to be dampened by still subdued 
foreign demand
 Œ partly related to the uncertainties following the UK referendum 
outcome
 Œ the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a 
sluggish pace of implem
entation of structural reforms
. The 
September
 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
expect
 annual real GDP to increase by 1.
7% in 2016, by
 1.6% in 2017 and 
by 
1.6% in 
2018. Compared with the June 2016 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised downwards slightly.
 In 
the Governing Council™s assessment
, t
he risks to the euro area growth outlook 
remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environm
ent.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in 
August 2016 was 0.2%, unchanged from July.
 While annual energy inflation 
continued to rise
, services and non
-energy industrial goods inflation 
was
 slightly 
lower than in July. 
Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation 
rates are likely to remain low over the next few months before starting to pick up 
towards the end of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of 
change of energy pric
es. Supported by 
the ECB
™s monetary policy measures and the 
expected economic recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017 and 

2018. The September 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 
foresee
 annual HICP inflation at 0.2%
 in 2016, 1.
2% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.
 In 
comparison with the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for HICP inflation is broadly unchanged.
 The monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 are filtering through 
to borrow
ing conditions for firms and households and 
are 
thereby 
increasingly 
supporting 
credit flows across the euro area
. Broad money continued to increase 
at a robust pace in July 2016
 and l
oan growth continued to recover gradually. 
Domestic sources of money cre
ation were again the main driver of broad money 

growth. Low interest rates and the effects of the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy 
measures continue to support money and credit dynamics. Banks have been 

passing on their favourable funding conditions 
in t
he form of
 lower lending rates and 
have eased credit standards, thereby supporting the recovery of loan growth. The 
annual flow of total external financing to non
-financial corporations is estimated to 
have increased in the second quarter of 2016.

 Overview
 4 Monetary
 policy decisions
 The Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged
 and continue
d to expect these rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended 
period of time, and well past the horizon of the Eurosystem™s net asset pu
rchases. 
Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council 
confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of •80 billion are intended to run until 

the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing 

Council 
sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its 
inflation aim.
 The Governing Council will 
remain alert and ready to act, if warranted, to 
achieve its price stability objective
. In the light of prevailing uncertainties, the 
Governin
g Council will 
continue to monitor economic and financial market 
developments very closely.
 It 
will preserve the very substantial amount of monetary 
support that is embedded in 
the ECB
 staff 
macroeconomic 
projections and that is 
necessary to secure a return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term. If warranted, 
the Governing Council
 will act by using all the 
instruments available within 
its
 mandate. Meanwhile, the Governing Counc
il tasked 
the relevant committees to evaluate the options that ensure a smooth 
implementation of 
the 
Eurosystem™s 
asset 
purchase programme.

 5 1 External environment
 The moderate 
global growth 
recorded
 towards the end of last year 
continued
 in the 
first half 
of 2016.
 Looking ahead, global growth 
is expected to 
recover gradually
. Low 
interest rates, improving labour markets and 
resilient
 confidence support the outlook 
for advanced economies
, although the uncertainty generated by the referendum in 
the United Kin
gdom on EU membership will weigh on demand in that country
. 
As 
regards 
emerging market economies
 (EMEs), economic activity in 
China
 is expected 
to slow, while the outlook for 
large commodity exporters
 remains subdued, despite 
some tentative 
signs of stabil
isation. Risks to the outlook for global 
economic 
activity 
remain on the downside.
 Global economic activity and trade
 Global 
economic growth remains moderate
. 
Following a
 soft patch in the first 
quarter, GDP growth 
in the United States strengthened
 only 
modestly in the second 
quarter, reflecting a
 large drag from inventories and a further 
decline
 in investment, 
driven primarily by falling capital expenditure
 in the 
energy sector. 
Meanwhile, 
economic
 growth in the United Kingdom 
was more resilient
 in the s
econd quarter. 
In 
contrast, the pace of expansion in Japan slowed, a
fter leap year effects had boosted 
growth in the first quarter. 
In 
China
, 
GDP growth stabilised in the second quarter, in 
line with the government™s annual growth target
, although 
economic
 activity relied 
heavily on government support through infrastructure investment and continued 
credit 
growth
. 
While short
-term indicators suggest that growth rates are beginning to 
bottom 
out in Brazil and Russia, output in those countries declined further
 in the 
second quarter
. 
Overall, recent 
survey
 indicators
 suggest 
that global economic 
activity will continue to expand at a modest rate
. The global composite output 
Purchasing Managers™ Index (
PMI
) remained
 subdued in August (see Chart 1)
. The 
outcome of 
the UK referendum on EU membership 
surprised financial 
markets
, but volatility has been short
-lived 
Œ contained, in part, by 
expectations of countercyclical policy response
s in major advanced 
economies.
 Following the referendum the pound declined,
 but the 
impact on most 
global markets outside Europe 
has been 
short
-lived. 
Capital flows to EMEs have 
proved resilient, amid a broad improvement in EME
s™ financial conditions, possibly 
linked to search
-for
-yield flows out of advanced economies. The Bank of England
 cut 
interest rates and announced further quantitative easing at its meeting in August. 
The 
UK 
government has also announced that 
it now expects 
the pace of fiscal 
consolidation in the 
country to be slower than was previously planned
. In the United 
States,
 market expectations 
of interest rate 
rises
 by the Federal Reserve 
System 
in 
2016 fell in the
 immediate after
math of
 the referendum
, before increasing again
 following stronger
 than
 expected labour market 
data
. The Bank of Japan also 
adopted
 further monetary stimulus
 at its meeting in July
, while the 
Japanese 
government announced fiscal stimulus 
measures 
in 
its
 supplementary budget for the 
2016-17 fiscal year.

 Note: The latest observations are for August 2016
. Nonetheless, the 
result of the UK referendum
 has triggered
 an increase in 
macroeconomic 
uncertainty.
 In the United Kingdom, uncertainty surrounding 
economic policy rose
. The impact o
n other countries has been more modest, 
suggesting that the 
vote on EU membership
 has resulted in a regional 
Œ rather than 
a global 
Œ shock. Nonetheless, o
ther factors may also be 
contributing to the higher 
levels of
 political and policy uncertainty 
seen 
in other countries, 
particularly
 in the 
United S
tates 
and China.
 The weakness observed in global trade in 2015 persisted in the early part of 
this year.
 According to CPB data, the volume of world imports of goods declined by 
0.8% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2016 (see Chart 
2). Global trade 
has been particularly weak over the last year, partly reflecting strong declines in 
imports caused by 
deep recessions in Brazil and Russia. As these shocks unwind, 
the drag on global imports should lessen and global import growth should recover 
somewhat. Survey indicators measuring global trade also point to a modest 
recovery. The global PMI for new export
 orders rose further in August, exceeding the 
50-point threshold. However, as 
discussed in 
Box 1, global trade is expected to grow 
at a fairly modest rate in the medium term. The decline observed in the income 

elasticity of global trade since 2012 is likel
y to persist, as the structural
 developments 
that 
have 
boosted trade in the past 
Œ falling transport costs, t
he liberalisation
 of 
trade
, 
the 
expan
sion of
 global value chains and financial deepening 
Œ are not 
expected to support trade to the same extent 
in 
the future. O
ver the medium term, 
therefore, 
global trade growth is likely to remain well below the levels observed 
prior 
to
 the financial crisis.
 Looking ahead, global economic 
growth
 is expected to 
remain

 In 
advanced economies

 7 Kingdom 
is expected to 
dampen investment
. 
Meanwhil
e, t
he gradual 
rebalancing of 
the 
Chinese economy is likely to weigh on growth. Capital flows to EMEs have 
recovered
 recently,
 but many countries are still coping with the tightening of external 
financing conditions associated with the expected withdrawal 
of monetary 
accommodation in the U
nited 
States
. The gradual easing of deep recessions in 
a couple of
 larger commodity exporters will provide some support 
for
 global growth in 
the years ahead
, but 
the outlook remains
 subdued
, as many commodity exporters 
fac
e difficult
ies in
 adjust
ing
 to the low commodity price
 environment. Finally, 
increases in
 political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions are also weighing on 
demand across a number of regions.
 Looking at individual countries in more detail, 
economic 
activity in the United 
States is expected to re
cover
. Strong domestic fundamentals
 Œ reflected in robust 
job growth, 
modest increases 
in nominal wages as the economy approaches full 
employment
, and positive household wealth effects 
(mostly from rising hous
e prices
) Œ are expected to support private consumption. 
Reductions in
 long
-term interest 
rates and the end of the contraction in the energy sector are also expected to boost 
investment over the projection horizon. On the other hand, the 
strengthening
 of t
he US dollar and modest growth in foreign demand will weigh on exports.
 The 
outlook for 
Japan remain
s subdued
. In the 
short 
term, supply chain disruption 
following the earthquake in April will constrain production. 
Looking
 further ahead,
 however,
 private c
onsumption is expected to recover amid 
rises in
 real incomes, 
while accommodative financial conditions should 
foster
 increases in
 investment. The 
postponement of the 
rise in 
VAT scheduled for April 2017 
will support economic 
activity, as will
 the additiona
l stimulus 
measures announced in
 the supplementary 
budget. 
In addition, m
onetary policy remains highly accommodative. Exports are 
expected to benefit from gradual improv
ements 
in foreign demand, albeit tempered 
by the re
covery seen in the value
 of the yen 
over the 
last year.
 The heightened uncertainty seen in the United Kingdom is expected to weigh 

on e
conomic 
growth
. The i
nstitutional and political uncertainty surrounding 
the 
negotiations 
to leave the European Union is 
expected to 
dampen 
domestic demand, 
particularly investment
 (although recent data suggest that the short
-term impact of 
the referendum has been
 relatively modest thus far). Looking further ahead, 
monetary accommodation and a reduction in the pace of fiscal consolidation should 
help to suppor
t economic activity.
 Real economic activity in central and eastern Europe is projected to remain 
relatively resilient
. Private consumption 
is expected to be 
supported by 
increases in
 real disposable income and low 
levels of 
inflation.
 However, 
the uncertai
nty 
triggered
 by the referendum 
in the United Kingdom 
and the
 potential impact on the UK and 
euro area economies 
(which 
represent
 th
ose countries™
 main t
rading partners) are 
expected to weigh on output in the coming quarters.

September 2016 ECB staff 
macroeconomic 
projections, 
annual real GDP 
growth 
for the world

projected to 
increase
 from

economic 
activity remain on the downside, 
particularly
 for

. 
A k
ey downside risk 
is 
a stronger slowdown in 
EMEs

Moreover, 
the economic implications of the U

Kingdom

European Union

d be worse than expected, increasing uncertainty and 
negatively affect
ing trade, 
business confidence and

 Global price developments
 The effects of past declines
 in
 oil price
s continue to weigh on global headline 
inflation.
 Average annual CPI inflation in OECD countries fell to 0.8% in July, from 
0.9% in the previous month (see Chart 3). The energy component has continued to 
weigh on in
flation, with average OECD inflation excluding food and energy standing 
at 1.8% in July. Looking at large EMEs, inflation fell in China, Brazil and Russia and 

rose modestly in India.
 Oil price
s have risen in recent months
. Price 
dynamics have been 
shaped 
by dev
elopments
 on the 
supply side,
 with large outages in 
a number of
 OPEC 
countries 
(Libya, 
Nigeria and Venezuela) and 
one non-OPEC 
country 
(Canada) dampening excess supply 

conditions. More recently, 
however, 
Saudi Arabian 
output 
has 
reached an all
-time high
, 
the decline in 
the 
supply of 
US shale oil 
has 
eased
, and Canadian oil 
production has come back online earlier than expected
. At the same time, global oil demand remained stronger 
than 
expected in the first half of 2016. Over the coming 

months, oil prices w
ill be supported by the rebalancing 
of supply/demand conditions
. 
Meanwhile, a
ggregate 
non-oil commodity prices 
have remained almost 
unchanged in the last three months
. Looking ahead, global inflation is expected to rise
 gradually
. In the short term, the ef
fects of past declines 
in oil and other commodity prices will diminish, 
lessening the drag on headline inflation. Looking further 
ahead, the upward
-sloping oil futures curve points to increases in oil prices over the 
projection horizon. At the same time, t
he abundance of spare capacity at global level 
is expected to weigh on underlying inflation over the medium term.

 10 2 Financial developments
 Apart from the immediate period around the UK referendum, 
euro area and global 
financial markets 
remained relatively ca
lm between early June and early September. 
In the period leading up to the UK referendum on 23 June, global financial markets 
exhibited increasing volatility, which spiked on the day following the referendum. 
Since then, financial market volatility has rec
eded and most asset classes have 
recovered their losses. The main exceptions to this normalisation are long
-term euro 
area bond yields, which remain significantly below their pre
-referendum levels, as 
well as bank equities, which continue to underperform t
he wider market index.
 The relatively tranquil developments in financial markets seen during the 

second quarter of 2016 have continued. 
Against the backdrop of timid 
improvements in the global economic outlook, mainly fuelled by developments in the 

US econ
omy, euro area and global financial markets weathered well the immediate 

impact of the UK vote to leave the EU. There was an initial reaction in the euro area: 
the 
euro depreciated markedly against the US dollar, the EONIA forward curve 
flattened, sovereig
n and corporate bond spreads widened, implied volatilities went 
up, and equities 
Œ notably bank equities 
Œ declined. Since then, financial market 
volatility has receded, sovereign spreads have tightened, and most other asset 
classes have recovered their lo
sses. 
While it cannot be ruled out that financial 
markets may react again when the modalities of the UK
™s relationship with the EU 
are known with more certainty, the immediate adverse impacts of this event on 
financial markets were short
-lived.
 The euro overnight index average (EONIA) 
remained stable during the review period
 (from 
2 June to 7 September), while the EONIA forward 
curve flattened, mainly in
 the wake of the UK 
referendum (see Chart 4). 
Market
-based 
exp
ectations 
of future EONIA rates
 have been gradually declining
. On 2 June it was expected that the EONIA rate would 

move into positive territory 
in 2021, 
but at the end of the 
review period this 
had been pushed back 
by at least 
one year. The 
expected 
trajectory 
of 
the EONIA rate 
has also undergone revision
. Chart 4
 illustrates that 
the 
EONIA forward rate curve
 moved backwards in time 
and also further downwards
 during the period under 
review.
 These
 developments
 indicat
e that markets may 
be expecting additional policy accommodation. 
The 
EONIA rate ranged between 
-32 and 
-35 basis points, 
except at 
the end of the second quarter of 2016, 
when it
 temporarily rose to 
-29 basis points. Excess liquidity 
increased by around •1
92 billion, to around •1,0
40 billion, in the context of 
Eurosystem purchases under the expanded 
asset 
purchase 
programme. Box 3

 11 While e
uro area long
-term yields generally moved closely in line with their 
global counterparts prior to the UK referendum, a 
moderate widening of the 
existing wedge 
between rates in the United States and the euro area 
was seen 
in the post
-referendum perio
d, and 
UK long
-term yields also declined markedly 
(see Chart 5
). These developments are likely attributable to market perceptions of 
different economic situations and monetary policies across these economic areas. 
Amid
 low bond market volatility, the GDP
-weighted
 average of ten
-year euro area 
government bond yields hovered at low levels from end
-June to 7 September. 
Country differences remained, with German ten
-year yields being negative and 
further 
Œ albeit marginal 
Œ decreases in Portuguese, Spanish and Italian 
ten
-year 
yields. These developments should also be seen in the light of the ECB™s ongoing 

public sector purchase programme.

    Yields on bonds issued by non
-financial corporations (NFCs) continue to be 
positivel
y affected by the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). 
After 
a downward trend in NFC bond yields, a plateau at around 0.45% seems to have 
been reached towards the end of July. The current levels are more than 80 basis 
points below those observed at 
the beginning of the year and can to a large extent 
be attributed to the CSPP (see also Box 2 in the August 2016 issue of the Economic 
Bulletin). Yields on bank bonds followed a similar pattern, although their decline has 
been less pronounced.
 Global equit
y markets reacted strongly to the outcome of the UK referendum, 
with euro area banks being most affected.
 Euro area non
-bank and US bank and 
non-bank equity indices have recovered the initial price drops that were seen after 
the UK referendum. For these eq

offset by a weakening of the euro against most other major

 Euro area real 
GDP 
growth normalised in the second quarter, after a strong outcome 
in the
 first
 quarter
. Growth was supported by net exports as well as small continued 
positive contributions from domestic demand. 
The latest 
survey indicators have 
shown resilience and poi
nt to ongoing moderate growth
 in the third quarter. 
Looking 
ahead, the 
euro area 
economic recovery is expected to proceed at a moderate but 
steady pace. 
Tailwinds to d
omestic demand 
continue to come from the
 pass
-through 
of the
 ECB
™s monetary policy measur
es to the real economy. Favourable financing 
conditions
, reduced leverage ratios and 
improvements in corporate profitability 
continue to promote investment. 
Sustained employment gains, which are also 
benefiting from past structural reforms
, and still relat
ively low oil prices
 should
 provide additional support for households™ real disposable income and private 
consumption. 
In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to be mildly 
expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 201
8. The weak 
external environment, the slow pace of structural reform, as well as balance sheet 

adjustment in a number of sectors, continue to weigh on the euro area growth 
outlook. Moreover, the outcome of the EU referendum in the United Kingdom is 
expecte
d to further dampen euro area external demand. The September 2016 ECB 

staff macroeconomic projections foresee euro area real GDP growing by 1.7% in 

2016 and by 1.6% in 2017 and 2018.
 The euro area economic expansion is continuing, 
with real GDP growth normalising in the second 
quarter of 2016, following strong increases in the 
first quarter.
 Real GDP growth slowed to 
0.3%, quarter 
on quarter, in the 
second
 quarter of 201
6, down from 
0.5% in the first
 quarter. On the production side, value 
added expanded by 0.3%, quarter on quarter
, and was 
driven by industry (excluding construction) and 
services, whereas value added in construction fell. At 
the country level, real GDP came out stronger than the 
previous quarter in Germany, Spain and the 

Netherlands, while France and Italy displayed
 zero 
growth. Overall, activity was supported by a positive 
contribution from net exports and by a 
continued 
positive
 contribution from
 domestic demand, albeit
 smaller than in the previous quarter.
 Private consumption
, which has been the main 
driver of the
 economic recovery in recent years,
 rose
 only
 modestly
 in the second quarter
. This 
slowdown compared with the first quarter may reflect 
some normalisation following the strong growth in consumption in the first quarter. 

Nevertheless, consumption is expecte
d to continue to be one of the main drivers of 
the ongoing recovery
, in particular as labour 
markets continue to recover and 
consumer confidence remains elevated.

 14 Recent
 improvements in euro area private 
consumption have 
largely 
been due to increases in 
employment
. Although low oil prices have been 
supportive of private consumption over the past two 
years, labour income has increasingly become the most 
important driver of households
™ disposable income. As 
the contribution 
of nominal wage growth to total 
disposable income growth has been declining 

somewhat in the course of the recovery, the 
contribution from employment, rather than wages, has 

boosted total nominal labour income recently (see 
Chart 10). This reflects the ongo
ing improvements in 
euro area labour markets, which have recovered more 

strongly than would be expected on the basis of 
movements in real GDP (see the article entitled 
ﬁThe 
employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
ﬂ in this 
issue of the Economic Bulleti
n). Improving bank lending 
conditions, reinforced by the ECB
™s monetary policy 
measures, should further support private consumption 
growth going forward. Even though low interest rates have affected interest earnings, 

they have also had an impact on intere
st payments, leaving euro area households
™ net interest income largely unaffected on average. As net borrowers typically have a 
higher marginal propensity to consume than net savers, this redistribution of interest 
earnings/payments should further support 
aggregate private consumption (see also 
the box entitled 
ﬁLow interest rates and households
™ net interest income
ﬂ in the June 
2016 issue of the Economic Bulletin).
 Euro area labour markets have continued to improve
, as reflected in
 falling 
unemployment rat
es, increasing employment and elevated employment 
expectations.
 Employment continued to expand, by 0.3% quarter on quarter, in the 
first quarter of 2016. As a result, the level of euro area employment stood 1.4% 

above the level one year earlier, which repr
esents the fastest annual increase since 
the first half of 2008. More timely information such as that provided by surveys 
continues to point to ongoing moderate improvements in euro area labour markets. 
Total hours worked in the euro area have lagged behin
d rising employment however, 
which is partly due to an increase in part
-time employment
 (see also the box entitled 
ﬁFactors behind developments in average hours worked per person employed since 
2008ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin). As for the euro
 area unemployment 
rate, it has continued its trend decline that started at the beginning of 2013 and 
reached 10.1% in the second quarter of 2016, the lowest rate since mid
-2011. The 
unemployment rate remained at this level in July. 
Wider measures of 
labou
r market 
slack
 Œ which also take into account sections of the working age population 
involuntarily working part
-time or which have withdrawn from the labour
 market 
Œ remain high, and are declining at a slower rate than unemployment
. Investment growth slowe
d considerably in the second quarter, owing to lower 
industrial production of capital goods and lower construction activity. 
The 
relatively weak total investment outcome in the second quarter is likely to reflect less

 15 housing investment, following the favo
urable weather conditions in the previous 
quarter, which led to relatively higher construction output in that quarter. Weak 
capital goods production, in part related to the subdued external environment, was 
also an important factor 
Œ together with lower ca
pacity utilisation 
Œ holding back 
business investment.
 As euro area domestic conditions are improving, 
both business and construction investment 
are
 likely
 to recover
 in the near term.
 Overall, imp
roving 
financial conditions, higher confidence in the 
construction sector and an increasing number of 
building permits issued point to a pick
-up in investment 
growth in the third quarter. Moreover, according to the 
European Commission
™s survey, demand has 
been perceived as a continuously diminishing constraint for 
the production of capital goods since 2013 and reached 
in the third quarter levels not seen since early 2012. 
Recovering demand, accommodative monetary policy 
as well as improving financing condit
ions should
 continue to
 boost both business and construction 
investment. 
Improving profits in recent months 
(see 
Chart 11
) and the need to replace capital after years of 
subdued fixed capital formation should also support 
total investment going forward. Ho
wever, uncertainty 
related to
 the
 EU™s future relations with the 
United 
Kingdom
 and the
 potential implications for the euro area economy might weigh on 
the investment outlook. In addition, deleveraging needs and a slow pace of reform 

implementation, partic
ularly in some countries, as well as subdued potential growth 
prospects, may also dampen investment growth.
 The persistent weakness in the external environment has continued to weigh 
on extra
-euro area goods exports in 2016 (see Chart 12).
 The weakness in 
global 
trade has many determinants (see Box 1 in this issue of the Economic Bulletin) and 
one of them relates to the increasing local production in local sales markets owing to 
shifting patterns of global demand, labour cost issues and local content requir
ements 
(see Box 4 in this issue of the Economic Bulletin). The weak extra
-euro area goods 
export growth in the second quarter was mainly driven by declining exports to Asia 

(excluding China), oil
-producing nations in OPEC and Latin America. Both the United
 States and Russia provided broadly neutral contributions to goods export growth, 
whereas China and non
-euro area Europe contributed positively
. 
While still very 
weak, growth in extra
-euro area goods exports outpaced that in global goods imports 
in the fir
st half of 2016 and led to export market share gains compared with the 
second half of 2015, partly owing to some still positive lagged effects of movements 
in the effective exchange rate
 of the euro. These tailwinds are likely to fade gradually 

and signals
 from surveys, export orders and industrial production point to continued 
weak export momentum in the near term. Looking further ahead, extra
-euro area 
exports are expected to grow more strongly following a gradual rebound in global 
trade.

 Notes: The latest observation is for May 2016 for non

 2016 for all others. Extra
-euro area 
goods exports are in volumes.
 Risks to the trade outlook remain on the downside and mainly relate to 
adverse impacts stemming from the EU referendum in the United Kingdom. 
Growth in goods exports to the United Kingdom 
already started to lose momentum at 
the beginning of 2016. This has been compounded by the sizeable depreciation of 
the pound vis
-à-vis the euro. Weaker import demand in the United Kingdom is likely 
to have a direct adverse impact on euro area trade, as it
 is one of the largest trading 
partners of the euro area, but also an indirect one through trade spillovers via other 
countries.
 Overall, short
-term indicators 
point to
 ongoing moderate 
growth
 in the third 
quarter
. The European Commission™s Economic 
Sentiment Indicator (ESI)
 fell in 
August, and the decline was
 broad based across sectors and reflected
 a weaker 
assessment of the current situation as well as 
lower 
expectations. 
In p

, there 
were
 negative results 
for the
 assessment regarding total
, as well as export, order 
books for manufacturing, notably in the capital goods sector, which displayed a sharp 
decline in August
. Moreover, the composite output Purchasing Managers
™ Index 
(PMI) edged down in August. However, the average reading for both 
indicators over 
July and August stood at broadly the same level as in the second quarter and stood 

above their long
-term average levels

 and the

However, the economic recovery in the euro area is

 According to Eurostat
™s flash estimate, euro area
 annual HICP inflation 
stood at 0.2
% in 
August 2016
, 
unchanged from July
. 
While annual energy inflation continued to 
rise
, services and non
-energy industrial goods inflation was slightly lower than in 
July. 
Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for 
oil
, inflation rates are 
expected to 
remain low over the next few months before starting to pick up towards 
the 
end of 2016
, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change in 
energy prices
. Thereafter, supported by the ECB
™s monetary policy measures and 
the expected economic recovery, inflation rates should 
increase
 further. This broad 
pattern is a
lso reflected in the 
September
 2016 ECB
 staff macroeconomic 
projections 
for the euro area
, which foresee annual HICP inflation 
standing 
at 
0.2
% in 2016, 
1.2
% in 2017 and 
1.6
% in 2018. Compared with the 
June 2016 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic projections, 
the outlook for HICP inflation 
is broadly 
unchanged.
 Headline inflation
 remained at low levels in August 
2016. 
According to Eurostat™s flash 
estimate
, 
overall 
HICP
 inflation 
stood at 0.2% in August, unchanged from 
July,
 with 
an increase in energy inflation 
being
 offset by 
a slight 
reduction 
in 
services and non
-energy industrial 
goods inflation (see Chart 16)
. This 
followed successive
 increases in headline inflation 
from 
-0.2% in April to 
0.2% in July
, 
driven 
mainly by
 less negative energy 
inflation and higher f
ood inflation.
 Most measures of u

Similarly, o
ther measures of 
underlying inflation 
have also 
show
n no clear signs of

his 
may
, in
 part
, be
 due to the

 input prices.
 Developments in the GDP deflator suggest that domestic price pressures have 
strengthened since mid
-2014. This re
flects increases in profit margins, as labour 
costs have remained subdued. Those increases in profit margins likely reflect 
changes in terms of trade associated with falling oil prices (see the box entitled 
ﬁWhat
 accounts for the recent decoupling
 between 
the euro area GDP deflator and 
the HICP excluding energy and food?ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin). Wage 
growth has remained moderate, owing to a range of factors including the still 
significant degree of labour market slack and weak productivity 
growth.

growth rate of negotiated wages stood at
 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016, 
unchanged from the first quarter.

 Money and credit
 22 5 Money and credit
 Money growth remained robust in the second quarter of 2016 and in July. In addition, 
loan growth continued to recover gradually.
 Domestic sources of money creation 
were again the main driver of broad money growth. Low interest rates and the effects 
of the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures continue to support money 
and credit dynamics. Banks have been passing on their favo
urable funding 
conditions to lower lending rates and have eased credit standards, thereby 
supporting the recovery of loan growth. The annual flow of total external financing to 
non-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have increased in the second 
quarter of 2016.
 Broad money continued to grow at a robust pace.
 The annual growth rate of M3 
moderated slightly to 4.8% in July 2016, having hovered around 5.0% since April 

2015 (see Chart 20). The growth in M3 continued to be supported by its most liquid
 
components, against the background of the low opportunity cost of holding these 
deposits in an environment of very low interest rates and a flat yield curve. In 
addition to the low opportunity cost of holding liquidity, robust M3 growth reflects the 
impac
t of the non
-standard monetary policy measures, in particular inflows relating to 
the sale of securities by the money
-holding sector in the context of the Eurosystem
™s asset purchase programme (APP) and the targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTR
Os). The growth rate of M1 has declined during recent months, 
from its peak in July 2015, but
 still remains at a high level.

 Money and credit
 23 continued to grow strongly, whereas those of non
-bank financial institutions 
continued to moderate. This distinction is important, as the leading indicator property 
of M1 for economic growth hinges, 
in particular, on dynamics observed for the non
-financial sector. The growth rate of currency in circulation continued its moderating 
trend, i.e. there are no signs of substitution of deposits with cash by the money
-holding sector, owing to very low or neg
ative interest rates. By contrast, short
-term 
deposits other than overnight deposits (i.e. M2 minus M1) contracted further in the 

second quarter of 2016 and in July. The growth rate of marketable instruments 
(i.e.
 M3 minus M2), a small component of M3, rec
overed somewhat during this 
period, supported by solid growth in money market fund shares/units and increased 
holdings of banks
™ short
-term debt securities.
 Domestic sources of money creation continued to be the main driver of broad 
money growth. 
Among the
se, credit to general government remained the most 
important factor behind money creation, while credit to the private sector 
continued 
to 
recover gradually. The former factor reflects the ECB™s non
-standard monetary 
policy measures, mainly the ECB
™s asset
 purchases in the context of the public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP). 
Monetary financial institutions™ (
MFIs
) longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) 
Œ whose annual rate of 
change has been negative since the second quarter of
 2012 
Œ continued to decrease 
in the second quarter of 2016 and in July. This reflects, in particular, the impact of the 
new series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
-II), which acts as 
a substitute for longer
-term market
-based bank 
funding. In addition, the flat yield 
curve has reduced the attractiveness for investors of holding long
-term deposits and 
bank bonds. Meanwhile, the MFI sector™s net external asset position remained the 
main drag on annual M3 growth, owing to continued cap
ital outflows from the euro 
area; PSPP
-related sales of euro area government bonds by non
-residents make an 
important contribution to this trend, as their proceeds are invested mainly in non
-euro 
area instruments.
 Loan dynamics continued to recover gradual
ly.
 The annual growth rate of MFI 
loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales, securitisation and notional cash 

pooling) increased further in the second quarter of 2016 and in July (see Chart 20). 
Loan growth improved during this period, particula
rly for non
-financial corporations 
(see Chart 22), having recovered substantially from the trough of the first quarter of 
2014. This improvement is broadly shared by the largest countries, though loan 
growth rates are still negative in some jurisdictions. 
In comparison, the annual 
growth rate of loans to households picked up slightly in the second quarter of 2016 
and remained unchanged in July (see Chart 23). The significant decreases in bank 
lending rates seen across the euro area since summer 2014 (notabl
y owing to the 
ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures) and improvements in the supply of, 
and demand for, bank loans have supported these trends. However, the ongoing 

consolidation of bank balance sheets and still high levels of non
-performing loans i
n some countries continue to curb loan growth.

 The fu
rther net easing of credit standards and the continued increase in loan 
demand by firms and households continued to contribute to the recovery of 
loan growth. 
According to the July 2016 euro area bank lending survey, competitive 
pressure remained the main 
factor behind the easing of credit standards. In addition, 
increasing loan demand was driven by a variety of factors
3, including the low general 
level of interest rates, financing needs for mergers and acquisitions and favourable 
housing market prospects (
see 
survey
). In this context, the main effect of the 
TLTROs on credit supply was through an easing impact on credit terms and 
conditions. Banks also reported that the add
itional liquidity from the TLTROs was 
mainly used for granting loans. Moreover, euro area banks reported that the TLTROs 
have had a positive impact on their profitability.
 Banks™ composite cost of debt financing declined in July to a new historical 
low, af
ter broadly stabilising in the second quarter of 2016 
(see
 Chart
 24).
 The 
considerable decline in July was driven mainly by a fall in bond yields, while the cost 
of deposits declined only marginally. The ECB™s accommodative monetary policy 

stance, the net 
redemption of MFIs™ longer
-term financial liabilities, the strengthening 
of bank balance sheets and receding fragmentation across financial markets have 

contributed to the decrease in banks™ composite cost of debt financing. In line with 

recent development
s, euro area banks reported in the July 2016 bank lending survey 
an improvement in access to funding via debt securities
 in the second quarter of 
2016.                                                                     3 See

 25 Bank lending rates for the private sector remained 
on a downward trend in the second quarter of 2016 
and in July
 (see Charts 25 and 
26). Composite lending 
rates for NFCs and households have decreased by 
significantly more than market reference rates since 
June 2014, signalling an improvement in the pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending 
rates. The decrease in banks™ c
omposite funding costs 
has supported the decline in composite lending rates. 

Between May 2014 and July 2016, composite lending 

rates on loans to both euro area NFCs and households 
for house purchase fell by around 100 basis points. The 
reduction in bank le
nding rates was especially strong in 

vulnerable euro area countries, indicating receding 
fragmentation in euro area financial markets. Over the 
same period, the spread between interest rates 

charged on very small loans (loans of up to •0.25 
million) and th
ose charged on large loans 
(loans of 
above •1 million)
 in the euro area followed a downward 
trend. This indicates that small and medium
-sized 
enterprises have generally been benefiting to a greater 
extent than large companies from the decline in lending 
rates.

 Money and credit
 26 stands at levels seen at the end of 2004 (before the start of the period of excessive 
credit growth). The recovery in NFCs™ external financing observed since early 2014 
has been supported by the strengthening of economic activi
ty, further declines in the 
cost of bank lending, the easing of bank lending conditions, the very low cost of 
market
-based debt and larger numbers of mergers and acquisitions. At the same 
time, NFCs™ record high cash holdings have reduced the need for exte
rnal financing.
 Net issuance of debt securities by euro area NFCs strengthened further in 

April and May 2016, before contracting in June. 
The strengthening in April and 
May was supported, among other factors, by the ECB™s monetary policy package 
announced 
in March 2016, including the 
corporate 
sector 
purchase 
programme, and 
was widespread across countries
4. The June moderation was most likely related to 
concerns about the UK referendum. Available evidence suggests that corporate 
bond issuance strengthened m
odestly again in July and August. The net issuance of 
quoted shares by NFCs has remained fairly modest in recent months.
 The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs is estimated 
to have fallen in July 2016 to a new historical low, bef
ore returning in August to 
the levels observed in the second quarter of 2016. 
The July decline was due both 
to a fall in the cost of equity financing and to a decline in the cost of market
-based 
debt financing, while the increase in August was attributable
 exclusively to a rise in 
the cost of equity financing. The cost of equity financing followed developments in 
equity prices and expected earnings. The cost of market
-based debt financing 
continued to decline over the period from June to August as a consequ
ence of the 
ECB™s March 2016 monetary policy measures and globally declining yields.

 Fiscal developments
 27 6 Fiscal developments
 The euro area budget deficit is foreseen to 
continue to decline
 over the projection 
horizon (2016
-18) 
mainly 
on the back of lower interest payments
 and favourable 
cyclical conditions
. The aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area is projected to be 
expansionary in 2016, but to turn broadly neutral in 2017
-18. 
While
 the aggregate 
debt-to
-GDP ratio is projected to decline over the projection horizon,
 thi
s masks large 
cross
-country differences. In 
particular
, those countries with high debt levels would 
need additional consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a 
downward path
, while other countries with fiscal space should use this room
 for 
budgetary manoeuvre to support demand
. The 
euro area general government 
budget deficit 
is projected to 
decline 
gradually over the 
projection horizon
. Based on the 
September
 2016 ECB
 staff 
macroeconomic projections
5, the 
budget 
deficit is expected to 
decline from 2.1% of 
GDP in 2015 to 1.5% of GDP in 2018
 (see 
the t
able).
 In 2016, 
lower interest 
payments 
together with favourable
 cyclical 
conditions
 are projected to 
more than 
offset the 
fiscal loosening
. In 2017 and 2018, low interest payments are fores
een to 
remain an important driver of the deficit reduction.
 Compared with the 
June
 2016 projections
, the fiscal 
outlook 
remains broadly unchanged over the projection 
horizon.
6 More detailed information on the 2017 budgets will only become available 
when th
e euro area countries submit their draft budgetary plans by mid
-October.
 The euro area fiscal stance is projected to be expansionary in 2016
 and to turn 
broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018.
7 The 
loosening of the aggregate fiscal stance 
in 
2016 reflects the im
pact
 of 
expansionary measures on the revenue side, such as 
cuts in direct taxes and social security contributions in a number of euro area 

countries. The expansionary fiscal stance 
can be 
regarded
 as broadly appropriate
 in 
view of the need to find a balanc
e between the amount of slack in the economy and 
the limited fiscal space, the latter in countries with high public debt.
 Regarding the 
period 2017
-18, the 
fiscal stance 
is projected to be broadly neutral, as deficit
-increasing measures on the revenue side
 are likely to be offset by less dynamically 
growing government primary expenditure items. The latter include, in particular, 
compensation of employees and intermediate consumption, which are projected to 
grow below nominal trend GDP growth, while other it

  6  Preliminary estimates of the German government 
accounts only become available after the cut
-off date. 
The general government surplus recorded in the first half of 2016 was, at 1.2% of GDP, significantly 
higher than the balanced budget projected in the German stability programme for the full year. While
 the full
-year figures are likely to be lower than the figures for the first half of 2016, a significant surplus 
is likely.

d reduction in government debt 
is supported by 
various factors, including

contribute to 
a better debt outlook. 
Compared with the June
 2016 project
ions, the euro area debt

 is expected to 
be somewhat lower by the end of the projection horizon, which notably 
relates to the strong 
upward revision 
to
 Irish nominal GDP for 2015
.8 From a cross
-country perspective, the debt
-to
-GDP ratio is fore
seen to remain heterogeneous, 
with more than half of euro area countries exceeding the 60% threshold by the end 
of the projection horizon. Moreover, in a few countries, the government debt ratio is 
expected to increase further over the projection horizon.
 Further consolidation efforts are essential, notably in countries with high debt
-to-GDP ratios.
 These countries need to set their public debt ratio firmly on a 
downward path, as they are particularly vulnerable
 to
 renewed financial market 
instability or 
a rebound in interest rates.
 Euro area countries with fiscal space should, 
in turn, make use of the room for manoeuvre, for example by expanding public 
investment, while all countries should strive for a more growth
-enhancing 
composition of government budget
s. Full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact would support countries in 
correcting budgetary imbalances and thus 
guide them
 towards an appropriate 
debt trajectory.
 In this regard, on 12 July the Ecofin Council concurred with the 
                                                                    8  As a result of the

ent that neither Portugal nor Spain had taken effective action 
to correct their excessive deficits by the respective deadlines of 2015 and 2016. On 
2 August the Council therefore gave notice on the measures needed to be taken to 
correct the excessive defic
it. It recommended Portugal to correct its excessive deficit 
this year, based on an additional fiscal effort of 0.25% of GDP, and to reduce the 
headline budget deficit to 2.5% of GDP. In turn, Spain was granted a two

0.4% of GDP this year and structural annual improvements of 0.5% of GDP 

thereafter. Both countries are invited to outline their plans on how they intend to 
follow up on the Council™s recommendations by

that no effective action had been taken by either country, on 8 August the Council 
followed the Commission recommendation not to impose sanctions, which in

 Determinan

 1 Determinants of the slowdown in global trade: what is the 
new normal?
 Global trade has been exceptionally weak over the past
 five years.
 Annual world 
import growth has been below its long
-run average since mid
-2011, the longest 
period of below
-trend growth for half a century. Prior to the Great Recession, 
global 
trade grew on average ro
ughly twice as fast as global output; sinc
e 2012 trade has 
barely matched the growth rates of world GDP (see Chart A). As a result, the global 
imports
-to
-GDP ratio has discontinued its strong upward trend and largely stagnated 
in the past five years (see Chart B). 
The observed decline in the gross
 income 
elasticity of trade 
Œ defined as the average growth rate of world imports divided by 
the average growth rate of world GDP 
Œ raises the question whether the trade 
weakness represents a temporary deviation from trend or a longer
-lasting 
phenomenon re
flecting 
more 
fundamental structural changes. 
The question has 
been a prominent area of recent research
9 and is highly relevant for central banks 
seeking to understand the role of external demand and international linkages in 
shaping the outlook for domest
ic activity, potential output and inflation. 
A recent 
report by 
experts of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) 
finds that the 
weakness in world trade 
relative 
to g
lobal GDP is likely to persist, 
being 
mainly 
driven by two developments.

. The latest observation is for the 
fourth quarter of 2015
. First, compositional effects dampen the global income elasticity of trade.
 Shifts 
in the global
 trade elasticity can reflect both changes in individual country elasticities 
and the change in the relative weights of each country within the global aggregate. 
Thus, in addition to fluctuations in elasticities at the national level, changes in the 

global
 elasticity also reflect shifts in import shares and relative growth across 
countries with different trade intensities. In particular, the increasing importance of 

emerging economies
, 
whose growth is 
typically 
less trade
-intensive
, has implications 
for the
 global trade elasticity.
11 The shift in trade and GDP growth from advanced 
economies 
towards emerging market economies implies a weaker relationship 

between trade and economic activity at the global level. This change in the 

geographical composition can ex
plain about half of the decline in the global elasticity 
of 
trade between the periods 1980
-2007 and 2012
-15 (see Chart C
). To a lesser 
extent, demand composition effects have also contributed to the global trade 

slowdown
. As import
-intensive GDP components
 Œ such as investment
 Œ have 
weakened relative to other demand components, 
import growth has also 
moderated

 Notes: Both measures exclude energy
-related trade. The intermediate share is mean
-variance adjusted to that of the GVC participation measure. The GVC measure is based 
on Borin and Mancini (2015).
   Second, s
eve
ral developments have 
lowered 
trade elasticities at the country 
level.
 Various struc
tural factors that boosted trade growth in the past, including 
falling 
transportation costs and the removal of trade barriers
, appear to have largely 
run their course. Another 
related 
factor is
 the moderation in the expansion of global 
value chains (GVCs).
 The 
growing
 fragmentation of production processes across 
international borders had significantly 
supported
 gross trade
, particularly in the 
1990s and early 2000s when
 intermediate components were increasingly shipped 
multiple times between economies along
 their production chains. It appears that the 
sharp rise in GVCs has 
stalled 
and possibly even reversed after 2011
 (see Chart D)
. 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that increasing protectionist measures such as local 
content requirements induce firms to increasi
ngly source and produce in their export 
markets, thereby substituting for earlier trade flows.
13 Furthermore
, 
non-linearities in 
the link between financial sector development and trade openness may also have 

contributed to the slowdown in global trade growt
h. Substantial financial deepening 
in the last three decades in many countries was associated with increasing trade 
openness. However, 
as financial sectors have matured, 
the positive impact of further 
financial deepening
 on trade
 has weakened. Future 
support from financial factors to 
global trade growth is therefore likely to be somewhat limited.

 Determinants of the slowdown in global trade: what is the new norm
al?
 33 Looking ahead, the structural factors seem unlikely 
to reverse over the medium term. 
The gradual shift of 
activity towards
 emerging
 market economies is widely 
anticipated to persist
. Moreover, the structural 
developments that boosted trade in the past 
Œ falling 
transportat
ion costs, trade liberalisation, expanding 
GVCs and financial deepening 
Œ are not expected to 
support tra
de to the same extent 
over
 the 
medium term.
 As such, the ﬁnew normalﬂ for the trade elasticity 
over the medium term 
is likely to 
be similar to the 
weak level 
observed over recent years on average.
 Specifically, for the world excluding the euro area, the 
elasticity 
fell from around 1.8
 over the period 1995
-2007 (i.e. before the crisis) to 0.9
 over the period 2012
-15. 
Part of the weakness in the recent period
 is due
 to 
large 

adverse shocks
 to 
a small number of countries
, particularly Russia and Brazil
, in 201
5. These 
have 
pushed global trade growth 
significantly 
below the rate 
of GDP growth (see Chart E). 
As these shocks unwind, global trade growth is 
expected to gradually rise to levels consistent with global GDP, 
bringing the global 
trade
-income elasticity (
excluding the euro area) back to the ﬁnew normalﬂ of a value 
around unity

 Financing constraints in euro area regions
 34 2 Financing constraints in euro area region
s This box presents new evidence on access to finance at regional level within 
the euro area
. The Survey on Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) has been 
carried out by the ECB and the European Commission since 2009 on a biannual 
basis. It provides information on developments in firms™ access to and use of external 
financing in the euro area, b
roken down by firm size and sector. Until now, analysis 

of the results of this survey has focused mainly on differences between euro area 
countries, disregarding heterogeneity at a regional level within countries. However, 
there is growing evidence that th
e regional dimension of access to finance is 

important even in integrated financial markets, particularly for small and medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs). Indeed, the level of regional financial development 
Œ which often has important implications as regards
 the accessibility of external 
sources of finance 
Œ is positively correlated with growth at a regional level. At the 
same time, regional market conditions matter in terms of determining financing 

constraints that are not related to firms™ individual financ
ial characteristics and 
circumstances.
14 Financing
 constraints vary from region to region
 across 
the 
euro area
. Since 
April 2014, information on the regions where surveyed companies are located has 
been collected by the SAFE survey on the basis of level 1 o
f the Nomenclature of 
Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). Thus, the 12 euro area countries covered by 
the survey are broken down into 57 major socio
-economic regions.
15 Chart A shows 
the level of financing constraints in these various regions by firm s
ize, based on 
survey results from 2014 to 2016.
16 Under the definition used in the survey, a firm is 
considered to be financially constrained if it applies for a bank loan or credit line and 
its application is rejected (or accepted only in part) or it refus
es the loan or credit line 
on offer because the associated costs are too high. A firm is also considered to face 
financing constraints if it needs 
a bank loan or credit line 
but is 
discouraged
 from 
applying for one.
 The percentage of firms that have experi
enced financing 
constraints appears to vary from region to region within individual countries. In 

addition, smaller companies appear to be more likely to experience financing 
constraints in most regions, with more pronounced regional differences relative t
o larger companies.
                                                                     14  See Guiso, L., Sapienza, P. and Zingales, L., ﬁDoes local financial development matter?ﬂ,

C Factors affecting the likelihood of firms facing financing 
constraints
 (marginal effect on the likelihood of a firm facing financing constraints; based on a probit 
regression
)  Sources: SAFE survey and ECB calculations.
 Notes: The dependent variable is binary, taking a value of 1 if the firm has reported 
financing constraints in the preceding six months and a value of 0 otherwise. The 

sample of firms comprises all fi
rms that either (i) applied for bank credit or (ii) needed 
credit, but were discouraged from applying. The bar labelled ﬁRegional impact on size 

effectﬂ shows the interaction between firm size and a dummy variable that takes a value 

of 1 if the percentage 
of firms in a specific region which signal that the general economic 
outlook has improved in the previous six months is higher than the percentage at the 

level of the country as a whole. This estimation is based on a weighted probit 

regression, including c
ountry/industry and time fixed effects, as well as cluster
-robust 
errors at regional level.
 It appears that regional 
conditions
 are particularly important for smaller firms
 in terms of 
determining 
access to finance
. In order to further investigate the 
rela
tive importance of the region where firms are located, the probability of a firm 
having only limited access to the credit market is estimated as a function of the 
regional economic environment and market conditions, alongside the firm™s specific 
characteri
stics, financial situation and capital structure (see Chart C).
17 On average, 
the probability of facing financing constraints is 29% lower where a firm reports 
increased availability of credit and around 8% lower where its business environment 
is improving.
 In addition, micro and small enterprises are around 5% more likely to 
experience financing constraints than medium
-sized and large companies.
 However, 
that size effect varies depending on the economic outlook for the region in question 

relative to the 
overall outlook for the country as a whole, with the probability of micro 
and small firms experiencing financing constraints falling significantly (by around 2 
percentage points) if local financing conditions are more positive than those 
observed at the le
vel of the country as a whole.
                                                                     17  In this firm
-level specification, a first set of variables controls for firms™ size (in terms of the number of 
employees and the level of turnover) and age and whether they are independent or family
-owned. A 
second set controls for firms™ financial situation in terms of their sales and own funds, as well as their 
perceptions regarding the general economic outlook and the availability of credit. All of these variables 
are binary, taking a value of 1 if there is
 an improvement in the relevant factor. In addition, a third set of 
variables takes account of the use of retained earnings and trade credit as alternatives to bank credit.

 Financing constraints in euro area regions
 37 Overall, firm
-level survey data confirm that 
regional
 market conditions affect 
the financing constraints 
faced by firms
. Greater attention needs to be paid to 
determinants of regional differences in the availability of credit
, looking at whether 
these are predominantly related to the nature of the local banking sector (i.e. its level 
of development) or local borrowers™ liquidity preferences.
18 Ultimately, the use of 
such local information will provide additional guidance regard
ing the impact that 
monetary policy has in the various regions of the euro area.

 Liquidit
y conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 27 April to 26 July 
2016 38 3 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the 
period from
 27 April to 26 July 2016
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the 
third
 and 
fourth
 reserve maintenance periods of 201
6, which ran from 2
7 April
 to 
7 June
 and from 
8 June 
to 26 
July
 respectively. 
During this period the 
interest rates on 
the main refinancing operations (MROs)
, the marginal lending facility
 and the deposit 
facility
 remained
 unchanged at
 0.0
0%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. On 28 June 
the first targeted longer
-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) in the second series of 
TLTROs (TLTRO
-II) was settled
 for an amount of •399.3 billion. However, that 
amount was largely offse
t by simultaneous voluntary repayments from the first series 
of TLTROs (TLTRO
-I) totalling •367.9 billion. That voluntary repayment option 
allowed banks to switch from TLTRO
-I to TLTRO
-II, thereby benefiting from more 
favourable conditions. For example, th
e interest rate applied to TLTRO
-II operations 
is linked to participating banks™ lending patterns 
Œ i.e. the more loans banks issue to 
non-financial corporations and households, the lower the interest rate on their 
TLTRO
-II borrowing will be.
19 On 
28 June
 the eighth and final
 TLTRO
-I operation
 was settled for 
•6.7
 billion, compared with •
7.3
 billion in the 
seventh
 TLTRO
-I operation 
in 
March
. 
Those voluntary repayments and new operations resulted in the 
total outstanding amount for both TLTRO programmes standing at •463.0 billion at 
the end of the review period. 
In addition, the Eurosystem continued buying public 
sector securities, covered bond
s and asset
-backed securities
, and started to 
purchase corporate sector securities
 as part of its 
expanded 
asset purchase 
programme (APP)
,20 with 
a target of •8
0 billion 
of purchases 
per month.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily l
iquidity needs of the banking 
system, defined as the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements, 
stood at •
843.1
 billion, an increase of •
64.5
 billion compared with the previous 
review period (i.e. the 
first and second
 maintenance periods of 
2016). That 
increase in liquidity needs wa
s attributable 
almost exclusively to an increase in 
average net 
autonomous factors, which rose by •
63.1
 billion to stand at 
•727.6
 billion (see
 table).
                                                                     19  For further information on TLTRO

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 27 April to 26 July 
2016 40 The increase in
 autonomous factors was mainly a result of 
an 
increase in 
liquidity
-absorbing factors.
 The mai
n contributor to this increase was government 
deposits, which increased on average by •21.4 billion to stand at 
•151.6 b
illion
 in the 
period under review.
 This increase stemmed from the fourth maintenance period, 
when the pronounced tax receipts seen in a 
number of euro area countries in June 
resulted in inflows to governments™ accounts with national central banks. This, 
coupled with the reluctance of some treasuries to place their excess liquidity in the 

market at negative rates, contributed to higher leve
ls of government deposits being 
held with national central banks. Average demand for banknotes also increased, 
rising by •16.2 billion to stand at •1,082.3 billion. O
ther
 autonomous factors rose by 
•44.0 billion, more than government deposits and banknotes
 combined, but that 
increase was largely attributable to quarterly revaluations of portfolio positions and 
was therefore offset by changes to net foreign assets.
 Liquidity
-providing factors 
increased
 over the 
review 
period 
as the continuing 
decline in net 
assets denominated in euro was compensated for by an 
increase in net foreign assets.
 Average n
et assets denominated in euro 
fell to
 •470.3
 billion, down •
18.8
 billion from the previous review period
, on account of 
a decline in
 financial assets held by the 
Eurosystem for purposes other than monetary 
policy, together with a
n increase in liabilities held by foreign
 official
 institutions with 
the 
national 
central 
banks. 
Those 
institutions increased their holdings
, despite the 
further 
reduction in
 the deposit fa
cility
 rate, possibly because there were 
few 
attractive 
alternatives in the market.
 Net foreign assets increased by •
37.3
 billion
 to 
stand at •654.2 billion, mainly as a result of quarterly portfolio revaluations.
 The volatility of autonomous factors 
remained elevated
, broadly unchanged 
from
 the 
previous review 
period.
 That
 volatility primarily reflected strong 
fluctuations in government deposits and
, to some extent, 
the quarterly revaluation of 
net foreign assets and net assets denominated in euro. 
Meanwhile, 
autonomous 
factors continued 
to rise
. At the same time, the
 average absolute error in weekly 
forecasts of autonomous factors declined by •
0.8
 billion to 
stand at 
•5.2 billion in the 
period under review
. Liquidity provided through monetary policy i
nstruments
 The average amount of liquidity provided through open market operations 
Œ both
 tender operations and 
the asset purchase programme 
Œ increased by 
•213.7
 billion to 
stand at 
•1,685.9
 billion (see

 Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 27 April to 26 July 
2016 41 The a

amount of 
liquidity provided through 
tender operations declined 
slightly 
in the period 
under review
, falling 
by •
6.8
 billion to 
stand at 
•515.0
 billion. 
The increase in the liquidity provided by 
the TLTROs was more than offset by a decrease in the 
liquidity supplied via regular operations. 
More 
specifically, 
liquidity provided via 
MROs and 
three
-month LTROs decre
ased by •
10.2
 billion and 
•13.5
 billion
 respectively
, while t
he outstanding amount 
of TLTROs increased by 
•16.9 billion as a net effect of 
the settlement of the first TLTRO
-II operation and 
voluntary repayments from the first seven TLTRO
-I 
operations.
 Average liquidity
 provided through 
the expanded 
asset purchase programme 
increased by 
•220.6
 billion to stand at •
1,170.9
 billion, mainly 
on 
account of
 the 
public 
sector 
purchase 
programme. 
Average liquidity provided by the 
public 
sector 
purchase 
programme, th
e third 
covered 
bond purchase 
programme
, the 
asset
-backed 
securities 
purchase 
programme
 and the corporate sector purchase programme
 rose 
by •
209.6
 billion, •
18.4
 billion
, •0.8
 billion
 and •3.5 billion
 respectively. The 
redemption of bonds held under the 
Securities 
Markets 
Programme and the previous 
two 
covered 
bond purchase 
programmes 
totalled
 •11.6 billion
. Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments
 detailed above
, excess liquidity rose 
on average 
by •
149.2
 billion to 
stand at 
•842.8
 billion 
in
 the period under 
review 
(see 
chart). 
The majority of that increase came in the third 
maintenance 
period, when excess liquidity rose by •
100.0
 billion on account of 
increased
 purchases and 
a liquidity
-providing effect resulting from changes in
 autonomous 
factors.
 The relatively small increase in excess liquidity in the fourth maintenance 
period was
 mainly a consequence of
 the 
larger 
rise in autonomous factors, which 
partially absorbed the increase
d liquidity provided by
 the 
expanded asset purchase 
programme
. That increase
 in excess liquidity was reflected 
mainly 
in higher
 average 
current account holdings, which rose by •79.2 billion
 to stand at •641.9 billion
 in the period under review
. Average recourse to the deposit facility increased by 
•71.6 billion to 
stand at •316.6 billion.

 43 4 Global production pat
terns from a European perspective: 
insights from a survey of large euro area firms
 In the aftermath of the Great Recession, global trade growth has remained 
exceptionally weak, barely increasing as a ratio of world GDP
. These 
developments represent a marke
d change compared
 with the strong growth in global 
trade seen in the preceding decades. Various explanations have been suggested
 for 
the
 protracted period of below
-average trade growth 
seen over recent years
, 
covering b
oth short
-term, cyclical 
and longer
-term structural 
factors (see Box 1 in this 
issue of the Economic Bulletin).
 This 
box reports 
on the drivers of recent global 
trade and production developments from an 
ad hoc 
survey of 
leading euro area 
business
es.22 The t
able 
summarises the breakdown of the 44 
participating 
firms
. 
25 of the responses came from the broader 
industrial sector (including construction), and 19 from 

the services sector. Together, these large and often 
multinational companies employed around 2.2
 million 
persons and their turnover amounted to over 
•600 bill
ion, which equate to around 1.6% of total 2013 
European Economic Area (EEA
23) employment and 
about 2.1% of 2013 EEA turnover respectively.
24 Respondents highlighted fast
-moving technological developments, demand 
concerns
 and labour market 
issues
 as the main 
global challenges 
that
 their 
sectors 
are faced with 
at the present time (see 
Chart 
A). Almost half of 
respondents cited technological advances 
due to
 rapid digital progress among the 
three main global challenges 
that
 their sectors 
currently have to contend
 with
. Firms 
reported 
that there had been an 
impact on all aspects of operation
s Œ from ways of 
reaching customers (e
-commerce) to data protection issues, price and cost 
implications, 
and effects
 that enhanced technologies have 
on the location of 
productio
n/operation
s and logistics. 
Demand 
concerns 
Œ globally and within the EEA
 Œ were cited by just over a third of respondents
, which was
 the same proportion 
that
 mentioned labour market challenges (concerns about 
relative 
European labour costs 
in particular
, as well as wider labour supply constraints and skill needs). A quarter of 
firms highlighted changing 
patterns of 
global consumption and 
issues related to 
geopolitical instability (including concerns surrounding commodity price evolutions 
and the 
potentia
l impact 
that terrorism could have 
on activity) among their main 
global challenges.
                                                                     22  The survey was carried out in the spring of 2016. 
 23  The EEA comprises the European Union and also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Although not a 
member of either the European Union or the EEA, Switzerland was included in the survey because it 
has access to the Single Market under the same terms as other 
EU businesses.

B Changes in local production over past five years
 (percentage of responses)
  Sources: Trade surve
y and ECB calculations.
  Notes: Responses to question: 
ﬁOver the past five years, has it become more or less 
common for companies in your sector to produce/operate in the local markets in which 
goods and services are sold?
ﬂ The survey suggests that localisation of production closer to final markets has 
slightly increased over the past five years (see 
Chart 
B). 
Although most firms 
reported no changes to global production patterns over the past five years, j
ust over 
a quarter o
f respondents reported having relocated production or service operations
. Both c
hanging global patterns of demand and high labour costs were cited as 
important 
factors driving operations out of the EEA
. Local content requirements 
were 
also mentioned as 
an important driver.
 Other factors impacting 
on relocation 
decisions related to a desire 
to 
hedge against currency fluctuations, capacity 
constraints within the EEA, excessive regulation, and economic and political 

uncertainty.
 Changes to global production pa
tterns continue to reduce demand for EEA 
labour. 
Roughly twice as many firms considered that changes in global trade 
patterns had reduced demand for EEA labour in their sector as compared with those 
who saw increases. Declines were particularly strong amon
g ﬁblue collarﬂ operatives 
(both in industry and services); however, demand was reported to have increased 
somewhat among the higher skilled occupations (including production technicians 

and supervisors or those in R&D and product design functions).

 Global production patterns from a European perspective: insights from a surv
ey of large euro 
area firms
 45 Reloca
tions were rare, as new markets were typically served by additional 
plants. 
Where they occurred, however, 
moves have often 
focused on relocating 
either within the EEA
 (particularly into lower
-cost 
central and eastern European
 countries from higher
-cost 
west European economies
, as 
cited by 
a third
 of 
those 
relocating
) or, to a lesser extent, to countries outside the EEA (cited by around a 
quarter of relocators).
 Only a handful of respondents reported having relocated back 
into the EEA from outside. Relocatio
n incentives by some EEA
 governments and 
tendencies towards centralisation of administrative and headquarter functions 
Œ usually, 
in the pursuit of cost containment 
Œ were 
reported to have 
incentivised 
relocations back into the EEA.
 Raising European production would require 

stronger 
growth prospects
, stronger cost 
containment and additional policy measures, 

according to survey respondents (see 
Chart 
C). Chart 
C summarises the responses to a question 
requiring respondents to select five factors most likely 

to encourage firms in their sector to increase EEA 

production/operations in the medium term
. Priorities 
were similar across both the industrial and serv
ices 
sectors. More than half of all firms cited stronger growth 

prospects as an incentive to raising European
-based 
production. 
Many 
emphasised the drive for further cost 

containment, via increased emphasis on technological 

advances and efficiency gains, a
s a vital means of
 restoring
 competitiveness and boost
ing 
profitability in a 
low
-growth environment
. Further
 policy measures to
 reduce operating costs 
Œ in particular, 
labour costs
 Œ and liberalise labour market regulations 
were 
emphasised as policy priori
ties by around a third of 
firms
.25 Just
 over a fifth of companies stressed the need 
for stronger investment incentives, reduced corporate taxation and fewer product 

market restrictions. 
Ultimately, the priorities for national policymakers will need to 
take 
account of local business environment conditions and a country™s position in 
global value chains along with its comparative advantages. Nevertheless, the results 
from this survey suggest that, in the view of the firms who took part, high labour and 

operati
ng costs as well as strong labour market regulation are likely to impact firms™ 
location decisions.
                                                                       25  Similar sentiments were also raised in an earlier survey

 What accounts for the recent decoupling between the euro area GDP deflator and the HICP 
excluding ene
rgy and food?
 46 5 What accounts for the recent decoupling between the 
euro area GDP deflator and the HICP excluding energy 
and food?
 The GDP deflator 
can be seen 
as a broad 
indicator of underlying domestic 
price developments. 
There are some differences between the GDP deflator and the 
frequently used measure of HICP excluding energy and food regarding their concept 
and aim.
26 Nevertheless, there has generally been a no
table degree of co
-movement 
between the longer
-term developments of the two indicators. For the euro area, the 
average annual rate of increase in the past 15 years has been of relatively similar 

magnitude. Over the short to medium term, however, somewhat l
arger deviations 
between the two indicators are not uncommon, and the past two years are an 
example of a gap opening up: annual growth in the GDP deflator has increased more 
noticeably and has been rising since mid
-2014, while HICP inflation excluding 
energy and food has edged up much less (see Chart A). This box explores the 
recent ﬁdecouplingﬂ by looking specifically at factors that have accounted for the 
pick
-up in the growth rate of the GDP deflator
. Developments in profit margins have been the main factor behind the recent 

acceleration in the euro area GDP deflator. 
A breakdown of growth in the GDP 
deflator into income components shows that almost all of the increase since mid
-2014 is accounted for by
 higher contributions from profits (gross operating surplus) 
per unit of output, here referred to as profit margins. The contributions from unit 
labour costs and unit indirect taxes (net of subsidies) have on balance been roughly 
unchanged. Profit margin d
evelopments in the euro area are strongly procyclical and 
their recent strengthening is in line with the ongoing recovery in real GDP growth 
(see Chart 
B). 
Favourable developments 
in 
economic 
activity 
support profit margins 
as the
 improvements in
 income an
d demand facilitate 
price 
increases, 
and as
 the 
associated pick
-up in productivity and the 
typically 
delayed 
response of wages to the 
cyclical upturn 
dampen unit labour costs. 
However, the impact of the economic cycle 
via profits should be a factor behind 
the developments in both the GDP deflator and 
the HICP excluding energy and food, suggesting that the recent decoupling reflects 
other factors.
                                                                     26  The main conceptual differences
 between the two indicators 
result from the fact that the 
HICP
 excludin
g energy and food 
refers to 
the 
prices
 of goods and services consumed by households
, while 
the GDP deflator 
is more encompassing and 
captures 
the 
price
s of all final products produced by the 
domestic economy. Looking at the GDP deflator from the expenditur
e side, it thus includes prices for 
private consumption, government consumption, capital formation and exports less those for imports. 
While prices for i
mported goods and services 
are 
not 
included 
in the GDP deflator
, they are included in 
the HICP excludin
g energy and food (with the exception of the direct effect from energy and food 
prices). At the same time, the prices of exported goods and services are included in the GDP deflator, 

but obviously not in the HICP excluding energy and food.

B Real GDP and unit profits
 (annual percentage changes)
  Sources:
 Eurostat and ECB calculations.
 Profit margins 
as captured in the GDP deflator have most likely recently 
also 
reflected changes in the 
terms of trade
. This is suggested by a comparison of the 
decomposition of the GDP deflator on the income side with that on the expenditure 
side, where the former includes the profit margin and the latter includes the (relative) 
prices for exports and impor
ts, i.e. the terms of trade. Changes in these terms may 
have recently reflected different factors. First, the depreciation 
of the 
effective 
exchange rate of the euro seen in mid
-2014 could
 have 
benefit
ed euro area 
exporters™ profit margins
 if they priced
 their products to the market
, i.e. kept 
their 
export 
prices 
unchanged 
in 
the 
foreign currency.
 Second, the 
sharp fall in oil 
and other commodity 
prices
 in mid
-2014 could have benefited euro area producers™ profit 
margins if they did not fully 
pass on 
the as
sociated lower import and input prices 
to 
selling prices. Such an impact is suggested by the notable co
-movement between 
the 
respective 
contributions of profit margins and the terms of trade to the growth 

rate of the GDP deflator in 
the past few years 
(see
 Chart 
C), while before cyclical 
developments appear to have dominated profit margin developments, as illustrated 
in Chart B.
 The impact of input prices on profit margins helps to explain the recent gap 
between growth in the GDP deflator and that in the HI
CP excluding energy and 
food. 
The large f
all in the price
 of oil reduced the price of inputs and intermediate 
consumption in production. Since intermediate consumption is not included in GDP, 

the change in oil input prices will not be directly mapped into 
the 
GDP deflator.
 At the 
same time, if 
the fall in oil input 
prices
 is 
at least partly 
passed on to selling prices
 as 
measured by final consumer prices
, HICP
 inflation excluding energy and food may 
decline
. By contrast, if the fall in oil input 
prices
 is n
ot passed on to selling prices, 
HICP
 inflation excluding energy and food
 remains constant
, whereas the GDP 
deflator increases (via higher profit margins)

On the basis of the current futures curve, the strong favourable

fade out and 
exert a 
dampening 
impact on the growth in the GDP deflator 
in the near term
, as is already 
visible in the data

being equal, HICP inflation excluding energy and food would be expected to pick up 

as the dampening indirect effects from the past fall in oil prices unwind. Once the oil 

price effect has fa
ded, the two indicators of underlying inflation should see some re
-coupling and both increase as the economic recovery plays a more prominent role 
again as a common driver.

 Factors behind developments in average hours worked per person employed since 2008
 49 6 Factors behind developments in average hours worked 
per person employed since 200
8 Over the course of the euro area recovery, average hours worked per person 
employed have remained broadly unchanged, after falling significantly during 

the crisis
. The total amount of labour input used by firms decreased considerably 
between 
the first quarter of 
2008 and 
the second quarter of 
2013, and the decline 
was more significant in terms of total hours worked than in terms of headcount 
employment. Underlying these developments was a decrease in average hours 
worked
 per person,
 which then
 remained flat 
during
 the recovery (
see 
Chart A). 
Although t
he decline 
in average hours worked observed since the start of the crisis 
has generally been considered a cyclical phenomenon, after 12 quarters of 

increasing activity
 average hours worked 
per wor
ker 
have shown no sign of a 
cyclical recovery. This box examines the underlying causes of this phenomenon and 
finds 
that
 the 
increase 
in part
-time work
 plays a significant role

 Factors behind developments in average hours worked per person employed since 2008
 50 average hours worked has been observed across euro area countries and a wid
e range of sectors.
28 In the euro area, average 
weekly 
hours actually worked have fallen by about 
one hour 
since 2008
, 
mostly due to an
 increase 
in part
-time employment.
 A breakdown of the change in average hours worked (as measured by Eurostat™s EU 
labour 
force survey) shows that t
he largest factor behind the recent decline in hours 
actually worked has been the increase 
in part
-time employment (see Chart C
). The 
ratio of part
-time workers 
to all workers 
in the euro area increased 
from 19.0% to 
21.7% between
 the first quarter of 
2008 and the second quarter of 2013
, and 
stood 
at 22.2% in the first quarter of 2016
. This 
increase accounts for
 more than half of the 
decline 
in average hours worked. At the same time, 
the 
average hours worked of full
-time workers al
so decreased 
after the start of the crisis 
(which can be 
explained by a 
fall in overtime and/or a rise in short
-time working), 
recovered somewhat in 2010 and 
2011 but have continued to decline since then, also contributing to the decline in 
average hours w
orked per person employed
. The increase 
in
 part
-time employment is strongly linked to developments in 
the services sectors
. Generally, part
-time work is more prevalent in the services 
sectors than in industry and construction. 
The ratio of part
-time worker
s to all 
workers is around 9% in industry and construction, while it is well above 20% in both 
market and non
-market services. Since 2008 the part
-time work ratio has increased 
in all sectors. However, the largest increase has been seen in the market servi
ces 
sector, which, also on account of its high share, has made the largest contribution to 

the increase in the part
-time work ratio of the economy. This effect has also been 
amplified by the compositional change in employment involving a shift towards 
serv
ices (see Chart D)
. At the same time, part
-time employment 
has 
also increased 
in industry and construction
 since 2008
, but 
it has 
show
n a more cyclical pattern and 
has 
declined 
somewhat during
 the recovery.
                                                                     28  According to national accounts data, between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2016 
average hours worked declined in 
each of the four largest euro area countries with the exception of 
Spain. During this period, the decline in average hours worked in the euro area was also observed in 
all NACE sectors with the exception of information and communication.

 At the euro area level, the growth in part
-time employment seems to ha
ve been 
driven to a significant extent by employers™ preference for this type of 
contract.
 More than
 half of the increase in p
art
-time employment since the first 
quarter of 2008
 seems to 
reflect decisions taken
 on a voluntary basis, as workers 
willingly to
ok advantage of new part
-time opportunities. However, almost half is due 
to a rise in ﬁunderemployment
ﬂ29, as workers involuntarily accept
ed part
-time 
employment, although they would have liked to work more. 
The rise in part
-time 
employment has been similar
 for both genders, although the prevalence of part
-time 
work still remains much higher for women. Underemployment, however, is higher 
among male part
-time workers and the rise in part
-time employment was 
accompanied by a larger increase in male underemploy
ment. Between the first 
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2016, t
he proportion of workers classified as 
underemployed
 grew from 
23% to 
30% in 
the 
case of men, and 
remained broadly 
unchanged at around 20
% in 
the 
case of women
.30 The increase 
in
 the 
part
-time work ratio as well as the related decline 
in average hours worked 
appear to be
 at least partially structural, meaning that 
average hours worked may not return to their pre

. Increased part

t two structural changes: the

 53 Article
 1 The employment
-GDP 
relationship since the crisis
 The continued
 employment growth seen across the euro area since the 
onset of the 
recovery 
in 2013 
has been 
stronger than expected
. 
Differences in the 
responsiveness of employment growth to GDP growth 
between
 the pre
- and post
-crisis periods 
suggest a possible structural change in the underlying employment
-GDP relationship.
 This article explores the factors driving the employment
-GDP 
relationship. It suggests that the changing sectoral composition of GDP growth 
towards a larger 
services sector, a shift in the composition of employment towards 
part
-time employment, and structural labour market reforms and fiscal measures in 
some countries underlie some strengthening in the underlying employment
-GDP 
relationship since the start of 
the recovery.
 The relationship between euro area employment and GDP
 The recovery in euro area GDP since the second quarter of 2013 has been 

accompanied by higher than expected employment growth.
 This article 
assesses 
the
 extent 
to which 
the stronger
 than
 expected employment growth seen 
over the recovery is likely to persist 
and examines some of the factors 
likely
 to be 
contributing to this
. From a central bank perspective, this topic is important because 
the labour market recovery is crucial for the streng
th of confidence and consumption 
in the aftermath of the crisis. While the earlier weakening of the relationship between 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate (Okun™s law), or between GDP and 

employment
 growth, has been documented and explained in the liter
ature
31, much 
less attention has, so far, been paid to the strong ﬁreconnectionﬂ between 
employment and GDP growth over the recovery.
 To some extent, it is surprising that the employment
-GDP relationship
 over the 
recovery
 has been as strong as in the pre
-crisis years.
 Before the onset of the 
Great Recession in 2008, euro area 
employment growth co
-moved closely with GDP. 
In retrospect, however, the strong employment growth experienced in some 
countries in the pre
-crisis per
iod had been associated with the emergence of sectoral 
imbalances, which were later viewed as unsustainable in the longer term. 
Nevertheless, since the onset of the euro area recovery in GDP, employment 
responses to GDP growth have been at least as strong 
as in the pre
-crisis period. 
 Both cyclical and structural changes are likely to have contributed to the 
higher than expected responsiveness of euro area employment to GDP since 
the rebound.
 The cyclical reasons include strong rebounds following large 
                                                                    31  See, for example,

eases in employment in some countries and the introduction of 
short
-term fiscal 
measures, which have boosted employment growth in the aftermath of the crisis in 
some 
Member States. However, ongoing structural changes and structural reforms in 
some countrie
s are also likely to have played a more persistent role.
32 This article considers the factors underlying the employment
-GDP relationship 
and assesses their role in explaining the strong employment growth observed 

since the start of the euro area recovery.
 The remainder of this article is organised 
as follows: 
Section 2 
provides an overview of euro area employment
-GDP dynamics 
over the course of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), focusing on developments 

since the crisis. Section 3 provides a quantification o
f the employment
-GDP 
relationship and includes a box examining the evidence of changing employment 
dynamics from a statistical perspective
. Section 
4 assesses the importance of 
sectoral dynamics in explaining the recent 
strength in the 
employment
-GDP 
relat
ionship
. A second box compares 
the patterns observed in the euro area 
with 
those seen in the 
United States
 since the Great Recession and considers the 
implications of recent 
strong 
employment
 growth in both economies 
for productivity 
measurement
. Section 
5 examin
es the country dimension 
of the euro area aggregate 
and assesses the role of 
policy measures 
in shaping
 recent euro area developments. 
A third b
ox examines the impact of structural reforms on country
-level changes in 
employment reactions to output 
growth. Section 6 concludes.
 A longer
-term overview of 
euro area employment 
dynamics
 The global economic and financial crisis brought about a major ﬁdisconnectﬂ 

in the employment
-GDP relationship.
 Before the crisis 
Œ between the first quarters 
of 1999 and 
2008 respectively 
Œ euro area employment and GDP growth had co
-moved closely (see Chart 1). This relationship, however, broke down with the onset 

of the Great Recession in 2008, although persistent job losses and subsequent weak 

job creation during the int
erim recovery
33 and a further very strong shake
-out of 
employment in the euro area™s second (double
-dip) recession helped to restore the 
underlying relationship. Since the recovery in activity that began in early 2013, 

employment and GDP appear to have reco
nnected strongly. These distinct phases 
are illustrated in Chart 2 and are briefly discussed below.
                                                                     32  Statistical and measurement issues may have also played a role; however, these are not the focus of 
this article.

 The employment
-GDP relationship s
ince the crisis
 55 When
 the global Great Recession hit the euro area 
economy in 2008, euro area employment initially 
contracted relatively moderately, given the sharp 
decline in GDP growth, but this was to some extent 

countered over the course of the interim rebound.
 While euro
 area employment initially contracted only 

modestly in the first quarters of the Great Recession, 

the employment decline continued for several quarters 
into the interim rebound in activity, which lasted from 
the third quarter of 2009 until the third quarter
 of 2011 
(as shown by the yellow line in Chart 2). Moreover, 
despite a marked recovery in euro area GDP over the 
subsequent interim rebound, euro area employment 

barely rose, in part reflecting the delayed effects of 
earlier labour hoarding (see the red li
ne in Chart 2). 
The 
marked disconnect in the relationship between 
employment and GDP has been widely reported and 

analysed in the literature

 As the euro area slid back into recession (from the fourth quarter of

 The employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 56 quarter of the GDP rebound 
Œ and has since expanded strongly in line with GDP 
dynamics (see the light blue line in Chart 2).
 Despite the strengthening of the employment
-GDP 
relationship of late, euro area employment remains 
slightly below pre
-crisis levels.
 As Chart 3 shows, in 
the first qu
arter of 2016
35 euro area employment was 
still around 1% below the pre
-crisis peak seen in the 
first quarter of 2008. However, the slight shortfall in 

headcount employment contrasts markedly with 
developments in total hours worked. In the first five 
years o
f the crisis, developments in headcount 

employment and total hours worked diverged 
substantially, with the latter remaining considerably 
below pre
-crisis levels, following a further significant 
reduction in total hours worked over the course of the 
second 
euro area recession. Following this strong 
decline, it had been expected that subsequent 

increases in activity would be met by increases in 
working hours of existing headcount (resulting in 
increases in measured average working hours per 

person employed).
36 In practice, however, average 
hours worked per person employed have barely changed since 2013. Instead, the 

evolution of total hours worked has merely reflected the expansion in employment 

(see also the box entitled ﬁFactors behind developments in average
 hours worked 

per person employed since 2008ﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin).
 Over the recovery, employment forecasts for the euro area have been 
continually revised upwards by a wide range of forecasters.
 It seems that 
forecasters had also anticipated that firms would 
expand the
 working hours of their 
incumbent 
employees, rather than expand headcount.
 Chart 4 shows that 
Eurosystem and ECB staff projections consistently underestimated euro area 
employment gr
owth over the 2013
-15 interval, even as the recovery was under way. 
Similar errors are evident in the forecasts for the euro area from other institutions, 
such as the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD, as forecasters there 
also were caught out by a
 stronger than expected employment response to GDP 

growth, rather than forecast errors for GDP.
 37                                                                     35 This article is based on data available up to the end of June 2016.
 36  For example, the European Commission held
 the view that ﬁthe current low level of average hours 
worked does not represent necessarily a 
new normal
, as it is accompanied by a significant increase in 
involuntary part
-time employment, which has a clear cyclical pattern and can be expected to be 
reabsorbed during the recoveryﬂ

Commi
ssion, 2015, p.24.
 37  Indeed, GDP growth was lower than projected in 2014 and 
Œ at the time 
Œ similar to the projections in 
2015, while employment growth was higher than anticipated in both years.
 The recent substantial 
revisions to Irish GDP were not take
n into consideration in this assessment.

 The strong employment

 Chart 5 shows a marked

growth in employment as the euro area recovery took hold. By 2015

which unemployment was declining continued to surprise forecasters even at the

with a lag of around two months). Moreover, the euro area unemployment rate 
declin

 58 of the recent recovery in activity

%, slightly

employment and GDP (see Box 1).
 Box 
1 A quantitative investigation of the euro area employment
-GDP relationship
 Econometric analysis finds that the euro area employment
-GDP relationship is at leas
t as 
strong in the recovery period as in the years leading up to the crisis.
 Attempts to assess the 
degree to which euro area employment cyclicality may have changed since the 
post
-crisis 
recovery 
are
, however,
 severely 
restricted
 by the small number of po
st-crisis
 observations
. 
Table 
A summarises the results of 
a simple model designed to
 identify
 the changing cyclicality of 
euro area 
employment
 over the course of the crisis and the subsequent recovery period.
 The results suggest an average pre
-crisis 
elasticity equal to around 0.58 
Œ which is 
similar to the 0.55 observed on a trough
-to-peak basis, as reported in the main text.
 The 
specification was selected to assess the 
differ
ent phases o
f the employment
-GDP 
relationship
 since the onset 
of the crisis.
 In 
particular, the model seeks to explain quarter
-on-quarter growth in euro area total employment 
using contemporaneous real GDP growth and 
several lags of GDP (see Table 1), alongside 
interac
tions of quarterly GDP growth with: (i) a 
dummy variable, 
RECN
, designed to capture 
the well
-known asymmetries during recession 
periods, taking a value of 1 when the euro area 
was in recession, and 0 otherwise; (ii) a dummy 
variable, 
0811
, assigned a value
 of 1 between 
the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter 
of 2011 to capture the strong disconnect in 
employment and GDP developments seen over the first crisis phase
40 (as suggested by Chart 2 in 
the main text); and (iii) a ﬁrecoveryﬂ dummy, 
RECOV
, re
flecting the recovery in euro area GDP from 
the second quarter of 2013 to the end of the sample in the fourth quarter of 2015.
                                                                     39  Computations are made relative to the local troughs in both variables.
 40  A variety of time dummies capturing the crisis periods were tested, for instance: 
0809
, capturing only 
the effects of the Great Recession period (as measured by quarterly developments in euro area GDP) 
and taking a value of 1 for the five quarters of the Great Recession, which the euro area experienced 
between the second quarters of 2008 an
d 2009 respectively; 
CRISIS
, taking a value of 1 between the 
second quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2013, thus covering both euro area recessions and the 

intervening interim rebound. The results reported above reflect the strongest of the three mo
dels, as 
measured by adjusted R
2 and root mean square error criteria.

 The employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 59 Moreover, the results show a marked and 
statistically significant disconnect in the 
longer
-term employment
-GDP relationship 
following the start of the Great Recession.
 Recession asy
mmetries were 
generally 
found to 
be strongly positive and significant
 (see the 
strong positive 
coefficient
 on the 
interaction 
term
, 
RECN*
GDP
t). This suggests that euro 
area employment typically falls at an 
accelerated rate during recessions, rather than 

at the same rate at which it grows during 
periods of GDP expansion. 
However, the model 
finds a strong reduction in
 the 
employment
-GDP 
relations
hip 
over the period of disconnect 
following the onset of the Great Recession (see 
the strong negative coefficient on the interaction 

term 
0811
), reflecting a marked 
moderation
 in 
employment losses 
(as a consequence of well
-documented labour hoarding in som
e euro area 
countries
41) over this period 
Œ and to an extent 
large enough to fully offset 
typical 
recession 
asymmetries
. In the recovery phase, the term aiming to 

capture an
y increase in euro area 
employment 
cyclicality 
in the aftermath of 
the crisis is pos
itive, but statistically insignificant.
 Leaving aside the significance issues
, which 
may be attributable in part to the low number of observations since the recovery
, the implied euro 
area employment elasticity rises from around 0.58 pre
-crisis to almost 0
.70 with the inclusion of a 
post
-crisis interaction dummy, RECOV.
42 Clearly, it is too early to be certain whether the stronger 
increase in employment growth seen over the recovery reflect
s merely an ongoing cyclical 
response to the previous strong decline 
in euro area employment seen over the crisis or the 
emergence of a stronger employment
-GDP relationship.
 Nevertheless, over the 
Q2 
2013
-Q4 
2015 period
, the 
inclusion of the recovery term markedly improves forecasts of euro area employment, 
compared 
either 
with
 forecasts b
ased solely on pre
-crisis relationships or those which simply take 
account of recession asymmetries and the Great Recession disconnect
 (see Chart 
A). Given 
the 
wide
-reaching changes under
 way in many euro area countries 
Œ including 
in the s
ectoral 
composition of output and employment, as well as to labour market institutions as a consequence of 
structural reforms 
Œ further 
careful monitoring of the employment
-GDP
 relationship
 as the recovery 
unfolds seems warranted.
                                                                      41  See, for example, the article entitled ﬁ

 The employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 60 The disconnect bet
ween labour market variables 
and real GDP over the crisis was also seen in total 
hours worked.
 To some extent, t
he disconnect of the 
employment
-GDP relationship 
in the first phase of the 
crisis, reflecting strong labour hoarding in several euro 

area econom
ies, was countered by developments in 
total 
hours worked
 as firms made extensive use of 
short
-time working and other adjustments to average 
working hours of their employees
. This explains the 
stronger reaction of total hours worked to GDP than 

employment o
ver the Great Recession and the interim 
rebound shown in Chart 6. During the double
-dip 
recession, when total hours worked fell more strongly 

(see again Chart 3) 
Œ and proportionately by a much 
greater degree than employment 
Œ the hours elasticity 
increase
d considerably (to around 2.2 
Œ considerably 
above its theoretical upper limit of 1 and around three 
times the size of the employment reaction to GDP). 
Over the recovery, however, total hours worked have 
rebounded only in line with employment 
Œ resulting i
n similar employment elasticities for both variables 
Œ albeit with both the 
employment and total hours worked
 series
 apparently exhibiting slightly stronger cyclicality over the recovery than in the 
pre
-crisis period.
 The strong ﬁreconnectﬂ seen between eu
ro area employment and GDP growth 
in the aftermath of the crisis has also been observed in other advanced 

economies, such as the United States.
 While the rebound in US output from the 
Great Recession began rather earlier than in the euro area, a marked rea
lignment 

between employment growth and GDP growth is evident there also 
Œ yielding a post
-crisis trough
-to
-peak employment
-to
-GDP elasticity of around 0.71, following a 
proportionately much stronger peak
-to
-trough decline in employment. Further 
similaritie
s and differences between the employment rebounds seen in the two 
economies and their implications for measured productivity growth are discussed in 
Box 2.
 Sectoral developments as a potential source of the strong 
employment
-GDP relationship
 Part of the st
rong employment reaction observed over the recovery period is 
likely to reflect the heavy sectoral concentration of the recovery in services 
Œ particularly market services.
 To a large extent this reflects the marked 
concentration 
of euro area output growth
 in these sectors
 (see Chart 7)
, with almost 
four
-fifths of the total expansion in euro area output seen over the recovery 
attributable to market services alone
. 
In terms of employment, the concentration has 

been great

43 Whilst the 
proportional increases in market services are thus not so different from their 
historical averages (also shown in Charts 7 and 8, computed for the pre
-crisis period 
between the first quarters of 1999 and 2008 respectively), three segments 
Œ business services (where part of the employment growth may also reflect broader 
tendencies towards outsourcing in other sectors), trade and transport and non
-market services 
Œ appear to have generated disproportionately large increases in 
employment and to a 
greater extent than in the pre
-crisis period.
44 Meanwhile in 
industry, which has contributed around one
-fifth of the rebound in euro area value 
added seen since the first quarter of 2013, employment has risen only modestly.

. The composition of GDP growth matters, as the services sectors tend to be 
characterised by a relatively higher employment intensity of growth.
 A 1% 
increase in GDP generated by market services result
s in stronger 
aggregate 
employment growth than in industry
, as shown in Chart 9, which displays estimated 
employment intensities for industry and construction, alongside estimates for the two 
services 
sub
-sectors with the strongest contribution to value added growth over the 
recovery. 
While the construction sector 
typically 
exhibits a higher employment 
intensity
 still
, over the recovery its contribution to euro area activity growth has been 
marginal, wh
ile its contribution to employment growth remains 
modestly negative.

Economic Bulletin
, Issue 8, ECB, 2015. 
 44  The
 sectoral patterns of output growth help to explain the lack of 
a rebound in hours worked over the 
recovery. Within the service
s sector, the main thrust of the expansion has been heavily concentrated in 
sectors where average weekly hours worked have tended
 to remain unchanged (e.g. in business 
services
, public services and other services) or even declined
 (trade and transport
, real estate). 
Meanwhile, employment has decreased in sectors where average working hours have expanded 

(i.e.
 construction).

 The
 employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 62 There is a further way in which the changing 
sectoral composition 
helps to 
explain the employment surprise
, in that the strong
-growth sectors tend also 
to be those where the part
-time 
work ratio is typically higher than in other 
sectors
. The ongoing increase in part
-time employment has been driven by an 
expansion of market services. 
In part, 
the generally higher employment intensities 
found in services 
Œ and in business services, in par
ticular 
Œ reflect
 a higher reliance 
on part
-time working in the services sectors (particularly in market services)
, also 
implying, on average,
 a somewhat shorter 
hourly working week,
 compared 
with
 industry
.45 (See the box entitled ﬁFactors behind developmen
ts in average hours 
worked per person employed since 2008ﬂ in
 this issue of the Economic Bulletin.) 
Since the start of the recovery, around one
-third of the total net increase in 
employment represents part
-time jobs.
46 This suggests that, with the total hou
rs 
worked as a given, employment growth was 6% higher than it would have been with 
the part
-time employment rate of 19% seen before the crisis.

partially to 
the lower wage growth seen over recent years.

this feature in the recovery period.

 63 Box 2
 Employment
-GDP dynamics in the euro area and the United States since the crisis
 The Great Recession had a significant impact on labour markets on both sides
 of the 
Atlantic, leading to substantial job losses in both the euro area and the United States.
 However, following a more rapid decline 
in employment during the Great Recession, the post
-crisis 
rebound in employment occurred much faster in the United Stat
es than in the euro area. Chart A 
shows that, following the 2008
-09 Great Recession, US employment took around 26 quarters to 
rebound to pre
-crisis levels.
47 Since the employment trough was reached in the first quarter of 2010, 
an additional 13.7 million jobs have been created 
Œ almost 5.2 m
illion
 over and above pre
-crisis 
employment levels. By contrast, eight years 
(some 32 quarters) 
after the onset of the gl
obal 
economic and financial crisis in the first quarter of 2008, euro area employment remains slightly 
below its pre
-crisis peak 
Œ despite a rebound in euro area employment of the order of 3.8 million 
since the trough was reached in the second quarter of 2
013. In part
, the delayed return to pre
-crisis 
levels of employment in the euro area reflects different GDP dynamics in the two economies, as the 

United States did not experience a second recession linked to the sovereign debt crisis. However, 
GDP dynamics
 alone do not fully explain the different employment dyna
mics seen in the two 
economies.

 The employment

 64 ﬁelasticityﬂ of employment
 to
 GDP losses of 
around 1.45. While to some extent this is
 likely to reflect 
the 
greater
 labour market flexibility which typically characterises the US labour market 
Œ in part as a 
consequence of notably lower employment protection legislation there
48 Œ the reaction was 
clearly
 stronger than in many earlier US recessions, whe
n employment losses were generally 
proportionately smaller than output losses.
49 Given the severity and duration of the recession, it is 
likely that US firms hoarded considerably less
 labour than usually 
seen across post
-war 
recessions.
50 Chart B shows the estimated elasticities of 
the 
employment response to GDP 
developments for the two economies over the crisis period and into the recovery. The US 
experience stands in marked contrast to the strong disconne
ct between employment and GDP 
developments that was evident in the euro area in the early phases of the crisis (
see the section 
entitled ﬁA longer
-term overview of euro area employment dynamicsﬂ
 and Chart 2). As has been 
shown, following the onset of the G
reat Recession, euro area GDP fell by some 5.7%, while 
employment initially declined by 2.7% (peak
-to
-local trough, reached in the first quarter of 2010), 
yielding a ratio of around 0.47. Over this period, institutional support 
Œ in particular from widespr
ead reliance on short
-time
 working schemes and other job
-saving measures in many euro area 
countries
51 Œ helped cushion the impact of the strong GDP losses on euro area employment to a 
greater degree than in the United States. 
 The expansion in US employmen
t relative to GDP has also been proportionately stronger in 
the upturn than in the euro area. 
Chart B demonstrates that following the respective troughs in 
GDP reached after the Great Recession, the employment response to GDP has been more muted 

in the eur
o area than in the United States, yielding an elasticity of around 0.62, compared 
with
 0.71 
in the United States. 
In advance of the crisis, it seems that the elasticity 
in the 
euro area had been 
somewhat stronger than in the United States, reflecting in pa
rt the protracted period of ﬁjobless 
growthﬂ following the bursting of the 
dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. 
 The rebound in employment 
in the United States 
has been somewhat more broadly spread 
across economic sectors than 
that 
in the euro area.
 In 
both 
regions, the business services 
sector
 and the 
trade and transport sector
 have contributed the bulk of the employment increase 
since their respective recoveries started. But the expansion in euro area employment has also been 
driven to a significant extent 
by ongoing growth in non
-market services (including public 
administration, health services and education)
, while this sector contributed much less to US 
employment creation over 
its
 respective recover
y (see Chart C).
52 In addition, the industrial and 
constr
uction sectors 
added around 15% to the US employment expansion seen since 2010
, while 
their contribution was marginal in the case of the euro area. This shows that these sectors 
rebounded more quickly in the United States than in the euro area. In the euro
 area, by contrast, 
                                                                    48  See the

. Productivity growth, however, slowed markedly for both economies compared with pre
-crisis averages.
 Following
 the trough reached in GDP in the second quarter of 2009, US annual 
productivity growth slo
wed to 0.9% year on year 
Œ more than halving its pre
-crisis average rate of 
growth since 1999. In the euro area, where lower productivity growth has long been of concern to 
policymakers
53, productivity growth slowed less (by around a third), but from a lowe
r starting point, 
to just 0.6% year on year. More recently, since the euro area post
-crisis rebound in GDP in the 
second quarter of 2013, the US productivity slowdown has been more marked still
54 and is now 
virtually indistinguishable from the 0.4% year
-on-year annual productivity growth seen in the euro 
area over this interval. In part, these slowdowns reflect a tendency towards stronger employment 
growth relative to GDP growth compared with the pre
-crisis period 
Œ as shown in Charts E and F. 
Moreover, they
 reflect a notable and broadly
-based decline in within
-sector productivity growth 
across all economic sectors in both the euro area and in the United States.
  The strong employment growth seen in both the euro area and the United 

States since the rebound i
n activity has been broadly welcomed by 
policymakers.
 Stronger employment growth
 has doubtless provided 
support to 
household incomes
, but has also further weakened aggregate productivity growth, 
which was already notably weaker 
Œ even at the sectoral level
 Œ than in the pre

period on both sides of the Atlantic. These common trends in productivity growth 
may imply risks to the long

 The employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 67 The country dimension and the 
role of policy measures
 So far
, the rebound in euro 
area employment has been driven 
mainly 
by two 
large 
countries
: Germany (where employment barely declined
, even 
in 
the 
Great Recession) and Spain.
 These two countries 
have together accounted for
 around 
two
-thirds of the cumulative increase 
in euro area empl
oyment since the 
trough in euro area employment reached in the second quarter of 2013 (31% and 
25% respectively 
Œ see Chart 11).
55 France and Italy have contributed much less to 
the euro area™s employment expansion (together accounting for just 13% of the 
expansion in employment seen since the first quarter of 2013), though in the past 
four quarters employment growth has also been gaining momentum in Italy. 
Meanwhile, employment growth has been relatively strong in several of the smaller 
Œ and formerly stres
sed 
Œ economies (most notably in Ireland and Portugal)
.

 Notes: 
Elasticities 
are computed by 
regressing quarter
-on-quarter employment growth 
on quarter
-on-quarter GDP growth (contemporaneous and up to four lags
). All equations 
include an interaction term to account for the typical asymmetries associated with 
recessions (interacting a dummy variable, taking a value of 1 when the respective 

country was in reces
sion, with the rate of quarter
-on-quarter GDP growth), lagged 
dependent variables (to take account of the typical high degree of persistence in 

employment growth 
in many countries) and a constant. Country models were selected 
on the basis of their explanat
ory power (F
-stat, R
2) and the statistical significance of the
 estimated coefficients on GDP.
 In the aftermath of the crisis, policy priorities have turned to means of spurring 
job growth, enhancing labour market flexibility and reducing long
-standing 
labo
ur market dualities.
 The aim is 
to aid reallocation and rebalancing 
Œ particularly 
in those countries most affected by strong job losses. Partly by design, these 

measures are likely to have influenced the elasticity of 
the 
response of employment 
to GDP gro
wth in the recovery. In some countries
, 
elasticities have peaked 
significantly during the
ir respective

Chart 1
2 shows a 
broadly based increas
e in employment elasticities across most euro area countries 
since the crisis. The exploratory analysis in Chart 12 compares estimated 
employment elasticities at country level over the pre
-crisis period with their post

e the 45 degree line show those countries 
where post
-crisis elasticities (estimated for the full Q1 1999 to Q1 2016 period) are

Slightly more than half of the countries f

elasticities notably higher than in the pre

 The extent to which the drivers of recent increases in employment creation 

reflect ongoing structural changes or temporary fiscal measures will influence 

the likely persistence of the strong employment growth seen over the 
recovery.
 While a definitive assessment of their role is not yet possible given the 
short interval of the recovery in some countries
56, structural changes 
Œ including the 
impact of structura
l reforms in several euro area economies (see Box 3 on ﬁRecent 
employment dynamics and structural reformsﬂ) 
Œ are likely to play a larger, sustained 
and more persistent role, also in those countries where
 temporary fiscal stimuli have 
helped to further 
boost employment creation
 over the recovery.
57 Ongoing sectoral 
changes (in particular, the growing role of services in the national output of most 
euro area economies) and compositional effects leading to an increasingly flexible 

workforce
58 are likely to r
esult in a persistently stronger employment reaction to 
changes in output in most euro area economies in the post
-crisis period.
 Box 3
 Recent employment dynamics and structural reforms
 Structural reforms have the potential to alter the reaction of growth i
n employment to output 
growth.
59 This may imply a direct change in the implied elasticities which capture the response of 
employment to GDP growth during the ongoing recovery
 Œ albeit one which is hard to isolate 
econometrically, given lags between the intr
oduction and impact of reforms
. This 
box presents 
some preliminary evidence regarding the impact of structural reforms on employment dynamics in 

euro area countries, with a particular focus on those countries which 
have 
implemented important 
product and la
bour market reforms.

evident
 for only five quarters (from the first quarter 
of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016).

 The employment
-GDP relationship since the crisis
 69 Structural measures may have contributed to an increase in the responsiveness of 
employment to GDP during the recovery in several euro area countries.
 These include 
measures which increase labour market flexibility by decreasing excessive employment protection
, 
for example 
by 
reducing severance payments or making wages more flexible. 
In consequence, 
firms in stressed economies 
may now 
consider it easier
 to adjust employment (
Chart
 A). 
Firms 
in 
Greece and Spain 
appear to 
attribute 
easier employment adjustment mostly
 to labour market 
reforms.
61 Meanwhile, product market reforms 
Œ including 
reforms
 which aim to reduce 
red 
tape or 
make it easier for new firms
 to enter the market, as well as 
those
 which reduce the protection of 
incumbent firms or professions 
Œ may also help to increase the speed or strength of employment 
adjustment of firms. All 
of 
these reforms are at least partly reflected in the change in pr
oduct market 
regulation and employment protection legislation indicators which are plotted against recent 
changes in employment elasticities
62 in 
Chart
 B. Overall, we see that countries which have 
implemented 
stronger
 structural reforms have also witnessed 
an increase in the responsiveness of 
employment to GDP over the course of the recovery.
63 In countries where wide
-ranging reforms were carried out earlier in response to the crisis, 
there is already some evidence of positive impacts on employment dynamics.
 For example, 
the 2012 labour market reform in Spain seems, at least partly, responsible for the 
country™s
 recent 
strong employment growth performance.
64 At the same time, other factors 
Œ such as sectoral 
differences 
in 
growth rates and job creation, as wel
l as a more pronounced rebound 
owing
 to 
previous substantial job losses in Spain 
Œ are also likely to have played a role. In Ireland, a package 
of effective active labour market policies has helped to significantly reduce the unemployment rate 

and get peop
le back 
into work
.65 In Greece, structural reforms in product and labour markets
66                                                                     61  For

shows that unemployment absorption episodes are often associated with a preceding period of 
structural reforms.
  62  Elasticities are taken from a baseline model regressing quarter
-on
-quarter employment growth on 
quarter
-on
-quarter GDP growth (contemp
oraneous and up to four 
lags
, according to the best
-fit country 
lag structures suggested by the data
). All equations include an interaction term to account for the 
typical asymmetries associated with recessions (interacting a dummy variable, taking a value
 of 1 when 
the respective country was in recession, with the rate of quarter
-on
-quarter GDP growth), up to two 
lagged dependent variables (to take account of the typical high degree of persistence in employment 
growth across many countries) and a constant.
 Country models were selected on the basis of their 
explanatory power (F
-stat, R
2) and the statistical significance of the variables of interest (estimated 
coefficients on GDP). The values reported in 
Chart A 
are corrected long
-term values (i.e. adjusted f
or 
the lagged dependent variables).
 63  This increased responsiveness seems particularly noteworthy given that 
the 
high levels of involuntary 
part
-time employment 
during
 the crisis might have resulted in a weaker relationship between 
employment and output d
uring the recovery if 
the 
additional working hours of part
-timers had increased 
as well as employment (see, for example,

  Concluding remarks
 The recovery in euro area activity has 
been accompanied by considerable 
employment creation.
 However, just 12 quarters after the post
-crisis rebound in 
euro area GDP, it is still too early to tell whether the recent
 strong 
growth in 
employment is likely to remain a long
-term feature of euro area labour markets
. 
Nevertheless, it is worth noting 
tha
t the two countries where 
output and 
employment 
growth have 
been the 
strongest 
since the recovery began 
Œ Germany and Spain 
Œ are
 among those 
which have carried out
 the widest
-ranging reforms to their labour 
markets
 since the mid
-2000s.
70 The 2015 labour ma
rket reform in Italy has also 
helped spur renewed employment dynamism in the country over recent quarters. 
These observations may encourage other euro area countries to pursue further 

reforms.
 To some extent, the recent strong employment growth seen in the
 euro area 

has been somet
hing of a positive surprise 
Œ to forecasters and policymakers 
alike. 
With the onset of the
 Great Recession in 2008, 
many had looked back at the 
strong pre
-crisis rates of 
euro area 
employment growth as being the result of 
unsustain
able sectoral imbalances in some countries, and thus unlikely to be 

repeated. However, over the post
-crisis recovery, the euro area employment 
response to GDP growth appears to have been at least as strong as in the pre
-crisis 
period 
Œ both at the aggregat
e level and in many of the euro area countries. This 
article suggests that the recent strong employment performance relative to GDP 
developments is partly due to structural changes under way across the euro area, 
including ongoing sectoral shifts and compo
sitional changes to the workforce, which 

have resulted in a labour market that is more flexible and more responsive to cyclical 

dynamics.
                                                                       70  In Germany, wide
-ranging labour market reforms were enacted some years 
before 
the Great 
Recession. 
These Hartz 
reforms have been widely credited for turning
 around
 the German labour 
market (see 
Dustmann, C., Fitzenberger, B., Sch
önberg, U., Spitz

.,

Europe to Economic Superstar: Germany™s Resurgent Economyﬂ
, Journal of Economic Perspectives
, Vol
. 28, N
o 1, 2014
). In Spain, reforms were first introduced in 2010, followed by a further and wider
-reaching round in 2012. See
