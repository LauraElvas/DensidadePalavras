XECUTIVE SUMMARY
 
Despite weaker external demand,
 
m
ost of the region outside the 
Commonwealth of 
Independent States (
CIS
)
 
continues 
to record
 
solid 
growth, with 
unemployment rates now 
approaching precrisis levels
.
 

 
Robust growth continues
 
in most
 
C
entral and
 
South
eastern European economies
 
as well as in 
Turkey
. Accommodative macroeconomic policies, improving financial intermediat
ion, and 
rising real wages
 

stly consumption
-
driven rebound, while 
private investment remained subdue
d. In the near
-
term, strong domesti
c demand is 
expected to continue 
support
ing 
growth amid 
contin
ued low or negative inflation. 
In 2016, 
CESEE 
countri
es outside the CIS are expected
 
to grow
 
by around 3 to 
4 percent. 
 
 

 
In contrast,
 
the
 
Russian economy
 
went 
through a sharp contraction
 
last year
 
amid
 
plunging 
oil pri
ces and sanctions
. Other 
CIS countries
 
were hurt by domestic political and financial 
woes, a
s well as by weak demand from 
Russia
. In 2016, output contraction is projected to 
moderate to around 1½ p
ercent from 4¼ percent in 2015 as the shocks that hit the 
CIS 
economies gradually reverberate
 
less and activity stabilizes. 
 
D
o
wnside
 
risks have increased since the fall of
 
2015
.
 
Although sources of downside risks 
remain largely unchanged, these risks have
 
become more pronounced. Lower euro area and U.S. 
growth, tighter global financial conditions, and continued weakness in many emerging 
eco
nomies are creating headwinds. 
In addition, 
political 
uncertainty and instability 
risks 
have 
been 
on the rise
 
across t
he region.
 
As CESEE 
is now heading into 
choppy waters, policies should remain supportive
.
 
In the 
baseline, 
a combination
 
of 
supportive monetary policy and medium
-
term fiscal consolidation 
remain
s
 
valid for many economies in the region.
 
In the event of a ne
gative growth shock, 
monetary policy should be the first line of defense, while automatic fiscal stabilizers sh
ould be 
allowed to operate
 
freely, provided there is 
room to do so. 
In case of a major shock
 
and 
depending on the source of the shock
, fiscal pol
icy should ease within medium
-
term adjustment 
plans that dispel concerns about sustainability.
 
Medium
-
term fiscal consolidation should rely
, as 
much as possible,
 
on growth
-
friendly revenue and expenditure measures, such as 
improving tax 
compliance,
 
introdu
cing carbon and property taxes, better targeting of transfers and entitlement 
programs, while protecting productive spending on public investment.
 
Despite the strong cyclical
 
rebound, growth in CESEE remains
 
well below the pre
crisis level
 
and the region is
 
facing considerable challenges over the medium
-
term. 
If

growth 

convergence with advanced Europe. 
From 1990 to 
2008
, 
CESEE 
countries 
made significant 
progress a
long the convergence path
 
on the back of strong 
total factor productivity (
TFP
)
 
growth 
and
,
 
to a lesser extent, 
capital accumulation
. After the crisis,
 
TFP growth slowed 
significantly across most advanced and emerging ec
onomies
, including CESEE
. 
S
ome of th
e 
factors that 
may have 
boosted TFP growth 
in CESEE 
before the crisis
,
 
such as potential growth 
in 
advanced Europe, 
or 
expansion of global trade
 
and 
supply chains
, 
appear to have 
stalled or 
gone
 
in
to
 
reverse after the crisis. In addition, CESEE countries a
re facing some of the worst declines in 
the 
working
-
age population in Europe, reflecting both unfavorable demographics and 
emigration

a trend that is expected to continue or worsen. 
 
 
How Can CESEE Countries Get B
ack on
 
the Fast Convergence P
ath?
 
 
 
W
ith 
a 
less supportive global environment over the medium
-
term
, grea
ter reform efforts to 
increase productivity
,
 
support further
 
capital deepening
,
 
and
 
improve labor supply 
may be 
needed
 
to lift growth a
nd re
-
accelerate convergence. 
The reforms could be directed 
toward:
 
 

 
Improving 
the 
labor supply
: 
U
nfavorable demographics and emigration
 
increase the
 
importance of active labor market policies. 
The analysis 
in this report shows that 
CESEE 
countries have some scope to counter 
the 
decline in 
the 
working
-
age populatio
n by 
increasing participation rates (women and seniors), r
educing structural unemployment and 
skill 
mis
matches
,
 
and raising life expectancy. 
For example, i
ncreasing female labor force 
participation could 
help support growth
 
in 
Southeastern Europe (
SEE
)
 
and
 
Turkey.
 
 
 

 
Boosting investment
: 
Capital stock per capita in a typical CESEE economy is still about a 
third of that in advanced Europe. Investment gaps are particularly wide in infrastructure, 
where public investment could help, but on its own would not be 
enough. 
While investment 
may be 
held back by the crisis 
legacies 

 
high debt burde
ns and nonperforming loans 

 
and 
a 
highly uncertain outlook for global growth, m
ost CESEE countries need to address
 
deeper 
st
ructural issues in order to boost
 
private investm
ent. 
In most of the region, domestic 
savings 
rates 
are lower than 
those required 
to sustain investment rates high enough to 
close the income gaps with advanced Europe within a generation or so
 
and without 
hitting 
external debt sustainability limits. 
Polici
es should therefore focus on institutional reforms 
that reduce inefficiencies and increase returns on private investment and savings.
 
 

 
Raising productivity
: 
In order 
to maintain higher TFP growt
h rates than in advanced 
Europe
, CESEE countries may have to a
ddress structural and institutional obstacles that 
prevent efficient use of available technologies, or lead to inefficient allocation of resources. 
While 
it is hard to estimate precisely the quantitative impact of structural reforms on 
productivity and gro
wth, the analysis in this report suggests the largest efficiency gains are 
likely to come from improving the quality of institutions (protection of property rights, legal 
systems, and healthcare), increasing the affordability of financial services (especia
lly for 
small but productive firms), and improving government efficiency.

I. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,
 
OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
 
After
 
solid growth in 2015, the 
Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (
CESEE
)
 
region is now heading 
into choppy waters. Lower euro area and U.S. growth, tighter glob
al financial conditions, and continued 
weakness in many emerging economies are creating headwinds. Nonetheless, near
-
term growth is 
expect
ed to remain robust 
in most CESEE countries outside the 
Commonwealth of Independent States 
(
CIS
)
, thanks to strong
 
dom
estic demand. At the same time, output contraction is projected to moderate 
in 
the 
CIS, as the shocks that hit the Russian a
nd Ukrainian economies gradually reverberate
 
less and 
activity
 
stabilizes
. While downside risks are now more pronounced than in the 
fall of 2015, policies in 
most economies will need to rebuild room for maneuver. 
 
A.   
Recent Developments
 
Most of the region outside the CIS continues to register robust growth, 
despite weakening 
external demand, particularly in emerging 
markets
 
(EMs)
 
(Figure 
1.1).
 
Accommodative 
macroeconomic policies, improving financial intermediation, and rising real wage growth have been 

-
driven rebound.
 
 

 
Growth picked up in much of 
Central and Eastern Europe
 
(CEE) in the second half of
 
2015 
on 
account of supportive demand policies and 
increased
 
absorption of EU 
Structural and Cohesion 
F
unds (Figure 1
.1
). Similarly, most 
SEE
 
countrie
s saw stronger growth 
despite 
political 
uncertainties and financial sector sp
illovers from Greece in some 
cases
. However, private 
investment rem
ained subdued
. In EU countries, public investment contributed strongly to growth 
in
 
a race to utilize EU F
unds be
fore their expiration in 2015 (see 
F
all 2015
 
REI
 
for details). Despite 
improving labor market
s
 
and lower 
oil prices, growth slowed in 
the 
Baltic countries, 
reflecting 
weaker demand
 
from Russia. 
 

 
Buff
eted by plunging oil prices and
 
sanctions, 
the 
Russian
 
economy went through a sharp 
contraction. Other
 
CIS
 
countries were hurt by domestic political and financial
 
woes, as well as 
spillovers 
from Russia. 
Output contraction appears to have moderated in 2015
:
Q4 partly 
due to
 
policy response
s
 
(
Box 1.1).
 
While exchange rate depreciation
 
has
 
facilitated external adjustment, 
this has happened mostly via im
port contractio
n. Exports
 
of the CIS countries
 
seem
 
to have 
benefitted little given the high share of
 
commodities
, supply disruption
s
, still
-
low
 
compliance 
with EU
 
import standards, and 
dependence on 
other 
CIS markets. 
 

 
Turkey
 
saw a strengthening of domestic demand, bene
fiting from a series of 
accommodative 
policy measures
 
and
 
the 
relaxation of macro
-
prudential regulation.
 
Labor markets outside the CIS have strengthened considerably in recent years 
(Figure 1
.1
).
 
Unemployment rates have fallen significantly across all sub
-
regions. The most dramatic turnaround 
has been in the Baltic economies where rates are now in the single digits. Despite some remarkable 
gains, unemployment rates remain elevated in non
-
EU SEE countries. Empirical
 
estimation 
suggests

that, on average, a 1
 
percen
tage point increase in 
the 
GDP growth rate was associated with a decline 
in the unemployment rate of about 0.15 
of a 
percentage point in the first year, and about 0.4 
of a 
percentage point after 
three
 
years.  Falli
ng unemployment has occurred 
in the contex
t of improving 
employment and labor force participation rates in the region
.
 
 
Estimates of potential outp
ut, output gaps, and actual unemployment rates suggest that 
cyclical recovery may be 
near 
completion
 
outside the CIS, 
but there is 
considerable uncertainty around estimates 
of economic slack.
 
Average potential 
output growth for the region has declined 
to 2
 
percent from over 4 perce
nt in 
pre
crisis years. Against 
a
 
backdrop of 
diminished potential output growth, output 
gaps now appear closed or positive for 
many countries (Figure 
1.
2). In the Baltics 
and some CEE countries, a closing of the 
output gap seems c
onsistent with 
developments in unemployment, wage 
growth, and recovery of credit and housing 
prices as well as some price pressures on 
no
n
-
tradables. However, the range of 
est
imates of potential output
 
is quite wide
 
(Podpiera, Raei, and Stepanyan
,

that
 
is currently 
hosting 
more than 
2.5 million refugees, and where the economic impact of refugees has been quite 
noticeab
le on several fronts. Most
 
refugees had left camps by end

2014 and started to join the labor 
m
arket, exerting pressure on 
unskilled segments in rural areas close to the Syrian border. Following 
the dialogue with the EU, refugees were allowed to work legall

January 2016. 
Some evidence suggests that

brought some small

Headline and core inflation are very low in CEE, SEE and 
the 
Baltic countries, but still high in 
Tur
key and 
the 
CIS 
(Figure

Low inflation likely reflects the lagging impact of excess capacity, 
including 
relatively flat Phillips curves, declining commodity prices (
including their ind

second

round effects) 
and low global inflation, notably i

inflation remains
 
in the double

The financial turbulence of early 201
6 softened 
asset prices in CESEE, althou
gh less so than in 
other EM
s
. 
The CESEE countries saw 
falling equity prices and a widening
 
in s
overeign 
credit 
spreads 
but the moves tended to be less dramatic than in other EM regions
 
(Figure 
1.
4)
.
 
Also, exchange rates 
outside the C
IS remained stable agai
nst the e
uro. More recently, c
orrelati
ons of movements in credit 
spreads
 
between CESEE countries and major EM
s
 
have increased, suggesting greater scope for 
spillovers to the CESEE region from financial shocks elsewhere
.  
 
 

 
susceptibi
lity to financial market turbulence is mostly explained by 
improved econom
ic fundamentals relative to pre
crisis years
. Internal and, especially, external 
imbalances appear smaller than in a number of other EM
s
. Most countries in the CESEE region have 
drast
ically improved their current account (CA) balances
,
 
with the average CA deficit in the region at 
2 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to 12 percent in 2008. Only a handful of countries still show a 
sizable CA deficit, notably Turkey, Belarus, and some non
-
E
U SEE countries. Similarly, apart from 
Turkey and 
the 
CIS, countries are more advanced in their credit and deleveraging cycle compa
red to 
EMs outside the region (s
ee Fall 2015 REI for details).
 
 
 
B.   
Outlook 
 
Growth is projected to fare better in 2016 compared
 
to 2015, mainly on account of a more 
moderate recession in Russia and a gradual move to
 
a
 
modest expansion in the rest of 
the 
CIS 
(Figure 
1.
5).
 
The new projections a
re somewhat lower than those in 
the fall
 
of
 
2015
, as lower oil 
prices are weighing on 
the 
Russia
n economy
, including by requiring more fiscal adjustment. Growth 
in other CIS countries, in turn, is revised down because of lower exports to Russia and additional 
fiscal adjustment. Elsewhere, weaker foreign demand is largely offset by stronger dome
stic demand, 
which is being helped by lower commodit
y
 
prices.
 
The outlook for 2016 across the region is as 
follows: 
 
 

 
In the 
CEE 
sub
region, growth rates are projected to move sideways or ease somewhat. The key 
factors are weaker external demand growth and 
a diminishing absorption of EU S
tructural
 
and 
Cohesion F
unds. 
 

 
For most 
SEE
 
countries, growth is projected to be broadly unchanged or 
to 
strengthen. In 
Romania, a cyclical upswing is underway and growth is projected to strengthen supported by 
wage increase
, low fuel prices and VAT reduction. In Serbia, growth is expected to accelerate as 
the pace of 
fiscal policy 
tightening slows and structural reforms start to take effect 
under the 
IMF
-
supported program. 
 

 
In 
the 
Baltics
, gro
wth will pick up 
on the back of
 
a
 
waning drag from exports to Russia.
 

 
In the 
CIS
, output contraction is expected to moderate. Despite some tentative signs of economic 
stabilization, the unexpected oil price decline in mid
-
2015 and a correction of growing fiscal 
imbalances likely mean tha
t the Russian economy will st
ay in recession in 2016. At the same time
, 
Ukrai
ne is expected
 
to record 
positive growth supported by diminishing macroeconomic 
imbalances and a less challenging geopolitical situation.

Turkey
 
is projected to turn in another ye
ar of strong growth. A 30 percent minimum wage 
increase and accommodative policies mean that both gro
wth and external imbalances 
will be 
more elevated than previously expected.

these products is dominating inflation dynamics in many countries. 
I
n 2016
, s
everal CESEE countries 
have experienced stronger wage growth, including large minimum wage hikes, 
which mostly reflect
 
tightening labor ma
rkets
. Estimates show that about a quarter 
of average wage growth in CESEE 
cou
ntries during 2012
-
15 was associated with
 
minimum wage developments 
(
Box 1.2
). This
 
could 
imply noticeable increases in average wages 
in countries
 
where the coverage of minimum w
ages is 
high
,
 
but is not projected to fundamentally alter the inflation dynamics in the near term. For CIS 
countries, 2016 inflation projectio
ns are roughly unchanged as 
upward price pressures fro
m 
exchange rate depreciations are largely countered by 
downw
ard pressures from contracting 
domestic demand. In Turkey, inflation for 2016 has been revised up to 9.8 percent from 7.9 percent, 
with wage hikes and 
accommodative
 
macroeconomic p
olicies boosting excess demand.
 
C.   
Risks
 
While the recovery in CESEE has taken 
hold, risks to the outlook have risen
. 
Although the main
 
sources of downside risks remain largely unchanged, these risks have become more pronounced, 
with a tighte
ning in financial conditions, weaker global growth prospects and rising political risks 
acros
s the region: 
 
 

 
Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions
: Sovereign
 
credit
-
default swap (
CDS
)
 
spreads appear compressed 
relative to economic fundamentals and according to standard 
econometric 
models. Increased market volatility 
may result in ri
sing borrowing costs and a pick
-
up in portfolio outflows, particularly affecting those with high fiscal financing needs (Figure 
1.7). 
Financial volatility may rise appreciably should the British voters choose to leave the EU in June. 
In addition,
 
further w
eakness in European bank asset prices
 
may heighten pressures on these 
institutions to cut exposures to the CESEE region. While foreign banks still own three
-
quarters of 
CESEE banking system
s
, dependence on parent funding has dropped significantly. 
Because 
domestic lending 
is 
now 
largely 
funded by local d
eposits 
in 
many
 
countries (Figure 1.7)
, the 
impact 
of lower foreign bank
 
flows 
on 
the 
real economy is l
ikely to be less disruptive

: Countries linked to the German supply chain (mostly in CEE

be affected via lower exports (see F

details). In addition, there may be financial sector spillovers if the slowdown affects investor 
sentiment for EM
s
. Commodity exporters, notably Russia, are also likely to be affected
 
via 
deteriorating terms of trade.

Rising political risks
:
 
A number of CESEE countries
 
have
 
experienced
 
political instability
 
(
notably, 
Ukraine, Moldova, Kosovo and FYR Macedonia)
 
(
Box 1.3)
. Several other countries
 
have seen the 
rise of populist parties in recent elections fueled by ant

establishment sentiment that may entail 
some policy r
eversal
s
. With a number of countries facing elections in the near

term, risks of 
political 
instability may be on the rise
.
 
Furthermore, a risk of the UK exiting from the EU could 
further increase support for euroskeptic parties and resistance to economic i
ntegration.

In the face of multiple shocks, the countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
adopted a 
range of policies to stabilize their economies and financial systems. 
Since late 2014, these econo
mies have 
been buffeted by declining commodity prices, geopolitical tensions and domestic political instability. Output 
contraction started in Ukraine in 2014, while the other countries entered into recession in 2015. Policy measures 
used by the CIS countr
ies included, to varying degrees, allowing greater flexibility in the exchange rate, 
accompanied by an increase in the policy rate and some intervention in the foreign exchange market to prevent a 
free fall in the exchange rate, and generally tighter fisca
l policies. In Russia, policies were also adopted to stabilize 
the financial sector, with temporary regulatory forbearance and liquidity support. Ukraine introduced temporary 
restrictions on capital flows to ease balance of payment pressures, and provided 
liquidity support to banks 
followed by comprehensive recapitalization and restructuring. Moldova closed three failed banks and also 
intervened occasionally in the foreign exchange market to limit excessive volatility (Table 1.1.1).

Exchange rate depreciation 
has helped improve the trade bala
nce and price competitiveness, despite
 
an 
initial hit to inflation
. While all CIS countries experienced large nominal depreciations, real effective exchange 
depreciations during 2014
-
2015 were sizable only in Russia and Ukr
aine (22 and 17 percent, respectively), but more 
modest in Belarus and Moldova (about 2.5 and 1.5 percent, respectively) due to very high inflation. The move to 
flexible exchange rates and supportive policies helped these economies rapidly reduce external 
imbalances mostly 
through import compression. Imports have declined significantly in all four countries, with non
-
energy imports 
declining by a cumulative 25
-
51 percent during 2014
-
15 (Figure 1.1.1). The large depreciations corrected most of 
the pre
-
existi
ng exchange rate misalignments in these countries. Despite improved price competitiveness, overall 
exports saw limited benefits due to a high share of commodities in exports (in the case of Russia), weak demand 
for heavy equipment (in the case of Belarus),
 
still low compliance with EU import standards (in the case of Moldova 
and Ukraine), as well as supply disruptions, trade restrictions and weak demand in other CIS markets (in the case of 
Ukraine) (Figure 1.1.2). Non
-
energy exports showed signs of stabiliz
ation or modest recovery in 2015. Even though 
inflation soared in the aftermath of depreciations, it stabilized in the second half of 2015 as exchange rate stability 
took hold.

1.2. Recent Minimum Wage Developments in CESEE Countries
1
 
 
After a period of restraint during the 
global financial 
crisis, min
imum wages 
since 2012 
have been rising 
faster than average wages in most CESEE countries. 
The pace of increase has been sharp particularly in Turkey, 
and some Baltics and SEE
-
EU countries. 
Minimum wages are typically set by the government, sometimes in 
con
sultation with social partners. 
Based on limited available data, about 10
-
20 percent of workers earn the minimum 
wage in CESEE. While minimum wage policy can provide protection to low income workers and avoid abuse of 
company power, sharp minimum wage hike
s may undermine external competitiveness and hamper job creation, 
particularly for low
-
skilled labor and in labor
-
intensive industries.

Minimum wage hikes could contribute to o
verall wage growth directly and indirectly through spillovers
.
 
About ¼ of average wage growth in CESEE countries 
over 2012
-
15 is associated with
 
minimum wage developments. 
In particular, the elasticity of average wage to minimum wage is found to be around 
10
-
40 percent, based on a 
variety of cross
-
country, firm level, and sector level estimates with the high impacts related to cases where coverage 
of minimum wage is high. The Wage Dynamics Network Survey of the European System o
f Central Banks also noted
 
th
at about a fifth of firms in the survey reportedly would have to increase the wages of employees above the 
minimum wage as the minimum wage rises, thus emphasizing the spillovers of minimum wage increases on overall 
wages. 
 
 
Some negative impact on 
the 
emp
loyment of youth and low
-
skilled
 
workers can also
 
be expected, 
particularly in countries with 
a 
high relative minimum w
age. 
IMF s

1.3. Political Stability
 
Risks in CESEE
¹
 
 
Political stability risks 
appear to have 
increased across 
the 
CESEE region
. 
In order to track political risks
 
in 
CESEE
, we use 
the
 

(EIU) 

indices, which
 
evalu
ate
 


ability and/or commitment to service its debt obligations and/or 
cause turbulence in the foreign
-

These indices 
take values 
f
rom 0 (very low risk) to 100 (very high risk
) and are 
constructed for
 
all countries in the world. 
At present, i
n almost 
half of all CESEE countries, the EIU political stabi
lity risk indices 
are 
above 50.
 
The EIU indicators suggest
 
that political
 
risks are 
particularly high in the European CIS countries, Turkey, and, to a 
lesser extent, in the non
-
EU SEE countries.
 
In terms of 
changes
, 
risks have increased in the past year in Poland, Turkey, Belarus, 
Moldova, and Montenegro and decreased in Serbia, Albania, 
Bulgari
a, Latvia
, Romania and Russia (see Figures 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
). 
 
While political stability risks 
in some of the 
larger
 
CES
EE 
countries
 
are well known
, such risks are also prominent
 
in 
several
 
smaller
 
CESEE 
countries
,
 
such a
s Moldova, 
FYR 
Macedonia and 
Kosovo:
 
 

 
FYR Macedonia
 
has been in an open political crisis since the 
April 2014 elections when the main opposition party 
boycotted Parliament alleging vote rigging. In early 2015, 
the opposition leader released tape recordings implicating 
top state offici
als of the ruling coalition in vote rigging, 
large
-
scale government abuse of power, and corruption 
which led to the resignation of top officials. A political 
agreement brokered by the EU and the US late last 
summer 
is 
being implemented with elections expec
ted later this year.

Unit Political Risk Score, March 2015

Moldova
 
has been in the midst of political, economic, and financial turmoi
l since late 2014, with 
three cabinet 
changes
 
within one year. Political instability has been amplified by the revelation of a large
-
scale fraud in the 
financial sector. This resulted in a collapse of three large banks, with a cost to the budget of around 
12 percent 
of GDP and a significant loss in reserves.
 
 

 
In Kosovo, political tensions have been high since October 2015, when the government signed agreements 
brokered by the EU towards normalization of relations with Serbia. The opposition has vowed to blo
ck all 
parliamentary activity and to stage protests until the government resigns.
 
Political uncertainty and instability can have macroeconomic ramifications
 
by 

and 
raising 
concerns about possible changes in economic and other 
policies, which can then lead to a sovereign 
rating 
downgrade. The latter channel 
was highlighted in January
 
2016

HOW TO G
ET BACK ON THE FAST 
TRACK
?
 
Despite the 
strong cyclical rebound
, 
growth in CESEE remains 
well below
 
pre
crisis levels
.
 
If
 
lower potential growth in CESEE
 
turns o
ut to be 
the
 


 
this would 
imply 
a much slower
 
pace of income convergence with advanced Europe. 
This chapter 
explore
s
 
the reasons behind the 
post
crisis growth slowdown
 
by looking at labor, 
capital and productivity trends
 
across the region
. 
It 
al
so 
aim
s
 
to identify the key
 
gaps 
betwee
n CESEE and advanced Europe 

 
with regard
 
to capital 
deepening and productivity 

 
as well as
 
the 
specific 
institutional and structural features of CESEE 
economies
 
that
 
might explain these 
gaps. While
 
there is no magic
 
f
ormula for fast convergence, the 
hope is that this chapter will
 
provide some 
insights for 
ongoing policy discussions in the
 
region on 
how 
to 
get back 
on
 
a fast
 
convergence 
track
.
 
A. Historical P
erspective
 
1. 
High
-
Speed Convergence 
 
History shows that fas
t
-
track
 
convergence
 
is possible, but it still takes several decades. 
There 
are 
a few 
examples of successful and rapid catch
-
up with advanced
 
economies from the starting 
per 
capita 
income 
levels that are comparable with the current levels of CESEE countries
. 
The relatively 
small number of economies 
that have successfully converged to their advanced peers i
n
 
the past 
century
 
include
 
Italy (1960
-
80), Spain (1980
-
09), Japan 
(1966
-
97), Korea (1988
-
10), and Taiwan 
 
(1968
-
08).
1
 
 
 
Most of the
 
rapid
-
convergence epis
odes share
 
some 
common characteristics
 
(Spence, 
2008
, 
Buera and Shin
,
 
2013
). First, the pace of growth typically accelerates following large
-
scale reforms. 
Second, a sizable fraction of growth is due to sustained growth of total factor productivity (TFP). 
Third, the investment
-
to
-
output ratio tends to increase during initial stages of growth acceleration 
and declines in the later stages. And finally, financial deepening occurs graduall
y along the transition 
path. Were
 
the precrisis transition dynamics 
in CE
SEE economies 
any different?  
 
2. 
CESEE C
onvergence before the Crisis 
 
 
Following the dramatic economic transformation and initial period of instability, most Eastern 
European countries set on their
 
convergence paths
 
by the late 1990s
. During the initial s
tages o
f 
transition, per capita income
 
declined in most CESEE countries, with the notable exception of Poland. 
Countries that had higher st
arting income levels or 
had gone through greater political turbulence 
(wars, changing borders) incurred higher transi
tion costs. In most CESEE countries,
 
tr
oughs in per 
capita GDP were reached by
 
the mid
-
or late 1990s
.
 
 
Compared to earlier fast
-
track convergen
ce cases, CESEE economies had less 
favorable 
demographics and slower capital accumulation, which were offset by s
tronger TFP growth.
 
Using the United States 
as a benchmark 
frontier economy in the post
-
World War II period
, one can 
trace the evolution of
 
relative per capita income
, as well as other economic variables, during the 
growth acceleration episodes
.
 
Figure 2.1
 
shows the growth paths of CESEE cou
ntries (starting from

juxtaposed
 
against the growth 
paths
 
of 
the 
so

economies

 
of the past century
 
to match 
starting income levels
. A
 
comparison between these two groups
 
yields 
several
 
observations:
 
 
 

 
T
he 
speed of convergence
 
in CESEE before the
 
global financial
 
crisis
 

 
measured by the rate of 
growth of per capita GDP at PPP relative to the U.S.
 
economy

 
was in many cases 
similar to 
th
at 
observed in the earlier fast
-
track convergence
 
episodes. 
 
 

 
However, the transition dynamics of CESEE differed from that of the miracle economies in sever
al 
respects: on the upside, 
TFP growth
 
has been stronger and the pace of 
financial deepening 
has 
bee
n much faster than during the earlier fast convergence episodes, but on
 
the downside, CESEE 
economies had slow
-
growing or 
shrinking
 
labor force
 
and 
slower pace of capital deepening
 
(measured by the growth rate of the capital
-
labor ratio), as well as genera
lly lower 
domestic 
saving and investment rates
 
(Table

F
aster TFP growth and financial deepening in CESEE during 199
0
-
2008 could, in part, be 
attributed to
 
an unusually f
avorable global environment
,
 
characterized by a combination of high 
commodity prices, low interest rates, rapid expansion of global supply chains and buoyant trade. 
During this period, not only CESEE, but many other economies in Southern Europe, Latin Amer
ica 
and Asia experi
enced an a
cceleration of growth (IMF, 2013
).
  
Amid
 
easy funding conditions and 
given their initial low capital
-
labor ratios, CESEE economies would have been expected to have much 
higher rates of capital accumulation than what they actual
ly had
. The latter
 
may be in part due to fast 
financial deepening that 
enabled households to boost consumption at the expense of saving in 
anticipation of higher incomes. 
 
 
3. 
The Post
crisis Growth Slowdown
 
 
The 
global financial 
crisis followed by the euro
 
area crisis led to steeper growth declines in 
CESEE than elsewhere
.
 
Real GDP growth in CESEE d
ropped
 
to 
an average of 
1.9
 
percent over
 
2011
-
15 from 
an average of 
6.1 percent over 
2002
-
08, showing a much sharper decline than in other 
emerging or advanced e
conomies (Figure 2
.2
). Part of this decline was cyclical, and in fact, much of it 
has already reversed in the last two years
 
outside the CIS
 
(as discussed in Chapter I
). But a large part 
of 
the 
growth slowdown is thought to be structural. The average poten
tial growth in CESEE is 
estimated to have dropped to 
2
 
percent
, which is
 
about half of 
th
e
 
pre
crisis 
potential growth rate 
(Figure 
2.
3
).
 
This stands
 
in
 
sharp contrast
, for example,
 
to the full recovery of 

potential 
growth within three years followi
ng the
 
Asian crisis
.
 
That said, potential growth 
deceler
ation since 
the global financial crisis has been a global phenomenon.
 
 
The decline in potentia
l growth across CESEE appears to have been
 
mainly 
driven 
by slower 
TFP growth but also by
 
weaker investmen
t. 
Indeed,
 
o
ur growth accounting analysis
 
point
s
 
to 
lower TFP growth and slower capital accumulation as the main reasons behind 
the 
potential growth 
slo
wdown after the crisis (Figure 
2.
3).
2
 
 
 
At current 
growth 
rates, convergence is
 
effectively
 
off 
the fast
 
track
. 
In order to get back on 
the fast track, CESEE countries would need to lift
 
potential growth closer to pre
crisis levels. 
This proposition is no
t
 
new. What is new is that 
CESEE countries
 
are now
 
facing considerable
 
headwinds
 
from unfavorable demograp
hics, sluggish global growth (o
r even secular stagnation) and 
likely 
tighter global financial conditions
 
going forward
. Against this backdrop, achieving similar 
growth r
ates as before the crisis may
 
prove to be challenging
. The rest of this chapter will ex
plore 
possible 
future 
engines of growth across CESEE countries, by looking at different factors of 
production and how efficiently they are used. 
 
 
 
 
                                        
          
 
2
 
Given that potential output is not observable and that TFP is estimated as a residual after accounting for the 
contributions of other fa
ctors of production, the usual caveats apply
.

Labor force participation rates in CESEE 
are
 
c
omparable to those in advanced Europe
, but 
there are pockets of 
underutilized labor
 
and str
uctural unemployment is
 
high
 
in some cases 
(Figure 2.5). 
Based on
 
full
-
time equivalent participation rates, only a few CESEE countries (
Bosnia and 
Herzegovina
, Moldo
va and Turkey) are below the EU
-
15 average. But there are more countries 
(notably in SEE), where participation rates among women and seniors are much lower th
an elsewhere 
in Europe
.
 
S
tructural unemployment tend
s
 
to be high
 
in SEE
 
as well
.
 
Stu
bbornly high u
nemp
loyment 
rates in SEE
 
economies
 
are linked to
 
the rigidity of labor market institutions and
 
persistent
 
outward 
migratio
n (Kovtun et al, 
2014; 
IMF
, 2015
c
).
 
Labor market practices in SEE countries have traditionally 
afforded workers high degree of protect
ion
 
and 
union coverage 
is also high compared to the rest of 
CESEE. While structural unemployment acts as a 
push factor for emigration (
Box 
2.
1), it may also be 
exacerbated by 
heav
y dependence on remittances, which are the flipside of emigration. Sizable 
re
mittances allow
 
their recipients to extend periods of
 
job search and push up 
reservation wages, 

g
ness to accept lower
-
paid jobs.
 
Also, migration itself may 
reduce pressures to reform labor markets.

Most CESEE econom
ies appear to
 
score well on the quality of
 
human capital on aggregate, but 
there are some gaps 
(Figure 
2.
6).
 
Based on the standard a
ggregate human capital
 
indices, 
most 
CESEE countries 
compare well with a
dvance
d
 
Europe
. However, a closer look at the distri
bution of 
the labor force by education
 
level
 
reveals that some CESEE 
economies lag in
 
the
 
share of 
the 
workforce with tertiary education
 
(
SEE and 
Turkey). 
As a result,
 
shortages of high
-
skilled labor
 

 
the 
difference between the share of high
-
skilled labor
 
in total employment and the same share in total 
population 

 
a
re worse in some parts of the region 
than 
in the EU
-
15.
  
In
 
the
 
Baltics and SEE, these 
shortages 
have been 
exacerbated by large and persistent outflows of younger and relatively more 
educated p
eople
 
since the 1990s (Box 2.1)

Furthermore,
 
skill mismatches
 

 
whereby a sizable 
portion of available skills are not employed in relevant occupations 

 
tend to be worse 
in CESE
E than 
in advanced Europe, in part due to deficiencies in labor market polici
es or institutions.

Economic Impact of
 
Emigration on CESEE Countries
 
Emigration can have profound effec
ts on economic 
outcomes in sending economies. 
Economic migration 

development and has likely led to positive outcomes for 
CESEE emigrants themselves and for the EU as a whole. 
However, emigration

through it
s externalities

may 
have also slowed growth and convergence in CESEE 
countries. Such externalities could arise from sizable 
o
utflow
s
 
of skilled labor, 
which can 
create skill shortages, 
and 
may 
impair productivity growth
 
and convergence
. 
 
 
Over the past 25 
years, close to 20 million people 
have emigrated from CESEE, accounting for 6 ¼ 

-
age population.
 
Two
-
thirds of CESEE countries are affected by net emigration
,
 
where it has
 
often exacerbated adverse demographic 
trends and
 
damp
ened working
-
age population growth by 
about 0.5
-
1.0 percentage points per year since 1990, and
 
contributed to shortages of high skilled labor, especially 
in the Baltics. 
Lower average income
 
vis
-
à
-
vis more 
advanced economies
, but also poor institutional qu
ality, 
and weak economic conditions at home are important 
factors behind emigration, particularly of skilled labor.
 
 
 
 
Remittances have been both a blessing
 
and a curse
. 
Analysis suggest
s
 
that higher remittances are associated 
with lower labor s
upply incen
tives, and l
arge remittance 
inflows 
may 
contribute to real exchange rate 
appreciation, and adversely affect the tradable sector. 
But 
they
 
also 
appear to have 
supported consumption,
 
and
 
private investment, and facilitated financial deepening
 
in 
high
-
remitta
nce receiving countries
.
 
 
Overall, emigration appears to have
 
slowed growth 
and income convergence
 
in CESEE
. 
 
A
nalysis suggests 
that in 2012, cumulative real GDP growth could have 
been 
around 
7
 
percentage points higher on average in 
CESEE in 
the 
absence of
 
migration during 1995
-
2012. 
As 
a result, on average, CESEE members of
 
the
 
EU could 
have narrowed their per capita income gap with 
the 
EU 
average by an additional 2 percentag
e points. Emigration
 
may have
 
also 
create
d pressures on
 
social security 
systems
 
an
d hinder
ed
 
growth through
 
increased
 
growth
-
unfriendly labor taxes
. 
Raising
 
the labor market 
participation 
rates
 
and better leveraging remittances to 
promote investment
 
could help offset
 
the negative 
impact of emigration.
 
Improving institutions and
 
economic
 
policies would also 
encourage potential 
migrants to stay, promote return migration, and attract 
new immigrants.

After more than
 
20 
years of transition, there is still significant scope for capital deepening in
 
CESEE
 
(Figure 
2.

With the exception of Slovenia and the Czech Republic, capital stock per capita in 
a typical CESE
E economy is about one third 
of 
tha
t in advanced Europe. Most significant gaps are in 
infrastructure 
(buildings and civil engineering)
 
and machinery equipment.

or

?
 
 
Given large capital gaps
, 
pre
crisis capital accumulation in CESEE 
was relatively slow
. 
The 
r
elative sca
rcity of capital and 
the 
higher 
rate of return
 
on investment would have justified 
investment rates
 
higher 
than those observed in CESEE before the crisis
. 
While p
re
crisis investment 
rates in CESEE 
exceeded those in advanced Europe, 
the difference was fairly small
. 
Average pre
crisis 
invest
ment rates were relatively high
er than in advanced Europe
 
in CEE, SEE, and 
the 
Baltics, but 
lagged behind
 
advanced economies
 
in the CIS and Turkey (Figure 
2.
8). 
 
After the crisis, investment rates fell across all of Europe. 
Investment rates declined in the
 
Baltics, 
CEE, 
and 
SEE, 
but also in the EU
-
15. The 
declines 
could have been even 
steeper in 
the

(Figure 2.8).

. However, if
 
the
 
investment rate exceeds both benchmar
ks, this could be
 
an indic
ati
on that the investment rate is 
unsustainable. 
 
 
With that interpretation
 
i

mind, the key finding
 
is that investment rates tended to be on the 
low side, with some exceptions
:
 

 
The p
re
crisis investment rates in Turkey and most of the CIS were too low
, 
with the exception of 
Belarus
. Investment rates in Russia and Turkey were well b

, while 
investment rates in 
Moldova and Ukraine
 
were 
sub

optimal relative to the golden rule.  
 

 
Across the Baltics, CEE, and SEE countries, there is more variation
. 
The pre

investment rates in 
Lithuania, 
the Slovak Republic
, Bulga
ria, and Poland 
also fall short of 
both benchmarks. 
In 
contrast,

Croatia,

.
 
 
 
Box

Golden Rule and Historical Benchmark Investment Rates
 
The 
golden rule
 
can be interpreted as a lower bound
 
t
o which an investment rate in a country would 
eventually converge as it approaches its own steady state level underpinned by its de
ep structural 
characteristics and exogenous parameters.  
 
 
The neo
-
classical growth model modified to allow for exogenous growth of labor
-
augmenting productivity 
(Cass
-
Koopmans model) predicts that

for given parameters of the aggregate production function,
 
social 
rate of time preference, depreciation, exogenous growth rates of the labor force and labor
-
augmenting 
productivity, and initial conditions with positive values

an economy converges to a steady
-
state 
equilibrium, in which income, consumption, and ca
pital all grow at a fixed rate equal to the sum of the 
growth rates of labor force and labor
-
augmenting pr
oductivity
.
 
 
Under typical calibration of the parameters, the model implies that the investment rate would fall 
monotonically as the economy converges
 
to its steady state. As such, the closed
-

saving/investment can be interpreted as a lower bound for the investment rate along the CESEE countries 

 
as a lower bound of 
the optimal investment rate also holds in the case of a similar open economy, for which the world interest 
rate is lower or equal to the value in the steady state of the closed economy. The main advantage of the 


conditions (i.e., it is not sample
-
dependent as is the case with all regression
-
based approaches). The main 
disadvantage is that it requ
ires knowledge of the unobservable
 
s
ocial rate of time preference (Miranda, 
1995).
 
 
The 
historical benchmark
 
provides a yardstick investment rate (for a given K/L ratio and technology) 
that is consistent with capital accumulation path of selected advanced European economies during 
1951
-
2011 
that has proven to be sustainable
. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not 
require any assumptions about the social rate of time preference and the position of the country on the 
saddle
-
path. The main disadvantage is that it assumes similar
ity in economic structures of CESEE countries 
and their advanced peers. See Annex
es
 
V
 
and VI for 
details.

Has Investment Growth Slowed Since the Crisis?
 
 
With the crisis
,
 
invest
ment slump
ed in most
 
CESEE economies
.
 
The global financial crisis 
triggered
 

souring the outlook and making legacy debt burdens unsustainable for many borrowers (see Spring 
2015 REI). 
The resulting push for deleveraging led to higher saving
s and further declines in 
investment,
 
broad
-
based in some cases (for example
,
 
in
 
Slovenia), but concentrated in construction 
in other cases (Hungary, Lithuania, and Estonia) (
Figure 2.10
). As a result, the net saving
-
investment 
balance
s
 
improved in most co
untries. 
 
 
The post
crisis decl
ine in i
nvestment rates likely reflects
 
both cyclical and structural factors
, 
though 
the two are difficult to pry apart
: 
 
 

 
In 
those 
c
ountries that had
 
precrisis 
in
vestment booms
, 
investment rates have become 
unsustainable 
afte
r the
 
onset of the
 
crisis, 
as
 
borrowing costs 
rose 
and 
near
-
term 
growth prospects
 
soured
.
 
Indeed, investment rates tended to decline mo
re in countries with larger pre
crisis 
investment gaps 

 
defined as 
the 
actual investment rate minus the benchmark 
rate 
(F
igure 
2.
10).
 
As discussed above, the largest positive investment gaps were observed in 
Croatia, Estonia, and 
Slovenia.
 
Precrisis i
nvestment overshooting 
was often
 
associated with excessive credit growth 
that led to a build
-
up of debt. After the crisis, deb
t overhang 
and attendant high nonperforming 
loans became a
 
drag on investment (see Spring 2015 REI). 
 
 

 
The post
crisis investment slump may, in part, also 
reflect
 
a 
perceived structural shift in trend 
growth 
(Figure 
2.
10).
 
The estimated 
golden rule and hist
orical benchmark investment rates 
for 
CESEE countries 
shifted lower after the crisis.
 
The dec
line in golden rule benc
hmarks, for example, 
was mainly
 
due to 
lower TFP growth and, to a lesser extent, worsening demographics.
 
3
 
Thus, 
some of 
t
he post
crisis
 
dow
nward correction in investment rates 
may be mirroring
 
the decline
s
 
in 
the benchmark
 
inves
tment rates for CESEE countries that reflect
 
changes in
 
potential
 
growth 
drivers after the crisis.
 
 
 
In most 
economies, investment rates are now below 
the
ir estimated
 
historical benchmark
 
rates
, though not the golden rule
. 
While it is not clear whether 
post
crisis TFP 
growth slump
 
will 
persist (
this 
will be discussed below), if 
it 
do
es
 
persist, then 
the 
steady
-
state investment rates 
for 
CESEE 

 
as 
implied
 
by the golden r
ule 

 
may be permanently lower. 
However, m
ost
 
CES
EE countries 
would need to have
 
much 
higher investment rates 

 
according to historical benchmark 

 
in order to 
get 
back 
on the 
fast
 
convergence
 
path
.
 
This would require substantial 
efforts
 
to boost TFP and, 
in a 
number of economies, higher saving rates to fund the additional investment without running into 
the 
external financing constraints
. We turn to these issues in the next sections.

The declines in historical benchmarks 
were
 
smaller, as they depend on both TFP growth rates and K/L ratios (
which 
are 
still very low in 
most 
CESEE
 
countries), 
while the gold
en rule rates are influenced by TF
P growth rates, but not 
capital gaps.

What Explains Investment Undershooting 
in Some CESEE C
ountries
?
 
 
 
So, 
investment rates 
tended to be on 
the low side 
before or
 
also 
after the
 
global financial
 
crisis
 
in a number of CESEE economies, as
 
discussed in the previous sections.
 
Was this because 
of low 
domestic saving rates, 
limited exte
rnal borrowing space
 
or other reasons
? 
 
 
Indeed,
 
in several CESEE economies, 
saving rates 
have been and remain low 
in
 
comparison
 
with
 
actual investment rates, optima
l investment benchmark rates and 
earlier 
fast

Comparing 
CESEE 
saving rates
 
with i
nvestment rates in
 
previous fast
-
convergence episodes
: 
 
While 
average 
domestic 
sav
ing rates 
in previous fast
-
convergence episodes were around 
28 percent of 
GDP
,
 
the average
 
was just 12 perc
ent 
for CESEE 
and 
slightly
 
under
 
20 percent in CEE (
Figure 
2.1
1
)
. I
n most CESEE countries, 
investment and saving rates remain well
 
belo
w 25 percent. 
W
hile 
25 percent
 
is not a magic number, the received wisdom 
in the growth literature i
s
 
that countries 
shoul
d maintain
 
such
 
investment rate 
for
 
a sufficiently long
 
period
 
in order to
 
achieve successful 
convergence
 
with advanced economies
 
(
Spence, 2008).
   
 
 
External borrowing space may 
have 
be
en
 
constrained
 
by sustainability concerns
 
in some cases
.
 
Before the crisis, quite a few CESEE
 
count
r
ies exceeded sustainable borrowing (the Balt
ics, Bulgaria, 
Romania, 
the 
Slovak Republic
, Serbia, 
FYR 
Macedonia, 
Monten
egro, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, and 
Turkey). Post
crisis adjustments have 
dragged down consumption and investment and 
created 
external borrowing space for many CESEE countries, except 
Albania, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina
, 
Belarus, and T
urkey
 
(Figure 
2.
13).
 
 
Finall
y, i
t is also possible that productivity gains may have been too slow
, 
thereby constraining 
return on capital and keeping both investment 
and 
saving rates low
. The next section will
 
take a 
closer look at 
the composition of domestic 
saving
s across CESEE cou
ntries

Note: 
The domestic saving rate is calculated as GDP less consumption

the balance of the curre

in 
Southeastern European countries outside of the EU
 
and foreign direct investment profits in CEE account for the bulk of the 
difference between nati

A comparison of savings rates across EU countries reveals that h
ousehold saving rates tend to 
be lower in CESEE
 
E
U countries
 
than in advanced Europe, while the opposite
 
is the case 
for 
corporate saving rates
 
(Figure 2.14). These differences can be 
largely 
explained by difference
s in 
the 
structural characteristics of these economies.
 
Specifically,
 

 
saving r
ates tend to be
 
positively correlated with
 
GDP levels, labor share of value added,
 
and 
labor force partic
ipation
, but 
negatively related to public debt levels, remittances, tax rates
 
and age dependency
 
(see Annex IV)
. 
Corporate saving rates 
appear to be
 
lo
wer in countries with higher corporate 
debt, corporate 
taxes 
and
 
government expenditur
es. Faster wage growth relative to
 
productivity growth
 
may have a 
dampening effect on corporate savings as well
 
(Figure 2.14). 
Since
 
the crisis
, 
s
aving rates 
of 
CESEE 
fir
ms and households 
have 
generally 
improved
, with e
conomy
-
wide s
aving rates 
now comparable 
across CESEE and advanced EU countries.
 
 
CESEE countries have
 
some scope to boost corporate
 
and household savings: 
 

 
Corporate savings
 
account for the bulk of total dom
estic savings in CESEE
 
(Figure 
2.
14
).
 
The fact 
that a large share of earnings are distributed rather than reinve
sted suggests that 
the 
return on 
investment may not be high enough. T
hus,
 
some additional savings could come 
from 
encouraging 
the 
reinvestment o
f FDI profits (CEE and Croatia) and 
reducing 
dividend
 
payouts 
(Baltics) through
 
tax incentives and
 
productivity
-
enhancing reforms. In other cases (Bulgaria), 
improving fina
ncial affordability
 
could help lift
 
corpor
ate savings as well
. 
A
fter the crisis, 
cor
porate saving rates were
 
boosted by reduct
ions in distributed profits, 
a 
shift from direct to 
indirect taxes, and realig
ning wages to productivity (
Baltics and CIS
). Indeed, 
the experience of 
Korea shows that 
a sustained positive productivity
-
wage growth 
d
ifferential would support 
higher cor
pora
te savings and investment
.

Household saving
 
rates are, in general, lower in CESEE than in other EU countries
 
(Figure 2.14).
 
This 
reflects 
a 
higher share of autonomous co
nsumption in household incomes and 
smalle

bor 
share in national incomes in CESEE
. 
Broad social safety nets and rapid financial deepening before 
the crisis 
may have 
provided additional disincentive
s
 
to save
. After the crisis, household saving 
rates i
mproved due to
 
lower consumption and net taxes/tr
ansfers. Further improvements may be 
needed, especially in Romania and Bulgaria, where 
domestic 
household saving rates continue to 
be negative. Given the demographic profiles, household savings can also be stimulated by 
greater emphasis on Pillar

Raising Domestic Savings in Turkey
 
Turkey has 
a large external imbalance, mostly 
due to a 
structurally low private saving rate. 
While the private sector saving rate averaged 
18
 
percent over 1998

2003, it dropped to 9 percent 
in 2013 and has stayed below 13 percent since 2010. 
The decrease in the saving rate was particularly 
pronounced in the ye
ars since 2003. Meanwhile the 
public saving rate stands at around 3 percent, while 
the investment rate increased from around 17 
percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2014. Thus, 
domestic savings, private and public, no longer 
covered investment, opening up a la
rge gap 
between savings and investments and hence a 
current account deficit, which averaged over 6½ 
percent of GDP between 2010 and 2015. 
 
Figure 2.3.1. Turkey: Saving Rates 
 
(Percent of GDP)
 
 
Sources: CBRT; IMF, WEO; and IMF staff calculations.
 
The 
decline in the private saving rate was mainly a consequence of economic stabilization and 
financial deepening
. The fast drop in the saving rate 
in 
the years directly following the 2001 crisis suggest
s
 
that the quick implementation of a thorough macroeconom
ic stabilization program may have played a large 
role. 
The more gradual, but still rapid
, decline thereafter is consistent with rapid financial deepening, primarily 
through bank credit becoming available to a large proportion of households.  Urbanization l
ikely also played 
a role: it is generally thought to lower the need for precautionary savings, as better and more public services 
are available in urban centers, and income volatility is lower for city dwellers.
 
 
The Turk
ish authorities have emphasized
 
ra
ising
 
the private saving rate
 
as an important policy 

vulnerability
. To this end, they
 
have
 
considered 
various policy options. They have introduced a 
subsidized third pillar pension scheme, and, more 
recently, a savings
 
subsidy for dowry accounts. They 
have also piloted an auto
-
enrollment funded 
pension scheme, and are committed to scaling up 
this pilot. Lastly, proposals to reform the severance 
pay scheme by making it a funded and transferable 
benefit have been put forw
ard. The authorities have 
also used macro
-
prudential tools t
o limit credit 
growth, prompted by 
systemic prudential risks in the 
banking system that
 
may be caused by
 
very high 
credit growth.

rce: Pension Monitori
ng Center.
 
Going forward, full and swift implementation of the pension and severance pay reform plans is key
. 
Given the urgency of reducing vulnerabilities and the time lag with which new policies will affect the saving 
rate, efforts should begin as soon 

fertility rate imply the country is enjoying a demographic dividend. This provides a window of time to 
increase savings in anticipation of 
almost inevitable population ag
ing in th
e future. Macro
-
prudential policies 
limiting credit growth should also remain part of the policy mix. IMF (2016b) provides more details and 
background on these policy options.

Growth Drivers: Productivity 
 
Significant productivity gaps
 
relative to 
advanced Europe
 
can be largely explained by s
tructural and 
insti
tutional obstacles that limit 
efficient use o
f available technologies
 
or efficient allocation of 
resources in CESEE
. In th
e absence of favorable external tailwinds
 
that 
helped to boost
 
product
ivity 
growth before the crisis, 
productivity
-
enhancing reforms become a must for CESEE countries
.

How Does CESEE Compare with A
dvanced Europe?
 
 
The TFP
 
levels in CESEE are 
notably 
lower than in advanced Europe
 
and the post
crisis TFP 
growth slowdown was m
uch sharper
 
(Figure 
2.
15
).
 
Because TFP is
 
typically estimated as a resi
dual 
after accounting for the contributions of other factors of production, it could 
reflect either
 
supply 
side (technological) or 
demand side
 
drivers
.
4
 
Bec
ause there is no good
 
model
 
o
f TFP, it
 
is often
 

For example, 
the much more dramatic declines in TFP 
growth in CESEE compared 
to advanced Europe (Figure 2.1
6
) may suggest that either CESEE were 
much more sensitive to 
some 
common
 
global
 
TFP

or that 
their pre
crisis 
potential 
growth estimates were overstated.

Focusing on the supply side, aggregate productivity reflects the level of technological 
progress, technical efficiency
,
 
and allocative efficiency
.
 
Technical efficiency is the 
efficiency with 
which
 
firms use available technology, while allocative efficiency is 
the extent to which 
firms with 
higher productivi
t
y have more resources.

Technical E

CESEE coun
tries appear to be less efficient users of available technologies
 
than advanced 
Europe
.
 
In the stochastic frontier analysis (
Annex VII
), the relative t
echnical 
inefficiency of a country
 
is 
measured by its
 
distance from the frontier
, wi
th the latter representing
 
the maximum amount of 
out
put that can be obtained from 
given inputs.
 
Figure

shows the estimated 
technological 
frontier and the position of CESEE
 
and advanced European economies
 
relative to the frontier as of 
2014. T
echnical 
efficiency 
is estimated 
relative to the frontier (=100). 
For example, i

is 60
, 
this means that it uses available technology 40 percent less efficiently than the frontier 
economy. 
 
 
L
ow
er technical efficiency may be due to
 
structural or i
nstitut
ional obstacles that prevent the 
diffusion and
 
effic
ient use of available technologies
. Our e
mpirical analysis of the sample of 
advanced economies and CESEE identifies several determinants of the distance to the technological 
frontier:

the economy
: A
 
relatively low share of 
the service
 
sector and
,
 
in some cases, 
a still

G

the incidence of corruption
, and 
tend to be associated with higher 
efficiency
;
 
and 
so does
 
higher
 
life expectancy
, which partly reflects the quality of healthcare.

tend to 
increase efficiency
 
as well. 
 
 
       
In contrast
, the level
s
 
of
 
research and development (
R&D
)
 
spending, infrastructure gaps and
 
labor market flexibility do not appear to be statistically significant determinants
 
of tech
nical 
efficiency
 
in our analysis
.
 
That said, 
these findings 
should be seen as tentative, given the limitations 
inherent in gauging technical eff
iciency with macroeconomic data, and sample specific issues
6
. 
 
 
 
Structural reforms 

 
most notab
ly upgrading leg
al systems 

 
could
 
bring significant efficiency 
gains

estimates of potential efficiency gains from improving structural and 
institutional characteristics of CESEE countries to EU

analy
sis
. 
In the case of Croatia
,
 
for example,
 
efficiency gains from all structural reforms
 
shown in 
Figure 2.18
 
would 
allow it to close the gap with the
 
frontier
 
economy
.
 
But, in
 
the case of Estonia, 
potential gains are
 
limited since in many of these areas Est

R&D spending is statistically significant in some specificat
ions, 
but the relationship is not robust. 
The lack of 
statistical significance of l
abor m
arket flexi
bility could be due to the fact that labor markets in CESEE outside SEE are 
fairly flexible, especially when compared to 
advanced
 
Europe. The absence 
from

(

)
 
of

Aggregate

by

tries 
with a larger 
share of employment in low

productivity sectors, such as agriculture, tend to have lower aggregate 
labor productivity. As one would expect, c
ountries 
where a la

higher productivity growth over 2000

The
 
link between productivity and allocative e
fficiency within sectors can be analyzed using 
firm
-
level data
. 
Aggrega
t
e productivity, defined as 
average firm
-
level productivity weighted by the 
number of employees, can be decomposed 
in
to two elements (Olle
y and Pakes, 1996): (1) underlying 
productivity, which is
 
captured by 
the unweighted avera

 
and
 
(2) 
productivity 
stemming from more efficient resource allocation 
across firms, whereby 
firms with higher 
productivity have more
 
resources.
 
The
 
second component

allocative efficiency

is 
measured by the 

 
and its 
share 
of employment in a given industry
 
(Box 
2.

).
 
 
 
Box

Assessing Allocative Efficiency Using Firm
-
level Data
 
 
The allocative efficiency score measures the relative productivity gain th
at a c
ountry enjoys owing
 
to its actual allocation of employment across firms relative to a case where employment allocation 
is random

would have been if resou
rces (employment) were allocated randomly 
(
see 
Figure 
2.
21
 
in the main text
). 
F
irm
-
level productivity is measured as the log of 
the 
ratio of 
a 

o the number of employees. 
A
llocative efficiency is measured at industry level (according to NAC
E 2 Rev. first two di
gits)
, and then 

 
 
A
llocative efficiency is higher when larger firms are more productive
. Between two countries with 
a 
s
imilar level of pro
ductivity among 
large firms (say, Poland and 
the 
Slovak Republic), a country with less 
productive small firms (Slovak Republic) exhibits 
a 
higher allocative
 
efficiency score than the
 
country with 
more productive small firms (Poland)
. This means
 
that in Pol
and there is more room for further 
productivity gains if
 
more resources are 
allocated to more productive firms. 
 
 
Th
e allocative efficiency score appears to be very
 
sensitive to the productivity distribution by firm
-
size in a sample used in the analysis
. F
or example, it measures differently depending on whether micro 
firms (less than 20 employe
es) are included or excluded from 
the sample, as micro firms represents 80 
percent of sample firms while accounting for only 20 percent of employment and turnover. Th
is is 
particularly the case in countries where the productivity
 
of
 
micro
 
firm
s
 
is relatively high (Poland and 

 
significantly (
see 
Figure 
2.
2
1
 
in the main te
xt)
.
 
It should be noted that further analysis may be needed here, 
as the unusu
ally high productivity of micro firms may be due to mis
-
reporting which is linked 
to specific 
threshold
-
based regulations. 
 
In mos
t CESEE countries, however, 
allocative efficienc
y appears lowe
r when 
micro firms are excluded

particularly in the case of Bulgaria and Latvia, where 
prod
uctivity of 
micro firm
s
 
is significantly lower
. See Annex 
VII
I
 
for more details
.
 
 
S
ome CE
SEE countries lag behind in 
allocative efficiency. 
Figure 
2.
2
1
 
shows 
that 
some CESEE 
countries, such as Serbia and Slovenia, have much room to improve their productivity through more 
efficient allocation of resources
.
 
 
 
S
tructural reforms
 
that help improve allocative efficiency would also help narrow 
the 
productivit
y gaps. 
We find several structural indicators to be significant determinants of allocative 
efficiency
: (1) 
quality of institutions
 
(government efficiency); (2) 
labor regulation
 
(flexible wages)
;
 
and
 
(3) 
financial development
 
(
affordability
 
of financial ser
vices
). 
Notably, these are exactly the areas 
where 
one would expect improvements to yield the largest benefits for
 
relatively 
small but 
productive
 
firms
. 
The analysis suggests that more efficient 
resource allocation through 
improvement

in govern
ment ef
ficiency and affordability of financial services up to the level of Sweden could
 
bring 
significant p

In sum
,
 
CESEE countries could
 
realize sizable gains from improving both technical and 
all
ocative efficiency
. In the case of technical efficiency, the biggest impr
ovement could
 
be achieved 
by upgrading institutions (legal systems), while in the case of allocative efficiency, the largest benefits 
would 
stem from greater 
affordability
 
of financia

for SMEs.

What
 
factors 

 
global or country
-
specific 

 
have played a larger role in the 
post
crisis 
TFP 
growth 
slowdown in CESEE?
  
We consider several hypotheses: 
 
 
Hypothesis 1
:
 
The 
TFP gro
wth slowdown in CESEE has been largely 
driven by lower potential growth of 
trading partners.
 
Basically,
 
we conjecture that the observed decline in 
TFP growth is simply a result of 
lower potential output and aggregate demand of th

 
partners 

 
the 
euro area countries
. 
Our analysis suggests 
that
 
s
trong TFP growt
h in CESEE before the crisis was 
indeed
 
largely driven by common 
or external rather
 
than country
-
specific factors (Figure 
2.
2
4
). More 
specificall
y, we 

expansion of global supply chains, and global trade are closely correlated w
ith the common 
component of 
TFP growth in CESEE (Figure 
2.
2
4
).
7
 
 
 
Hypothesis 2
: 
The 
TFP growth slowdown in CESEE reflects 
slower technical
 
progress in frontier 
economies, 
in other words
, it reflects 
a 
TFP growth slowdown
 
in advanced econ
omies
. We find some 
empirical support for this hypothesis as well.
 
Technological frontier 
is estimated to have been
 
expanding
 
by
 
1 percent per year before the crisis,
 
on average,
 
but
 
has remained
 
un
changed since 
200
7. Mean
while most of the advanced countri
es that were close to the technological frontier before 
the cris
is
 
appear to
 
have moved away from it since
 
the crisis.
 
                                                                      
Hypothesis 3
: 
Less efficient economies 
suffered 
larger declines in 
TFP growth
 
than those that were 
closer to the technological frontier before the crisi
s.
 
Indeed, one might expect that c
ountries 
that have
 
significant structural or institutional obstacles to 
efficient use of technology or resource allocation 
could have
 
exp
erience
d
 
a 
larger TFP growth 
slowdown due to their limited ability to adjust.
 
However
,
 
we find that countries with low initial 
levels of technical efficiency have experienced 
larger 
subsequent 
improvements in efficiency 
(Figure 
2.
2
3
)
, likely reflecting imp
rovements in their 
structural and institutional characteristics
. 
However, 
t
he pace of these impr
ovements 
has slowed after 
the crisis.
 
In sum
,
 
it appears that
 
the
 
strong productiv
ity growth 
enjoyed 
by CESEE 
before the crisis 
was
 
la
rgely 
associated with 
favo
rable external or 
common factors. 
This also means that 
CE
SEE 
countries 
will
 
have 
to do more on their own rather 
than rely on external tailwinds
 
if the current
 
les
s supportive global 

 
 
 
                                        
          
 
7
 
We also looked at the correlation
s of global FDI flows and
 
oil prices with the common component of 
the 
TFP gr
owth 
for CESEE countries. The c
orrelation between FDI and 
the 
common component of 
TFP growth was positive, but not 
strong. The
 
c
orrelation between oil prices and 
the 
common component of TFP growth
 
turned out to be insignificant 
in our sample of countries, 
in contrast with the findings of Eichengreen, Park, and Shin (2015).

Key Takeaways and Reform Priorities
 
CESEE 
may face
 
much slower pace of convergence
 
unless they step up reform efforts
. 
CESEE
 
co
untries 
made
 
significant 
progress 
along the 
convergence
 
path 
during 
1990
-
2008
, on the back o
f 
strong
 
TFP
 
growth and to a lesser extent, investment. 
After th
e crisis, TFP growth slowed
 
sign
ificantly 
across most economies, raising concerns that 
CESEE may be entering
 
a prolonged period of lower 
global growth,
 
less
 
trade and 
capital flows,
 
and less 
scope for
 
expansion 
of global supply chains. 
This 
also 
means that 
external financial conditions may be less supportive
, implying that
 
CESEE may have 
to rely more on domestic savings
. Coupled with 
negative demographic trends, 
these challenges 
imply the need to 
put g
reat
er emphasis on 
productivity
-
enhancing reforms as well as on
 
active labor 
market policies.
 
For example, in the case of Korea
, a strong acceleration of TFP growth after the 
Asian 
crisis 
was largely due to 
large
-
scale 
structural reforms, including corpora
te restructuring and
 
upgrading 
corporate governance
, which in addition to 
a 
more benign global environment at the 
time, 
helped it to stay on
 
a fast convergence path.

What ar
e the CESEE E

 
Strengths and W
eaknesses? 
 
 
Labor
: In contrast to
 
many
 
emerging markets 
that have 
enjoy
ed
 
the so
-
called
 

demographic 
dividend

 
CESEE countries
 
have experienced
 
some of the worst declines in the working age 
population due to unfavor
able demographics and emigration. On the upside, the relatively high l
evel 
of 
human capital is a plus, though s
izable skill gaps and skill mis
matches remain. 
 
 
Capital
: C
apital gaps relative to advanced Europe are still large, while investment rates are not
 
sufficient for 
rapid catch
-
up. 
Currently, i
nvestment is held back by 
crisis 
legacies and 
subdued long
-
term growth prospects. More generally, investment and saving rates have been 
fairly
 
low 
across 
CESEE, when compared t
o the optimal benchmarks or to 
previous fast
-
track convergence episodes
. 
This could be because
 
of still
 
low level
 
of productivity
 
coupled with the negative productivity
-
wage 
growth differential
, which
 
reduce 
return
s
 
on capital and incentives to 
save and invest
. Furthermore, 
limited
 
access to financial services
 
may constrain the
 
expansion opportunities for small, but 
productive firms. 
In some cases, s
pace for external borrowing may be constrained
 
due to alr
eady 
high external debt.
 
 
Productivity
:
 
P
roductivity gaps between CESEE and advanced Europe
 
are significant due to both 
technical 
and allocative inefficiencies.

outperform
 
other CESEE economies, but are still quite far from the frontier.

Which 
structural reform
s
 
would yield the largest growth
 
benefits
? 
 
T
he
 
answer 
d
epends
 
on the 
growth el
asticity of different reforms and on 
the size of 
institutional gaps in 
a given country
. 
Out of 
the
 
host of indicators
 
shown in Figure 2.
25
, Figure 
2.
26 
includes only a subset of institutional and 
structur
al characteristics that turned out to be statistical
ly
 
significant and robust in our
 
empirical
 
analysis of produ
ctivity or 
the ones that
 
directly 
affect the supply of production factors, such as labor 
and capital
 
(
infrastructure
)
. 
The colors are based on the estimated potential gains (percent increase 
in GD
P level) from improving these characteristics
 
from their current levels to 
EU
-
15 levels. The main 
advantage 
of this approach is that potential gains from differ
ent reforms
 
can be compared across
 
CESEE REI SPRING 201

INTERNATIONAL MONETA

the entire spectrum of policy choice
s
. 
So, putting it all tog
ether 
suggests that 
the 
largest poten
tial 
growth benefits
 
can be achiev
ed by (1
) 
improving protection of 
property rights 
and
 
upgrading 
legal 
systems
;
 
(2
) 
increasing government efficiency
;
 
(3
) improving 
affordability 
of financial services 
(especially for sm

; (4
) upgrading

(5

increasing quality of 
healthcare (life expectancy); 
and (6
)
 
facilit
ating structural transformation 
of economies by increasing 
the 
share of high
-
productivity sectors (services)
 
(Figure 2.25). 
Given th

The productivity

CESEE 
countries have
 
little prospects of co
nverg
ing
 
to euro area living standards within a generation (25
-
year horizon), if TFP growth remains
 
the same as in euro area, implying investment rates close
 
to 
current levels (Figure 
2.
27
). At the same time, a s
ustained 1
 
percentage point TFP growth differential 
against the euro area,
 
which would raise
 
average investment rates by 2½ percentage points a year, 
would lead to faster convergence for many CESEE cou
ntries. Some of the CIS and SEE
-
non EU 
countries, however, might need a much larger boost to TFP growth to
 
achieve similar results. 
The 
analysis in this report 
suggests 
a possible menu of reforms that 
could help
 
CESEE countries 
to 
achieve a
 
necessary boost
 
to TFP growth

POLICY PRIORITIES
 
In the baseline, s
upportive monetary policy and medium
-
term fiscal consolidati
on re
main
 
valid for 
many economies in
 
the 
region. 
In the event of a negative
 
growth shock
, monetary policy should be the 
first line of defense, while automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to play freely, provided there is 
enough fiscal policy room to do so.
 
In case of a major shoc
k and depending on the nature of
 
the shock
, 
fiscal policy should ease within the medium
-
term adjustment plans that dispel concerns about 
sustainability. 
Against the backdrop of mediocre global growth prospects, s
tructural reforms are critical 
to 
lift potential growth and re
-
accelerate convergence.
 
 
 
 
 
In the absence of negative shocks, 
supportive monetary policy and medium
-
term fiscal 
consolidation is 
an 
appropriate
 
policy mix
 
for many CESEE economies
:
 

 
Monetary policy
 
should stay accommodative in 
low
-
inflation countries
 
with further rate cuts if 
in
flation expectations continue to decline or interest rate differentials with the euro area widen. 
There are, however, many countries in the region, where conventional monetary
 
policy space is 
limited: 
because they lack monetary policy autonomy or because i
nflation is above 
the 
target or 
the 
interest rate at zero bound
. 
For 
Turkey
, where inflation remains high, further tightening 
would be needed to address excess demand pressures and build
 
up international reserves that
 

rve adequacy. In 
Russia
, a resumption of monetary easing 
to support the weak economy is only feasible once inflation expectations fall. The pace of such 
future easing would need to be mindful of 
the 
uncertain external outlook and the need to 
build 
the 
cred
ibility of the new
 
inflation
-
targeting
 
regime. 
About half of the countries in the 
region 
that have some sort of 
flexibl
e exchange rate regime
 
can 
also 
use this tool 
to counter
 
adverse 
external shocks
. 
However, high
 
foreign currency indebtedness, 
euroizatio
n
 
and financial 
openness could limit
 
the benefits of currency depreciations
. 
 
 

 
Fiscal policy
 
should continue to anchor medium
-
term debt sustainability and build policy 
buffers in most countries. Some have made progress with a noticeable decline in the stru
ctur
al 
fiscal deficit
. However, with 
the 
debt
-
stabilizing primary gap still in the negative for several 
countries
 
and
 
public debt still high
,
 
more needs to be done to 
rebuild fiscal buffers 
in the 
medium term (Figure 3.1).
 
For 
Russia
, the roughly neutral f
iscal stance remains appropriate, given 
cyclical weakness, but more consolid
ation is needed over the medium
-
run. In 
Turkey
, a 
tightening of fiscal policy in the medium term would increase domestic savings and thereby 
soften excess demand pressures, while b
uilding more policy space. 
 
 

 
Medium
-
term f
iscal consolidation should rely, as much as possible, on more growth
-
friendly 
expenditure and revenue
 
measures
, as discussed in the F
all 2015 REI.
 
On the 
expenditure side
, 
it is important to reduce
 
unproductive
 
tra
nsfers and further reform
 
entitlement 
programs, including publ
ic pension systems
, 
while protecting productive spending on public 
investment
. Restructuring of public employment may also be called for, especially where 
employment levels or public sector wage
s are higher than in the private sector. On the 
revenue 
side
, policymakers 
should consider the introduction or strengthening of carbon and property 
taxes,
 
and in some
 
cases, the improvement of tax compliance and administration.

If growt
h and inflation 
surprise
 
on the 
downside, 
monetary policy should be 
the first line of defense
. Also, 
automatic fiscal stabilizers 
should 
generally 
be a
llowed to 
operate
 
freely
. In case of a very 
adverse external demand shock, 
fiscal stimulus may need to be 
deployed by countries that 
still 
have access to international 
capital markets on affordable 
terms. For those with this 
option, 
it 
is recommended 
that 
they rely
 
on measures that are 
easy to pull back if economic 
conditions improve (for 
example, a temporary 
investment tax credit) or 
that 

-
term 
growth potential (for example, 
targeting infrastructure). More 
generally, for such stimulus to 
be effective and not raise questions about sustainability, it should be overlaid on medium
-
term 
adjustment plans that noticeably
 
reduce public debt. Deploying the latter, together with further 
repair of balan
ce sheets 

 
as discussed in the Spring 2015
 
REI, is the main macroeconomic policy 
challenge for many CESEE economies.
 
Against the backdrop of mediocre global growth prospects, 
structural reforms are critical to 
lift potential growth a
nd re
-
accelerate convergence
. As discus
sed in Chapter II, efforts should 
focus on active labor market policies and productivity
-
enhancing reforms. 
The analysis in this report 
suggests that t
he curre
nt
ly
 
significant productivity 
gaps with advanced Europe could be
 
reduced by 
upgrading institutions (
protection of property rights, 
legal systems, healthcare), increasing 
the 
affordability of financial services
 
(for small and productive firms), and improvin
g government 
efficiency
. 
While
 
the structural reform
 
recommendations 
in 
IMF
 
country reports
 
are
 
generally 
more 
comprehensive
9
 
and 
more 
tailored to country
-
specific circumstances
, many of the cross
-
country 
themes are similar
 
to the ones highlighted in t
his report 
(Figure 3.2
)
:
 
improving government 
efficiency and reducing regulatory burden on firms in most CESEE countries; strengthening 
governance and institutions in SEE and 
the 
CIS; and increasing labor force participation in CEE 
countries, while improvi
ng labor market flexibility in SEE countries.
 
As discussed in the WEO, in cases

A comprehensive approach may indeed be critical. For example, the recent paper by 
Aiyar 
et al (2015) discusses the 
need for a comprehensive approach towards addressing multiple interlinked institutional obstacles to NPL re
solution 
in Europe.

where 
the necessary
 
reforms could have negative short

s
 
would need to 
be mitigated thro

careful

or demand support
, 
if possible
10
.  
 
 
In countries with greater structural challenges more far
-
reaching refo
rms may be needed to 
speed up 
convergence.
 
As discussed in
 
IMF country reports, reforms in SEE non
-
EU and CIS 
economies should aim
 
to strengthen 
governance, to
 
lower administrative and trade barriers, increase 
competition in domestic markets, and improve 
the 
transparency and efficiency of public investment 
procedures. In 
Belarus
, deep and carefully sequenced structural reforms 
to re
-
orient the economy 
toward more private
-
sector
-
led growth remain
 
critical. For 
Moldova
, priority should be given to 
strengthening institutional quality. For 
Ukraine
, critical reforms include anti
-
corruption and judicial 
measures, tax administration reforms,
 
and reforms of state
-
owned enterprises to improve corporate 
governance and reduce fiscal risks.

. Derivation of the Golden Rule Benchmark

In the neoclassical (Ramsey

-
state equilibrium in which consumption is maximized, the saving/investment rate is 
constant at its 

-

In the Ramsey

f capital accumulation is given by:
 
 
 
 
where
 

growth of the labor force; and g is the rate of technical progress.
 
 
The model is calibrated for European Union (EU) countries using national a
ccounts data, labor market surveys, 
and the Penn World Tables Version 8.1 (PWT). In the case of EU members, for which standardized data exist 
from Eurostat, the estimates of the growth of the labor force and the capital share of output are derived from 
lab
or market surveys and national accounts data, respectively. Similar to the adjustments made to the raw data 
in the PWT, the estimates of the labor share of output are augmented by 63 percent of self
-
employment 
income. For non
-
EU members, data for these var
iables are from the PWT. In addition, estimates of capital 
stocks, depreciation rates, and total factor productivity are taken from the PWT.
 
 
Under a typical calibration and with a starting value of the capital
-
to
-
labor ratio below the steady state, the 
mo

-

converges to its steady state. As such, the closed
-
economy, golden
-
rule saving/investment can be interpreted 
as a lower bo
und for the investment rate
 
alon
g its path of convergence to euro area income levels. The social 
rate of time preference is constant and set equal to 5 percent for all CESEE countries. This value corresponds to 
the social rate of time preference in the euro area, derived from the golden 
rule under the assumption that the 
euro area has been close to its steady
-
state path of development on average over 2002

. Derivation of the Historical Benchmark
13
 
 
The purpose of the benchm
ark is to provide a proxy for a sustainable path of the investment rate during the 
transition to a steady state. Although neoclassical growth theory does not offer a closed
-
form solution for such 

-

 
differences in real interest rates that affect 
intertemporal choices of consumption and savings (the Euler equation; see Barro and Sala
-
i
-
Martin 2003). When 
relative capital scarcity makes capital more productive, bearing a higher real interest rate, it s
timulates saving 
and investment rates and leads to faster pace of capital accumulation. With a rising K/L ratio, the real return to 
capital declines and saving and investment rates gradually fall to their steady
-
state constant level. The further 
the econom
y is from its steady
-
state K/Y ratio, the faster it will accumulate capital. Therefore, the transition path 
for the investment rate I/Y may be approximated by a function of the real return to capital (given by the 
marginal product of capital, using Cobb
-
Do
uglas production function, where 
A

productivity,

This suggests that our approximation of the transition path is a plausible transition dynamic, since it converges 
into the balanced growth path.
 
 
In order
 
to

use the historical experiences of countries in Western Europe 
with their capital accumulation path over 1951

investment rate on a panel for Germany, France, I
taly, and Spain over 1951

The Effect of Structural Factors on Total Factor Productivity
14
 
 
Methodology
 
 
Stochastic frontier models are used to analyze the efficiency of economic agents, regions, or countries. The 
intuition behind the models is 
that frontier technology may not be exceeded by any of the economic agents 
and the distance from the frontier reflects the inefficiency of individual agents. The frontier represents the 
maximum amount of output that can be obtained from a given level of in
puts. Stochastic frontier models are 
characterized by composite error that is composed of idiosyncratic disturbance (to capture measurement errors 
and other noise) and one
-
sided disturbance, which represents inefficiency. In this annex we use a stochastic 
frontier panel
-
data model proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995) to estimate the contributions of technological 
progress and country
-
specific technical efficiency to total factor productivity (TFP) growth
.
15
 
Stochastic frontier 
models could be described by t
he following equations:

We use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate the production frontier and technical inefficiency, and to identify 
structural, regulatory, and institutional factors that are associated with technical inefficiency. The analy
sis 
applies the stochastic frontier method to 
30
 
advanced and emerging European economies and the United 
States for the period
 
1995

2014.
 
16
 
The model is estimated using purchasing power parity
-
adjusted annual data 
from the Penn World Tables (PWT) and struc

Report and from the Economic Freedom of the World Survey.
 
17
  
The production function approach is used to 
remove cyclical components from output and labor series (for a detailed description, see P
odpiera, Raei, and 
Stepanyan, forthcoming). Structural variables cover the following broad areas: (1) product and labor markets, (2) 
institutional quality, (3) quality of infrastructure, (4) innovation and R&D, and (5) quality of labor and capital.
       
 
 
Regression
 
Results
 
 
According to our estimation, technology progressed at 0.5 percent per year, on average,
 
during 1995

2014 
(Annex Table VII
.1). However, before the global financial crisis the average growth rate of technological 
progress was higher, at 
about 1 percent, while after the crisis technological progress stalled. Estimated 
coefficients for physical capital and human
-
capital
-
augmented labor in the production function are very close 
to the calibrated labor and capital shares used in the literatur
e. These results are robust to the different model 
specifications and different samples.
 
 
Differences in structural factors explain the variation in inefficiency across countries in our sample. The high 
levels of corruption and restricted business regulati
ons, including for foreign direct investment (FDI), give rise to 
technical inefficiencies. The higher share of employment in the services sector and the longevity of the 
population are conducive to technical efficiency. The square of human capital has a po
sitive sign on inefficiency, 
reflecting the diminishing return on human capital.
18
 
 
We zoomed in to identify specific factors that influence technical inefficiency and, according to the literature, 
are behind corruption. We used a variety of indicators repr
esenting the legal and judicial system 
in lieu of
 
corruption
 
indicators
 
in our analysis.
19
 
Data limitations prevent us from including a
ll variables simultaneously, 
and therefore,
 
we used one at a time. The results suggest that judicial independence, imparti
ality of the courts, 
and property rights play an important role in 
improving technical efficiency.

e, 
Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, Ukraine, and United States.
 
17
 
Data in 
the 
PWT are available until 2011. We used 
purchasing power parity (PPP)
 
conversi
on factors from 

Development Indicators
 
for the period 2011

14 to calculate
 
the
 
growth rate of output and investment in PPP
-
adjusted terms. We 
extended 
the 
PWT series to 2014 using these growth rates. 
 
 
18
 
We considered structural indi
cators in the broad area
s
 
of institutions, legal framework, labor market
,
 
product market efficiency, 
financial market developments, 
i
nnovation and R&D, quality of education, physical and human capital, and infrastructure. We found 
robust and significant re
sults only for the variables presented in 
Annex 
Table 
7.
1. For the rest of the variables, the relationship was 
either not statistically significant or not robust.
 
 
19
 
Some of the factors in the product market that may give rise to corruption are already inc
luded in the model through business 
regulation.

Implications for Structural Reform Priorities
 
 
Structural reform priorities vary across countries depending on potential relative ef
ficiency gains (Annex Fi
gure 
VII
.1):
 
 
Legal system and protection of property rights:
 
 
Among CESEE countries, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Slovak 
Republic, and Slovenia have relatively large room to increase efficiency by improving the legal system 
(independence of the judicial system 
and impartiality of courts) and protection of property rights. Turkey also 
has significant room to improve the independence of the judicial system. Albania, Hungary, Serbia, and the CIS 
countries could also benefit from improving protection of property rig
hts. In general, the Baltic countries have 
institutional and structural characteristics very close to the EU
-
15 average. Thus, the room to gain efficiency by 
improving these characteristics is limited.
 
 
 
Business regulation:
 
Croatia, the Czech Republic, an
d the Slovak Republic could gain the most among CESEE 
countries from easing general business regulation and restrictions for FDI. 
 
 
Structural transformation:
 
In Albania, Romania, Turkey, and, to a lesser extent, Poland, there is scope to raise 
productivit
y by shifting labor from relatively lower productivity sectors (agriculture) to higher
-
productivity 
(services) sector.
 
 
Life expectancy:
 
the 
Baltic and 
the 
CIS countries have the greatest room to improve the life expectancy of the 
population.

Methodology
 
 
This annex analyzes the role of structural policies in improving the efficie
ncy of resource allocation
. The 
evidence from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, as shown in 
Andrews and C
ingano (2014), suggests that policy
-
induced frictions in labor, product, and credit markets have 
an economically and statistically significant negative relationship with aggregate productivity, as they can 
hinder efficient resource allocation from less to 
more productive firms.  This annex applies a similar 
methodology to 14 CESEE countries using firm
-
level data from ORBIS for the period 2010

13, and examines 
whether certain reforms could help clo
se productivity gaps by facilitating
 
more efficient resource 
allocation.
21
 
 
In order to test the role of the quality of institutions and regulations in resource allocation, we estimate the
 
following fixed
-
effect model with time dummies:
 
 
 
 
 
 
where 
AE
i,c,t
 
denotes allocative efficiency, measu

their labor share within industry 
i

denotes the country

m
-
th indicator of 
regulation and institutional quality; 


 
denotes the fixed effe
cts for industry and country groups; and 


 
denotes time dummies.
 
For structural indicators, 

Index, particularly in the areas of government efficiency, flexibility in wage determination, and aff
ordability of 
financial services
.
24
 
Results suggest that the quality of institutions matters for allocative efficiency, and, in CESEE, the improvement 
in government efficiency and affordability of financial services could yield significant potential product
ivity 
gains through better resource allocation. The regression results suggest that, for instance, an increase in the 
affordability of financial services indicator by one notch is associated with a rise in allocative efficiency by 13 
percentage points. The
 
productivity gains from reforms in these areas (government efficiency and affordability

The countries included are Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, S
erbia, 
Slovak
 
Republic
, Slovenia, and Ukra
ine. Within the sample years, the number
s
 
in the
 
sample remains relatively stable. Firms with one 
employee and in the top and bottom 1
 
percent
 
of the productivity distribution from 
the 
sample are excluded, following the standard 
in literature.
 
22
 
The measur
e of allocative efficiency, proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996), is based on the decomposition of
 
the
 
industry
-
level 
aggregate productivity index (defined as average firm
-
level log
 
productivity, weighted by 
the 

averag
e and covariance term
 




































, where
 



  
is the unweighted average of firm log
-
productivity, and 

 

a 
fi

productivity, measures allocative efficiency
 
by 
capturing the extent to which firms with higher productivity have greater resources 
(zero in random allocation and increasing with better allocation). When productivity is measured in log, the t
erm captures how much 
higher
 
and
 
by how much of a 
percent
age
 
the industry productivity index is higher than in the case of random resource allocation.
 
23
 
Industries are classified according to NACE Rev 2, first 
two

24
 
We considered structural in
dicators in the broad area

s
, labor market
s
 
and financial market efficiency, and 
product 
market efficiency. We did not 
a 
find robust, c
onsistent relation between product 
market efficiency and allocative efficiency 
(
for example,
 
burden
s on starting 
a 
business, domestic and foreign competition). Within the broad area
s
 
of public institution
s
, labor 
market
s
, and financial market efficiency, the indicators included in 
the 
results show 
a 
more robust and significant relation with 
allocative e
fficiency than other subindicators (

public security, undue influence, hiring and firing practices, and 
trustworthiness and confidence in financial market

Data Description
 
 
The allocative efficiency analysis uses firm

ase, covering over 1.5 million firms 
each year for the period between 2010 and 2013 (1.8 million firms for 2013) for 14 countries. The sample 
excludes the self
-
employed (firms with one employee) and the outlier firms at the top and bottom 1 percentile 
in t

share within industry (using a narrow classification according to NACE Rev. 2, first two
-
digit level). Those 
industries with less than 20 firms a
vailable are excluded from the sample. Annex Table 
VIII
.2 shows the data 
coverage (comparing the total number of employees hired by sample firms to the aggregate
-
level employment

. Decomposing TFP Growth into Common and Idiosyncratic Components
25
 
 
Productivity growth has slowed across countries regardless of their level o
f development (Eichengreen, Park, 
and Shin 2015). A widespread slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP) growth raises a natural question: Are 
common factors behind this slowdown? This annex describes the framework that we used to decompose TFP 
growth in
to common/external and country
-
specific/idiosyncratic factors. For this purpose we run the following 
regression for each CESEE country separately:
 
 

























,
 


























 
 
where 



 
is TFP growth at time t;






 
is weighted average TFP growth of trading partners at time t 
(weighted by exports); 





 
is average TFP growth across countries in the samp
le at each point in time, 
which represents other common factors for TFP growth; N is the number of countries in our sample; 


 
is the 
country
-
specific component of TFP growth; and 


 
are parameters that need to be estimated. Vectors of 







 
across all countries in our sample represent common factor loading vectors. To control for country 
fixed and time effects, all data are de
-
meaned and de
-
trended in advance. TFP growth data for CESEE countries 
are from Podpiera, Raei, and Stepanyan 
(forthcoming). TFP growth for trading partners is calculated using the 
production function approach described in Podpiera, Raei, and Stepanyan (forthcoming).
