FOREWORD
The European economy continues to expand modestly. Low oil prices, the relatively low exchange rate of
the euro, very ample monetary policy and slightly supportive fiscal policy will continue to underpin
growth this year. However, the lift from cheap oil is set to gradually wane and the lagged boost from the
euro’s depreciation will soon have run its course. As a result, the pace of private consumption growth, the
main motor of growth so far, is projected to slow down somewhat next year, even though employment
gains and a modest acceleration in wage growth should partly compensate for the fading of these
tailwinds. Support next year will mainly come from monetary policy, which the ECB has committed to
keep expansionary for an extended period of time, while the fiscal stance is projected to turn neutral. At
the same time, the conditions are in place for private investment to pick up over the forecast horizon, and
the Investment Plan for Europe will move from project identification to implementation. In sum, the
economy is forecast to continue growing on the back of slightly re-balanced domestic demand but growth
is not expected to accelerate significantly.
Sluggish core inflation reflects the slack still present in the economy. Real GDP in the euro area has now
risen above its pre-crisis peak of eight years ago but it has taken much longer to reach this milestone than
in other advanced economies. The level of investment remains depressed and unemployment far too high.
This investment shortfall, structural unemployment and the slow trend growth of productivity have
reduced potential output growth. Moreover, a debt overhang persists in some sectors, while the financial
industry is adjusting to a more demanding regulatory environment and needs to address low profitability
as well as in some Member States high levels of non-performing loans. Shifting to a higher growth path
cannot rely as often in the past on the external side. Net exports will continue to subtract from growth in
Europe this year, even if acute concerns about the global economy have abated somewhat.
The uncertainty surrounding the forecast is extraordinarily high considering that we are in an expansion
phase. The economic risks to the baseline of slow but steady growth are mostly to the downside. On top
of these more or less familiar and quantifiable risks, political uncertainty outside the remit of economics
but with potentially sizeable economic ramifications is large. Lifting this uncertainty could clear the way
for faster investment than forecast. There are heightened geopolitical tensions in Europe's immediate
neighbourhood and farther afield. And there is serious uncertainty within Europe. Although it stems from
various domains and circumstances, much of it relates to the same broad theme, namely the capacity and
the continued willingness to find and implement common solutions to common challenges.
In this context of modest growth amid high risks, economic policy has two functions to fulfil. First, it
needs to support the ongoing, but still fragile economic expansion and reinvigorate potential growth
through the three-pronged strategy of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms endorsed by
the G20. At present, this task is mainly being carried out by monetary policy. Fiscal policy levers, by
contrast, are not being used to the necessary extent. Some countries could take better advantage of their
fiscal space to increase investment, and all countries should still do more to make their tax and spending
policies fair and more growth friendly. Macroeconomic policies should thus be rebalanced and
complemented by accelerated structural reforms to bolster potential growth in the medium term. Their
short-term positive growth impact can in fact be maximised through measures that increase demand. The
second function at the current juncture is preventive: policy makers need to stand ready to react swiftly
and decisively to the potential materialisation of multiple, large and inter-related downside risks. This
necessity was re-affirmed at the global level by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in
April and preparedness on the part of the EU, as well as its Member States, will be crucial.

OVERVIEW:

STAYING THE COURSE AMID HIGH RISKS

An ongoing but fragile
economic
expansion…

For more than a year, the European economy has been benefitting from an
exceptional combination of favourable factors. Low oil prices, a low euro
exchange rate, supportive monetary policy measures and increased public
expenditure associated with the inflow of asylum seekers in some Member
States, have provided generous support to the economy. In recent months,
however, the boost from these factors has been partly offset by external
headwinds stemming from the downturn in emerging economies and, more
recently, from a slowdown in major advanced economies. As a result,
economic growth has remained moderate.

…amid fading
tailwinds and growing
headwinds…

The strength of some of the positive factors supporting the euro area is likely
to fade over the forecast horizon. On the one hand, although the renewed
drop in oil prices early this year should still sustain the purchasing power of
households, the expected rebound in inflation will eventually slow the
expansion of real disposable incomes. Additionally, the benefits of the euro’s
earlier depreciation, which take time to feed through, will start to wane, while
its appreciation since the start of this year is likely to compound the slowing
impact of the external environment on the euro area. On the other hand,
additional measures taken by the ECB in March have improved access to
credit and reduced funding costs, further improving the conditions for an
acceleration of investment. Fiscal policy is expected to be slightly supportive
to growth this year. Meanwhile, high levels of public and private debt will
continue to weigh on growth, along with other legacies from the crisis, such

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

as high structural unemployment and high levels of policy uncertainty.
Overall, euro area GDP is forecast to grow at modest rates, rather than gather
momentum, over the 2015-2017 period, as it is projected at 1.6% in 2016 and
1.8% in 2017 after 1.7% in 2015.
…as global growth
has been slowing…

The outlook for global GDP growth has weakened further in recent months.
Growth outside the EU is expected to have fallen to 3.2% in 2015, its slowest
pace since 2009, and is now forecast to pick up only modestly to 3.3% in
2016 and 3.7% in 2017. Reflecting increased external headwinds from the
slowdown in emerging markets, growth in advanced economies lost
momentum at the end of last year and is expected to remain at 2% this year
and next. In the US, weak external demand is likely to continue to weigh on
activity while domestic demand should continue to support it. But the
maturing cycle limits the scope for growth to pick up further. In Japan,
sluggish wage growth is likely to remain a drag on private consumption while
the investment outlook suffers from weak potential growth. Domestic
demand is also expected to be increasingly volatile ahead of planned fiscal
consolidation measures.
Growth in emerging markets slowed down last year to its weakest annual
pace since 2009. It is expected to pick up only marginally in 2016 before
stabilising commodity prices, a gradual easing of the deeper-than-expected
recessions in Brazil and Russia, and some progress in adjustments in other
emerging markets support a mild rebound next year. But this outlook is
fragile and subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In particular, the
challenges surrounding an orderly rebalancing and gradual slowing of the
Chinese economy remain pressing and entail considerable risks, even though
pressures on the exchange rate and capital outflows have recently abated.

2

…and trade flows
remain weak…

World imports of goods and services excluding the EU are estimated to have
grown by a meagre 0.5% in 2015, dragged down by sharp contractions in
Russia and Brazil and the marked deceleration of import growth in China.
Non-EU trade is expected to firm over the forecast horizon as a result of a
progressive normalisation in Chinese imports, the assumed stabilisation of
commodity prices at low levels and the expected pick-up in emerging market
growth. Slowing demand for imports in the US, which is largely triggered by
the weakness of its own exports, should, however, also limit non-EU trade
growth to 2.1% this year, while an increase to 3.4% is expected next year.
Growth in European export markets should continue to outpace GDP growth
outside the euro area in general, but should be less robust than expected at the
beginning of the year.

…while financial
markets somewhat
stabilise…

In early 2016, financial markets recorded losses as investors shunned risk
amid intensified concerns about a further global slowdown and worries that
macroeconomic policies would be lacking space to react to it. These concerns
have recently abated with inter alia the slight rebound in oil prices, but
volatility remains elevated. The EU’s financial sector continues to
underperform the broad market reflecting concerns about banks’ profitability
prospects amid the low interest rate environment and the persistence of high
levels of non-performing loans in some countries. Expectations of divergence
between the monetary policies of major central banks receded somewhat
since the beginning of the year. On the one side, the ECB and the central
banks of Sweden, Hungary and Japan have, for instance, further eased their
monetary policies, while on the other side, expectations of monetary policy
tightening by the US Fed and the Bank of England have been pushed back.
The euro has appreciated as a result.

Overview

…and funding
conditions remain
favourable.

The accommodative policy stance of the ECB has led to very favourable
monetary and credit conditions in the euro area. Net bank lending flows to
households and non-financial corporations have remained positive over the
recent months, supported by lower interest rates, which improve the
attractiveness of bank lending relative to market funding. Bank lending rates
have also come down significantly in vulnerable Member States, suggesting
that the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy has improved
and that financial fragmentation across Member States has receded.

Domestic demand
should drive growth…

With net exports turning negative, GDP growth was entirely driven by
domestic demand in 2015. This pattern is expected to continue this year and
next although the composition of domestic demand is expected to show some
rebalancing, as private consumption moderates and investment gathers speed.

…although private
consumption should
lose momentum…

Private consumption should continue to benefit in 2016 and 2017 from
improving labour market conditions, moderate rises in wages and higher nonlabour incomes. The very low inflation foreseen this year should also support
stronger increases in real gross disposable incomes. Private consumption
should then pick up slightly, as households are expected to spend much of
this oil-price windfall rather than increase their savings significantly. The
pace of private consumption growth, however, should slow down next year
as the expected rebound in inflation shaves off a larger portion of the growth
in nominal incomes.

…as should public
consumption…

Government consumption is also set to lose some momentum next year after
having gathered further pace this year mainly as refugee-related spending in
some Member States is set to continue increasing.

…while conditions are
favourable for a pickup of investment…

Investment strongly accelerated at the end of last year, but most available
data suggest that this rebound was mainly driven by temporary factors.
Investment is expected to moderate in the near term as it is held back by
expectations of weak global demand and still considerable uncertainty of
economic and non-economic nature. Nevertheless, the conditions for
investment to pick up further down the line have recently improved, as
borrowing conditions have eased, capacity utilisation is above its long-term
average, corporate deleveraging pressure is fading, and global demand is
expected to gradually strengthen. Construction investment, meanwhile,
should benefit from sustained growth in households' real disposable incomes,
very low mortgage rates and progress in the adjustment in the housing sector.
In some countries, the demand for housing should also rise due to the need to
host refugees. The Investment Plan for Europe is also expected to yield
increasing tangible results on public and private investment as a growing
number of projects should move to the implementation phase.

…and net trade
should be a drag on
growth this year.

The deterioration in external demand turned net trade into a drag on growth
last year despite the resilience of intra euro area exports and the positive
impact of the euro’s past depreciation on euro area exporters' price
competitiveness. Export growth is expected to slow down markedly this year
reflecting both the slow growth of euro area external export markets and the
euro’s recent appreciation. But with real unit labour costs still declining, euro
area exporters are well-positioned to benefit from the expected rebound in
global economic activity next year. Imports, with the support of resilient
domestic demand, are expected to follow the same pattern. As a result, net
exports are projected to have a negative impact on GDP growth in 2016 that
should turn neutral in 2017.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Inflation remains
driven by energy
prices…

Oil prices fell again at the start of 2016, dragging inflation below zero. It is
expected to remain negative in the near term as a result of base effects.
External price pressure is also weak due to the slight appreciation of the euro
and overcapacities in several emerging market economies that are holding
back global producer prices. At the same time, core inflation has so far failed
to show an upward trend, as moderate economic growth and subdued wage
developments have kept a lid on domestic price dynamics. Inflation in the
euro area is therefore set to remain very low for longer than previously
forecast and the projection for inflation in 2016 has been revised downward
to 0.2%. With the assumption of gradually increasing energy prices, inflation
is expected to step up in the second half of this year when positive base
effects start to kick in. The further narrowing of the output gap and higher
domestic demand should eventually add upward pressure on domestic prices.
In 2017 inflation is expected to reach 1.4%.

…labour markets
continue to improve…

Labour market conditions are set to continue their moderate pace of
improvement, driven by the lagged response to improved cyclical conditions
and contained wage growth. In some Member States, labour market reforms
implemented in recent years and fiscal policy measures are also supporting a
rise in net job creation. Overall, employment is set to continue to grow at
about 1% this year and next. The labour force is also expected to increase,
mainly on the back of higher participation rates and, in some Member States,
net migration flows. The unemployment rate in the euro area is projected to
fall from 10.9% in 2015 to 9.9% next year. Although labour market
disparities are set to remain for some time, unemployment is expected to fall
in almost all euro area countries over the forecast horizon, particularly in
those that have implemented labour market reforms (e.g. Spain, Cyprus,
Ireland and Portugal).

…and the fiscal
stance should be
slightly expansionary
this year.

The general government deficit is expected to continue declining this year
and next underpinned by the ongoing economic expansion, the improvement
in labour markets and, to a lesser extent, the drop in interest expenditures.
Discretionary tax cuts to lower the tax burden on labour in some Member
States and additional government expenditures related to the inflow of
asylum seekers in some countries explain the slightly slower decline in the
headline deficit this year. The general government deficit in the euro area is
expected to decrease from 2.1% of GDP to 1.9% in 2016, and to decrease
further to 1.6% next year under a no-policy-change assumption. The fiscal
stance is expected to be slightly expansionary in the euro area this year but to
turn neutral in 2017. The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to continue declining
gradually over the forecast horizon, although less than earlier expected due to
the slower pace of nominal GDP. It should reach 91.1% in the euro area in
2017.

Downside risks are
considerable

The uncertainty surrounding these projections is substantial and the European
economic outlook is exposed to considerable downside risks. On the external
side, the risk that slowing growth in emerging market economies, particularly
China, could trigger stronger spillovers or turn out worse than currently
forecast remains particularly significant for growth in Europe and the world.
Uncertainty linked to geopolitical tensions remains high and could affect
European economies more negatively than currently expected. Abrupt moves
in oil prices or financial turmoil could also dampen European growth.
On the domestic side, risks associated with European policies remain
considerable, as for instance the pace of implementation of structural reforms

4

Overview

and the uncertainty ahead of the UK’s EU referendum. (1) A failure to find
common solutions at the EU level to common challenges of economic and
non-economic nature could also affect private consumption and further delay
the expected rebound of investment. On the upside, the positive impact from
structural reforms could turn out greater than estimated and the transmission
of very accommodative monetary policies to the real economy could prove to
be stronger than expected.

EA and EU outlook

STAYING THE COURSE AMID HIGH RISKS

The euro area economy continues to grow modestly
The euro area economy grew by 1.7% in 2015, expanding at its highest rate since 2010. Thanks to
supportive policies and exceptional factors, such as very low oil prices, the euro area’s GDP surpassed
it pre-crisis peak earlier this year. In 2016 and 2017, the economy should continue to expand at roughly
the same rate – staying the course, but not accelerating. Low oil prices, low funding costs, lagged
effects from the depreciation of the euro, a slightly expansionary fiscal stance, and structural reforms
are expected to continue supporting activity but with diminishing strength. At the same time, modest
global growth, weak global trade, and increased uncertainty look set to weigh more heavily on activity
than previously expected.
As a result, the main impetus for economic growth over the forecast horizon is expected to come from
domestic demand. Private consumption is set to benefit from higher real disposable incomes due to a
delayed rebound in consumer prices and improvements in the labour market. The conditions for a pickup in investment have recently improved, as funding conditions have become more favourable and
capacity utilisation rates remain above their long-term average. Government consumption is expected
to continue contributing to growth but this will depend in part on the number of asylum seekers that
arrive. Hit by external headwinds and a slowdown in exports greater than in imports, net trade will
detract slightly more this year. Overall, real GDP growth in the euro area is projected to be roughly
stable, falling slightly from 1.7% (2.0% in the EU) last year to 1.6% (1.8%) this year before increasing
marginally to 1.8% (1.9%) next year. Labour markets are set to continue improving at a moderate pace.
Inflation remains very low. With the oil price falling again in early 2016 and the slight appreciation of
the euro since then, external price pressures have weakened. Domestic wage and price dynamics,
meanwhile, remain contained by the moderate growth momentum. Thus, the near-term outlook for
inflation has fallen and positive base effects are expected to kick in somewhat later than previously
forecast. Recent monetary policy decisions should support the return to higher inflation rates in the euro
area but only very slowly. Overall, inflation in the euro area is set to rebound later than previously
thought, moving up from last year’s rate of 0.0% to 0.2% in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017.
The uncertainty surrounding these projections is substantial. Growth is exposed to considerable, mainly
negative, external and domestic risks. The most important risks relate to the strength of global growth,
the expected rebound in emerging markets and the ability of China to manage its transition and to avoid
a ‘hard landing’. Abrupt moves in oil prices or financial turmoil could also dampen European growth.
Risks also relate to the stability of financial markets, overall uncertainty of economic and non-economic
nature, and the success of designing and implementing common solutions to common challenges.

PUTTING
THE
FORECAST
INTO
PERSPECTIVE: DISTRIBUTIONAL FACTORS
AND THE EURO AREA OUTLOOK

Sparked by empirical studies showing that
economic inequality has risen substantially in
recent years, economic analyses have presented
various channels through which this affects the
economy. Rising income inequality has been
blamed for substantial output growth losses in
advanced economies. (2) It has also been cited as
one of the reasons for the subdued pace of the
recovery in recent years because of its negative
effects on demand, (3) and as driver in secular
stagnation theories and explanations of the euro
area’s prolonged slump because of its effects on
the saving-investment ratio. (4) Income inequality
has also been named as one of the causes of the
economic and financial crisis in 2007-09. (5)
Globalisation, skills-biased technological change
but also macro-economic and structural policies
have been blamed for the increase in economic
inequality, (6) which has been observed over a long
time span (see Graph I.3)
Most analyses of distributional factors emphasise
medium- to long-term developments. Empirical
analyses have often been driven by data
availability and focussed on the US or single
European economies. This leads to questions such
as whether distributional factors also exert
meaningful short-term effects and whether such
effects can be found in the euro area. By looking at
the functional and personal distribution of incomes

An OECD study (p. 67) estimated that increased income
inequality in 19 OECD countries between 1985 and 2005
knocked 4.7 pps. off cumulative growth between 1990 and
2010; see OECD (2015). In it together – Why less
inequality benefits all. Paris: OECD.

and the distribution of wealth in the euro area, this
sections aims to provide some answers. Overall,
there are good reasons to believe that changes in
income and wealth distribution affect growth in the
longer run. However, incorporating them into
short-term, cyclical forecasts remains challenging.

Employment gains and moderate wage
growth drive the income share of labour…

Functional income distribution divides income
generated by domestic production between the
remuneration of labour (including wages and
salaries, employers’ social security contributions,
but also imputed labour incomes of the selfemployed) and capital (including imputed rents of
homeowners).
This
primary
income
is
supplemented by secondary income, which covers
links between households and the public sector
(e.g. transfers). Not included are capital gains and
losses (resulting from fluctuating asset prices).
In euro area Member States, the income share of
labour ranges roughly between 40% and 60% of
GDP (see Graph I.4). (7) During the economic and
financial crisis, the income share of labour
temporarily increased as corporate profits
plummeted. The effect was less strong in the US,
where faster labour shedding led to a faster decline
in wages. (8) As profits recovered, the labour share
fell slightly back. The European debt crisis and the
‘double dip’ recession of 2011-13 caused
deviations from the usual cyclical pattern. Over the
forecast horizon, labour income’s share of GDP in

higher share of primary incomes. This would be in
line with the observed increase in corporate
savings, most notably during the deleveraging
process in Europe. (10)

Over a longer period, technological change can
lower labour’s income share, for instance by
raising the capital-labour share (‘capital
deepening’). Shifts from labour-intensive to more
capital-intensive sectors tend to reduce the income
share of labour. Changes in labour market policies
and institutional settings (e.g. a lower influence of
trade unions, employment protection, minimum
wage legislation, the increase in part-time work)
can also affect the income share of labour.
Regulatory reforms to strengthen product market
competition, the privatisation of public enterprises
and a relatively strong expansion of the financial
sector (‘financial deepening’) could also affect
income shares.
…whereas non-labour incomes are closely
linked to housing and corporate profits.

In the euro area, non-labour incomes represent
about one third of household disposable income
(see Graph I.5). Since household capital income
includes incomes from housing services, i.e. actual
rents and imputed rents in the case of owneroccupied housing, the share tends to be higher in
countries with a large share of homeownership
(e.g. France and Italy). (9) A parallel decline in
households' labour and capital incomes could

The housing component has been shown to drive capital
incomes, see Rognlie, M. (2015). ‘Deciphering the fall and
rise in the net capital share: Accumulation or scarcity?’.
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring, pp. 1–69.
The ratio of housing capital and housing income has also
figured prominently in Piketty's analysis, see Piketty, T.
(2013). Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press.

Developments in labour and non-labour incomes
describe pre-tax variables, which limits the validity
of conclusions in an environment that is
characterised
by
substantial
redistribution
mechanisms. During the economic and financial
crisis,
increased
social
transfers
(e.g.
unemployment benefits) and lower taxes raised the
importance of secondary incomes for households.
In national accounts, the transfers paid and
received and the taxes on income enter the
calculation of household disposable income.
Empirical studies find that income redistribution
by governments is not a major long-term driver of
household disposable incomes, (11) but it is an
important factor in short-term analysis.
Recently, private consumption has closely
followed households' disposable incomes

According to economic theory, households
accumulate and deplete their wealth to keep their
planned consumption spending roughly steady.
Thus, aggregate consumption should be roughly
proportional to the sum of current wealth and
expected future non-property income.
In the short term, changes in household disposable
income, deflated by the private consumption
deflator, are associated with GDP, deflated with

Real gross disposable income

As regards the causality from incomes to GDP, a
lower wage share can be expected to have a
negative impact on private consumption because
the propensity to consume associated with labour
income tends to be higher than that of non-labour
income. As the profit share increases accordingly,
the impact on investment should be positive. The
impact on net trade should also be positive. Lower
private consumption depresses imports of goods
and services, whereas a lower wage share
corresponds with a fall in unit labour costs that
raises, all other things being equal, the price
competitiveness of exporters. The overall impact
on GDP will depend on the characteristics of the
economy looked at.

Private consumption

Concerning the impact of changes in disposable
incomes on private consumption, subcomponents
such as labour income, non-labour income and
secondary income are likely to differ in terms of
marginal propensity to consume. Nonetheless,
recent developments in the euro area point to a co-

12

movement in real disposable incomes and private
consumption (see Graph I.7).
The personal distribution of incomes has
become more unequal in the euro area...

To capture the impact of distributional factors on
macroeconomic variables, it is important to extend
the analysis to the personal distribution of
incomes, which sheds light on the inequality
within wages. Empirical analyses of market
incomes in advanced economies point to
substantial increases at the top of the income
distribution and a falling income share at the
bottom of the distribution. This is also true in the
euro area, where the income share of the top
quintile of incomes has increased in recent years
and the bottom quintile has declined.

which is a measure of the statistical dispersion of
incomes. A Gini coefficient of zero implies full
equality while a coefficient of one shows complete
inequality. However, the inequality of disposable
incomes before transfer (market incomes) is
cushioned by transfers and therefore the inequality
of disposable incomes is more limited (see
Graph I.8). A substantial role in the more equal
distribution of disposable incomes stems from the
inclusion of pensions, in other words, differences
between pre-transfer and post-transfer incomes can
only be partly attributed to contemporaneous fiscal
policy.

EA and EU outlook

Until the economic and financial crisis, the
development of median net incomes of those
earning above and below 40% or 60% of the
overall median net income has moved in parallel,
but since 2010 some divergence has been
observed. Median incomes have been falling in the
group with incomes below 40% of the area’s
median income (see Graph I.9).
Graph I.9: Median net income in selected income
groups, euro area, 2005-2014

contribute to the explanation of increasing (pretax) inequality. (16) While rising employment is
usually expected to reduce income inequality as
the number of people earning a salary increases,
the gradual decline of standard full-time jobs could
endanger this effect. In addition, ‘financialisation’,
i.e. the rapid growth of the financial sector, favours
high-skilled
workers
(‘college
premia’).
Differences across advanced economies suggest
that common (international) factors can only partly
explain changes in inequality, whereas countryspecific factors remain important.

What are the main drivers of income inequality
and changes therein? A number of factors have
been related to changes in income inequality.(13)
Among them are elements of globalisation
(cheaper
transport,
improved
automation,
improved
and
cheaper
communication
technologies), which has pushed labour-saving
technologies and offshoring on manufacturers and
raised the skill premium, i.e. incomes for workers
with higher educational attainment grew faster (see
Graph I.10). New information technology has
raised productivity over the years and raised the
demand for skilled labour over low and unskilled
labour, which widened the gap between high and
low household incomes. (14) Moves from
productive activities to rent-seeking, as well as
market structure (e.g. monopoly power) have also
been identified as drivers of income inequality. (15)
Changes in labour market institutions (e.g. less
bargaining power of trade unions, wider spread
between minimum and median wage) can pose
challenges particularly for low-skill workers and

…seen as impacting negatively on the pace of
economic growth…

While early work on the nexus of income
inequality and economic growth has focussed on
how economic growth would raise inequality in
the early stages of economic development and
reduce it later, (17) most recent contributions have
focussed on the opposite direction, asking how
rising inequality could dampen growth.
Changes in income inequality affect growth via a
number of channels. Households on the losing side
of rising inequality may have a stronger preference
for redistribution (endogenous fiscal policy
argument), which could impact negatively on the
profitability of investment projects and impact
negatively on investment. (18) Households with
lower incomes could also respond by lowering
investment in their human capital (less education

and training); financial market imperfections could
make such a development more severe (human
capital accumulation argument). (19) An increased
number of low-income households could become a
drag on domestic demand, hampering the adoption
of advanced technology. (20) By contrast, increased
inequality could strengthen incentives to strive
harder to earn high incomes, for instance by taking
more risks and working harder.
The difficulties in assessing the impact of
increased inequality can be illustrated by the
propensity to consume. Low-income households
usually have a higher marginal consumption
propensity (up to subsistence level, they would not
be able to save). This implies that a less equal
distribution of a given income could raise the total
marginal propensity to consume. (21) But increasing
income inequality resulting entirely from increased
incomes of high-income households would lower
the total marginal propensity to consume. Thus, a
key question in the analysis of the impact of
distributional factors is to what extent an increase
in per-capita GDP ‘trickles down’ to real
disposable incomes across the distribution.

distribution can be expected to be larger for
permanent rather than transitory shocks, but in the
short term, households face uncertainty concerning
the nature of a shock. This complicates
assessments of the impact of changes in inequality
in the context of a short-term forecast, as the
impact of higher inequality may differ in the short
and longer term. (23)
The personal distribution of wealth is more
unequal than that of incomes…

Economic
theory
suggests
that
private
consumption is driven by total (permanent)
income, which is the present value of expected
lifetime resources. This suggests looking not only
at current incomes but also at the wealth of
households, which includes physical wealth
(financial assets and housing wealth) but also
human wealth (i.e. current labour income and the
discounted value of expected future labour
income). Capturing all these components is a
difficult task due to a lack of adequate data.

70

Apart from the standard redistribution schemes
that mitigate market income inequality, (22)
discretionary measures during the crisis also had a
potential to affect the personal income distribution.
However, the impact of fiscal stimulus on income
distribution is difficult to quantify as output effects
are benefitting all households, whereas some
discretionary measures could have exerted a quite
progressive (cutting taxes and boosting transfers to
low-income households) or regressive (cutting
income taxes across the board) impact.

EA and EU outlook

more uneven than the distribution of income (see
Graph I.11).
The more unequal wealth distribution can be
associated with the observation that only a small
share of households owns financial wealth.
Inequality is also attributable to the long-term
accumulation of wealth, which implies that many
older people tend to have substantially more
wealth than younger people. Moreover, the
possibility of negative financial wealth widens the
span of wealth positions. (25) In particular, in the
wake of the crisis, debt overhangs and
deleveraging have become important features in
wealth analysis. A special role in that regard is
attributed to housing wealth, which for many
households is the dominant financial asset, subject
to house prices changes. The role of housing
wealth is also key to explaining the substantial
difference in wealth distribution across euro area
economies.
In the short run, variations of wealth reflect mostly
the valuation of financial assets and house prices.
Monetary policy, which affects asset prices
through the interest rate, the availability of credit
or directly through asset purchases may thus affect
wealth inequality in the short term. (26) However,
the focus on the impact on asset prices and asset
owners risks overlooking the overall impact of
monetary policy, which, for instance by affecting
output and employment, also matters income and
wealth across the whole distribution.(27)
…with wealth effects on economic growth
mainly originating from financial wealth.

A permanent increase in wealth raises the expected
lifetime income and should thereby lift
consumption. This increase could stem from
additional possessions but also from valuation
effects, e.g. due to higher asset prices. Empirical
studies have confirmed a positive impact of
changes in wealth on private consumption in the
euro area, highlighting the strong impact found for
financial wealth, whereas changes in housing

wealth have small of even insignificant effects. (28)
By contrast, in the UK housing wealth has strong
effects, to some extent related to mechanisms of
mortgage equity withdrawal. (29)
The aggregate wealth effects on economic growth
depend also on the distribution of wealth.
Following a shock to their wealth, the propensity
to consume is expected to be higher for less
wealthy households than for more wealthy ones.
Empirical studies for the euro area, have recently
confirmed this presumption. (30)
Distributional factors are affecting the outlook,
but more over the medium term

Near-term economic forecasts regularly cover
wage negotiations, increases in compensation,
changes in the labour force and changes in
employment as drivers of the main aggregates such
as consumption and investment as well as
inflation. Distributional factors have been found to
play a substantial role in explaining the
development of these key macroeconomic
variables. Implications of higher economic
inequality can in particular be associated with
differences in the spending habits of different
income groups. However, in practice the
assessment of the short-term impact is complicated
by the fact that many different influences generally
overlap. For instance, the wealth distribution and
wealth effects on spending behaviour need to be
taken into account. Moreover, the focus of most of
the empirical studies of these linkages on the
medium to long run puts severe limits on the use of
distributional characteristics in short-term analysis.
Even though, ‘widening inequality is a very longterm trend, one that has been decades in the
making’ (Bernanke), near-term forecasts should
not be short-sighted to such developments. At the
current juncture, understanding shifts in income
distribution may for instance help to assess the
impact of swings in house and financial asset
prices on consumption and savings.

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The global economic outlook weakened further in
recent months amid heightened financial market
volatility and falling equity and commodity prices.
Prospects for many emerging markets remain
fragile with the downturn across these economies
now looking likely to continue for longer than
expected in the winter due to renewed commodity
price declines, tightening financial conditions and
a host of homegrown vulnerabilities. At the same
time, growth in a number of advanced economies,
including the US and Japan, disappointed towards
the end of last year, raising concerns about the
strength of their recoveries and further clouding
the global outlook. Principal risks to this outlook
relate to developments in China and their potential
spillovers to the rest of the world, the prospective
pace and impact of US monetary policy
normalisation, developments in commodity prices,
and ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts in
many parts of the world.

growth

Following a period of gradual slowdown among
emerging markets which began in 2011, global
economic growth (excluding the EU) likely fell to
3.2% in 2015, its slowest pace since 2009 (Graph
I.3), and is expected to recover only modestly in
2016 (3.3%) and 2017 (3.7%).

Over the forecast horizon, the projected pick-up in
global growth (excluding the EU) largely reflects
expectations of a very modest recovery in
emerging markets supported by stabilising
commodity prices, the progressive easing of
recessions in Brazil and Russia, and a gradual
pick-up in global trade flows (see Graph I.13).

The projected firming of global economic growth

assumptions, including (i) the stabilisation of
commodity prices, limited second-round effects
from the past declines and some rebound in
activity in commodity exporting countries, (ii) the
continuation of an orderly rebalancing and gradual
slowing of the Chinese economy, accompanied by
a progressive pick-up in Chinese import demand,
(iii) the absence of major financial market
upheavals related to the normalisation of US
monetary policy and (iv) resilient recovery in
advanced economies.

Overall, the global outlook has deteriorated in
recent months as growth expectations in advanced
economies (US, Japan) have been downgraded,
while recessions in Brazil and Russia have been
deeper-than-expected, and the rebound in most
other emerging economies has disappointed.

Recent data confirm the weakening momentum of
the global economy in late 2015 and early 2016.
Global GDP growth eased to around 0.7% q-o-q in
the fourth quarter of 2015, (31) from 0.8% in the
second and third quarters. This reflects a
combination of factors, including a stabilisation in
emerging market growth to just over 1% (q-o-q),
and a pronounced slowdown among advanced
economies. Quarter-on-quarter growth in the last
quarter of 2015 fell to just 0.3% in advanced
economies, markedly less than earlier in the year
and a two-year low. Forward looking indicators
point to a modest pick-up in activity in March, as
PMIs (Purchasing Managers’ Indices) in both
advanced and emerging markets moved up from
their February lows, with those in emerging

…as the recovery in advanced economies is
losing momentum…

Real GDP growth disappointed towards the end of
2015 in a number of advanced economies, notably
the US and Japan. In the US, growth was dragged
down by the sharp slump in the energy sector due
to the sustained fall in oil prices, weak net exports,
reflecting sluggish demand in the rest of the world,
an appreciating US dollar, and an adjustment in
inventories. While the contraction in the energy
sector is likely to level off as oil prices stabilise,
weak external demand and the inventory cycle will
likely continue to weigh on growth for some time.

Domestic demand remains robust, thanks to low
oil prices, solid employment growth and rising
wages, all of which are supporting private
consumption and residential investment. This
should continue to sustain the US recovery over
the forecast horizon, even though the sharp fall in
unemployment rates and the closure of the output
gap are clear signs of a maturing cycle and limited
scope for further accelerating growth.
In Japan, the pronounced weakness in domestic
demand towards the end of the year largely reflects
lacklustre private consumption as nominal wage
growth and real household incomes have so far
failed to pick up consistently. Although monetary
policy remains accommodative, real GDP growth
is not expected to increase markedly over the
forecast horizon, as planned fiscal consolidation
measures will add some volatility to the profile of
private consumption and investment.
All in all, economic growth in advanced
economies (including the EU) is now expected to
remain stable at annual rates of 2.0% over the
forecast horizon. This is lower than previously
forecast and largely reflects stronger external
headwinds, most notably from the slowdown in
emerging markets.

17

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

…the downturn in emerging markets is easing
only gradually…

Growth in emerging markets fell to 3.8% in 2015,
their weakest annual rate since 2009. Little
improvement is expected in 2016 but a mild
rebound to 4.4% in 2017 is forecast as the
recessions under way in Brazil and Russia ease and
other emerging markets make progress in cyclical
and structural adjustments.
Several factors are weighing heavily on the
outlook for emerging market economies. These
include the slowdown and rebalancing in China
and the associated weakening of global trade
flows, low commodity prices and a host of
domestic and geopolitical vulnerabilities. Another
factor is the tightening of financial conditions,
most recently reflected in the rise of sovereign and
corporate yields, falling equity prices, and net
capital outflows from several emerging market
economies. (32)
While prospects vary across countries, the outlook
remains fragile and is subject to increased
uncertainty. Over the forecast horizon, some of the
biggest emerging markets are expected to continue
facing deep adjustment crises. These include
Russia and Brazil, where recessions are projected
to extend into 2016 before marginal growth
resumes in 2017. Most countries in the Middle
East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and
emerging Asia are set to face a difficult
macroeconomic and financial environment in
2016. Commodity prices have fallen sharply and
financial conditions have tightened amid rising
financial volatility and capital outflows. This in
turn raises concerns about financial stability,
particularly where there are high levels of foreigncurrency
denominated
debt.
Moreover,
deleveraging in the private sector and fiscal
contraction are likely to weigh on economic
growth and further depress confidence.
…and the rebalancing in China continues to
weigh on growth.

In China, the gradual slowdown in growth
observed so far is expected to continue as the
economy shifts from investment- to consumptionled growth. This transition has substantial
implications for the structure of Chinese trade and

is expected to continue weighing both on global
trade flows and commodity prices. Recent data
releases and policy announcements, including
short-term stimulus measures and the renewed
commitment to market-oriented reform, support
the view that the ongoing transition process
remains under control. Buoyant growth in a
number of sectors (services, consumption) seems
to be sufficiently strong to compensate for
recessionary developments elsewhere, and the
Chinese authorities remain committed to provide
short-term stimulus if needed. Nevertheless, the
challenges associated with the necessary correction
of major imbalances (overcapacity in heavy
industries, over-indebtedness) remain pressing and
entail considerable risks of a sharper and more
disruptive slowdown. An extended period of
capital outflows and exchange rate pressures
reflects major uncertainty associated with China’s
adjustment process, even though some of these
pressures have recently abated. Hence, downside
risks to the outlook dominate and largely relate to
the capacity of the authorities to steer the transition
process successfully, finding the right balance
between measures to stabilise near-term growth
while maintaining financial stability and advancing
with necessary structural reforms.
Global trade to remain sluggish

Following a sharp contraction early last year and a
mid-year rebound, global trade flows remain
depressed (see Graph I.15), largely reflecting
weaker demand from China, Russia, Brazil and
other commodity exporting economies. (33) Last
year's 3% contraction in Chinese goods import
volumes was the first on record. However, for the
year as a whole, world goods imports were up by
1.5% in volume terms, as the decline in emerging
markets (-1.4%) was more than offset by solid
growth in advanced economies’ imports (3.6%).
During 2015 and early 2016, Chinese trade flows
were consistent with the ongoing rebalancing away
from manufacturing (as reflected in the weak
imports of commodities, capital and investment
goods), towards services, whose imports have seen
annual growth rates of close to 20%.

Outside China, trade weakened most for
commodity exporters (both advanced and
emerging) (34) and for the countries most exposed
to China. But trade developments also
disappointed in major advanced economies,
including the United States, where the US dollar’s
steady appreciation weighed heavily on trade flows
during the second half of 2015. A sharp terms-oftrade adjustment, triggered by the collapse in
commodity prices, has depressed export values and
import demand across much of the CIS, Latin
America, MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa. In some
cases, this is exacerbated by home-grown
vulnerabilities and regional conflicts, capital
outflows and currency depreciation, and
compounded further by the sharp drop in demand
from China.
Globally (excluding the EU), the growth rate for
imports of goods and services likely bottomed out
at an estimated 0.5% in 2015, their lowest level
since 2009 (Graph I.16). Russia and Brazil jointly
subtracted as much as 0.8 pps. from growth while
China’s contribution was just a fraction of what
has been in previous years. Excluding the EU,
world import growth is expected to firm to 2.1%
and 3.4% in 2016 and 2017, mainly driven by the
assumed stabilisation of commodity prices, the
gradual recoveries expected in Brazil and Russia,
and some normalisation of trade flows in China
accompanied by the ensuing pick-up in emerging
Asia (see Graph I.17). In 2016, however, slowing
import demand in the US is expected to be a major
factor offsetting these improvements.

Headed? Output Growth in the Aftermath of the
Commodity Boom’. In World Economic Outlook (IMF),

Despite the projected rebound, trade flows are set
to remain relatively weak over the forecast
horizon, including as a share of global output, and
especially when compared to pre-crisis trends.
This largely reflects the lower trade intensity
assumed to prevail in emerging markets, where
trade and its responsiveness to growth has been
slowing for a number of years, partly due to the
maturation of global value chains, structural
changes in China and the slower pace of trade
liberalisation. (35)

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Commodity prices are set to stabilise at a low
level

One implication of the deteriorated global outlook
has been the marked broad-based decline in
commodity prices to very low levels. As regards
oil prices, the related demand aspects have added
to the impact of burgeoning supply that had
initially been identified as the dominating factor
behind the decline since mid-2014. (36)
After hitting a new cycle low of 28 USD/bbl. in
January 2016, Brent oil prices recovered to over
USD 40/bbl. in March-April amid increased
volatility. The recovery of Brent spot prices was
supported by a slight tightening of supply based on
lower OPEC and non-OPEC output. Output losses
in some OPEC members were only partly offset by
rising Iranian production. While pumping near
record volumes, Russia and Saudi Arabia kept the
output stable during February-March as foreseen in
their agreement with Qatar and Venezuela to
freeze their oil production at January levels.
Further attempts to reach a global deal on curbing
oil production failed at a meeting in Qatar in April,
but its negative impact on prices was outweighed
by supply outages in Kuwait, Nigeria and
Venezuela. Non-OPEC supplies, including the US,
have been declining since December. However, the
IEA does not expect a strong recovery of oil
prices, as the supply surplus is set to diminish only
gradually throughout 2016. High levels of stocks
and concerns over economic growth in emerging
markets are likely to keep a cap on price pressures.
Oil prices are assumed to rebound moderately over
the forecast horizon (see Graph I.18). Due to the
decline observed until January, the average annual
oil price is assumed to fall further this year (from
53.4 USD/bbl. in 2015 to 41.1) before rising next
year (to 45.9). This implies an upward revision of
the technical assumptions with respect to the
winter forecast. In euro terms, the oil price
assumption has been revised up by 10.5% in 2016
and 3.4% in 2017 as compared to the winter
forecast.
Uncertainty
surrounding
these
assumptions remains high.
The prices of other commodities also fell sharply
in 2015 and are likely to fall further in 2016, albeit
at a slower pace. Despite a sharp rally of some
metal prices in February and March, the near-term
(36)

Recent ECB estimates confirmed that the initial decline can
mostly be explained by supply increases. See ECB (2016).
‘Current oil price trends’. ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 2,
Box 2, pp. 38–39.

outlook for most industrial commodities remains
bleak. Ample supply and the projected weakening
demand outlook from emerging economies suggest
a further decline in metal prices in 2016. In 2017,
diminishing oversupply and the pass-through from
recovering energy prices provide arguments in
favour of some price stabilisation.

Food prices are expected to continue their
downward trend in 2016 due to sufficient
production, comfortable levels of stocks for most
commodities and low energy costs. In particular,
large harvests in the US and in the southern
hemisphere have improved the supply outlook for
wheat, maize and soya beans. This outlook is
subject to the risk of adverse weather conditions
associated with El Niño.
Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the
downside and have increased

The balance of risks to the global outlook remains
tilted to the downside and has deteriorated further
in recent months. Developments in China remain
at the forefront of concerns. The impact of
volatility in Chinese financial markets on the
domestic economy looks limited, although the
recent spillovers from developments in Chinese
equity and foreign exchange market to global
financial markets expose the potential strength of
this transmission channel. Given the size of the
Chinese economy and its key role in many
commodity markets, ongoing structural shifts in
the real economy could generate further
uncertainty. In particular, any signs that GDP
growth may be slowing more than expected or of a
prolonged weakness in Chinese import demand
could have major negative consequences for

EA and EU outlook

commodity prices, world trade, and investor
confidence. (37)
There remain significant risks associated with the
prospective pace of US monetary policy
normalisation. Combined with uncertainties
surrounding developments in China, monetary
policy measures in the US could have a more
negative impact on emerging market economies
than envisaged in the central scenario, particularly
in those countries with high levels of foreign
currency-denominated corporate debt. Lower
economic growth in emerging market economies
would not only endanger the expected rebound in
global activity and world trade, it could also affect
the stability of financial markets. Yet, the weaker
outlook for the US may lead to a slower pace of
monetary policy normalisation than previously
expected, and would thus mitigate some of the
concerns over monetary policy divergence. This
could reduce some of the risks associated with
rising interest rates in the US. Nevertheless,
concerns about the strength of the US recovery
could also feed into renewed market uncertainty
about the future course of policy action and trigger
more volatile market reactions.
Additional downside risks are related to
commodity price assumptions where, for instance,
a further slump in prices could aggravate the
downturn in emerging markets in general and
commodity exporting regions in particular.
Stronger-than-expected second round effects from
the fall in commodity prices seen so far could
result in a more severe tightening of the fiscal
stance and lower domestic demand, which would
accentuate the downturn and limit the scope for a
rebound in 2016 and 2017.
Finally, geopolitical risks remain high, particularly
with respect to the conflicts in the Middle East,
parts of Northern Africa and Ukraine.
(37)

The impact of a Chinese import shock in 2016-17 could be
substantial as recent estimates suggest; see Kireyev, A. and
A. Leonidov (2016). ‘China’s Imports Slowdown:
Spillovers, Spillins, and Spillbacks.’ IMF Working Paper

FINANCIAL MARKETS

In early 2016, volatility in financial markets rose
as investors became more risk averse in response
to increased concerns about a global slowdown.
Stock markets across the world were affected (see
Graph I.19). More recently, these concerns were
reduced by some positive data releases,
rebounding oil prices, and expectations of
additional monetary policy easing in Europe and
delayed normalisation in the US. However,
volatility is still elevated. Overall, these
developments highlighted the reliance of the
economic recovery on monetary policies and the
key role of financial markets.

New monetary easing measures in the euro
area…

In March, the ECB announced monetary policy
measures, supplementing those taken last year (e.g.
at the January and December meetings) to further
ease funding conditions for banks and companies
while also stimulating bank lending to businesses.
In addition to lowering its key policy interest rates
further, the asset purchase programme was
extended and new tools were introduced. Rate cuts
affected the ECB’s main refinancing operations
(MRO, -5 bps. to 0%), the deposit facility (-10 bps.
to -0.4%), and the marginal lending facility
(-5 bps. to 0.25%). Monthly purchases under the
asset purchase programme (APP) were increased
from €60 billion to €80 billion and the list of assets
eligible for regular purchases was extended to
include investment grade euro-denominated bonds
issued by non-bank corporations established in the
euro area. In addition, the ECB announced a new
series of four targeted longer-term refinancing

years. The TLTROs allow banks to borrow at zero
rates and to obtain a rebate of 40 bps. if they meet
a lending benchmark by January 2018.

considered a rate hike to be more likely than not
over the committee’s forecast horizon.

These measures are expected to ease monetary
conditions through several channels. The lower
negative policy rate and the new bank liquiditysupport measures are expected to improve the
transmission of monetary policy to the real
economy through both banks and financial
markets. The increased amount of monthly
purchases and the inclusion of non-bank corporate
bonds in the list of assets eligible for purchases
under the APP should ease financing conditions
for the non-financial sector directly and possibly
also indirectly, through portfolio effects, thus
complementing the transmission through the
banking sector.

Market participants’ reassessment of the relative
monetary policy trajectories of the ECB and the
US Federal Reserve have been felt on foreign
exchange markets. After fluctuating in early 2016,
the euro recently has trended higher against the US
dollar, but depreciated against the yen. In nominal
effective terms, the euro has strengthened on the
back of continued weakness in the currencies of
most emerging and commodity-exporting countries
(see Graph I.20). Another factor has been a slide in
the pound sterling that market participants have
attributed to uncertainty ahead of the UK
referendum on EU membership in June.

…but less global monetary policy divergence
than previously expected…

Monetary policy outside the euro area has recently
either eased further or been characterised by
delayed tightening. It has therefore diverged less
than expected in the winter.

Member States outside the euro area and in Japan.

to -0.50%) in February and decided in mid-April to
continue purchasing a further SEK 45 billion of
government bonds during the second half of 2016.
The Hungarian central bank also lowered its policy
rates in March to new historically low levels. In
January, the Bank of Japan eased further by
introducing for the first time a negative policy rate
(-0.10%) amid increasing risks that low oil prices
and uncertainty in emerging and commodityexporting countries could delay Japan’s escape
from a ‘deflationary mind-set.’
Expectations of monetary policy tightening
(normalisation) were recently pushed back in the
US and in the UK. At its January and March
meetings, the US Federal Reserve’s FOMC
announced that it would proceed cautiously in
adjusting monetary policy, emphasising the risks
that foreign economic and financial development
since the turn of the year would restrain US
economic activity. At its April meeting, the Bank
of England’s Monetary Policy Committee left its
monetary policy stance unchanged but said that it

Market conditions continue to support the
economic recovery…

The initial financial market losses in early 2016
were broad-based, affecting different market
segments. For instance, the general risk aversion
and renewed concerns over the sovereign-banking
sector nexus created upward pressure on bond
spreads in the periphery. Corporate bond spreads
increased substantially (Graph I.21), while EU
stock markets fell sharply. The financial sector
underperformed the broader market significantly
amid growing concerns about the profitability
prospects of banks in low or negative interest rate
environments.

Since mid-February, however, markets have turned
on speculation about further monetary policy

…bank lending shows robust expansion,
supported by declining lending rates…

The very accommodative policy stance of the ECB
has resulted in very favourable monetary and
credit conditions for borrowers in the euro area.
Both narrow and broad money supply has been
growing at high rates and the recovery in bank
credit flows to the real economy is spreading
across euro area countries, albeit from relatively
low levels. Since mid-March and up to mid-April,
the three-month Euribor declined further while the
three-month Euribor-OIS spread, a measure of
interbank market stress, narrowed.

In equity markets, volatility has receded somewhat
in recent weeks compared to the first weeks of the
year. But banking shares have not fully caught up
with other market segments (see Graph I.23). This
reflects structural factors such as the persistence of
high levels of non-performing loans, but also an
adjustment
process
towards
regulatory
requirements such as the ‘bailing in’ of creditors,
stipulated in the Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive (BRRD).

Net bank lending flows to households and nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) has remained
positive over the last few months. The annual
growth rate of loans to the private sector recovered
further into positive territory along with the
economic cycle. Survey-based signs are consistent
with these developments in lending. The ECB’s
latest Bank Lending Survey (April 2016) indicates
improving loan supply conditions for businesses
and increasing loan demand across all loan
categories. (38) However, credit standards on loans
to households for house purchases tightened. The
ECB’s Survey on Access to Finance of Enterprises
(SAFE) suggests further loosening of funding
constraints to SMEs.
As banks have been passing on their favourable
funding conditions, bank lending has been
supported by lower interest rates for NFCs and
households. This suggests that the transmission of
monetary policy through the euro area banking
system has improved. An important development

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

for the economic outlook is that there were
pronounced declines in bank lending rates across
vulnerable Member States and this includes rates
for smaller loans, typically taken by SMEs. Hence,
discrepancies in lending rates between vulnerable
and other euro area countries have narrowed
further while the interest rate spread between large
and small loans, which had significantly widened
during the financial crisis, has also narrowed for
most countries over the last year.

bank lending rates have progressively declined.

The take-up of loans in response to falling interest
rates has been more heterogeneous. For SMEs, the
latest data indicate that the biggest rise in lending
volumes have not occurred where interest rates
have fallen most (see Graph I.24). For instance,
small loan volumes have risen only modestly in
Italy and Portugal where the decline in interest
rates has been large. This suggests that other nonprice supply side factors, such as high levels of
non-performing loans (NPL) (39) and/or weak
demand remain important in some countries. This
points to the risk of subdued bank-based credit
intermediation in these countries.

Euro area banks continued to repair their balance
sheets but remained challenged by low profitability
in an operating environment of low interest rates
and low nominal economic growth. In fact, by
lowering the borrowing costs for the real economy,
unconventional monetary policy appears to have
compressed banks’ net interest margins. The
impact on bank profitability, however, is difficult
to estimate, because it depends on the ability of
banks to pass on costs through the re-pricing of
loans, deposits and other liabilities. (40)

Compared to a year ago, the attractiveness of bank

more volatile over the last couple of months. After
widening over most of 2015, corporate bond
spreads narrowed sharply in March this year after

According to a recent IMF estimate, the amount of NPL

900 bill, which is almost 10% of GDP. See IMF (2016).
Global Financial Stability Report. Washington, DC, April,
p.33.

Heightened market volatility and risk-aversion
translated into negative net issuance of corporate
bonds in December 2015 and January 2016. The
narrowing of corporate bond spreads in the wake
of the ECB decisions in March created an
opportunity to increase issuance. Several
companies used it, suggesting that corporates are
responsiveness to price signals in the bond
markets. Meanwhile, equity issuance, while
starting from low levels two years ago, has been
more resilient over the last couple of months
despite deteriorating conditions.

Looking forward, the cycle of external corporate
funding is expected to pick up further, thanks to
both bank lending and market funding. Currently,

to the relative improvement of price conditions for
bank lending compared with market funding from
a year ago.
All in all, the stance of monetary policy suggests
easy financing conditions over the forecast
horizon. To what extent firms will use bank credit
or market financing will depend on the prevailing
price conditions for the various funding
instruments. The latest ECB decisions provide
support to both bank lending (via the new
TLTROs) and market funding (via an extended list
of assets eligible for the APP). Market interest rate
expectations, which are reflected in the
assumptions underlying this forecast, remain low.
As the economic recovery progresses, the use of
internal funds is expected to gradually decline.
Nevertheless, corporates’ net funding position may
remain positive as the deleveraging process in the
euro area corporate sector continues.

GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS

For more than a year, the euro area has been
benefitting from a combination of favourable
factors such as low oil prices, a depreciating euro,
additional supportive monetary policy measures,
and an increase in public expenditure. In the last
six months, however, headwinds stemming from
the deterioration in the external environment and
in particular from emerging markets have come to
the fore, partially offsetting the positive impact of
these tailwinds. As a result, the economic recovery
in the euro area has remained moderate.

economic output still slightly below the pre-crisis
peak. For the whole year 2015, GDP rose by 1.7%
in the euro area (2.0% in the EU), its fastest rate
since 2010. This comes after several years of very
subdued and fragile growth, (41) in line with the
typical features of recoveries after deep economic
and financial crisis (the Reinhart-Rogoff case) and
certain euro area and EU-specific factors. (42)
The main driver of GDP growth in 2015 was
domestic demand, which rose on the back of rising
private consumption (see Graph I.26). With a
strong increase in household real gross disposable
income and some improvements in the labour
market, private consumption rose significantly.
Investment, by contrast, was rather subdued
despite an unexpected acceleration at the end of
the year. Lower growth momentum in the external
environment, high uncertainty and corporate
deleveraging restrained investment decisions. Net
trade detracted slightly from GDP growth, mainly
reflecting the slowdown in emerging market
economies.

The strength of the tailwinds will be decisive for
the continuation of the economic upswing. While
some of them are expected to continue supporting
the recovery in the short term, the effect of some
of these factors is expected to diminish over the
forecast horizon. Since the winter forecast, oil
prices have risen slightly and the euro has
appreciated somewhat. Over the same time,
however, monetary policy has become even more
accommodative and the fiscal stance has been
slightly expansionary.
GDP growth gained momentum last year…

According to the latest national accounts data,
economic growth continued last year at a moderate
pace. In the fourth quarter, GDP expanded 0.3%
(q-o-q) in the euro area (0.4% in the EU). This was
slightly lower than projected in winter and left

scale Investment Plan for Europe helped to
brighten the outlook. (43) In spring 2015, optimism
about growth further rose as the beneficial impact
of the ECB’s expanded APP on funding costs and
access to credit became visible. (44) In autumn
2015, the boost to euro area growth was regarded
as strong enough to offset the initial impact of
weaker global trade momentum and a deteriorating
external environment, in particular as additional
refugee-related expenditures provided additional
growth stimulus in some countries. (45) However,
headwinds became stronger, partially offsetting the
positive impact from an extension of the period
with tailwinds, so that in the winter the outlook
had slightly worsened and the downside risks to
the outlook had markedly increased. (46)

The balance of tailwinds, headwinds and crisis
legacy factors remains favourable...

A new balance of tailwinds and headwinds is
expected to develop over the forecast horizon.
Overall, the previously identified tailwinds are
expected to provide some further support to
economic growth, but this support is expected to
fade, while the headwinds identified in the winter
forecast remain in place or become stronger.
Oil prices appear to have stabilised somewhat.
After hitting a 12-year low in January, they have
slightly rebounded. As a result, oil price
assumptions have been revised up, but oil prices
remain at rather low levels. The renewed oil price
drop in January is set to delay the rebound in
inflation rates, extending the boost to household
purchasing power and corporate profitability.
Concerns that the weakening earlier in the year
could have been a harbinger of a further slowing in
the world economy have recently receded in line
with the release of more positive data. The positive
overall effect of declining oil prices on global
economic activity may be smaller than previously
expected, (47) but for the EU and the euro area, oil
prices remain growth-supportive. The development

The need to keep into consideration the low-interest rate
environment had been stressed early on. It has recently
been iterated, e.g. by e.g. Obstfeld, M., R. Arezki and G.
M. Milesi-Ferretti (2016). ‘Oil prices and the global
economy: It’s complicated’. VoxEU Column, 13 April.

Monetary and financing conditions remain
favourable for borrowers. The ECB’s very
accommodative monetary policy has improved
access to credit and lowered funding costs, with
the latter also reflected in the development of
interest rate assumptions (see Graph I.28).

The euro remains at a relatively low level
compared to previous years, which is also evident
from developments in the exchange rate
assumptions (see Graph I.29). However, support
from a lower euro exchange rate can mainly be
expected from some lagged effects as the euro has
recently appreciated slightly. As a result of capital
outflows from emerging markets, their currencies
have depreciated, and the outlook for a less
asynchronous monetary policy in different regions
of the world also supported the strength of the
euro. Nevertheless, the relatively weak euro should
continue exerting a positive, though decreasing
impact on exports and economic growth.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Fiscal policy is expected to remain growth
supportive this year. Refugee-related expenditures
have increased strongly in the past quarters in
some Member States and this is projected to
continue even without additional large inflows of
asylum seekers.

Domestic headwinds have also come to the fore.
The unprecedented increase in the inflow of
asylum seekers last year has put a strain on some
Member States. Some of them have unilaterally reintroduced temporary border controls within the
Schengen zone, which could affect negatively
foreign trade (e.g. distortion of cross-border
transport, waiting time for commuters). (48) The
impact on economic activity at the aggregate level
is set to depend on the extent of such measures, but
also on whether joint EU decisions are reached,
and the impact this has on confidence.

17

In some Member States, reforms, including labour
market reforms, should continue to bear fruit in the
form of continued employment gains.
...despite being dampened by several growth
impediments.

Legacies from the crisis are also expected to
continue weighing on growth. They include high
public debt, which limits the options for fiscal
policy responses; high household debt, which
weighs on domestic demand; and high nonfinancial corporate debt, which induces
deleveraging in the private sector with adverse
knock-on effects on economic activity. Moreover,
high unemployment in some euro area Member
States hampers human capital accumulation while
low investment delays capital accumulation. As a
result, the crisis legacies continue to weaken
potential output growth (cf. Box I.4).
Since mid-2015, a number of external and
domestic headwinds have come to the fore. They
already put a lid on economic growth last year and
are expected to continue weighing on growth over
the forecast horizon.
External headwinds are stemming from the
slowdown in emerging market economies and also
more recently from some advanced economies.
Their impact on GDP growth is mainly evident in
euro area and EU export growth and uncertainty
related to recent bouts of financial market turmoil.

28

The further deterioration in the global outlook
implies a negative impact from these headwinds on
GDP growth. The expected rebound outside the
EU should, however, lower their impact towards
the end of the forecast horizon. In particular,
investment should benefit from the expected global
recovery.

The impact on confidence of increased security
concerns is set to weigh on the growth outlook
particularly in some Member States. In some cases
e.g. France and Belgium, this adds to the economic
impact of terrorist attacks and increased securityrelated spending.
Mixed signals for the near-term outlook...

The increased uncertainty, reflected in the high
volatility of financial markets, the recent
appreciation of the euro and the slowdown in
emerging and advanced economies, is expected to
have weighed on economic growth early this year.
Recent data give conflicting indications about the
path of GDP growth in the first quarter.
On the one hand, survey data suggest weaker real
GDP growth momentum in the first quarter of
2016. Both the Commission’s Economic Sentiment
Indicator (ESI) and the composite output
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell in the first
quarter of 2016 from multi-year highs in the
previous quarter (see Graph I.30). The declines
confirmed that the manufacturing sector has taken
a hit from slow growth in the external
environment, mainly in the first two months as the
March readings signalled some stabilisation in
both the euro area and the EU. Confidence in the
services sector also fell but its reading was the
third highest since the recession in 2008-09 in both
the euro area and the EU. In the first quarter,
(48)

to the rules of the Schengen agreement, see Box I.3.

EA and EU outlook

sentiment in the construction continued rising to a
new post-recession high in the EU and came in at
the second highest level since the recession in the
euro area. Overall, both the Commission's
indicators and PMIs remained at high levels,
consistent with a continuation of the expansion in
activity in the near term.

and PMI Composite Output Index, EU

Putting the pieces together, the signals are for a
near-term continuation of the expansion, the
signals are mixed as regards its pace of the nearterm expansion. As survey indicators measure
more the breadth than the depth of developments,
it is difficult to quantify the impact of the decline
in sentiment indicators and its distribution over
time. As regards the first quarter of 2016, the
projected rate of real GDP growth in the euro area
(0.5% q-o-q) is sufficient to lift output for the first
time above the pre-crisis peak of 2008.

On the other hand, hard data suggest slightly
higher growth than in the previous quarter. In
January and February, industrial production in the
euro area was on average 1.1% higher than the
average in the last quarter of 2015 (see
Graph I.31). The 3m-o-3m growth rate of new
industrial orders rose in January to 1.0% in the
euro area. In parallel, retail sales, a high-frequency
indicator of private consumption, in January and
February 2016 stood on average 0.8% above the
average recorded in the last quarter of 2015. The
strong increase in the growth rate of loans to
households for purposes other than house
purchases supports expectations of continued
domestic demand expansion (Graph I.32).

…and moderating growth projected in 2016
and 2017.

Overall, the euro area outlook for 2016 and 2017
has worsened somewhat since the winter, mainly
due to the intensified headwinds related to the
weakening of global growth. As inflation picks up,
the positive boost to real incomes from low
inflation, which provided strong support to
domestic demand last year, will also wane. While
these two factors conspire to slow economic
growth, other factors are paving the way for an
acceleration. These include ongoing improvements
in the labour market that will have a positive effect
on incomes, the slightly expansionary aggregate
fiscal stance, and the projected rebound in global
activity. As a result of the balance of these forces,
growth in the euro area is no longer projected to
gain pace over the forecast horizon. Rather, it is
expected to remain broadly stable at rates which
are low by historical standards, leaving the euro
area vulnerable to global shocks.
After having grown by 1.7% in 2015 (2.0% in the
EU, see Graph I.33), the euro area’s real GDP is
expected to grow by 1.6% in 2016 (1.8% in the
EU) and by 1.8% in 2017 (1.9%). This implies that
the economic recovery remains considerably

29

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

weaker than in previous upturns. (49) Potential
growth is expected to remain weak, reflecting the
aforementioned crisis legacies, but also slow total
factor productivity growth and demographic
factors. It is set to be at about 1% over 2016 and
2017. The negative output gap is therefore
expected to narrow over the forecast horizon.

Private consumption remains a key support for
growth…

Private consumption, which has been the main
contributor to GDP growth in the last two years,
moderated somewhat towards the end of last year.
In 2015, the income growth generated by the
ongoing improvement in the labour market along
with very low inflation pushed real gross
disposable incomes and provided the basis for the
strongest annual post-crisis expansion of private
consumption. A rebound in house prices and rising
asset prices supported household wealth, whereas
the growth in non-labour incomes was far more
modest. The slowing expansion in the fourth
quarter of last year reflected the impact of
relatively mild weather conditions on expenditures
for seasonal clothing and energy, a small uptick in
household savings, but also temporary factors such
as the Paris terrorist attacks in November.
…despite several short-term drags…

The drags that were behind the moderation
towards the end of last year are expected to prove
short-lived so that private consumption should
continue to remain the backbone of economic
growth. Nevertheless, drags to growth may still be
(49)

Area (European Commission – DG ECFIN) 14(3), pp. 6–

at work in the short term. Evidence can be seen in
the conflicting signals received in the first months
of this year.
On the downside, survey indicators have mostly
come in below the high levels of last year. The
Commission’s monthly Consumer Confidence
indicator decreased three times in the first quarter,
before picking up slightly in April according to the
flash estimate. Although the outcome in the first
quarter fell, the reading remained well above the
long-term average (see Graph I.34). In the first
quarter, consumers were more pessimistic about
the future general economic situation. Meanwhile
their views on future unemployment, which had
soared in the last quarter of 2015 in several
Member States due to the influx of asylum seekers,
broadly stabilised (and declined in the EU).
Consumers also appeared more confident about
making major purchases. In line with consumer
confidence, the Commission’s retail confidence
index fell in the first quarter, although it too
remained at high levels. In contrast, the PMI for
retail sales in the euro area remained broadly stable
in the first quarter compared to the previous
quarter.

On the upside, retail sales continued increasing in
the first two months of the year (on average 0.8%
higher than in the preceding quarter), following the
upward trajectory begun three years ago (see
Graph I.35). During these two months, new
passenger car registrations rose by 10.7% from the
corresponding months last year, supporting a
strengthening in private consumption growth.

In line with these developments, the annual growth
rate of loans to households continued to increase in
February to an annual rate of 1.6%, the highest rate
since October 2011. This mainly reflects the
growth of loans for house purchases (2.3% in
February), which account for more than 70% of
loans to households.
…based on continued real income growth.

Looking further ahead, private consumption should
continue to benefit from further improvements in
labour market conditions and wages, which are
expected to be not depressed by persistently low
levels of headline inflation (second round effects
in wage bargaining). These developments should
accelerate nominal disposable income growth.
Additionally, non-labour incomes (e.g. interest on
savings, dividend payments and rental income) are
also set to rise over the forecast horizon. Overall,
the growth in gross disposable income in the euro
area is expected to accelerate to 2.5% in 2016
(from 2.0% in 2015) and 2.7% in 2017. This
should lead to a strong increase in real gross
disposable income in 2016 when inflation is
expected to be very low and a slightly smaller
increase in 2017 when consumer price inflation
rebounds. This slowing expansion of real
disposable incomes (Graph I.36) will have a
limiting effect on the private consumption growth.
Evidence from the euro area suggests that
increases in financial and housing wealth will only
partially compensate for slower real labour income
growth. However, after several years of
deleveraging, household balance sheets should
become less of a drag on spending. Very low
interest rates and easier access to credit also imply
increased opportunities for re-negotiating loans
and lowering deleveraging needs.

Forecast numbers are de-annualised annual figures.

Household saving rates changed little last year
despite the rise in purchasing power but rates are
expected to pick up slightly this year before
slightly receding next year. The very low level of
interest rates is expected to spur higher savings by
households whose private pension plans and life
insurance schemes are negatively affected.
However, households overall are expected to
continue spending more or less in line with their
income rather than saving their windfall from oil
prices. This also reflects the unwinding of some
pent-up consumption demand after years of
subdued growth and high uncertainty.
Overall, for the remainder of this year and beyond,
the further expansion of disposable incomes should
support private consumption with some
moderation next year, mainly due to the higher
inflation. The growth rate is then expected to
moderate from 1.8% in 2016 in the euro area
(2.1% in the EU) to 1.5% in 2017 (1.8%). Private
consumption will therefore no longer outperform
overall economic growth next year.
Public consumption contributing to economic
growth

In 2015, public consumption is expected to have
risen by 1.3% in the euro area (1.4% in the EU),
twice the rate expected this time last year in the
2015 spring forecast. Exceptional developments
largely explain this outcome. Public security
measures, spending on military operations in Syria
and Iraq, and refugee-related expenditures have
strongly driven up public consumption in some
countries. In the last quarter of 2015, government
consumption grew 0.6% q-o-q. Overall, in 2015,
government consumption is expected to have
decreased in only three euro area Member States

31

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

(Ireland, Italy and Finland) and remained stable in
Greece.
Public consumption growth is projected to
continue rising in 2016 before decreasing again in
2017. The acceleration in 2016 mostly reflects
developments in Germany, Italy and the
Netherlands. Government consumption in the euro
area is expected to grow by 1.4% (1.5% in the EU)
and 1.2% (1.2%) in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In
2017, it is expected to continue contracting only in
Greece. The forecast for 2017, however, is
particularly dependent on the no-policy change
assumption, according to which consolidation
measures are only factored into the forecast if they
have been adopted and presented to national
parliaments or are known in sufficient detail.
Investment growth rebounded at the end of
last year…

Investment in the euro area surprised on the upside
in the last quarter of 2015, growing at its second
highest rate since mid-2011 (1.3% q-o-q) and
making a larger contribution to economic growth
than any other component. Both equipment and
construction investment played a role in this
acceleration, which was broad-based across
Member States. In assessing the sustainability of
the recent rebound, it is useful to look at main
contributors. In Germany, both equipment and
construction investment rebounded strongly. The
pick-up in equipment investment, however, was
driven by a very strong increase (about one quarter
of a percent of GDP) in public investment,
whereas private equipment investment declined
again slightly. In the Netherlands, the strong pickup was linked to buoyant sales of new cars and the
strong housing market. These observations suggest
a substantial role of temporary factors in the recent
acceleration of euro area investment.
The strong growth in the final quarter lifted the
annual rate for 2015 to its highest level since the
crisis, although the gap with pre-crisis levels
remained wide. Drivers were both equipment
investment and, for the first time since 2007,
construction investment. Developments across the
euro area remain very heterogeneous, with
construction investment still falling in half of the
Member States in 2015.

32

…but is expected to moderate in the near
term…

The short-term outlook is complicated by mixed
signals from survey indicators and hard data.
On the downside, the Commission’s surveys
suggest that investors have become less optimistic.
Confidence in the euro area was slightly lower in
all business sectors (industry, services, retail and
construction) in the first quarter of 2016 compared
to the previous quarter. In the construction sector,
confidence even fell again below its long-term
average. Similarly, both the manufacturing and
services PMIs decreased in the first quarter.
On the upside, the first hard data for the first
quarter of 2016 bode well for both equipment and
construction investment. As regards equipment
investment, the average monthly production of
capital goods increased in January and February by
1.9% from the average in the fourth quarter of last
year (0.9% in the EU). The expansion of industrial
new orders for capital goods increased in January
in the euro area. The rate of capacity utilisation in
the first quarter continued to rise and exceeded its
long-term average (see Graph I.37).

Hard data on construction continue to be
supportive of positive growth in construction
investment in the near term. The sector’s output
has in February increased by 1.4% (3m-o-3m) in
the euro area. Construction investment should also
benefit from the increase in the number of building
permits in the fourth quarter of 2015 (Graph I.38).
In line with this, the growth in loans for house
purchases, which in February was still rising in the
euro area, augurs well for the construction outlook.
However, flat house prices in the fourth quarter of
2015 as compared to the preceding quarter are

EA and EU outlook

somewhat at odds with the positive signals for
construction investment.

Looking beyond the short term, the factors for
higher investment growth appear to be in place
(e.g. favourable funding conditions, moderately
strengthening demand, above-average capacity
utilisation, and modernisation needs). The
favourable funding conditions for non-financial
corporations include lower bank lending costs and
less tight bank lending standards, improved
conditions for (non-bank) market funding, and also
a strengthened position for internal financing due
to increased savings and retained earnings.
However, low funding costs per se cannot be
expected to impact strongly on corporate
investment decisions. (50) Moreover, in real terms,
the decline in funding costs has been more limited.
However, the pace of investment growth in the
near term is expected to remain modest due to a
number of factors weighing on investment
decisions. One of these factors is the lower growth
momentum outside the EU, which is expected to
reduce export growth and hence equipment
investment. Also, high uncertainty will continue to
play a role in discouraging investment. Other
limiting factors include the moderate growth of
aggregate demand in the euro area, which impacts
negatively on the size of accelerator effects, and
relatively low long-term growth expectations (see
also Box I.4). These have become more important
for investment decisions as very low discount rates
make the distant future almost as important as the
(50)

near future. Meagre expectations for demand and
potential growth limit the impact of very
favourable financing conditions and easier access
to funding. Moreover, high corporate and
household indebtedness will continue to weigh on
investment in some Member States.

Several studies, including a survey conducted by the ECB,
had found evidence that at the current juncture funding
costs are of minor importance for investment decisions;
ECB (2015). ‘What is behind the low investment in the
euro area? Responses from a survey of large euro area
firms’. ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8, Box 2, pp. 35–37.

…before it increases over the forecast horizon.

Further ahead, investment should accelerate more
significantly as corporate deleveraging needs
become less of a constraint and global growth
gradually rebounds. After several years of subdued
investment, the need to modernise the capital stock
should become more pressing. The Investment
Plan for Europe is also expected to exert a positive
impact on both public and private investment in
2016 and even more so in 2017 as a growing
number of projects moves to the implementation
phase.
In addition to the factors described above,
construction investment should benefit from
sustained growth in household real disposable
income and very low mortgage rates. Moreover,
the adjustment in the housing sector seems to be
slowly coming to an end, as suggested by
developments in residential property prices
throughout 2015. Heterogeneity across euro area
Member States however remains large. Among the
largest countries, house prices continued to decline
in 2015 in Italy and France while they increased
markedly in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands.
Construction investment should also benefit from
increased demand for housing for hosting refugees.
Nevertheless, the high level of household debt in
some euro area Member States will continue to
limit construction investment.
All in all, total investment in the euro area is
expected to rise by 2.9% in 2016 (3.0% in the EU)
before accelerating in both areas 3.8% in 2017.
Net trade was a drag on growth in 2015…

The key feature for assessing the growth impact of
foreign trade is the widening divide between trade
within the EU and the euro area on the one hand,
and trade with partners outside on the other hand.
The two performed rather differently last year and
this trend looks set to continue. The divide shows
up in the discrepancy between relatively strong
total export growth in the euro area and the EU and
more moderate growth elsewhere.

33

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

On the export side, the slowing economic growth
in the EU's external environment and the weakness
of global trade have become a drag on exports of
goods and services. The fall in commodity prices
has undermined demand growth in commodity
exporting countries and China’s transition (see
Section I.2) has lowered the demand for
investment goods. This has made the further
expansion of exports heavily dependent on the
growth momentum of intra-area exports in both the
euro area and the EU.
In the fourth quarter of last year, the overall
growth of euro area exports remained at the rather
subdued pace to which it had fallen in the third
quarter. The slowdown was more pronounced for
goods, which even declined in the third and fourth
quarters, whereas services continued growing. As
regards goods exports, trade statistics indicate that
the increase in intra-euro area exports in nominal
terms was not strong enough to compensate for the
decline in extra-euro area exports.
On the import side, strengthening domestic
demand remained the key driving factor behind the
almost unabated expansion in the import of goods
and services in the third and fourth quarters. Taken
together, these developments resulted in net trade
making a negative contribution to GDP growth in
both quarters.

exports, the recent appreciation of the euro is
expected to dampen this effect over time. As a
result, the impact of price competitiveness on
exports is expected to turn negative.
With the expected gradual strengthening in foreign
demand, euro area exports should slightly
accelerate over the course of this year (see
Graph I.39), as the demand impact turns positive.
With real unit labour costs expected to continue
declining over the forecast horizon, European
companies should gradually benefit from the
rebound in global economic activity. It has to be
noted, however, that import growth from emerging
markets is expected to accelerate over the forecast
horizon, but to remain low in a historical
perspective. Moreover, import growth from
advanced economies, such as the US and Japan is
even expected to slow down significantly in 2016
before gaining momentum in 2017. All in all, euro
area export growth is set to slow in 2016 before
increasing in 2017. Import volumes are expected to
follow a similar pattern, given the high import
content of many export goods.

…and is expected to continue detracting in
2016 and 2017.

The persistence of external headwinds does not
bode well for the future contribution of net exports
to GDP growth. As regards exports, this view is
supported by the assessment of order books in the
Commission’s manufacturing survey, which
showed a deterioration in the first quarter of this
year for both the euro area and the EU. The decline
in the export-oriented manufacturing PMI in the
first quarter of the year is compatible with this
development. Moreover, while some lagged effects
from the euro’s past depreciation should continue
and thereby provide some support to euro area

Overall, the expansion in the export and import of
goods and services in 2015 was mainly driven by
strong growth in the first half of the year, when the
weak euro helped the euro area and the EU to
weather the slowdown in global trade with
remarkable
resilience.
Nevertheless,
the
contribution of net trade to GDP growth turned
negative, for the first time since 2009.

Overall, both exports and imports are expected to
show a decelerating profile this year before
accelerating next year. The contribution of net
trade to economic growth in both the euro area and
the EU is expected to fall in 2016 (to -0.3 pps.)
before becoming neutral in 2017.

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

Last year, the adjusted current account surplus of
the euro area continued to rise. Key drivers were
the sharp decline in commodity prices, gains in
price competitiveness due to the lower external
value of the euro, and the relatively low
momentum of domestic demand. As commodity
prices are expected to rebound only modestly and
the external value of the euro is expected to show
little change over the forecast horizon, the adjusted
current account balance is projected to broadly
stabilise.
Lower commodity prices and improved price
competitiveness pushed surpluses gradually
higher in 2015…

In 2015 the euro area’s trade surplus was strongly
boosted by the effects of lower commodity prices,
most notably oil, which were only partly offset by
the lower external value of the euro. This is
evident from the euro area’s oil balance (see
Graph I.40). (51) The short-term impact of lower
commodity prices was most notable in nominal
imports, while the potentially dampening impact
on (nominal) exports to commodity-exporting
countries, due to their revenue shortfall, was
difficult to identify as it was overlapped by other
factors (e.g. weak global trade momentum). The
direct impact of lower oil prices on nominal
imports has been somewhat offset by the impact on
economic growth in the euro area, which came
along with strengthening domestic demand that
induced additional imports.
Slowing economic growth in emerging market
economies and the relatively weak momentum of
global trade impacted negatively on the expansion
of euro area’s merchandise exports, particularly
since mid-2015. The impact of the slowdown in
the growth of export volumes was exacerbated by
the depreciation of the euro, which lowered export
values of non-euro-denominated goods and
services.

The euro area’s adjusted merchandise trade surplus
increased from 2.4% of GDP in 2014 to 3.1% in
2015, whereas the adjusted current account surplus
increased from 2.5% of GDP to 3.2%. The
increase in both trade and adjusted current account
surpluses resulted mainly from the improved price
competitiveness stemming from low commodity
prices, decreasing relative unit labour costs and the
depreciation of the real effective exchange rate. As
a result, the euro area’s export performance
(Table 54 in the Statistical Annex) improved in
2015.
…with appreciating currency and rebounding
commodity prices becoming mitigating
factors…

The euro area’s growing trade balance surplus is
expected to peak in 2016 and recede in 2017.
Export and import prices in the euro area are
expected to be influenced mainly by the slight
gradual increase of commodity prices and the
modest appreciation of the euro. Moreover, the
growth of unit labour costs is expected to
accelerate over the forecast horizon. This all is
expected to result in a gradual slowdown of the
growth of terms of trade. Despite the worsened
situation in the external environment and higher
uncertainty, export market growth (3.8% in 2016)
is expected to remain stronger than GDP growth
outside the euro area (3.3%). In other words, the
geographical composition of exports appears
beneficial. Moreover, domestic demand is
projected to remain rather subdued. Overall, the
euro area’s adjusted trade surplus is expected to
increase slightly to 3.2% of GDP in 2016 and to
remain stable in 2017. The adjusted current
account surplus (see Graph I.41) is expected to
reach 3.3% and 3.2% of GDP in the euro area in
2016 and 2017 respectively.

By contrast, the large current account surpluses in
some countries are expected to widen even further
as a result of low commodity prices and the
weaker euro. In Germany the total current account
surplus expanded to 8.8% of GDP in 2015. At
9.2% of GDP, the current account of the
Netherlands, contributed substantially to the
overall surplus of the euro area. Over the forecast
horizon, the surpluses of these two countries are
expected to recede but to remain at very high
levels.

…while cross-country diversity is expected to
remain.

The adjusted current account surplus in the euro
area is projected to remain broadly stable over the
forecast horizon. However, it conceals an
asymmetric adjustment among Member States (see
Graph I.42). Several vulnerable Member States
have been successful in rebalancing their current
accounts by turning large deficits into growing
surpluses. The current accounts of some of these
countries are expected to continue improving or
stabilising over the forecast horizon (e.g. Italy,
Hungary and Bulgaria). On the other hand, the
current accounts of some other countries (e.g.
Poland, Slovakia, and Romania) are projected to
slip back into deficit after a short period of
rebalancing in 2014 and 2015. An increasing
deficit over the whole forecast horizon is expected
in Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Lithuania
registered a deficit in 2015, but is expected to
return to a balance account over the forecast
horizon.

THE LABOUR MARKET

Labour market conditions continue to improve as
the recovery progresses, but significant slack
persists. The low pace of economic growth limits
employment growth over the forecast horizon.
Nevertheless, cyclical factors and, in some
countries, policy efforts to support job creation
should underpin a fall in unemployment, although
differences between countries will remain. As the
inflow of asylum seekers gradually increases the
labour force in the EU there may be some upward
pressure on unemployment in the Member States
most affected (e.g. Germany, Sweden, and
Austria).
Labour markets continued to improve in 2015…

Net job creation in the euro area continued to
increase last year supported by the ongoing
economic recovery, modest wage growth and
labour market reforms. At about 1.1% in both the
euro area and the EU, the rate of employment
growth in 2015 was at its highest since the crisis.
The sharp rise in the number of employees (1.2%
in the euro area, 1.5% in the EU) more than offset
the decline in the number of self-employed persons
in the euro area (-0.3%) and the EU (-1.3%). Still,
headcount employment remained about three
million persons below its 2008 level. Total hours
worked have not yet recovered from the sharp fall
during the crisis, partly also due to the increased
use of part-time workers, notably in the services
sector (see Graph I.43).

Last year, employment rose in the majority of
Member States, including countries such as Spain,
Portugal and Greece where unemployment remains
high. Recently implemented labour market reforms
and policy measures to support net job creation
have contributed to the higher employment
intensity of economic growth.

As regards the jobs that are being created, the
share of temporary employment to total
employment has been increasing in the euro area in
recent years, with the highest shares marked in
Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands (over 20%).
This is consistent with the still moderate pace of
the recovery and labour shedding often being
based on temporary employment to smoothen
cyclical fluctuations. The rise in temporary
employment is somewhat steeper among young
people. At the same time, low-skilled employment
in the euro area continued to decrease last year
while high-skilled employment increased.

The decline in the unemployment rate also reflects
the lagged effects of the strengthening economic
recovery and narrowing output gap, in line with
Okun’s law. Estimates for the euro area confirm
the negative relation between changes in output
growth and unemployment (see Graph I.44) (52)
with the former explaining about 40% of the latter
and about half of the changes in the youth
unemployment rate. (53) These estimates imply that
an increase in output growth by 1 pp. lowers the
total unemployment rate by 0.2 pps. and the youth
unemployment rate by about 0.7 pps.
At the country level there is a wide variation in the
responsiveness of unemployment rates to the
business cycle. Estimates of Okun’s coefficient
range from slightly less than -0.20 for Austria to
about -0.70 for Spain, where cyclical factors were
extremely
important
in
lowering
the
unemployment rate. (54) The sharp post-crisis rise
in youth unemployment in some countries (e.g.
Spain, Cyprus, Ireland and Greece) can be largely

...and unemployment continues to decline,
partly underpinned by cyclical factors.

Unemployment rates continued to decline
gradually over the course of last year and during
the first months of this year, while activity rates
were buoyant amid still increasing participation
rates, mainly of women and older workers (addedworker effect). Unemployment in the euro area fell
to 10.3% in February (8.9% in the EU), its lowest
level since August 2011 (May 2009).

(53)

(54)

Using annual data for 1980-2015 (1992-2015 for youth
unemployment), panel estimates of Okun’s law are based
on
the
regression
of
the
form
, where Δu
is the change in the (youth) unemployment rate, Δy is
output growth, gi is a dummy for country i, α1+α2i is a
country-specific intercept and α3i is the Okun’s coefficient
for country i. Estimates of the intercept are not reported.
However, higher values of the intercept suggest that more
growth is needed to lower unemployment rates. Intercept
estimates are higher for Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Estonia and
Slovakia (but also for Latvia and Lithuania in youth
unemployment regressions).
Based on the R-squared statistic. See also Banerji, A., H.
Lin, and S. Saksonovs (2015). ‘Youth unemployment in
advanced Europe: Okun’s law and beyond’. IMF Working
Paper WP/15/5 and Anderton R., T. Aranki, B.Bonthuis
and V. Jarvis (2014). ‘Disaggregating Okun’s Law.
Decomposing the impact of the expenditure components of
GDP on euro area unemployment’. ECB Working Paper
Series 1747.
This suggests that a one percentage point increase in output
growth decreases the overall unemployment rate by
0.2 pps. and 0.7 pps. in Austria and Spain respectively. See
also, Ball, L., D. Leigh and P. Loungani (2013). ‘Okun’s
Law: Fit at fifty?’. NBER Working Paper Series 18668.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

explained by a higher sensitivity to cyclical
conditions, as reflected in a higher Okun’s
coefficient. This is partly due to lower
participation rates in the cohorts of young people
but also idiosyncratic labour market features, such
as a high rate of temporary contracts often used to
adjust employment in response to output
fluctuations.

The ongoing recovery in labour markets is also
only gradually driving down long-term
unemployment (Graph I.46). The proportion of
people unemployed for 24 months or more remains
high. The persistence of long-term unemployment
is set to continue weighing on the efficiency of
labour market matching in Europe and increase the
risk that high levels of unemployment could
become entrenched.

In 2015 and early 2016, youth unemployment
continued to fall at a faster rate than overall
unemployment, but the share of young people
affected by unemployment remains high compared
to other cohorts (Graph I.45). Persistently high
rates of youth unemployment can lead to skill
attrition and scarring effects but also to emigration
of skilled labour with greater risk of lower

Developments in matching efficiency and
structural unemployment as depicted in the
Beveridge curve for the euro area (which shows
the unemployment rate at a given level of labour
demand i.e. the job vacancy rate) continue to point
to structural mismatches in labour markets (see
Graph I.47). For a given level of job vacancies, the
unemployment rate in the euro area was still higher
in 2015 than it was before the crisis. However, the
inward shift of the curve during the recovery
points to a small decrease in structural
unemployment. This moderate improvement can
be partly explained by the slower pace of job
destruction in some countries as well as the higher
job-finding rates and the declining share of longterm
unemployment.
Still,
structural
unemployment in the euro area remains high, also
reflecting skill mismatches, notably among lowskilled workers. (55)

Employment should continue growing in the
near term...

Labour market conditions should continue to
improve over the forecast horizon. The lagged
response to improved cyclical conditions and to
policy measures undertaken in some Member
States are expected to support job creation.
However, this year’s moderation in the pace of
economic growth and the relatively slow recovery
of hours worked back to pre-crisis levels will
weigh on the absorption of excess capacities in the
labour market and hold back stronger
improvements in the near term. Moreover, the
ongoing tightening of the labour market in some
large Member States points to a weakening in the
pace of job creation.
Survey data point to a slowdown in net job
creation in the first quarter of 2016 and signal slow
employment growth for the second quarter.
Following a significant downward revision in early
2016, employment expectations in industry
remained broadly unchanged in the euro area in
March (Graph I.48), whereas employment
expectations in services plummeted in February
and March. The employment component of the
euro area’s Composite PMI increased in March at
the slowest pace since September 2015, indicating
a slowdown in job creation in the manufacturing
and services sectors. By contrast, employment
expectations in retail trade in the euro area
continued to rise moderately in March. Overall, the
hiring intentions of firms remain above their longterm averages in all sectors. Consumers’
unemployment expectations rose further in the first
quarter of 2016, possibly which due to heightened
uncertainty about the economic outlook.

Overall, employment is set to continue growing by
about 1.0% this year and next in both the euro area
and the EU supported by the moderate economic
recovery, contained wage growth, and a somewhat
higher pace of capital accumulation. Labour
market reforms implemented in recent years and
policy measures, mostly on the fiscal side to
support job creation, should contribute to higher
labour demand and underpin employment growth
over the forecast period.
…and the decline in unemployment is set to
gather some pace…

Labour force developments should continue to
determine unemployment dynamics over the
forecast horizon. The labour force is expected to
increase in 2016 and 2017, mainly on the back of
higher participation rates and net migration flows.
The gradual integration of refugees into the labour
market should eventually increase the labour force
in the countries most affected. However, recent
policy measures are expected to reduce the
numbers of asylum seekers arriving in most
Member States, notably in Germany and Austria.
Upward pressures on unemployment should
therefore remain limited.
The activity rate is set to pick up modestly this
year and next in both the euro area and the EU,
mainly driven by declines of the working age
population in some countries (e.g. Baltic countries,
Poland). In the euro area as a whole, the
population of working age is projected to grow
only modestly over the forecast horizon, which
could reflect unfavourable demographics and an
ageing population. A slowdown in the growth of
the working age population implies a higher tax
burden to finance the retirement and healthcare
costs of a growing elderly population. This could

growth outlook.

only a moderate impact on the employment
outlook. Minimum wage developments in other
countries (e.g. Estonia and Latvia) are expected to
have an impact on wage growth and labour
demand over the forecast horizon. At the same
time, other factors, such as the pass-through of
monetary policy and real interest rates, could affect
capital accumulation and the unemployment gap.
The contribution of intra-EU labour mobility to
smooth fluctuations in regional labour markets is
expected to remain low. Overall, unemployment is
projected to fall in almost all euro area countries
this year and next, especially those that have
implemented labour market reforms (e.g. Spain,
Cyprus, Ireland and Portugal).

Labour productivity growth (output per person
employed) is expected to broadly stabilise this year
in both areas and increase only modestly in 2017
as the recovery regains some momentum and in
line with the pro-cyclicality of labour productivity.
It is set to reach 0.8% in the euro area in 2017
(1.0% in the EU).
Unemployment rates in both the euro area and the
EU are set to decline slightly faster than previously
expected amid resilient employment growth,
slightly weaker labour force dynamics and policy
efforts to boost net job creation. In the euro area,
declines of 0.6 pps. in 2016 (0.5 pps. in the EU)
and 0.4 pps. in both areas in 2017 are projected,
which implies an annual rate of 9.9% (8.5%) next
year. However, the moderate pace of the recovery
and the high level of structural unemployment
limit the decline in the unemployment rate. Over
the forecast horizon, the Non-Accelerating Wage
Rate of Unemployment (NAWRU) is expected to
broadly stabilise in the euro area and to decline
somewhat in the EU.

7.

INFLATION

Inflation was sluggish in 2015 and early 2016,
mainly driven by energy price developments. With
energy prices expected to continue exerting a
strongly negative effect in the second quarter,
inflation is set to remain very low for longer than
previously forecast.
Inflation dipped below zero again…

…but labour market disparities should recede
only slowly.

HICP inflation in the euro area averaged 0.0% in
the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.2% in the
fourth quarter. In January, headline HICP
recovered to 0.3% as positive base effects in
several inflation components - due to the ‘atypical’
month-on-month movements in the price index
twelve months earlier - pushed it higher despite the
continued fall in oil prices. However, in February
and again in March the base effects in the energy
component turned strongly negative which resulted
in headline inflation of -0.2% and 0.0%,
respectively. This was due to the continued steep
fall in energy prices early this year when compared
to the levels of the same period last year when
energy prices were actually picking-up. At the
same time, unprocessed food inflation - which also
tends to be very volatile – declined in the first

The improvement in labour market conditions at
the aggregate level masks considerable
heterogeneity among Member States. Labour
market disparities across countries are set to recede
only gradually over the forecast horizon. This
reflects differences in the initial conditions prior to
the crisis but also differences in the adjustment
mechanisms, such as in labour market institutions,
put in place in individual Member States to
weather the shocks.
Changes in institutional factors, such as the
minimum wage setting, will have a different
impact across Member States. In some countries,
such as Germany, the minimum wage should have

but remained in positive territory.

determining the relationship between headline and
core inflation are more complex.

On the other hand, core inflation (excluding energy
and unprocessed food) in the euro area averaged
0.9% in the first quarter, unchanged compared to
the fourth quarter (Graph I.49). Core inflation has
slightly increased since the first quarter of 2015
when it averaged 0.6%. However, it has hovered
around 0.9% since mid-2015 with no discernible
trend. Over the same period, there was an upward
trend, especially in the first half of 2015, in nonenergy industrial goods inflation which benefitted
from the low euro. At the same time, the services
component, which is a good measure of domestic
demand and wage pressures, remained rather
stable at slightly above 1%.

Due to the inclusion of energy and unprocessed
food prices, a sharp decline (increase) in headline
inflation usually triggers only a moderate trend
decline (increase) in core inflation, which
necessarily implies periods of widening gaps
between both measures followed by a narrowing
gap once swings in headline inflation diminish.
While the two variables move similarly, core
inflation lags headline inflation. (56) This is because
oil price or weather shocks, for example, are
quickly passed-through to energy or food prices
but the impact of these on services is less
immediately evident.

The gap between the two measures fluctuates and
the negative gap now visible is not as big as it was
during the crisis in 2009 when headline inflation
quickly turned negative. What is different this
time, however, is that the downward trend in
headline inflation has been more prolonged, which
raises the risk that consumers, producers and social
partners get used to a lower inflation rate and
revise their inflation expectations over a longer
time horizon. This could in fact lead to another
notable fall in core inflation and potentially
destabilising second-round effects.

…and the gap between headline and core
inflation has widened.

Core inflation has exceeded headline inflation
since the fourth quarter of 2013 with the gap
between both measures having grown over time.
This should continue in the short run, given the
strong negative base effects in energy inflation
expected in the second quarter. Whether low and
temporarily even negative headline inflation rates
could narrow this gap by pulling core inflation
lower has been at the centre of the discussion of
‘second round’ effects.
Although the core inflation index excludes by
definition the direct effects of energy inflation,
some immediate and indirect effects of the energy
price component are rather obvious. For instance,
lower energy prices affect energy-intensive goods
like transport that are part of core inflation. But
empirical evidence suggests that the factors

Global factors also weighing on inflation…

Global factors have been the driving force behind
recent inflation developments and are expected to
remain so in the near term. External price
pressures continued to weaken in the first months
of 2016 (Graph I.50). This mirrors the sharp fall in
energy prices during the same period which has
had an impact across global supply chains. In
tandem, a major factor holding down global
producer prices is the overcapacity in several
emerging market economies, particularly China.
There, the fast build-up of debt amid weakening
growth could put further pressure on indebted
companies to off-load their inventories at cheaper
prices, resulting in downward price pressures on
traded goods.
The latest data (for February) show that industrial
import prices fell at an annual rate of 6.3% in the
euro area, which was a stronger decline than in the

measures to have become shorter in recent years. ECB

fourth quarter of last year. This deterioration may
also be partially affected by the recent appreciation
of the euro. This decline in industrial import prices
is also contributing to subdued producer price
developments in the euro area, which fell at an
annual rate of 3.0% in January and then at a more
pronounced rate of 4.2% in February.

The recent uptick in energy prices and the
assumption of gradually increasing energy prices
may help to stabilise both import and producer
prices once the impact of base effects runs its
course towards the end of the year. Yet the strong
falls in imported and domestic industrial prices are
expected to partially pass-through and exert further
downward pressure on retail prices in 2016.
After having fallen again last year, the euro area
import deflator is expected to fall further this year,
before turning positive in 2017. Since import
prices are deducted when calculating the GDP
deflator – a broad indicator of domesticallygenerated inflationary pressures – the negative
growth rate of the import deflator increases
mechanically the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator
last year therefore was substantially above the
change in the harmonised consumer price index.
The same is expected for this year, but the turn in
the import price deflator next year should
contribute to the narrowing of the changes in the
GDP deflator and consumer prices.
…and

wage

growth

remains

On the domestic side, inflationary pressures are
also low because wage growth remains subdued in
the euro area. Wages and salaries per hour grew at
an annual rate of 1.5% in both the third and fourth
quarters of 2015, which is below the 2.1%

42

registered in the first half of the year. These
average rates, however, mask a wide difference in
wage growth across euro area Member States. The
growth rate of nominal compensation per
employee fell short of growth in hourly wages, and
in the euro area it marked the lowest in the past
decade. Again, this hides specific developments
depending also on the composition of the work
force and the type of jobs newly created. Growth
in nominal compensation per employee is then
projected to increase slightly in 2016 and more
markedly in 2017 when the output gap closes
further.
…but the increase in real wage growth is
robust.

As expected growth in nominal incomes exceeds
inflation, the real wage rate and the purchasing
power of households are set to move up. In fact,
the growth rate of real compensation per employee
increased further to 1.1% in 2015, substantially up
from 0.5% in 2013 and 0.8% in 2014. As inflation
is expected to remain very low again in 2016 and
the nominal compensation per employee only
increases slightly, the real compensation growth
per employee is expected to remain broadly stable
in 2016. This could imply some pent-up demand
that will eventually add upward pressure on
domestic prices.
At the same time, when analysing the gap between
wage growth and inflation developments one ought
to consider several differences across Member
States. Downward wage rigidities in vulnerable
countries seem to have softened, leading to a
dampening, if not negative effect on wage growth
given the presence of large, well-established
unemployment gaps. On the other hand, in those
countries where the unemployment rate has
declined substantially, like Germany and several
small euro area countries, inflation has not
increased more strongly despite the recent robust
growth in nominal wages.
Inflation expectations have fallen…

Market-based measures of inflation expectations
have fallen further since the winter forecast
providing evidence of a close link with the sharp
drop in oil prices and recent inflation
developments. Early last year, a recovery in
inflation expectations had been observed following
the ECB’s decisions on non-standard monetary
policy measures, but later in the year and in early

EA and EU outlook

2016, market-based indicators fell again. This
reflected inflation developments surprising on the
downside, as evident in consecutive downward
revisions to inflation forecasts, and headline
inflation turning negative earlier than expected.
Although somewhat distorted by market
turbulence and an increased flight to quality,
market-based indicators in early 2016 fell to very
low levels, with the implied forward inflation rate
five years ahead reaching a new all-time low in
February (see Graph I.51). This indicates that
market participants consider it very unlikely that
inflation will pick up soon, suggesting that markets
are attaching increased importance to global
demand and oil price shocks in the formation of
inflation expectations. (57)

at 1.8%. According to the Commission’s surveys,
consumer price expectations have remained
positive although the level remains substantially
below its historical average.
…and the outlook for inflation has been
revised down...

Looking ahead, the profile for inflation will again
be dominated by developments in the energy
component. The recent increase in oil prices will
be to an extent muted by the appreciation of the
euro but the impact of the past oil price decline on
inflation will be almost completely passed through
in the coming quarters. Given the assumed path of
commodity prices, inflation is expected to remain
very low in the first half of this year, especially in
the second quarter, but then to step up higher in the
second half of the year when positive base effects
come to dominate. From there, any pick-up in oil
prices will quickly feed into price increases.

At the cut-off date of this forecast on 22 April,
inflation-linked swap rates at the one-year forward
one year ahead horizon stood at 0.7%. Swap rates
at the three-year forward three years ahead horizon
imply an average inflation rate of 0.9%. On a
longer horizon, the widely watched five-year
forward five years ahead indicator suggests
inflation of 1.4%.
Survey-based measures of inflation expectations,
such as the average of market forecasters
calculated by Consensus Economics, were revised
down in the first months of 2016, to 0.3% in April
(0.8% in January). For 2017, the forecast mean is
for 1.4% (down from 1.5%). The ECB’s April
2016 Survey of Professional Forecasters includes
inflation forecast means of 0.3% in 2016 (down
from 0.7% in the January survey), 1.3% in 2017
(1.4%), and 1.6% (1.8%) in 2018. The longer-term
inflation expectations (for 2020) stood unchanged

An investigation into the contribution of global demand
and oil supply shocks to euro area inflation expectations.’

48.

In 2016, headline inflation in the euro area is
projected to come in at 0.2%, which is 0.3 pps.
lower than forecast in the winter. Core inflation is
expected to remain broadly stable before picking
up gradually towards the end of the year.
Moreover, the persistent weakness of core inflation
in the euro area largely reflects the still negative
output gap since the crisis and subdued
developments in nominal compensation per
employee. However, as the output gap is projected
to narrow further over the forecast horizon, upward
pressures on core inflation are expected to become
more evident.
In 2017, the impact of higher nominal wages and
domestic demand, the further narrowing of the
output gap and the assumed moderate increase in
oil prices should feed into increasing underlying
price pressures. Positive base effects are expected
to have a more noticeable impact than this year. As
the headline inflation rate is expected to pick up,
the gap with core inflation is set to close. Inflation
in 2017 is projected to stand at 1.4%.

Belgium; and in 2017, from 0.6% in Greece to
2.9% in Estonia. The variation in inflation reflects
several factors including differences in GDP
growth, wage growth pressures, convergence in
price levels, and the different impact of exchange
rate and commodity price movements, which in
turn depend on the composition of consumption
and industrial structures. Another factor behind
recent inflation differences is the adjustment of
relative prices within the euro area, where in
several stressed countries, external re-balancing
has required increases in price competitiveness.

In 2015, the aggregate general government deficit
fell to 2.1% of GDP in the euro area (2.4% in the
EU), down from 2.6% in 2014 (3.0% in the EU).
Over the forecast horizon, it is expected to
continue declining in both areas, albeit at a slightly
lower pace (Graph I.53), in 2016 reaching 1.9%
(2.1% in the EU) and next year, under a no-policychange assumption, 1.6% (1.8% in the EU).

The projected reduction in the government deficit
is underpinned by the ongoing economic recovery
and, to a lesser extent, the decline in interest
expenditure. The latter reflects depressed longterm interest rates as a result of negative policy
rates, moderate GDP growth expectations and
extended quantitative easing. As central banks
increasingly purchase longer-maturity sovereign
bonds, issuance at longer maturities has increased,
which locks in lower interest rate expenditure for
longer.

The general government deficit-to-GDP and gross
debt-to-GDP ratios continued declining in the euro
area in 2015, on the back of economic growth and
historically-low interest rates. Over the forecast
horizon, both government deficit and debt ratios
are projected to remain on a downward path. The
fiscal stance in the euro area should be slightly
expansionary in 2016, but once again, the picture
varies considerably across Member States.

The combination of cyclical developments and
lower interest expenditure is projected to
contribute 0.3% and 0.1% of GDP respectively to

…but without further improvements in the
structural balance.

In 2016, the general government deficit-reducing
effects, mainly stemming from the business cycle,
are expected to be partly offset by deficitincreasing policy measures. As a result, the
structural balance is expected to take a break from
its improvement trend. In fact, the fiscal policy
stance as measured by the change in the structural
balance, i.e. the general government budget
balance corrected for cyclical factors, one-offs and
other temporary measures, was broadly neutral in
both areas last year. In 2016, a slightly
expansionary fiscal stance is foreseen in the euro
area as a whole, while the structural balance is
expected to remain broadly unchanged in the EU.
Looking ahead into 2017, under a no-policychange assumption, the structural balance is
projected to remain roughly stable in both the euro
area and the EU.
(58)

The projected slight deterioration in the structural
balance in the euro area in 2016 is set to be driven
by expansionary fiscal policies somewhat
dampened by lower interest expenditure. In
particular, the primary structural deficit in the euro
area is set to widen by 0.5% of GDP in 2016, as a
result of fiscal policy measures, notably tax cuts
and additional government expenditure related to
the inflow of asylum seekers in some countries.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the primary
structural deficit is expected to increase further by
0.2% of GDP in 2017. At the same time, the
reduction in interest expenditure in both years is
expected to somewhat offset these impacts on the
structural balance (Graph I.53).
While the fiscal stance in the euro area as a whole
is expected to become more growth-supportive to
the economic recovery in the short term, it is set to
remain counter-cyclical in the majority of Member
States. In particular, among countries with output
gaps projected to remain in negative territory in
2016, an expansionary fiscal stance is expected in
twelve countries, while fiscal tightening is
projected in the remaining two. In turn, among
those euro area Member States where real GDP is
expected to be above potential in 2016, an
accommodative fiscal stance is expected in one
country, while some fiscal restraint is envisaged in
the other four (see Graph I.55).

the euro area economy in 2017, the deficitreducing contribution from the business cycle is
forecast to slightly increase to 0.4% of GDP next
year, while the positive effect of lower interest
expenditure is expected to remain stable. In some
Member States, the unwinding of one-off
budgetary factors, namely associated with financial
sector support, will also contribute lowering the
government deficit in 2016.

Expenditure-driven deficit reduction…

The reduction in the aggregate general government
deficit-to-GDP ratio over the forecast horizon is
expected to come from a lower government
expenditure ratio in both the euro area and the EU.
This mainly stems from lower interest expenditure
and the operation of automatic stabilisers, such as
a fall in unemployment benefit spending, as the
economic recovery progresses and labour market
conditions continue to improve (Graph I.57). This
is likely to be only partly offset by the budgetary
impact of the inflow of asylum seekers, which is
concentrated in a few countries. (59) Based on the
information provided by Member States, the
overall impact is expected to amount to between
0.1% and 0.3% of GDP in 2016 in the majority of
the concerned countries, which is the same amount
as in 2015.

Recent estimates by the IMF put the budgetary impact for
2016 at 0.31 % of GDP in Austria, 0.35% in Germany and
1.0% in Sweden; see IMF (2016). ‘The fiscal response to
the refugee influx in Europe.’ In IMF Fiscal Monitor, Box
1.2, p. 24.Washington, WC, April.

The expenditure-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is
expected to decline over the forecast horizon from
48.6% in 2015 to 47.6% in 2017. The decline
forecast mostly reflects the decreasing weight (as a
percentage of GDP) of social transfers, as well as
lower interest expenditure, wage bill moderation in
the public sector and the phasing-out of one-off
factors, including financial sector support
measures in some Member States. Moreover, the
public investment-to-GDP ratio for the euro area
as a whole is set to remain unchanged over the
forecast horizon and thus to stand below the precrisis average. (60) However, public investment in
nominal terms is projected to pick up notably in
2017 in some Member States as the new
programming period of EU funding takes off
(Graph I.58).

The reduction in the government expenditure-toGDP ratio is coupled with a decline in the
government revenue-to-GDP ratio, mainly
resulting from fiscal policy measures targeted at
lowering the tax burden on labour in some
Member States. These fiscal policy measures could
underpin the recovery in the short term and
contribute to a gradual rebalancing towards a more
growth-friendly composition of public finances.
Overall, the revenue-to-GDP ratio in the euro area
is set to gradually decrease from its peak of 46.8%
in 2014 to 46.0% in 2017, under a no-policychange assumption. The decrease forecast reflects
a reduced weight (as a percentage of GDP) of
income taxes and social contributions, stemming
from the above-mentioned fiscal policy measures.

The “snow-ball effect” captures the impact of interest expenditure on accumulated debt, as well as the impact of real GDP
growth and inflation on the debt ratio (through the denominator). The stock-flow adjustment includes differences in cash and
accrual accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other residual effects.
Note: A positive sign (+) implies an increase in the general government gross debt ratio, a negative sign (-) a reduction.

some downward pressure on indirect tax revenue,
this has been partly offset by a higher tax rate on
fuels in some Member States.
…and government debt is set to continue
declining.

In 2015, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio
fell to 92.9% in the euro area and 86.8% in the EU,
down from the peaks reached in 2014 (of 94.4%
and 88.5%, respectively). The decline in the debt
ratio was underpinned by a stock-flow adjustment
stemming from privatisation receipts and the use
of cash reserves in a few Member States,
complemented by an improving primary balance
and a favourable nominal growth-interest rate
differential.
Over the forecast horizon, the government debt
ratio is projected to continue declining gradually in
both areas, backed by higher primary surpluses and
the still favourable debt-reducing effects of
somewhat higher real GDP growth and inflation
over the forecast horizon, which combined are
expected to offset the still sizeable, yet gradually
declining, interest burden on public debt
(Table I.7). However, the expected softening of the
pace of the recovery and low inflation should have
a lower-than-previously expected contribution to
the debt-reduction over the forecast horizon.
Overall, the aggregate general government debt-toGDP ratio in the euro area is forecast to fall further
to 92.2% of GDP in 2016 and, under a no-policychange assumption, to 91.1% of GDP in 2017. In
the euro area, the decrease in the government debt
ratio over the forecast horizon is projected to be

slightly stronger than in the EU. In the EU, the
general government debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast
to decline to 86.4% in 2016 and, assuming no
policy change, to 85.5% in 2017.

RISKS

The uncertainty surrounding these projections is
substantial. Since the winter forecast, some
downside risks (e.g. a further deterioration in the
outlook for the external environment, a slight
appreciation of the euro) and upside risks (a further
decline in funding costs in the wake of additional
supportive monetary policy measures, a delayed
normalisation of monetary policy in the US) have
materialised. However, other risks have intensified
and the overall balance of risks remains titled to
the downside.
Risks to the growth outlook are predominantly
on the downside…

On the external side, the risk that slowing growth
in emerging market economies, in particular
China, could trigger stronger spillovers or turn out
worse than currently forecast, remain particularly
significant. The central scenario is that China
successfully manages its transition from an
investment-driven model of growth to one based
on consumption. A ‘hard landing’ in China would
create substantial risks for the continuation of the
global recovery and the dynamics of global trade
with spillovers to the euro area and the EU. Also a
faster than assumed normalisation of monetary
policy in the US could enhance the global growth
risks.

47

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

More generally, geopolitical tensions (e.g. in
Ukraine and Syria) are keeping uncertainty at high
levels and could affect the EU and the euro area
more negatively than currently expected.
On the domestic side, despite improvements in
many respects, legacies of the crisis could continue
to weigh more heavily on private consumption and
investment activity than currently expected. They
include deleveraging needs in the household and
corporate sector and non-performing loans on bank
balance sheets, which could weigh more on
spending decisions and result in a further
moderation of economic growth.

A faster or stronger-than-expected global rebound
would push European exports and could contribute
more positively to economic growth than currently
foreseen. And, as usual, technical assumptions
(e.g. oil price and exchange rate) underlying the
projections are associated with both upside and
downside risks to the growth outlook.

Risks associated with European policies remain
considerable and are on both sides. The
implementation of structural reforms could be
slower than expected, but structural reforms could
also have a larger positive impact than currently
envisaged. Uncertainty ahead of the UK’s EU
referendum on June 23 could impact differently
than currently envisaged.
The extended period of very low nominal interest
rates comes along with substantial risks to
financial stability. The search for yield could push
asset prices away from fundamentals and financial
institutions could get into trouble if their past
business models prove unsustainable. Any
materialisation of such risks could discourage
consumers and investors and challenge the
economic recovery.
Stronger positive effects from the policies taken
into account in this forecast are an upside risk to
the growth outlook. For example, the transmission
of the very accommodative monetary policy stance
to the real economy could be stronger than
expected.
Failure to find common solutions to common
challenges at the EU level (e.g. handling of
migration flows) could result in an increase in
growth-hampering uncertainty, which would
particularly affect private consumption and
corporate investment. The same impact could
come from a more widespread suspension of
Schengen and measures that endanger the
achievements of the internal market. In addition,
there could be trade-related costs with a disruptive
impact on economic growth (see Box I.3).
Moreover, concerns about the sustainability of
public finances could resurface in several Member
States.

Overall, risks to the growth outlook remain tilted
to the downside. This is visualised in the fan chart
(see Graph I.59) that depicts the probabilities
associated with various outcomes for euro area
economic growth over the forecast horizon. While
the darkest area indicates the most likely
development, the shaded areas represent the
different probabilities of future economic growth
within the growth ranges given on the y-axis.
Since the balance of risks to economic growth is
assessed as clearly tilted to the downside, the fan
chart remains skewed towards the bottom.
…whereas risks to the inflation outlook look
more balanced.

The extent and speed at which the assumed
rebound in commodity prices would feed through
to inflation remains highly uncertain and there are
risks in both directions. The future path of
commodity prices remains closely linked to the
global outlook, which is subject to risks on both
sides. For example, lower global growth
momentum could depress commodity prices. With
lower-than-assumed oil and other commodity
prices, inflation rates could remain negative for
longer than expected. Further risks are associated
with other technical assumptions.
Overall, there are significant risks to the inflation
outlook in both directions but they appear to be
broadly balanced. The probability of outright
deflation (i.e. a fall in prices in a self-sustaining
and broad-based sense) remains very low.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.1: Main drivers of growth in 2016 – discerning the underlying shocks
This box uses a newly-developed and estimated
multi-region macro model (1) to provide a modelbased quantification of the main drivers of GDP
growth in the euro area (EA) in 2016. The
estimated model is fitted with historical data from
1999-Q1 to 2015-Q3 and extended with forecast
data from the European Commission’s forecast for
the main macroeconomic aggregates. The new
model enables us to decompose deviations of real
GDP growth from the long-run trend into the
underlying shocks that drive the short- and
medium-term dynamics. Hence, the shock
decompositions in this box takes the European
Commission’s forecast as an input to recover the
factors that can explain the forecast in a modelconsistent way. In other words, the analysis shows,
which exogenous factors (‘shocks’) provide a
model-consistent interpretation of the forecast.
The advantage of using an estimated structural
macroeconomic model to understand underlying
economic dynamics is that such models use all the
information in the dataset. Notably, the size of
shocks to the model economy (e.g., financial,
savings, and productivity shocks) is selected in
such a way that these shocks fit not only the
movement of GDP, but also the dynamics of other
variables (including investment, consumption, the
exchange rate, and employment) and the
correlations between them (e.g., the correlation
between GDP and inflation, or the correlation
between employment and wages).

investment, and the exchange rate, for example, can
emanate from various sources, including regulatory
policies or non-standard monetary policy measures
(QE). In such cases, the simplified structure of the
multi-region macro model and most other DSGE
models does not identify the specific ‘events’
behind the shock.
Table 1 shows the principal drivers of real GDP
growth in the euro area in 2016 as projected in the
European Commission’s spring forecast, based on a
consolidated shock decomposition produced with
the estimated multi-region model. The trend
component (1.4%) shows the attainable long-run
growth rate if the euro area economy were to grow
with the average growth rates of total factor
productivity (TFP) and the population of working
age as observed over the period 1999 to 2015. Real
GDP growth is forecast to exceed trend growth by
0.2 pps. in 2016 due to a number of positive shocks
that outweigh negative factors.

It should be noted, however, that the impact of
various factors implied by the model-based shock
decompositions is not necessarily identical with the
impact that the same factors have in the European
Commission’s forecast. The driving factors
recovered in the model-based analysis are
conditioned on the theoretical structure of the
model and its parameter values, where the latter
have been obtained by estimating the model with
Bayesian techniques over the sample period
(1999-Q1 to 2015-Q3).
Furthermore, not all shocks in the shock
decompositions are directly interpretable in the
sense of recovering their fundamental ‘causes’
within a model of tractable size. Changes in
financial risk premia and financing costs that affect
interest-sensitive domestic demand, notably

According to the decomposition in Table 1 there
are positive and negative factors on the supply side
and the demand side. Overall, the contribution of
supply factors to the positive deviation of GDP
growth from trend is positive.
There is a sizeable negative contribution (-0.2 pps.)
from TFP, however, which suggests that TFP
growth remains subdued and below the long-run
trend.
Labour and goods market adjustment makes a
positive contribution (0.1 pps.). A disaggregate
view, however, reveals that wage and price
developments point in opposite direction. Falling
(Continued on the next page)

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Box (continued)

real unit labour costs in the forecast indicate
moderate wage growth in the euro area, with wages
growing less strongly than labour productivity. The
model interprets the combination of low wage
growth and declining unemployment as structural
adjustment of wages in the euro area labour market,
i.e. as a positive labour supply shock that
strengthens employment and economic activity.
The positive supply side contribution from the
labour market is partly offset by rising price markups on the producer side. The increase in the price
mark-up is inferred by the model from the
observation that the GDP deflator rises more
strongly than nominal unit labour costs in the
forecast.
Falling oil prices were an important stimulus to
euro area GDP growth in 2015, as lower oil prices
reduce costs for firms and boost household
disposable income. The shock decomposition
suggests that oil prices should continue to make a
sizeable positive contribution (0.3 pps.) to growth
in 2016. This is due to the fact that, despite the
gradual and moderate rebound for 2016 in the
external assumptions of the forecast, the average oil
price in 2016 remains below the annual average in
2015. In addition, the large fall in oil prices in 2015
still has positive effects in 2016 due to sluggish
adjustment of demand and goods prices in the
model.
On the demand side, a distinction can be made
between domestic and foreign factors. Among the
factors on the side of domestic demand, the shock
decomposition points to a positive contribution of
private consumption behaviour (0.2 pps.) to real
GDP growth. According to the forecast,
consumption is strong despite lagging wage
growth, which in the model points to a reduction in
the savings rate, i.e. a change in consumption
behaviour for given income and levels of shortterm interest rates. The decline in the savings rate
that is behind stronger consumption in the model
suggests that household deleveraging has weakened
in the euro area. On a cautious note, the
sustainability of consumption growth without wage
growth at a similar pace, i.e. of consumption

50

growth based on lower savings, seems questionable
in the longer term.
Investment growth in 2016 is still held back by
high estimated investment risk premia (financing
costs, access to finance) in the model, and the
investment share in GDP remains below its longterm mean. The decomposition attributes -0.1 pps.
of GDP growth to a shift in investment demand that
is associated with elevated risk premia (financing
costs).
Fiscal spending shocks (government consumption
and investment) appear neutral in the GDP growth
decomposition. It should be stressed, however, that
the component in Table 1 measures the impact of
deviations in fiscal policy from estimated patterns
of fiscal behaviour over the sample period. These
deviations are not identical to changes in the
primary government balance.
Regarding the foreign factors, weakening foreign
demand and weaker international trade are
estimated to contribute negatively (-0.2 pps.) to
euro area GDP growth in 2016. However, this
negative impact is offset by a positive contribution
(0.2 pps.) of shocks to the exchange rate.
The positive contribution of the exchange rate is a
lagged consequence of the euro’s effective
depreciation in 2015 in light of the estimated
sluggish adjustment of prices and export and
import demand in the model. Therefore, the
positive contribution of past depreciation should be
expected to soften and even reverse with a renewed
strengthening of the euro. Furthermore, it should be
stressed that the positive contribution only refers to
financial shocks (foreign exchange risk premia)
that affect exchange rates in the model. Further
factors that also affect exchange rate dynamics,
such as differences in monetary policies across
regions as captured by the model’s Taylor rule, are
not included in the estimated contribution of
0.2 pps. The positive contribution may, however,
partly reflect the portfolio balance effect of nonconventional monetary policy (QE) in the euro
area.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.2: Growth differences between the US and the euro area
The purpose of this box is to document the main
drivers of economic activity in the euro area and
the US since the beginning of the 2008-09 financial
crisis. In particular, it focuses on explaining the
striking divergence in the recovery paths of these
two regions, with the euro area having recovered at
a much slower pace than the US.
Crisis and recovery: the story of two regions

The global financial crisis led to a sharp contraction
in real activity in both the euro area and the US
followed by a slump that was long by historical
standards. However, comparison of a later
adjustment in the euro area and the US, especially
since 2011, shows striking differences. In
particular, the slump in the euro area has been
considerably more protracted (Graph 1). Euro area
per capita real GDP still remains below its precrisis peak. US per capita GDP recovered to its precrisis peak in 2014 but its current trend remains
markedly below its pre-crisis trend. Private
(corporate and housing) investment contracted less
(as a share of GDP) in the euro area than in the US,
during the 2008-09 crisis but in the 2010-14 period,
investment in the euro area continued to decline as
a percentage of GDP, while the investment rate in
the US began to recover in 2011. The rebound in
employment in the US, observed since 2011, has
similarly been stronger. Inflation has been lower in
the euro area than in the US since 2009, providing
some more evidence of the weakness of the euro
area economy.

growth. (2) Several commentators have linked the
persistent slump, especially in the euro area, to
post-crisis household deleveraging pressures. (3)
Others point out that financial constraints may have
been more severe in the euro area because of the
relative weakness of its banking sector and the
sovereign debt crisis which erupted in
2010/2011. (4) The latter factors may have been
compounded by lengthier decision-making
processes in the euro area and the greater
complexity of its monetary policy architecture.

There is heated debate about the causes of these
developments and differences: some commentators
argue that the protracted slump in the euro area
reflects weak aggregate demand, driven by factors
including overly restrictive fiscal policy, (1)
particularly in the context of the sovereign debt
crisis. Other analysts stress that structural
weaknesses in the euro area economy, visible in
product and labour market rigidities, may have
hampered the economic rebound by slowing down
sectoral redeployment and the adoption of new
technologies and resulting in weak productivity

According to an OECD study, the supply of credit to

persistently in the euro area than in the US, due to the
continuing poorer health of euro area banks (OECD,

that euro-area banks rebuilt their capital much more

Box (continued)

A recent paper by Kollmann et al. (2016) (5)
attempts to clarify the relative importance of these
factors in explaining the differences between the
US and the euro area using an estimated dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. The
use of an estimated model allows the authors to
analyse the shocks that have driven the euro area
and US economies and infer which shocks and
transmission mechanisms mattered most and when.
To quantify the role of different shocks as drivers
of economic growth in the period 2000-15, the
estimated contributions of these shocks to the
historical time series of the annual growth rate of
real GDP are plotted in the Graph 2 (euro area) and
3 (US). The graphs plot historical series from
which the sample averages have been subtracted.
The coloured parts of the bars show the
contribution of different types of shocks to plotted
series: structural shocks (productivity (TFP), wage,
and price mark-up shocks), fiscal shocks, saving
shocks and investment risk-premium shocks. The
grey parts of the bars capture other shocks, which
are not in the focus of this box (monetary policy
shocks, trade shocks, oil shocks etc.). Bars above
the horizontal axis represent positive shock
contributions, while bars below the horizontal axis
show negative contributions.
Main drivers of the crisis and the subsequent
(slow) recovery

The historical shock decompositions in Graphs 2
and 3 suggest that in the euro area (and also in the
US), the pre-crisis boom was largely driven by an
excessive loosening of credit conditions, which
helped fuel stock market and housing bubbles in
both regions. In the model, such loosening on the
credit market, not driven by the fundamentals, is
captured by negative shocks to investment risk
premia that is, to the spread between the risk-free
rate and the required return on investment. As can
be seen on the graphs, beginning in 2008, risk
premia increased abruptly, provoking tightening of
credit conditions and a collapse of the bubbles.
This finding lends strong support to the hypothesis
that financial frictions were the single most
important factor behind the crisis. However, the
financial turmoil was accompanied by several
additional adverse shocks. Overall, the model's
estimates suggest that the slowdown in the euro
area’s growth in 2009 was largely due to: (i) an
increase in the investment risk premium; (ii) a

decline in TFP growth that represents a permanent
level shift coupled with other structural frictions
related to price and wage mark-up movements; (iii)
to a comparably lesser degree, an increase in saving
presumably due to household deleveraging. (6) The
temporary recovery in 2010 is explained in our
model mainly by a short-lived fall in risk premia
across the euro area. However, in 2011 and even
more so in 2012, the euro area was hit by a further
rise in the investment risk premium, which had an
adverse effect on investment and GDP. We
interpret this second rise in the investment risk
premium as a consequence of the sovereign debt
crisis that weakened euro area bank balance sheets,
reducing the supply of credit to the corporate sector
and to households, thus lowering corporate
investment and housing investment. (7)
The recovery phase after 2013 has been
characterized by flattening of risk premia and
(likely temporary) abatement of household
deleveraging pressures. However, productivity and
structural factors are slowing down the full
recovery.

Overall, fiscal ‘austerity’ has not been the main
factor behind the slow recovery in the euro area or
the US. However, fiscal policy has had an effect on
the speed at which the US and euro area economies
have developed in recent years, first by stimulating
the economy, then by putting a brake on the speed
of the recovery, an effect that was particularly
strong in 2011.

Fiscal shocks

Graphs 2 and 3 also show the contribution of fiscal
shocks to GDP growth during the crisis. These
contributions were calculated taking into account
the fact that monetary policy was constrained by
the zero lower bound during much of this period,
with the effect that the fiscal multipliers used in the
calculations are higher than in ‘normal’ times. (8)
As can be seen on the graphs, fiscal policy shocks
in both regions had a stimulating impact during the
first phase of the Great Recession. In particular in
2008, fiscal policy added about 0.6 pps. to GDP
growth in the euro area (and a further 0.4 pps. in
2009) and as much as 0.9 pps. and 1.1 pps. in 2008
and 2009 in the US, due to a large fiscal stimulus
package. However, starting from 2010 in the euro
area and 2011 in the US, there was a turnaround in
fiscal policy, as governments started the painful
process of fiscal consolidation. In the euro area,
consolidation measures subtracted 0.8 pps. from
(8)

GDP growth in 2011, and still about 0.2 pps. in
2013. In the US, the negative impact on GDP
growth was even stronger (1.1 pps. in 2011 and
0.5 pps. in 2013). (9) Interestingly, the period of
massive fiscal consolidation in the euro area seems
to have ended around the year 2014, while
contributions from fiscal policy have so far
remained negative in the US.

The calculation of the fiscal shock contribution,
taking into account the occurrence of the ZLB
phenomenon during the period, is explained in Ratto,
M. (2016). ‘Latent variables and shocks contribution
in DSGE models with occasionally binding
constraints.’, mimeo.

This box documents the main drivers behind the
eruption of the last financial and economic crisis
and a latter slow recovery, with the emphasis on the
factors that led to a much slower recovery in the
euro area, compared to the US. At the current
juncture, the US is profiting from buoyant
sentiment among consumers, translating into
stronger private consumption growth than in the
euro area. However, two other factors contribute
more significantly to the slow recovery in the euro
area. One is related to its structural problems, as
gauged, in particular, by very slow growth of total
factor productivity. The other is related to financial
frictions, which seem to be abating much more
slowly in the euro area than in the US. This
provides more evidence for the view that cleaning
up bank balance sheets and generally improving the
performance of capital markets is one of the most
important challenges facing the euro area. It also
suggests that larger and more integrated capital
markets as well as more timely and concerted
policy responses (not only along this dimension)
might have helped to smoothen the recovery.
(9)

The larger negative contributions of fiscal policy to
growth in the second phase of the crisis in the US are
consistent with the fact that the US fiscal multipliers
tend to be larger.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Box I.3: Estimating a hypothetical scenario of generalised border controls
in the Schengen area
The Schengen agreement is one of the major
achievements of European integration. The creation
of an internal area without borders where people
and goods can circulate freely has brought
important benefits to European citizens and
businesses alike. Yet, in recent months, the system
has been challenged by the largest inflow of asylum
seekers since the Second World War. In reaction,
several Member States have unilaterally resorted to
reintroducing temporary internal border controls,
within the framework of the Schengen Borders
Code. Another reason for the temporary
reintroduction of border controls were security
concerns in the wake of the terrorist attacks in
Paris. Currently, reintroduced controls are a shortterm measure, limited to a small number of
countries, and targeted to specific sections of the
border. Their economic effect should therefore be
limited. On 4 March, the Commission has proposed
a roadmap for restoring a fully functioning
Schengen system by the end of the year. However,
a hypothetical more systematic and permanent
reintroduction of border controls would represent a
novel scenario and could turn out to be not only
politically but also economically costly. The aim of
this box is to provide a first estimate of the
potential economic costs of such a scenario, while
bearing in mind that political costs may well be
very high too.
Estimating the cost of border controls

Estimating the cost of reversing Schengen is not a
simple task. The scope of any analysis is bound to
be significantly restricted by data availability and
methodological
limitations,
therefore
any
assessment can only be an approximation at this
stage. The approach proposed in this box is based
on the combination of ‘value of time’ calculations
for direct costs - where a standardised cost
coefficient is applied to the delays caused by
permanently re-established border controls – and
simulations of the impact on trade flows for
indirect costs.
Due to the sensitivity of the results to the
assumptions (e.g. length of the delays, parameters
used, model specifications, etc.), a range of results,
rather than a point estimate, is presented. The lower
bound represents the minimum cost, whereas the
upper bound reflects the impact of lengthier and
more systematic border controls, leading to longer
delays.

The direct cost of border controls

The systematic reintroduction of border controls
could bring significant additional costs to the
European transport sector, notably to land
transport, because of potential disruptions of traffic
caused by congestion and delays. (1) In 2014, the
road haulage sector performed at least 57 million
cross-border transport operations in the EU. As the
average international trip within the EU involves
more than one border crossing, controls would
entail non-negligible additional waiting times.
According to estimates reported by the transport
industry (2), delay costs amount to about EUR 55
per hour. An alternative coefficient used in the
literature on the economics of transport (Quinet,
2013) (3) points to similar magnitudes and breaks
down the cost in EUR 37 per hour per lorry and
€0.6 per hour per tonne of merchandise.
Considering a delay of 30 minutes to two hours for
both estimates, the resulting costs for road freight
transport would range from a lower bound of
EUR 1.7 billion up to a maximum of EUR
7.5 billion per year. (4)
The reintroduction of border controls would also
severely affect the mobility of international
passengers, including 1.7 million cross-border
commuters living in the Schengen area. It is
roughly estimated that at least 1 billion passenger
trips are performed within the Schengen area each
year, (5) of which 50 million trips by ferries,
70 million by rail, 85 million by bus and around

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Rail and maritime transport might be affected more in
terms of passengers than freight and costs occurring
to these modes are therefore analysed only for the
first sector.

investissements
publics.’
France
Stratégie,
September 18.
Assuming a delay of one hour, the costs for road
freight hauliers would vary between EUR 3.4 and
EUR 3.7 billion per year, using the first and second
parameters respectively. The higher value also takes
into account intra-EU cross-border checks for
merchandise trade ultimately exported outside the
Schengen area.

data on maritime and rail transport, on the number of
cross-border commuters and their expected daily
mobility, and tourist trips abroad by means of
transport.

850 million by private cars. (6) To estimate the costs
for cross-border passengers, the value of time
coefficients are taken from the FORGE model for
both professional passengers (including crossborder commuters) and personal trips. (7) Assuming
a delay of between 7.5 and 30 minutes for each trip,
the calculation returns a perceived costs for
passengers at large ranging from EUR 1.3 to
EUR 5.2 billion per year.
Finally, re-establishing border controls would also
entail additional administrative and fiscal costs.
These are assessed through the combination of two
different approaches. First, the EU standard cost
model for the reduction of regulatory burden is
used (European Commission, 2004). (8) Considering
EUR 18.5 per hour of labour costs, it is assumed
that checking travel documents would take between
1.5 and six minutes per passenger for all modes of
transport considered, while for each lorry between
four and 16 minutes would be needed to perform
the document check and a cargo inspection. The
estimated administrative burden for the public
administrations would range between EUR
600 million and EUR 2.2 billion per year. As a
second approach, the estimates of custom
administration costs existing before the entry into
force of the Single European Act (1 January 1993)
are used as a reference and updated. (9) In the
context of this exercise, we only take the part
relative to administrative expenditure for the public
sector into account (human and material resources
needed to perform controls) and not the
administrative costs related to fulfilling custom
formalities (e.g. questionnaires, declarations, proofs
of conformity, etc.), which represented by far the
largest administrative burden and were mostly
borne by businesses. Public administrative costs
were found to range between 0.1% and 0.2% of the
total value of intra-community trade. Since the
latter reached the value of EUR 2.9 trillion in 2014,
(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

Although it cannot be excluded that the aviation
sector would face additional costs, it is not
considered in this calculation because control systems
are already in place in airports.
FORGE is the road capacity and cost model used by
the UK department of transport. For professional
passengers, a mode-specific monetisation is used,
while for personal trips, EUR 7.89 per hour is used
(overall resulting on an average value of time of
EUR 10.40). This refers to the perceived cost related
to loss of leisure time and not to traditional economic
costs as used in National Accounts.
European Commission (2004). ‘The standard cost
model: A framework for defining and quantifying
administrative burdens for businesses.’ International
working group on Administrative Burden. Brussels,
August.
A detailed estimate of these costs was presented in
the Cecchini report (European Commission, 1988).

the cost of reintroducing border controls in terms of
staff and material can be assumed to amount up to
EUR 5.8 billion. Combining both approaches to
define our lowest and highest estimate, the
resulting costs range from EUR 600 million to
EUR 5.8 billion per year.
Indirect costs of reversing Schengen

The estimates of costs presented above are static or
direct in the sense that they do not take into account
behavioural changes. Effectively terminating the
Schengen agreement among Member States entails
risks whose economic impact may go well beyond
a value of time approach measuring the direct costs
of reinstituting border controls. The reintroduction
of controls within Schengen, could, for example,
reduce how much people decide to travel within the
area, lead to the reorganisation of production
chains, or lower the volume of trade etc.
To the extent that the abolition of Schengen could
result in the unpicking of the EU’s common visa
policy, the tourism industry could be strongly
affected, particularly by a drop in tourists from
outside the EU. (10) In addition, frequent congestion
and systematic delays at frontiers could require a
re-organisation of just-in-time-logistics or the
return to more expensive warehouse solutions,
which would impact supply and delivery chains
scattered across Europe and imply higher capital
costs. This could particularly be the case in
manufacturing industries like the automotive
sector, which are characterised by the presence of
strong backward linkages with production in
neighbouring countries supplying intermediate
inputs.

(10)

Within the EU, domestic tourism (especially day
trips) would be impacted by restrictions to Schengen.
Further costs in terms of lower turnover in the
tourism industry may be considerably high for some
countries of first arrival if the closure of borders
impacts negatively on the capacity to manage alone
massive inflows of asylum seekers. More broadly,
recent studies on visa facilitation suggest that tourism
from third countries towards the European Union
may be significantly impacted if border controls are
associated with a fragmentation of the EU’s common
visa policy. Tourism Economics (2012) calculated
that the EU-Schengen area had the potential to
generate additional income of between EUR 11-60
billion – depending on different scenarios - in
international tourism receipts (exports) by 2015 if the
flexibility in the visa rules were fully exploited.
European Commission (2013) has also estimated that,
by tackling the main issues with the current visa
regime and practices, trips to the Schengen can be
expected to increase between 30% and 60%.

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Box (continued)

The recent work by Assilloux and Le Hir (2016) (11)
shows a significant positive impact of the Schengen
agreement on bilateral trade since its
implementation, suggesting that a widespread and
permanent reintroduction of border controls would
also have large indirect costs and decrease trade
between Schengen countries by 10% to 20% in the
long run. This impact is assumed to be equivalent
to a tax of 3% on the value of traded goods and
services. According to simulations performed using
the MIRAGE model, (12) the GDP of the Schengen
area would be 0.8% lower (more than EUR
100 billion) in 2025 compared to the baseline
scenario. Another econometric analysis carried out
by Felbermayr et al (2016) suggests that Schengen
has boosted trade by 4.2% on average (modelled
with an equivalent drop in tariff by 0.7 percentage
points for each border crossed) and GDP for the the
EU would fall by 0.31% if identity checks were to
be reinstated at all internal borders. (13) Similar
simulations for Germany and the EU have been
performed by Böhmer et al. (2016), (14) where the
impact of an increase in import prices of 1% to 3%
are simulated in the VIEW macroeconomic
model. (15) The range was chosen to define a
conservative and pessimistic scenario and in view
of past research on the single market (Harrison,
Rutherford and Tarr, 1994) (16) quantifying the
magnitude of so-called ‘border costs’ in the middle

of this range (around 1.7%), on average, for the
European Community. (17)
The estimations of equivalent tariffs to model the
trade effects of Schengen are subject to
considerable econometric uncertainty and the
higher bound of the range used in the
aforementioned literature partly overlaps with past
studies of the trade effect of the single market too.
However, for purely illustrative purposes,
simulations using the Commission’s QUEST model
indicate that an import price increase of 1% to 3%
would generate a fall in intra-community trade
leading to a negative impact on cumulative GDP of
around 0.2%-0.5% for the euro area by 2025 (EUR
20-55 billion), compared to a baseline scenario.
Whatever the uncertainty surrounding the indirect
estimates, there is also a risk that the reversal of
Schengen could fuel a deeper confidence crisis. In
a worst case scenario, not only trade flows would
be more severely affected, but also foreign direct
investment and investment decisions (which are
much more reactive to uncertainty). If this were to
happen then the economic impact could be far
greater.
Conclusions

The recent increase in the number of asylum
seekers entering the EU has prompted some
Member States to unilaterally re-introduce controls
along their borders with other Member States.
Although border controls have so far been
introduced only temporarily by some Member
States on certain crossings, the estimates presented
in this box suggest that the direct costs in a
(17)

Harrison, Rutherford and Tarr (1994) analysis of the
impact of the single market differentiates between
border costs and standardisation costs. According to
the authors, border costs represent the costs of
undertaking trade, such as transporting over
international boundaries and administrative costs
(e.g. shipping, handling and warehousing for customs
purposes). Standardisation costs on the supply side
are instead due to differences in technical
specifications and regulations across national
boundaries. The overall impact of the single market
(border and standardisation costs) was assumed to be
2.5%. A simulation of a shock above this threshold is
therefore very likely to include impacts that go
beyond Schengen and include the benefits of the
Single Market too.

The abovementioned estimates correspond purely
to the quantification of static costs based on a

possible behavioural changes, substitution effects

large.

A small number of studies have tried to go beyond
direct costs and have produced estimates which
also include indirect effects, using either new
econometric analyses or estimates from trade
literature. Necessarily constrained by data and
methodological limitations, these studies point to a
possible equivalent impact on import prices of 1%
to 3%, with the upper range likely to capture part of
the benefit of the single market too. (18)

For illustrative purposes, the macroeconomic impact
of a shock of this magnitude with the QUEST model
would bring to a cumulative GDP loss of around
0.2%-0.5% for the euro area by 2025

Beyond the proposed quantification of the potential

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Box I.4: Secular Stagnation
Introduction

The economic recovery in Europe has so far failed
to gather much momentum and has been weaker
than previous recoveries. Inflation continues to
remain very low, driven mainly by low oil prices,
despite the ECB’s accommodative policy. Despite
high public indebtedness, long-term interest rates
remain rather low which suggests that markets may
well anticipate a low inflation, low interest rate
environment to remain in place for some time. All
this has led several policy institutions to warn that
Europe could be vulnerable to stagnation if it were
to suffer further adverse shocks in the coming
years.
This box presents model simulations to assess the
effects of the prevalent adverse demand and supply
forces that have been blamed for stunting growth
and inflation since the crisis (2009-2014).
The secular stagnation debate

Since the popularisation of the term by Summers in
his 2013 speech at the IMF Economic Forum (1), a
single definition of ‘secular stagnation’ has yet to
be agreed. Most however, would agree it
corresponds to a protracted period of low growth,
low inflation and low interest rates. The standard
secular stagnation hypothesis in advanced
economies consists of adverse developments along
two dimensions: a shortage of demand and/or
supply.
The demand-side thesis (2) argues that the
combination of chronic excess savings and reduced
investment tends to push the equilibrium real
interest rate into negative territory, leading to
lacklustre demand and subdued growth. Summers
(2015) (3) places this argument in the low inflation
environment that both the US and the euro area are
currently experiencing; with nominal interest rates
constrained at the zero-lower bound, real interest
rates cannot fall further to increase investment to a
level that is compatible with full employment.
According to Summers the ‘savings glut’ has been
brought about due to an expected ageing of the
population, combined with risk aversion, readily

available cheap capital and rising income
inequality. (4) These elements, in particular the
expected deterioration of demographics, are of
particular relevance for Europe. As seen in the
European Commission’s 2015 Ageing Report (5),
both the working-age population and the number of
employed persons has been falling at a faster rate
since the 2008 crisis. Although migration flows and
the participation rates of female and older workers
are expected to increase, these will be offset by the
ageing of the European population, which is
expected to accelerate rapidly from 2025 onwards.
The supply-side arguments put forward to explain
secular stagnation emphasise the significance of
reduced potential growth. Potential growth in the
euro area has declined substantially from an
average of 2% in the pre-crisis period to
approximately 0.5% between 2009 and 2014 (6).
Gordon (2015) (7) suggests that lower potential
growth is partly driven by a deceleration in the rate
of technological progress over time, as well as four
‘structural headwinds’. Two of these headwinds,
the expected ageing of the population and the rise
in income inequality, are also relevant for the
demand-side interpretation of secular stagnation.
The other two are a decline in average educational
attainment levels and unsustainable public finances
caused by high public debt levels.
DG ECFIN’s output gap calculations for the euro
area show that total factor productivity (TFP)
growth since 2008 has been significantly lower
than it was before the crisis. By 2025, the level of
TFP is expected to be roughly 10% below its pre2008 level. For the US, Gordon (2015) projects that
the reduction in TFP growth will contribute to
reducing the average 2% US per capita growth rate
of the 1891-2007 period by 0.6 pps. in the future.
Additionally, the four headwinds together are

projected to deduct another 1.2 pps. from the US
per capita growth rate over time.
The third line in the debate with regards to the
causes of secular stagnation relates to the ‘debt
supercycle’ hypothesis. Rogoff (2015) (8) argues
that despite the effective real interest rate profile in
the economy being high because of both demand
(post-crisis higher inherent riskiness) and supply
(financial regulation) forces, it has incentivised
low-risk borrowers, such as pension funds, banks
and insurance companies, and governments to hold
disproportionately more safe assets. This has
generated strong deleveraging pressures and has
resulted in weak growth in the US, UK and Europe.
A model-based assessment using QUEST

Using the Commission’s QUEST model, this
section presents results of simulations to investigate
the impact of the prevalent adverse demand and
supply forces in pushing the euro area economy
towards a period of low growth and low inflation
since the crisis (2009-14), and subsequently leading
it towards a phase of recovery in the medium-term.
The model used is a two-region dynamic general
equilibrium model for the euro area economy and
the rest of the world. (9) The simulations begin in
2009, at the start of the financial crisis and the
model is calibrated to closely reflect the current
economic environment, which is characterised by
constraints on monetary policy.
The developments assessed, which cause a shortage
of demand and supply and are able to generate an
environment of protracted low growth are the
following: private sector deleveraging, which
reduces private debt by 10 pps. of GDP over a 10year period (10); fiscal deleveraging, which comes in
the form of reductions in government consumption
and investment; a temporary slowdown in the
growth rate of TFP of around 10%

slow recovery in the Euro Area.’ DG ECFIN, mimeo.
The reduction of household debt (as a % of GDP)
following a deleveraging episode is consistent with
the calculations in: Cuerpo, C., I. Drumond,

over 15 years (which is consistent with DG
ECFIN’s output gap calculations and gradually
recovers in the medium-term); temporary increases
in corporate and housing investment risk consistent
with the patterns observed during the 2008
financial and 2012 sovereign debt crises; and
demographic projections, including a 67% rise in
the dependency ratio by 2060. (11)
Graph 1 shows the results of the model
simulations. (12) Each subplot presents the
aggregate effect of all shocks combined on GDP,
inflation, and investment (as a % of GDP) and
contrasts their responses to actual data
available. (13) As can be seen, the persistent adverse
supply and demand shocks can largely explain the
decline of the inflation rate, investment and GDP in
the period 2009-2014. However, as these shocks
gradually fade away, the model predicts that GDP
will gain some strength and inflation will
accelerate, consistent with the short-term forecast.
In the short-run, the model mainly produces
demand-side effects that lead to a decline in GDP
and inflation through a reduction in expected percapita income. The expected fall in future percapita income leads to a front-loaded increase in
household savings, and a fall in consumption and
the real interest rate. Overall, this implies that GDP
will decline in the short run. However, as these
adverse developments fade away in the mediumterm, GDP gains strength and inflation accelerates.
While the growth rate of GDP is seen to recover to
pre-crisis rates, at the same time, the downward
level shift of TFP, as well as the risk premium
increase, restrain GDP and investment levels from
fully recovering to their pre-crisis trends.

and interest rates.’ Quarterly Report on the Euro

pp. 19-24.
Results for GDP and the GDP deflator are deviations
from a no-shock baseline, in %. Results for
investment are deviations from the baseline in
percentage points.
For years 2016 and 2017 the values reported are
obtained from the European Commission’s 2016
Winter Forecast. For investment, the forecast is
consistent with DG ECFIN’s medium-term
projections, which predicts that investment will
progress to approximately 21% by 2020. The
pre-crisis trend illustrated in the subplot for GDP is
adjusted for the slowdown of the total population.

‘financial frictions’ interpretation of the ‘long
slump’, suggesting that increases in spreads can be
attributed to the sizeable risk premia on investment.
It is also in conflict with the classical secular
stagnation hypothesis, which describes a downturn
due to a fall in consumption driven by ageing,
deleveraging, and increasing inequality.

It is important to note that in the simulation
exercise both the decline in TFP growth and the
rise of investment risk are not permanent
developments. Both phenomena are seen as
persistent but, nevertheless transitory features of
the financial and sovereign debt crisis. In
particular, improving lending conditions in Europe
expected to facilitate investment in productivityenhancing innovations and leads to a turnaround of
TFP growth. These assumptions on the recovery of
TFP growth in the medium-term are key in limiting
the economic downturn observed in 2009-2014,
and hence assist the economy into entering a phase
of higher, though still subdued, GDP growth
following 2014. However, with the recovery still
weak, any additional adverse developments could
be enough to tip the economy into a more
prolonged period of slow growth. (14)

The analysis presented has interesting policy
implications. To counter the risks of stagnation, a
number of demand- and supply-side policies would
be needed to address each adverse development. In
particular, a number of supply-side reforms, such
as facilitating sectoral adjustments, better
qualifications, education and training would be
warranted to address the productivity growth
slowdown. Regarding the still on-going
deleveraging process in Europe, which puts
downward pressure on demand, measures such as
the recently-launched Investment Plan for Europe
will also be crucial to counter the risk of weak
investment. In addition, the current period of low
interest rates favours public investment for
countries with fiscal space. Additional supply-side
measures to combat financial frictions in the
banking sector and further support investment,
apart from the creation of the ESM, would be a
movement towards a European banking union that
improves cross-country integration and risk
sharing. Finally, the effects of demographic ageing
could be offset by an increase in the retirement age.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
22 April. The forecast incorporates validated public
finance data as published in Eurostat’s News
Release 76/2016 of 21 April 2016.

Budgetary data and forecasts

External assumptions

Eurostat is expressing a reservation on the quality
of the data reported by Belgium in relation to the
sector classification of hospitals. Eurostat considers
that, in line with ESA 2010, government controlled
hospitals in Belgium should be classified inside
government. This is currently not the case. A future
reclassification will most likely result in a limited
increase in government debt.

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 5 and 18 April) were used for exchange
and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption regarding exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.13
in 2016, and 2017. The average JPY/EUR is 124.44
in 2016 and 123.60 in 2017.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Shortterm interest rates for the euro area are derived
from futures contracts. Long-term interest rates for
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term
interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be -0.2% in 2016 and
-0.3 in 2017 in the euro area. Long-term euro area
interest rates are assumed to be 0.2% in 2016, and
0.3% in 2017.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 41.07 USD/bbl in 2016 and
45.95 USD/bbl in 2017. This would correspond to
an oil price of 36.47 EUR/bbl in 2016 and
40.53 EUR/bbl in 2017.

Data up to 2015 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission before
1 April and validated by Eurostat on 21 April 2016.

Eurostat is expressing a reservation on the quality
of the data reported by France in relation to two
issues. First, the sector classification of the French
Deposit Guarantee and Resolution Funds (Fonds de
garantie des Dépôts et de Résolution - FGDR) in
2015 which will most likely result in a limited
increase in government debt and a limited decrease
in government deficit. Second, the recording of
settlement costs related to the restructuring of
complex debt instruments undertaken by local
government which will most likely result in a
limited increase in government deficit for the year
2015.
Eurostat is expressing a reservation on the quality
of the data reported by Hungary in relation to the
sector classification of Eximbank (Hungarian
Export-Import Bank Plc). Eximbank needs to be
reclassified inside the general government sector
which will result in an increase in government debt.
Eurostat, in cooperation with these national
statistical authorities, will clarify the issues and
assess the impacts during the coming months.
Eurostat is withdrawing the reservation on the
quality of the data for Austria expressed in
Eurostat's News Release of 21 October 2015.
Eurostat made no amendments to the data reported
by Member States.
The public finance forecast is made under the ‘nopolicy-change’ assumption, which extrapolates past
revenue and expenditure trends and relationships in
a way that is consistent with past policy
orientations. This may also include the adoption of
a limited number of working assumptions,
especially to deal with possible structural breaks.

Box (continued)

EU and euro area aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2016-17 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans, including
those made through the European Financial
Stability Facility). To ensure consistency in the
time series, historical data are also published on the
same basis. For 2015, this implies an aggregate
debt-to-GDP ratio which is somewhat higher than
the consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 76/2016
of 21 April 2016 (by 2.2 pps. in the euro area EA19
and by 1.6 pps. in the EU).
ESA 2010

The current forecast is based on the ESA 2010
system of national accounts for all Member States,
the EU and the euro area aggregates.

Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission’s annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted annual growth rates differ only
marginally (by up to ±0.1 pps.). The calculation of
potential growth and the output gap does not adjust
for working days. Since the working-day effect is
considered as temporary, it should not affect the
cyclically-adjusted balances.

PART II
Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM

Temporary factors impede recovery

Economic growth is expected to slow down to 1.2% in 2016 due to the weaker external environment and
the short-term impact of the March terrorist attacks. More robust domestic demand should lift growth to
1.6% next year, with a continued recovery in the labour market. The reduction of the fiscal deficit moves
slowly and public debt is projected to decline as of 2017.
The short-term economic forecast for Belgium has
been trimmed since the winter forecast due to both
the weakened external environment and the March
terrorist attacks. The growth of Belgian export
markets is projected to weaken from 4.6% in 2015
to 4.2% in 2016, before picking up to 4.7% in
2017. The March attacks are expected to have a
transitory impact on the Belgian economy. The
main channel through which the events are likely
to affect economic activity is the hospitality
industry given a slump in tourist arrivals.
Indirectly, an apparent weakening of consumer
sentiment could suggest a further softening of the
already slow-moving business cycle.

expected to continue as the economy strengthens
and the reduction of labour costs weighs in. This
should support a fall in the unemployment rate
from 8.5% last year to 7.7% in 2017.
Steady improvement of competitiveness
trickles through to corporate investment

Total investment growth is expected to be flat this
year due to a negative base effect from exceptional
transactions in 2014-2015 related to patents and
ships. It should, however, grow by about 3% in
2017, driven by equipment investment and public
investment (see below).
In spite of the pick-up in wage growth, aggregate
competitiveness gains of Belgian companies are
set to continue with reductions in social security
contributions curbing total labour cost growth.
This improved competitiveness is reflected in
fairly robust financial fundamentals. Combined
with a further softening of financing conditions,
this puts companies in a good position to take
advantage of the expected expansion of export
markets in coming years, underpinning job
creation and equipment investment. A floundering
recovery in the euro area, Belgium’s main trading
partner, is therefore a central risk to the outlook.
Inflation seen rising to 1.7%

Resumption of wage growth and mending
labour market uphold private consumption

Following last year’s wage stagnation, employees
will see remuneration increase again this year. This
renewed wage growth, as well as some income tax
cuts in 2016 help compensate for the effect of the
current spike in inflation on purchasing power.
Overall, household consumption is expected to
grow by 1% in 2016 and by 1.3% in 2017.
The brightening outlook for private consumption
over the forecast horizon is underpinned by the
performance of the labour market. Job creation has
proceeded steadily in recent quarters. In line with
what leading indicators such as interim labour and
temporary unemployment suggest, this trend is

66

Inflation stood at 1.5% in 2016-Q1, compared with
0.0% in the euro area. A substantial part of this gap
is explained by government measures, such as
increases in indirect taxation and prices for public
services. However, items such as food products
and private services have also shown notable
differences in price developments. Inflation is
forecast at 1.7% in 2016, compared with 0.6% in
2015, and is expected to remain broadly at that
level in 2017.
Public finances give a mixed picture

The general government deficit declined to 2.6%
of GDP in 2015. The decline in market interest
rates, the non-indexation of public wages and

Member States, Belgium

social benefits, as well as sizeable consolidation
measures curbed current expenditure. Capital
expenditure, including investment, decreased by
0.6 pps. of GDP after some large one-off
expenditures in 2014. At the revenue side, tax
revenues fell as a consequence of low wage growth
and tax cuts on labour, while non-tax revenues
dropped because of lower revenues from dividends
and financial sector guarantee fees. All in all,
Belgium’s structural balance is estimated to have
improved by around ¼ pps. of GDP in 2015.

of Belgium’s EU contribution and a transfer to the
EU single resolution fund have a one-off negative
impact of 0.15% of GDP on the government
balance. On the other hand, interest expenditure is
expected to decline further (-0.2 pps. of GDP). The
recovery of around 0.2% of GDP of illegally
granted corporate income tax advantages under the
excess profit scheme has not been included
because its timing is not yet fully known. All in all,
the structural balance is expected to improve by
around ¼ pps. of GDP in 2016.

In 2016, the headline deficit is projected to rise to
2.8% of GDP and the primary balance is also
expected to slip into deficit, for the first time since
2012. This projection includes a package of 0.15%
of GDP of consolidation measures announced in
April 2016. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected
to decline due to the drop in one-off revenues and
cuts in personal income taxation and social
contributions, which are not fully offset by hikes in
other taxes. While past consolidation measures and
reforms have curbed public spending dynamics,
primary expenditure is boosted by the automatic
indexation of public wages and social benefits
expected to occur in summer 2016, as well as
(partly temporary) additional expenditure related
to asylum-seekers and security measures, of
respectively 0.2% and 0.1% of GDP. A settlement

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the deficit
should decline to 2.3% of GDP in 2017 thanks to
the disappearance of the above-mentioned
temporary expenditure increases, more favourable
cyclical conditions and a further decline in interest
expenditure. Large regional construction plans and
the investment cycle of local governments are set
to boost public investment in 2017.
The reimbursement of a loan (0.7% of GDP) by
KBC bank, which had been granted in the context
of past bank rescue operations, prevented a further
increase in the public debt ratio in 2015. While
rising again in 2016, public debt should head back
down in 2017 when projected nominal GDP
growth strengthens.

2. BULGARIA

Moderate growth ahead

Real GDP grew 3% in 2015, driven mainly by exports and falling oil prices. It is expected to drop to
2.0% in 2016, as some boost factors, such as the absorption of EU funds weaken. GDP growth is set to
recover to 2.4% in 2017 as strengthening domestic demand more than offsets fading net exports.
Inflation is projected to be negative in 2016 but to be positive in 2017. The general government deficit is
set to gradually decrease.
Increasing role of
economic growth

domestic

demand

Growth in 2015 was stronger than in 2014 mainly
because of higher net exports, but domestic
demand is expected to increase and replace net
exports as the main growth driver in 2017. Private
consumption growth is expected to strengthen
from 0.8% in 2015 to 2.0% in 2016 and to 1.7% in
2017. Amidst favourable financing conditions and
the rise of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing
sector above its historic average, the slowdown of
the implementation of projects co-financed by the
EU is still set to supress investment in 2016-17. In
general, risk aversion, an unsupportive business
environment and restrained foreign capital inflows
are also expected to weigh on investment growth.
Net exports to contribute positively to growth
over the forecast horizon

Exports are projected to grow faster than imports
over the forecast horizon, supported by higher
demand from the EU, resulting in positive
contributions of net exports to growth. Exporting
industries are also expected to continue benefitting
from the weaker euro, to which the national
currency is pegged, given that a substantial portion
of Bulgarian exports go to non-euro area countries.
However, the contribution of net exports to growth
is projected to decline, as the recovery in domestic
demand gathers pace in 2017.
Overall, risks to the growth outlook appear
balanced. On the positive side, stronger
employment growth and slower weakening of
exports could fuel stronger-than-forecast private
consumption and investment. Also, some
economic sectors could receive stronger-thanprojected support from low interest rates and oil
prices. Geopolitical uncertainties and weak import
demand of the main trading partners could,
however, pose a downside risk to exports and
output growth, given the high degree of openness
of the economy.

Labour market conditions to improve, inflation
to turn positive in the first quarter of 2017

Employment growth is projected to marginally
increase from 0.3% in 2016 to 0.5% in 2017,
supported mainly by the recovery in domestic
demand. Together with the expected decrease in
the labour force due to population aging and
emigration, this is likely to further reduce the
unemployment rate to 8.6% in 2016 and 8.0% in
2017.
Inflation is expected to rise gradually as the impact
of declining commodity prices slowly tapers off,
although it is forecast to remain negative
throughout the first three quarters of 2016. At the
same time, the weak euro and the tight labour
market conditions should exert some upward
pressure on prices. Inflation looks set to turn
positive in the fourth quarter of 2016 but will
remain low at 0.9% for 2017 given the expected
negative output gap.
Improving public finances

The general government deficit decreased to 2.1%
of GDP in 2015, according to the notified data.
Compared to the original budget deficit target of
2.8% of GDP in 2015, the better outcome reflects

Member States, Bulgaria

mainly higher tax-revenues of around 1.5% of
GDP, mostly attributable to improved tax
compliance. Those additional revenues more than
offset various expenditure slippages, such as the
incomplete implementation of the planned
reduction of the public wage bill and the higher
purchase of goods and services. Higher-thananticipated absorption of EU-funds financed
significantly higher expenditures, in particular
public investments, slightly increasing the deficit.
The headline deficit is forecast to decrease to 2.0%
of GDP in 2016 and to 1.6% of GDP in 2017. In
general, tax revenues are expected to increase in
light of economic growth and labour market
developments, assuming only slight further
increase in tax compliance. The expected
significant improvement in 2017 reflects already
substantiated measures on the revenue side, such
as an increase in excise duties and social security
contributions as well as technical assumptions

about a limited rise in expenditures. The impact of
the likely temporary fall in the absorption of
EU-funds on public investment in 2016 is expected
to be partly offset by higher investments from
domestic resources. In 2017, public investments
are set to be unchanged compared with 2016.
Regarding fiscal risks, a positive surprise could
come from further improvements in tax
compliance. Also, savings on the expenditure side
may be may be more pronounced, in particular in
2017. At the same time, any further support for the
financial sector could have a deficit-increasing
effect.
Structural balance is projected to improve by
½ pps. of GDP over the forecast horizon in light of
consolidation measures. Given the still-sizeable
budget deficit and the limited growth of the
economy, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast
to increase from 27.0% in 2014 to 28.7% by 2017.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC

Return to a sustainable growth path

Economic growth in the Czech Republic is expected to fall to 2.1% in 2016, after having risen to 4.2%
in 2015 as a result of an exceptional boost from public investment. While investment is expected to fall
in 2016, household and government consumption will continue to contribute positively to growth. In
2017, all domestic demand components are expected to contribute positively to a real growth rate of
2.6%. The headline government deficit is forecast to remain well below 1% over the forecast horizon.
Growth driven by consumption

The economy of the Czech Republic is forecast to
grow by 2.1% in 2016. This represents a slowdown
from 2015, when real GDP growth rose to 4.2%
due to an exceptional boost from EU co-financed
investment activity. Growth in 2016 will mainly be
driven by domestic consumption, which is
expected to contribute 1.9 pps. to the headline
growth rate. Household consumption is expected
to rise by 2.8% in real terms, the same rate as in
2015, amid accelerating wage growth, rising
employment and low inflation. Public consumption
is also expected to grow strongly. By contrast,
investment activity is projected to detract from real
GDP growth in 2016 due to the sharp fall in public
investment following last year’s exceptionally high
growth. While the growth rate of private
investment is expected to remain positive, overall
investment is projected to fall by 0.5% in real
terms. In 2017, all domestic demand components
are expected to contribute positively to real GDP
growth of 2.6%. The magnitude of the reduction in
public investment could be larger than expected
and poses a downside risk to the forecast in 2016,
while
uncertainties
surrounding
external
environment developments pose a downside risk
over the entire forecast horizon, particularly given
the highly open nature of the Czech economy.
Trade balance to increase

The trade balance fell to 4.7% of GDP in 2015, as
imports grew faster than exports, reflecting the
high import-intensity of consumption and
investment in the Czech Republic. The projected
fall in investment activity in 2016 is expected to
contribute to weaker import growth and to a rising
trade balance. In line with this slowdown in import
growth, net exports are expected to contribute
positively to real GDP growth in 2016 for the first
time in two years. While a positive contribution is
also projected for 2017, it will likely be lower than
in 2016 given the projected acceleration in
investment.

Increasingly tight labour market

The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in 2015 and is
projected to fall to 4.5% in 2016 and 4.4% in 2017.
While employment growth is expected to remain
positive, the scope for further growth is
diminishing and is projected to slow to 0.3% in
2017 as the working age population decreases.
Tight labour market conditions over the forecast
horizon are expected to accelerate wage growth.
Falling import prices contribute to low inflation

Import prices are forecast to decline by 1.9% in
2016, reflecting an expected year-on-year fall in
most commodity prices in Czech koruna terms
despite a levelling off in the second half of the
year. Import prices have put downward pressure on
domestic consumer prices, with inflation slowing
to 0.3% in 2015 and expected to accelerate to only
0.5% in 2016. Regulated prices are forecast to
contribute negatively to inflation in 2016, with the
domestic price of gas expected to fall particularly
steeply. At the same time, inflationary pressures
from non-regulated prices are expected to increase,
reflecting higher demand pressures amid growing
employment and accelerating wage growth. While
inflation is expected to start rising in 2017, it is not
forecast to reach the Czech National Bank’s target
of 2% over the forecast horizon.

Member States, The Czech Republic

Headline deficit to remain below 1%

The general government deficit fell to 0.4% of
GDP in 2015 from 1.9% in 2014. This
significantly better-than-expected outcome was
due to several temporary factors including an
exceptionally high absorption rate of EU funds,
which boosted GDP growth. On the revenue side,
corporate taxes and taxes on production grew
strongly. Revenues of the Deposit Insurance Fund
were boosted by one-off contributions from
previously-financed projects. Expenditures were
driven by co-financing of public investment, which
rose significantly as the previous programming
period of EU funding came to an end, even though
some planned local government investments were
delayed. The structural deficit decreased to 0.4%
of GDP in 2015, down from 0.8% in 2014.
The small deterioration of the projected headline
deficit to 0.7% of GDP in 2016 is the result of
fading one-off factors and a stabilisation of tax
revenues in line with lower projected
macroeconomic growth. Revenues are expected to
be supported by higher excise duty on tobacco and
the introduction of the VAT control statement. The
growth rate of direct taxes is expected to pick up
slightly for personal income taxes, due to increased

wages, but to decline for corporate taxes because
of slower growth in economic activity.
Expenditures are projected to be affected by
buoyant government consumption, with a strong
contribution from the wage bill and intermediate
consumption. Pensions are also forecast to rise due
to an exceptional lump sum payment to pensioners
intended to compensate for the low increase
currently set by the indexation scheme. Partially
counteracting this will be the significant decrease
in overall investment spending, although national
investment is likely to pick up compared to last
year. Additionally, interest expenditure is expected
to continue decreasing moderately due to
favourable financial market borrowing conditions.
In 2017, the headline deficit is forecast to decline
slightly due to the expected improvement in
macroeconomic conditions. Recently approved
legislation on the electronic evidence of sales,
designed to combat tax evasion, is expected to
bring in somewhat higher tax revenues in 2017. On
the back of a widening positive output gap, the
structural deficit is expected to deteriorate in the
forecast horizon, rising close to 1% of GDP in
2017. The debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase
slightly to 41.3% in 2016 and decline to 40.9% of
GDP in 2017.

4. DENMARK

Domestic demand drives ongoing recovery

The recovery of the Danish economy has slowed down amid robust domestic demand, but weak export
performance. Employment is projected to continue growing strongly, but unemployment is expected to
fall only gradually because of the rising labour force. The general government deficit is expected to
further widen to 2.5% in 2016 before improving in 2017.
GDP growth has slowed down

Denmark’s real GDP grew by 1.2% in 2015. After
relatively high growth at the beginning of the year,
the economy lost steam in the second half.
Following a drop in GDP of 0.6% (q-o-q) in the
third quarter, GDP recovered by a mere 0.1%
(q-o-q) in the last quarter of the year. On an annual
basis, growth in 2015 was driven by domestic
demand, while the growth contribution from net
exports was close to neutral, with both exports and
imports registering declines.
Domestic demand remains the main engine of
economic growth

Foreign trade developments were weak in 2015,
mainly due to a decline in service exports and
imports. The slowdown in world trade has led to a
fall in sea freight, which is a large component in
Danish services export. However, the weak
performance of exports in 2015 is not a reflection
of weak wage competitiveness, as wage growth in
Denmark has been below that of peer countries for
several years. Exports are expected to pick-up over
2016 and 2017, growing by 1.5% and 4.2%
respectively, supported by higher growth in Danish
export markets.

The moderate recovery of the Danish economy is
expected to continue with GDP forecast to grow by
1.2% in 2016 and by 1.9% in 2017. Steadily
expanding private consumption is expected to be
the main driver of real GDP growth.

Private consumption expanded at a rate of 2.1% in
2015, supported by growth in real disposable
income due to increases in both employment and
wages, as well as low inflation. The recovery of
house prices over the last three years has had a
positive effect on households’ asset positions,
reducing the need for continued consolidation. The
decline in consumer confidence from a high level
over the last year has mainly been related to less
optimism regarding future developments, rather
than a change in the assessment of the current
situation. Growth in private consumption is
expected to remain dynamic expanding at around
2% both in 2016 and 2017.
Business investment is projected to pick-up in the
next years on the back of recovering external
demand and increasing capacity utilisation. In
view of the high saving rate in the corporate sector,
there is a potential for an even stronger growth in
business investments. Public investment is
expected to continue declining in the coming years
after reaching a historically high level in 2014.

Buoyant labour market

The relatively weak growth of GDP contrasts with
the continued strength of the labour market.
Employment grew by 1.1% in 2015, driven by
private sector employment. Unemployment has
been declining gradually since spring 2012 and fell
to 6.2% in 2015. The good performance of the
labour market is expected to continue over the
forecast horizon. Employment is expected to grow
by around 1% in both years, but the unemployment
rate is forecast to only gradually decline to 5.7% in
2017 due to the expanding labour force.

Gradually rising inflation

Fiscal deficit deteriorates in 2016

Consumer prices (HICP) dropped by 0.3% on an
annual basis in March 2016. Inflation has been
dragged down by the fall of energy prices, which
in March were 5.7% lower than in the same month
a year before. Core inflation, which excludes
energy and unprocessed foods, stood at 0.3% in
March. HICP inflation is expected to increase by
0.3% in 2016 before rising to 1.5% in 2017.

The general government balance posted a deficit of
2.1% of GDP in 2015. The deterioration compared
to 2014 was mainly due to lower one-off revenues
from the pension taxation measure and lower
revenues from the pension yield tax. The drop in
oil prices also had a negative impact on public
revenues. This year, the fiscal deficit is
expected to deteriorate further to 2.5 % of GDP, as
the before-mentioned one-off revenues come to a
halt.

Risks are broadly balanced

Macroeconomic risks to the forecast appear
broadly balanced. Negative risks relate to a
potentially more pronounced slowdown in
emerging markets and commodity-producing
countries. Danish exporters would be primarily
affected due to their position in global value
chains. On the other hand, stronger than expected
private consumption and investments remain a
positive risk, as both household and corporate
savings have remained high despite the fact that
interest rates are very low.

Nevertheless, the structural balance is expected to
improve from a deficit of around 1¾% of GDP in
2015 to deficits of about 1.0% of GDP in 2016 and
2017. The volatile profile of the structural balance
in Denmark is to some extent due to large and
volatile revenue items, such as revenues from oil
and gas production and from the pension yield tax.
The general government gross debt level is
expected to decrease from 40.2% of GDP in 2015
to 39.1% of GDP in 2017.

Solid growth continues, driven by consumption

Economic growth continues to be fuelled mainly by consumption, underpinned by solid fundamentals
and further boosted by temporary factors including low energy prices. Public spending on asylum
seekers implies a lower budget balance for the general government which will support growth. The
current account surplus is expected to remain very high.
Strong start into 2016 followed by deceleration

Real GDP expanded moderately by 0.3% (q-o-q),
seasonally and working-day adjusted) in the fourth
quarter of 2015, thus keeping the pace seen in the
previous quarter. On average, real GDP expanded
by 1.7% in 2015. Annual growth was mostly
driven by private and public consumption with
only a moderate increase in investment. Net
external trade made a small positive contribution
to growth.
Available indicators suggest that economic activity
accelerated somewhat in 2016-Q1 but is likely to
slow down again in 2016-Q2. Industrial production
expanded markedly at the beginning of the year.
The level of survey indicators relating to the
current situation remained favourable, including
for construction, which also benefitted from
relatively mild weather, and for the services sector,
which already drove the expansion in 2015-Q4. By
contrast, confidence in the outlook for business has
deteriorated, pointing to a coming deceleration.
Less optimistic export expectations reflect the
recent weakening in the external environment.
Industrial orders also softened again after their
recovery in 2015-Q4, albeit partly due to volatile
large orders. At the same time, some payback for
the boost from mild weather is expected in
2016-Q2. Nevertheless, the robust labour market,
favourable financing conditions, low energy prices
and additional public spending on the unusually
large number of asylum seekers is set to contribute
to domestic demand-driven growth over the
forecast horizon. Overall, real GDP is expected to
increase by 1.6% in 2016 and 2017. Risks to the
outlook include a further weakening in the external
environment while uncertainty surrounding the
strong inflow of asylum seekers and its economic
impact remains high.

gradual, a slight rise in unemployment is expected
by 2017. Real wages and household purchasing
power should again be boosted by low inflation in
2016. Nominal wage growth is expected to
accelerate again in 2017 after easing slightly in
2016. Overall, private consumption is projected to
continue to grow markedly, also reflecting high
employment, high net immigration, and low
interest rates. Public consumption continues to be
boosted by spending on asylum seekers.

Moderate recovery in business investment

Investment growth accelerated markedly in
2015-Q4. This was partly due to public investment
in machinery and equipment, which includes
defence investment. Private equipment investment
remained weak, partly reflecting sluggish external
demand. A moderate recovery in corporate
investment, however, is expected, amid slowly
rising capacity utilisation and gradually
strengthening external demand over the next
quarters. Housing investment growth is set to
moderate only gradually, also due to the additional
boost from very high net immigration.

Consumption continues to underpin growth

Employment expanded markedly in the first
quarter and further robust increases are expected.
Nevertheless, given that the integration of asylum
seekers into the labour market is likely to be

Current account surplus to remain high

Exports declined in 2015-Q4 and dynamics only
strengthened gradually in 2016-Q1. Moreover, the
external environment is weaker than previously

Member States, Germany

assumed. Together, this suggests only moderate
export growth in 2016 followed by some
acceleration in 2017. Buoyant domestic demand
means that imports should expand more
dynamically. External trade is therefore expected
to exert a substantial drag on growth this year and
detract slightly again in 2017. However, the
current account surplus is set to remain very high,
reflecting further oil price-related improvements in
the terms of trade and still-low investment.

set to accelerate in 2016, due to strong increases in
pension payments as well as higher government
consumption and spending on cash benefits. Public
investment is set to grow as a result of additional
funds earmarked for infrastructure investment and
social housing.

Inflation to pick up only slowly

The dampening effect of oil prices is set to last
until late this year, so headline HICP inflation is
projected to pick up only slightly in 2016 (0.3%)
before accelerating to 1.5% in 2017. Core inflation
(excluding energy and unprocessed food) remains
more dynamic and is set to reaccelerate amid
buoyant domestic demand in spite of some
spillover effects from low energy prices.

Steady in the face of external shocks

Following a slowdown in growth to 1.1% in 2015, Estonia’s economy is expected to regain pace with
growth of 1.9% in 2016 and 2.4% in 2017 as the impact of negative external shocks fades.
Unemployment is set to increase, as businesses react with a lag to 2015’s weak economic activity and
reforms induce work-incapacity pensioners to re-enter the labour market. The fiscal position is
projected to turn slightly below balance in 2016-2017, with public debt below 10% of GDP.
Growth in 2015 was moderate

Growth in exports and imports turns positive

Real GDP growth in Estonia fell to 1.1% in 2015,
from 2.9% in 2014. The fall reflects negative base
effects in the electronics sector, sharply reduced
demand from neighbouring Russia, and low
international oil prices, which affect Estonia’s
shale oil sector. Private consumption boomed,
supported by strong wage increases, income tax
cuts and the absence of consumer price inflation.
At the same time, business investment activity fell
considerably due to weak external demand and the
completion of major energy sector investment
projects. After building up in 2014, inventories
contracted significantly. Net exports made a
positive contribution to growth in 2015, as low
investment reduced import demand.

Exports are expected to grow again in 2016 and
even more so in 2017, as the negative base effect
in the electronics sector disappears and the
negative impact of the Russian crisis fades out.
Service exports in particular are set to ensure a
positive external balance of goods and services
throughout the forecast period. Imports are set to
show positive growth as well, as domestic demand
picks up.

The impact of external shocks is set to wane

Estonia’s income level should soon start catching
up again with the EU average as its real GDP is
forecast to growth by 1.9% this year and by 2.4%
in 2017. While the global outlook remains rather
uncertain, regional demand is expected to grow,
raising Estonia’s capacity utilisation to a point
where businesses will need to invest. The large
contribution of private consumption to growth will
likely diminish in 2016 and 2017 as consumer
price inflation picks up. Domestic demand,
however, is projected to remain the main growth
driver over the forecast horizon.

Risks to the forecast appear quite balanced.
Negative risks relate to a possible delay in the
recovery of neighbouring Russia and Finland. On
the upside, higher demand from other EU Member
States could boost growth more than currently
projected.

Lending to enterprises resumes

Bank lending to enterprises has gathered pace in
recent months. This should underpin the gradual
recovery in enterprise investment this year and
next year, as factors holding back demand are
fading. Public investment should start growing
again in 2017 once disbursements of EU funding
under the new programming period resume.
Household investment is set to accelerate,
supported by rising incomes and favourable
financing terms.

76

Waiting for the work ability reform

Estonia’s working age population is projected to
shrink over the forecast horizon, mainly as a result
of its low birth rate in recent decades. This is
expected to have a dampening effect on the
unemployment rate, which will likely be more than
offset by labour shedding following last year’s
lacklustre economic activity. At the same time, the
work ability reform will enter into force in mid2016, enticing incapacity-for-work pensioners

Member States, Estonia

back to the labour market. As a result, participation
in the labour force, which is already high, is
expected to rise above 70%. Overall, the
unemployment rate is forecast to increase from
6.2% in 2015 to 7.7% in 2017. As a result of the
expected increase in labour supply together with
Estonia’s public sector wage moderation at the
central government level, nominal wage growth is
forecast to stabilize at below 6%. With higher
expected inflation, the gap between real wage
growth and real productivity growth is likely to
close by end-2017.
Inflation is expected to rise swiftly

HICP was almost zero in 2015 but is forecast to
start rising again in 2016 and then to surge to about
2.9% in 2017. The increase is set to be driven by
higher excise tax rates, strong wage growth,
sizeable annual minimum wage increases, and a
gradual pick up in commodity prices.
Favourable fiscal position despite lacklustre
GDP growth

The government’s headline surplus reached 0.4%
of GDP in 2015. Although expenditure growth was
rapid, it was matched by strong revenue growth,

boosted by buoyant household consumption and
one-time revenue windfalls from corporate income
tax. Overall, tax revenue has remained strong in
the first months of 2016, indicating that favourable
conditions for public finances persist. The forecast
period 2016-17 will be impacted by several tax
changes: significantly higher excise taxes on fuels,
tobacco and alcohol; decreased labour taxes; and
reduced resource taxes to support oil shale
companies. On the expenditure side, measures
have been taken to contain government personnel
costs while social spending will be increased
according to the government’s programme. These
measures are expected to have a slightly negative
net effect on the fiscal balance in 2016 and 2017.
Limited deficits of 0.1% and 0.2% of GDP are
projected in 2016 and 2017, especially as the
windfall revenue from corporate income tax will
not accrue again. In structural terms, this should
lead to a balanced fiscal position in 2016 and a
slightly below balance position in 2017. Some
negative risks to the projection could arise from
low energy prices, which might further impact
energy producers and related government revenue.
Also, the significant increase in excise taxes could
prompt a stronger-than-expected decline in retail
sales. Estonia’s public debt is expected to remain
below 10% of GDP in 2016-17.

7. IRELAND

High growth continues, supporting public finances

The Irish economy appears resilient to the recent deceleration in world output. GDP growth is forecast
to remain strong but to settle to more sustainable rates in 2016 and 2017, supporting improvements in
the fiscal position over the forecast horizon. Nevertheless, the still high levels of public and private debt,
and the uncertainty surrounding external economic and policy developments invite some caution.
GDP growth surged again in the last quarter of
2015, while employment growth moderated

In 2015, Ireland’s real GDP grew by 7.8%, much
higher than the euro area average. Growth
accelerated further in 2015-Q4, reaching 9.3% in
annual terms. At the same time, employment grew
by 2.6% over the year, leading to a decline in the
unemployment rate to 9.4% in 2015. However,
employment growth decelerated in 2015-Q4,
despite the surge in GDP, and labour market
participation did not pick up either. Leading
indicators point to resilient economic activity in
the first months of 2016 while the unemployment
rate fell to 8.6% in March.
Headline investment and imports need to be
interpreted with some caution

GDP growth in 2015 was driven by domestic
demand. Private consumption grew by 3.5%, due
to the improving situation in employment and
rising wages, very low consumer price inflation
and the release of pent-up demand for durable
goods after the recession. Total investment grew
by a record 28.2%, in part due to large transfers
(imports) of patents by some multinational
companies to their Irish affiliates. Excluding those
patents and aircraft leases, underlying investment
was still strong, growing at an estimated annual
rate of 20%, thanks to core machinery and
equipment and construction. Exports grew by close
to 14% in 2015, which contrasts with a neutral
contribution of the external sector to GDP growth
over the year. However, this effect was also due to
the large imports of patents by multinationals.
GDP growth and job creation to moderate

Broad-based economic growth is expected to
continue over the forecast horizon, with both
domestic demand components and the external
sector contributing to the consolidation of the
ongoing economic expansion. In 2016, real GDP is
forecast to grow nearly 5% before moderating to
3.7% a year later. At the same time, the ongoing
moderation in employment growth is expected to
continue, with unemployment decreasing at a

78

slower pace than in earlier phases of the recovery,
reaching 7.5% at the end of the forecast horizon.
The labour force is expected to expand moderately,
due to positive demographic effects.
Wages are expected to continue to recover,
helping consumer price inflation

The recovery in wages is expected to continue as
the labour market tightens, though wage growth is
not expected to match the productivity gains of the
past few years. Rising wages should help inflation
turn positive again in 2016 and recover further
thereafter. Domestic price increases, mainly in
services and rents, are expected to contrast again
with price falls for goods, which are heavily
affected by energy prices. House price increases
are expected to moderate while government
measures to boost supply kick-in.

Risks to this forecast are tilted to the downside,
mainly due to external factors, to which Ireland is
particularly exposed as an open economy, such as
a deceleration in demand from trading partners.
Conversely, investment in construction could turn
out higher than expected, boosting job creation and
overall domestic demand further.
High nominal GDP growth in 2015 helped the
deficit shrink more than expected

In 2015, the general government deficit fell
sharply to 2.3% of GDP from 3.8% in 2014. Net of

Member States, Ireland

a one-off transaction, related to the restructuring of
a state-owned bank’s capital base, the deficit
would have dropped further to 1.3% of GDP. (61)
Compared with the winter forecast, this betterthan-expected net deficit turnout stems from
several reasons: i) nominal GDP growth was
higher than expected; ii) about one fifth of the
extra-budget approved in October 2015 was not
ultimately spent; iii) the emergence of an
unexpected surplus at local-authority level.
The improvement in the deficit compared to 2014
reflects the exceptional rebound of the Irish
economy. Tax revenues increased by 9.3% (y-o-y),
fuelled by an unprecedented surge in corporate tax
receipts, which were up by 50% for the year.
Despite increases in public wages and intermediate
consumption, current primary expenditure’s share
in GDP fell by 3 pps. to 28.7%. Public investment,
already at a historical low, decreased by 0.3 pps. to
1.8% of GDP. Due to low market interest rates and
the early repayment of IMF loans, debt interest
costs were about 10% lower than in 2014.
(61)

Given the accounting treatment of the conversion of part of
the government’s preference shares in Allied Irish Banks
into ordinary stock, in preparation for their planned sale.

The improved fiscal position in 2015 is forecast
to carry-over into 2016 and beyond

Despite further tax cuts and expenditure increases
of about EUR 1.5 billion (0.7% of GDP) in the
2016 budget, the general government deficit is
expected to drop further this year to 1.1% of GDP
on the back of strong economic growth. Cash
returns for the first quarter have been positive.
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the
deficit is expected to narrow to 0.6% of GDP in
2017. Risks to this fiscal forecast are on the
downside, mainly reflecting policy uncertainty and
risks to the global economic outlook.
The structural deficit is expected to improve over
the forecast horizon reaching around 2% and 1%
of GDP in 2016 and 2017 respectively, down from
about 2¾% of GDP in 2014. Government debt is
projected to continue falling. In 2015, it dropped
by 13.7 pps. of GDP to 93.8% of GDP, down from
107.5% in 2014 largely due to the surge in nominal
GDP, the sales of state assets and sizeable primary
surpluses in a low interest environment. By 2017,
government debt is projected to fall to 86.6% of
GDP, contingent on still robust GDP growth and
the realisation of primary budget surpluses of more
than 2% of GDP both in 2016 and 2017.

8. GREECE

Growth to return in the second half of the year

The Greek economy demonstrated a remarkable resilience in 2015, reflecting inelastic private
consumption and a positive contribution of net exports. Growth is expected to resume in the second half
of 2016 and to pick up in 2017 thanks to the return of confidence and the impact of structural reforms.
Following stronger than expected public finances in 2015 and the additional fiscal package currently
finalised by the Authorities, the general government balance is expected to improve further.
Economy more resilient than expected in 2015

Real GDP in 2015 turned out to be slightly
negative, at -0.2% that is over 1 pp. better than
expected after the imposition of capital controls in
July 2015. Economic activity was backed by the
surprising resilience of private consumption,
positive net exports and by an acceleration of
public investment at the end of the year.
Growth to return in the second half of 2016

Greece’s real GDP is forecast to contract by 0.3%
in 2016, slightly less than expected in the winter
forecast, as the adverse trends in the second half of
2015 turned out more moderate than projected.
Domestic demand is projected to mainly drive the
contraction. While fiscal consolidation should
continue to weigh on household disposable
income, the fall in public and private consumption
is expected to be partly offset by a positive
contribution of net exports backed by another good
year for tourism and positive trends in the export
of goods. Investment is projected to slightly
decrease as a result of inert credit conditions.
Subsiding uncertainties following the conclusion
of the first review of the ESM programme should
support the gradual relaxation of capital controls
and fuel investment. The economy is expected to
start growing again in the second half of 2016 and
should gather strength in 2017 as domestic demand
accelerates with the help of EU structural funds,
and of liquidity injected via the clearance of
government arrears.
Greece’s current account deficit has been
improving since 2011 and it is expected to turn
positive in 2016, as past and ongoing structural
reforms improve external competitiveness.
Unemployment fell in 2015 and is projected to
continue declining over the forecast horizon, amid
marked declines in wage growth and significant
reforms over recent years, the gradual recovery of
the economy, and employment schemes promoting
labour participation. HICP deflation continued in
2015 and prices are projected to fall further in

80

2016 - albeit at a moderate pace - as the impact of
lower oil prices and weak demand are expected to
outweigh the inflationary impact of a VAT hike.
HICP inflation is projected to turn positive in
2017.
Uncertainties around the forecast remain large.
The projected recovery is contingent on the timely
conclusion of the first review of the ESM
programme, as well as positive financial market
and trade developments. Upside risks could come
from a faster-than-expected pick-up in business
and consumer confidence. The downside risks are
related to a failure to fully deliver on the reform
programme, a higher-than-expected negative
impact of the refugee crisis on trade and tourism,
as well as the slowdown in global trade.

Robust consolidation package to ensure
public finances reach medium-term targets

The resilience of the economy, the fiscal
consolidation in the second half of 2015 and
certain large positive one-off factors helped Greece
achieve - according to the programme
definition (62) - a primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP
in 2015, overachieving the primary balance target

primary balance targets, the headline deficit is
projected to fall to 3.1% of GDP in 2016 and 1.8%
of GDP in 2017.

Notwithstanding the over-performance in 2015,
additional savings are envisaged by the
government, amounting cumulatively to 3% of
GDP through 2018, in order to reach the
programme’s primary surplus targets of 0.5% of
GDP in 2016, 1.75% of GDP in 2017 and 3.5% of
GDP in 2018.

The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase from
176.9% in 2015 to 182.8% in 2016 due to the
clearance of arrears which was postponed from
2015 to 2016 and to programme disbursements
taking place in 2016 instead of 2015 given past
delays
in

The
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to start declining in

The adjustment package includes 1% of GDP from
a comprehensive reform of the pension system, 1%
of GDP from personal income tax reform, ¼% of
GDP from changes in the VAT standard rate, ¾%

consumption taxes, primarily on energy products,

Downside risks to the fiscal forecast include
spending from the refugee crisis, as well as
possible delays in the implementation of the
reforms with a budgetary impact. Upside risks
stem mainly from revenue administration reforms
and revenue buoyancy in light of the strong
revenue collection witnessed in the second half of
2015.

Growth to ease but remain robust

Economic growth is set to continue easing but to remain robust, underpinned by sustained job creation
and declining unemployment, improved financing conditions and low oil prices. Inflation is expected to
remain negative in the short term due to falling energy prices. The general government deficit is
expected to narrow, mainly thanks to the economic recovery.
Robust expansion set to continue

Economic growth remained robust in the fourth
quarter of 2015 at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, which
led the economy to expand by 3.2% in the year as
a whole, driven by domestic demand. GDP growth
in the first quarter of 2016 was likely slightly
slower at around 0.7%. Growth appears to be
losing some momentum as reflected by the
Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) but it is set to
maintain a robust pace over the forecast horizon on
the back of positive labour market developments,
improved access to credit for firms and
households, and low oil prices. The drag on
domestic demand from private sector deleveraging
is expected to fade out. Accordingly, Spain’s
economy is forecast to grow by 2.6% and 2.5% in
2016 and 2017, respectively.

negative for growth in 2016, before turning
broadly neutral in 2017. The current account
surplus is forecast to widen slightly further to 1.5%
of GDP in 2016 and to narrow thereafter, to 1.3%
of GDP in 2017, due to the deterioration of the
terms of trade. Net external lending is expected to
remain above 2% of GDP throughout the forecast
horizon.

Although private consumption is expected to
decelerate throughout 2016, it is set to remain the
main growth driver over the forecast horizon,
supported by low inflation and steadily improving
labour market conditions. The increase in gross
disposable income is expected to allow households
to increase their savings rate in 2016 and 2017,
albeit only slightly.
Although displaying a decelerating profile over the
year, equipment investment is also forecast to
maintain healthy growth rates over the forecast
horizon, underpinned by positive demand
prospects, supportive financing conditions and a
projected rebound in exports in 2017. Construction
investment is forecast to lose momentum in 2016
but to accelerate in 2017. The expected
deceleration in 2016 would be explained by nonresidential
construction,
especially
public
investment. Residential investment looks set to
gather strength steadily.
Export growth is expected to slow down in 2016,
especially for goods, due to the projected
weakening of Spain’s main export markets. While

The fall in oil and energy prices are expected to
keep dominating inflation developments in the
short term. Hence, headline inflation is forecast at
−0.1% in 2016, whereas core inflation is expected
to remain positive though moderate over the
forecast horizon, due to low external price
pressures and remaining slack in the economy. In
2017, headline inflation is forecast to return to
positive territory.
Employment growth keeps moderating

Job creation decelerated moderately in the first
quarter of 2016. While this trend is expected to
continue over the forecast period, employment is
still projected to record high growth rates, above
2% over the forecast horizon. Despite expected
moderate wage dynamics, unit labour costs are
forecast to increase on the back of low productivity
increases. In turn, the unemployment rate, which
amounted to 20.9% of the labour force in the last

Member States, Spain

quarter of 2015, is expected to continue falling to
some 18% by 2017.
The amount of fiscal policy measures needed to
correct the budgetary slippage registered in 2015
add to the downside risks to the growth forecast
stemming mainly from the uncertainty surrounding
the formation of the new government.
Deficit reduction driven by the recovery

Driven by strong economic growth, Spain’s
general government deficit continued to decline in
2015. The full-year deficit narrowed from 5.9% of
GDP in 2014 to 5.1% in 2015. Despite cuts in
personal income taxes, total tax revenues held up
well, helped by a strong recovery in domestic
demand and corporate tax revenues. Government
expenditure picked up in the second half of the
year, with notable increases in compensation of
employees and public investment. About 0.3% of
GDP of the full-year deficit stems from one-off
factors that are not expected to spill over to 2016
(0.2 pps. due to a reclassification of assets of
public-private-partnerships on the government’s
balance sheet and 0.1 pps. due to support to the
financial sector). Spain’s general government
deficit is expected to narrow to 3.9% of GDP in

2016 and is projected to reach 3.1% of GDP in
2017. The reduction of the deficit relies to a large
extent on the positive macroeconomic outlook,
which is expected to continue supporting tax
revenues and keeping social transfers in check. In
particular, while pension expenditure is expected
to continue rising, falling unemployment should
reduce the growth of social transfers in the near
future. Previous improvements in financing
conditions and the decelerating public debt ratio
imply that interest expenditure is likely to continue
to fall. Finally, the forecast assumes savings of
about 0.3% of GDP in 2016 from the recently
announced measures aimed at reining in spending
at central and regional government level. These
savings, part of which is assumed to decrease
expenditure also in 2017, are subject to
implementation risks, as they require active
involvement by different tiers of government and
strict enforcement.
After deteriorating significantly in 2015, Spain’s
structural deficit is expected to increase further by
around ¼ pps. over the forecast period, to 3¼% of
GDP in 2017. Thanks to a narrowing deficit and
relatively strong nominal GDP growth, the public
debt ratio is expected to peak in 2016 at 100.3% of
GDP before falling back to 99.6% in 2017.

10. FRANCE

Moving slowly towards a more self-sustained recovery

France’s economic activity is forecast to continue accelerating, as a dynamic household purchasing
power is expected to sustain private consumption and investment is projected to pick up gradually.
However, net exports are set to remain a drag on growth in 2016. The government’s headline deficit is
expected to decrease slightly, but the general government debt will continue to rise.
After three years of weak activity, GDP increased
by 1.2% in 2015, supported by favourable external
factors. Growth was primarily driven by private
consumption, benefitting from low oil prices.
However, the contraction in the construction sector
weighed on GDP growth for the fourth consecutive
year, offsetting the positive contribution from
equipment investment. Despite the depreciation of
the euro and relatively strong export growth, net
exports contributed negatively to growth in 2015.

purchasing power, which is still supported by low
oil prices and recovering labour income.
Investment is forecast to gradually pick up.
Equipment investment is accelerating, in a context
of improving profit margins and low interest rates,
while construction investment is expected to
recover, as suggested by the improvement in
building permits and housing starts. The recovery
in investment is key in the transition towards a
more self-sustained growth path.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Despite the past depreciation of the euro, net
exports are expected to remain a drag on growth in
2016, as imports remain dynamic and exports are
expected to fall short of their exceptional
performance of 2015.
Risks remain skewed to the downside, as
inventories could contribute more negatively to
growth than expected in the coming quarters and
because the expected recovery in investment relies
on further improvement in business confidence,
which still has to materialise.

Resilient private consumption and recovering
investment support a pick-up in growth

Unemployment set to decline while inflation
gradually recovers

Real GDP growth is expected to pick up in 2016 to
1.3% and then rise further in 2017 to 1.7%, driven
by domestic demand. Although the fiscal impulse
is expected to become less restrictive over the
forecast horizon, growth is projected to be held
back by the deterioration in the external
environment in 2016. At the same time, the
support from inventories is expected to fade, as
inventories as a share of GDP at the end of 2015
reached their highest level in almost 40 years.

The moderate pace of GDP growth is likely to
induce limited job creation over the forecast
horizon and the labour force is projected to
continue growing dynamically. The ‘emergency
plan for employment’ announced in January is
expected to temporarily shift a part of the labour
force into training, translating into a decrease in
the unemployment rate to 10.2% in 2016. A further
slight growth-driven decline of the unemployment
rate is projected for 2017.

Private consumption is expected to accelerate
slightly in 2016. After a temporary decline in the
fourth quarter of 2015, in part due to the mild
temperatures and to the November terrorist attacks,
household consumption is expected to have
markedly rebounded in the first quarter of 2016.
More fundamentally, private consumption is set to
remain resilient, on the back of dynamic household

Amid continuously low energy and commodity
prices, inflation is expected to further decline in
the second quarter before recovering slowly.
Inflation is thus expected to average 0.1% over
2016, before increasing to 1.0% in 2017 as the
output gap is forecast to close and gradually
increasing energy prices and wages exert upward
pressure on inflation.

Member States, France

GDP in 2015, the structural balance is expected to
remain unchanged in 2016.

The gradual reduction of the deficit continues

In 2015, the headline deficit reached 3.5% of GDP,
0.5 pps. below the level of 2014. This better-thanexpected outcome is due to a reduction in the
deficit of the State and social security and to an
improvement in the financial situation of local
governments. Local investment contracted due to
the electoral cycle and local operating expenditures
slowed down. The debt interest charge was also
substantially lower in 2015.
In 2016, the headline deficit is set to decrease by
only 0.1 pps. to 3.4% of GDP, as the impact of the
higher nominal growth and the better-thanexpected deficit outturn in 2015 is largely offset by
the additional measures announced since the 2016
budget and by the negative impact of low inflation
on government finances. The 2016 stability
programme specifies the consolidation measures
and additional savings planned to finance the
‘emergency plan for employment’, the measures
for farmers and the wage increases for civil
servants. Finally, the forecast for 2016 does not
include the planned savings from the forthcoming
reform of the unemployment insurance scheme as
negotiations between social partners are still
ongoing. After improving by around ⅓ pps. of

The headline deficit in 2017 is set to decrease to
3.2% of GDP under the no-policy-change
assumption. Revenue growth is expected to
accelerate to 2.3% with the impact of stronger
economic growth being partly offset by the further
roll-out of the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact.
The government has announced that a total of
EUR 24.8 bn expenditure savings would be
implemented in 2017. Based on the information
available at the cut-off date, the forecast
incorporates EUR 12.4 bn of these savings. This
amount does not take into account the additional
measures announced to compensate the impact of
lower inflation and the new spending initiatives
decided in the course of 2016, as well as the
planned savings from the reform of the
unemployment insurance scheme, as these
measures are not yet sufficiently specified. The
structural balance is expected to deteriorate by
⅓ pps. of GDP.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to further increase to 97.0% by 2017.
Downside risks relate to a stronger-than-expected
impact of low inflation on the deficit.

11. CROATIA

Domestic demand becomes the main driver of moderate growth

The pace of the recovery decelerated in the last quarter of 2015 as the positive impact of a record
tourism season faded away and public investment contracted more than expected. In 2016, the economy
is set to grow by 1.8% and accelerate to 2.1% in 2017. As the fall in energy prices is transmitted to
retail, the price level is projected to decline by 0.6% in 2016 before rebounding in 2017. The deficit fell
by more than expected in 2015 and is forecast to improve further this year and next.
Growth to resume at a slow pace following the
disappointing fourth quarter of 2015

Croatia’s real GDP expanded by 1.6% in 2015, the
first year of positive growth since 2008. The
negative reading of real GDP growth in 2015-Q4,
at -0.5% (q-o-q), weakened the momentum for
growth into 2016. However, high frequency
indicators suggest that economic activity picked up
again in the early months of 2016.
Looking ahead, GDP growth is set to reach 1.8%
in 2016 and slightly accelerate in 2017, driven by
domestic demand. Tailwinds stemming from low
energy prices and a recovering labour market
underpin a robust growth in household disposable
income. However, with a depressed real estate
market and falling prices, deleveraging pressures
are not expected to ease substantially in the short
term, leading to an overall modest increase in
consumption. Investment is set to gather pace,
driven by a rebound in public investment. Private
investment is set to grow only mildly, under the
impact of deleveraging.
The current account surplus is expected to
decrease slightly but remain high

The outlook for the external environment
deteriorated markedly in the first months of 2016.
As a result, growth of exports of goods is expected
to decelerate, with market share gains for Croatian
exporters to the EU set to progressively stabilise.
After a record year for the tourism sector in 2015,
service exports are set to register a more modest
increase in 2016 and 2017. Imports of goods and
services are projected to slightly outpace exports in
both years, implying a neutral contribution to
growth. Stronger import growth is set to be
partially offset by improving terms of trade in
2016.
The balance of primary incomes is projected to
deteriorate in 2016, as the profits of foreign-owned
banks recover from the effects of the conversion of

86

Swiss franc-denominated loans. By contrast, the
balance of secondary incomes is forecast to
improve on account of a further rise in the use of
EU investment funding. On the whole, the current
account balance is set to decrease to 4.4% of GDP
in 2016 and further decline in 2017.

Unemployment is set to further fall – and so are
prices

Modest employment growth is set to bring a
reduction in the unemployment rate of about
0.8 pps. in both 2016 and 2017. Nominal
compensation of employees is expected to resume
growing above productivity, leading to a small
increase in unit labour costs.
The decision of the authorities to reduce gas tariffs
as of April 2016 adds to the deflationary pressures
from commodity prices. HICP inflation is expected
to fall by about 0.6% in 2016 and to return to
positive territory in 2017. In such a low inflation
environment, wage growth is expected to remain
subdued.
Risks to this forecast are skewed to the downside,
and are related to the still high debt burden in both
the public and private sectors and uncertainty
regarding the progress in the reform agenda.

Member States, Croatia

The general government deficit dropped in
2015 and is set to continue improving mildly

assumption, the general government deficit is
projected to decrease to 2.3% of GDP in 2017.

The general government deficit decreased to 3.2%
of GDP in 2015, down from 5.5% of GDP in 2014.
The main driver of the sizeable improvement was a
22% drop in public investment. This, together with
a further reduction in public subsidies and the
wage bill, resulted in a slight decrease in general
government expenditure in nominal terms.
Revenue grew by a solid 4.4%, mainly on account
of strong growth in indirect taxes. On the back of
these developments, the primary balance turned to
a surplus of 0.4% of GDP in 2015.

The deficit projection for 2016 is subject to
considerable risks. These are related, in particular,
to the ongoing renegotiation of collective wage
agreements in the public sector, the continued
uncertainty about the impact of the CHF loan
conversion legislation and a possible stronger
rebound of investment activity in public
corporations classified in the general government
sector, following the sharp adjustment in 2015.

In 2016, the general government deficit is
projected to improve further to 2.7% of GDP.
Revenues are set to be positively affected by the
reduction of a corporate tax allowance for
reinvested earnings, the residual impact of the
hikes in excise taxes in 2015 and the announced
increase in the supplementary health insurance
premium. These measures are expected to partly
offset the 0.3% of GDP fallout of the corporate
income tax due to the impact of the conversion of
CHF loans on profits in the banking sector. The
budget outlines moderate restraints for most
spending categories. Under a no-policy-change

In 2015 the structural balance is estimated to have
improved by nearly 2 pps. of GDP to about -1¾%
but is expected to deteriorate in 2016 and 2017.
The debt-to-GDP ratio increased moderately in
2015 to 86.7%, as the authorities were able to
finance part of their borrowing needs from
accumulated deposits. At the same time, public
debt was revised upwards by around 1.4% of GDP
due to the recording of the assets related to a
concession contract for the construction of
motorways on the government balance sheet.
Supported by the strengthening primary surplus,
public debt is expected to peak at 87.6% of GDP in
2016 and to decline slightly in 2017.

12. ITALY

Moderate growth to continue

The recovery of the Italian economy is projected to continue in 2016 and 2017 as domestic demand
growth picks up. Employment is forecast to keep on growing and inflation to remain subdued also due to
limited labour cost pressures. In 2016, the government budget balance is projected to decline slightly
and the debt-to-GDP ratio to remain stable before starting to decrease in 2017.
The cyclical recovery is set to continue

In 2015, real GDP in Italy grew by 0.8%, halting
the economic slump that followed the sovereign
debt crisis. The recovery was supported by positive
external factors including a weaker euro and lower
oil prices. Yet, over the course of 2015, the pace of
growth declined and resulted in a lower-thanexpected carry-over for 2016. This, together with a
further slowdown in global trade, mainly explains
the downward revision of GDP growth for 2016 to
1.1% compared to 1.4% in the winter forecast. In
particular, exports are expected to grow at a slower
pace, while domestic demand becomes the main
driver of growth. Low inflation, increasing
employment and tax cuts are set to support real
household disposable income and thus private
consumption. The recovery in construction is
supported by the Investment Plan for Europe (e.g.
EUR 1.4 bn EFSI financing eight projects already
approved by March 2016, triggering investment
for EUR 4.8 bn). New equipment investment is set
to pick-up as demand strengthens, spare capacity
wanes and profit margins increase. Sound nonfinancial corporations are in a position to selffinance investments as they have been net lenders
in the economy since 2012 and their deleveraging
needs have diminished. Although non-performing
loans still burden bank balance sheets, credit
conditions are set to continue improving in 2016.
In fact, the stock of credit to households and
manufacturing firms has been increasing since
mid-2015. Economic expansion is set to continue
in 2017 at 1.3%, thanks to more dynamic external
demand and investment. The current account
surplus is set to remain above 2% of GDP over the
forecast horizon. A further slowdown in global
demand and persistent uncertainty holding back
new investment are the main downside risks.
Employment increases

A three-year social contribution exemption for new
permanent hires supported the increase in
headcount employment in 2015. The 2016
Stability Law extends this scheme to new
permanent hires made in 2016 but with a less

88

generous social contribution reduction. As the
recovery gathers strength, employment is projected
to continue increasing in 2016 and 2017 but more
in terms of working hours than in terms of
headcount. The unemployment rate is set to
decline only gradually in 2016 and 2017, also
because previously discouraged workers are
expected to eventually reintegrate into the labour
force. Upward pressure on labour costs is projected
to remain limited also thanks to cuts to the labour
tax wedge. Moreover, increases in real wages
realised over recent years on the back of lowerthan-expected inflation are supposed to be taken
into account in future bargaining rounds. Moderate
wage dynamics and improving labour productivity
imply broadly flat nominal unit labour costs and
some recovery in competitiveness.

Inflation remains low

In 2015, HICP inflation was 0.1%, since the fall in
imported energy prices offset the moderately
positive core inflation (0.7%). HICP inflation is
expected at 0.2% in 2016, as oil prices remain low,
and to accelerate to 1.4% in 2017. This is also due
to a partial incorporation of the VAT hike
legislated by the 2016 Stability Law to achieve the
2017 budgetary targets (see below). A similar
pattern is anticipated for core inflation (0.5% in
2016 and 1.2% in 2017), driven by very limited
wage pressures and some recovery in profit
margins, which were squeezed during the crisis.

Member States, Italy

A supportive fiscal stance

In 2015, the government deficit fell to 2.6% of
GDP, down from 3.0% in 2014. Current primary
expenditure stabilised in nominal terms. Public
investment bottomed out after five years of
contraction, while one-off outlays affected capital
transfer dynamics markedly. On the revenue side,
the improving economic outlook translated into
positive developments for personal and corporate
income tax revenues. VAT revenues benefited
from discretionary measures to increase tax
compliance, while the tax wedge on labour
declined. The structural balance marginally
improved in 2015. In 2016, the supportive nature
of the 2016 Stability Law explains the fact that the
headline deficit declines marginally (to 2.4% of
GDP) despite a drop in interest expenditure and
improving cyclical conditions. As a result, the
structural balance is expected to worsen by more
than ½ pps. of GDP in 2016. Current primary
expenditure is expected to increase by around
1.5% (y-o-y) in nominal terms, as compensation of
public employees is anticipated to increase for the
first time since 2010 due to new hiring in
education and higher wages in the security sector.
Moreover, additional social benefits also due to
new measures to fight poverty are set to affect
current transfers, while past reforms curb the

increase in pension expenditure to around 1%
year-on-year. Public investment is set to slightly
rise again, while capital transfers decline sharply
due to lower one-offs. Outlays related to the
migrant influx are estimated by the government at
around 0.2% of GDP in 2016, 0.04 pps. higher
than in 2015. On the revenue side, current taxes
are forecast to increase much less than nominal
GDP growth, mainly due to further cuts to the
labour tax wedge and the abolition of property
taxation on primary residences. This is partially
compensated by higher one-off capital taxes
related to the so-called ‘voluntary disclosure’ of
assets held abroad. Based on a no-policy-change
assumption, the headline deficit is projected to
decline to 1.9% of GDP in 2017, implying a
neutral fiscal stance. The forecast for 2017
includes around half of the 0.9% of GDP VAT
hike legislated at end-2015. The government
committed to repeal it; however this repeal is
conditional upon the identification in the next
Stability Law of the compensatory measures
needed to achieve the planned 1.8% of GDP deficit
target (from a trend of 1.4% that includes the full
VAT hike). After the peak reached in 2015, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is set to stabilise in 2016 and to
start decreasing in 2017 thanks to higher nominal
growth and primary surplus.

13. CYPRUS

Labour market conditions improve as real GDP growth picks up

Growth has resumed in Cyprus and is expected to slowly gain strength with labour market conditions
improving in parallel. The economy continues to benefit from low energy prices. Service exports, in
particular tourism, appear resilient to the challenging external environment. The general government
balance is also expected to improve, supporting debt reduction.
Resuming growth and improving labour market

Cyprus’ economy emerged from recession in 2015,
with real GDP growth reaching 1.6%. In 2015,
nominal spending by households stabilised but
declining consumer prices allowed households to
consume more in real terms, providing a
significant boost to real GDP growth. Investment,
particularly in transport equipment, increased
rapidly in 2015, mainly reflecting an elevated
number of ship-registrations, which, however, was
completely offset by an associated increase in
imports of ships. The weaker euro, combined with
ongoing structural reforms in the tourism sector,
provided significant support to service exports.
Labour market conditions improved but continued
slack in the economy and declining energy prices
kept HICP inflation in negative territory in 2015.
Real GDP growth is forecast to gradually pick
up

Real GDP growth is forecast to remain broadly
unchanged in 2016 before picking up to 2.0% in
2017. The support from declining consumer prices
and the weaker euro is expected to abate. Debt
servicing is expected to increase, due to a higher
pace of restructuring of bad loans. This should
help reduce non-performing loans but weigh on
private consumption. Investment should benefit
from the recent stabilisation of the housing market
and a further normalisation of credit intermediation
to businesses. Investment activity should
nevertheless remain constrained by the high
deleveraging needs of the economy. Furthermore,
following the large ship-registrations in 2015,
investment growth is expected to slow down in
2016.
Despite headwinds from the external environment,
export growth is forecast to strengthen further. The
strong growth in the tourism sector observed in
2015 has extended into the first part of 2016,
benefitting from geopolitical tensions in
neighbouring countries. Bookings from British
tourists appear strong despite the depreciation of

90

the pound. In 2017, growth should gain further
strength.

Labour market conditions in Cyprus are forecast to
improve further. Wage growth is expected to
remain moderate, as suggested by the recent
collective agreement for the hotel industry. Oil
prices continue to remain low and are forecast to
weigh further on energy prices in 2016, due to base
effects. Excluding the more volatile components
such as energy and unprocessed food, consumer
prices are forecast to decline marginally in 2016.
As the downward pressure from energy prices
abates and demand picks up, HICP inflation is
forecast to return to positive territory in 2017.
Risks remain broadly balanced

On the upside, declining consumer prices could
support consumption and exports more than
expected. On the downside, the continued
weakening of external demand and developments
in the pound sterling may weigh more on export
growth than envisaged. The modest improvements
in labour market conditions and the slow pace of
reducing non-performing loans in the banking
sector may lead to a prolonged period of tight
credit conditions, which would dampen the
recovery.

Member States, Cyprus

Strong fiscal performance continues

In 2015, the general government primary balance
continued to improve. It reached a surplus of 1.8%
of GDP, with a general government deficit of
1.0%. This incorporates a one-off effect from the
2015
recapitalisation
of
cooperatives
(1% of GDP). Excluding the effect of banking
recapitalisations, in 2015, the primary balance
improved marginally (by 0.2 pps. of GDP to
2.8%), on the back of continued control on public
expenditure and despite negative factors beyond
the control of the government, notably new
location rules regarding VAT on e-commerce
services, lower taxes on interest due to reduced
deposit rates and a decrease in dividend income
from the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC). In
parallel with the primary balance, the headline
balance also improved marginally (by 0.2 pps. of
GDP to 0.0%).
The general government primary surplus,
excluding the effect of banking recapitalisation, is
forecast to decrease to 2.2% in 2016 and then
increase to 2.4% of GDP in 2017. The decrease in
2016 is largely driven by a drop in revenue related
to the continued normalisation in the banking
sector. Given the expected continued reduction in

deposit interest rates, taxes on interest are forecast
to continue to fall. The reduced level of the
emergency liquidity assistance is expected to
continue reducing CBC dividend income. (63) In
2017, the improvement in the general government
primary surplus is largely based on the improving
economic outlook. In 2016, total primary
expenditure is expected to remain constrained by
the continued freeze of pensions and wages, while
in 2017, this expenditure is expected to grow by
less than the nominal economic activity due to the
revised mechanism of its indexation. In 2016 and
2017, interest expenditure is forecast to decrease.
The structural balance in 2016 is expected to
worsen, as it is less supported by the cyclical
component, reflected in the output gap. The latter
narrows in 2016 and eventually turns positive in
2017. The headline balance improves by less than
the economic cycle.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to gradually
decline, reaching 105.4% in 2017. This reduction
is supported by economic growth and primary
surpluses.
(63)

The dividend distribution is to be in line with the Treaties
(on the European Union and the Functioning of the
European Union) and the ESCB and ECB Statute.

14. LATVIA

Growth shifts further towards domestic demand

Economic growth is expected to pick up marginally in 2016 and slightly faster in 2017 driven by strong
domestic demand. The labour market is expected to improve accordingly but the potential for further job
creation faces structural restraints. The fiscal situation remains sound, although headline figures are
affected by temporary factors.
Growth to pick up slowly

Economic growth improved to 2.7% in 2015 from
2.4% in 2014, supported by strong domestic
demand. Although the latest short-term indicators
point to setbacks in some business sectors, further
improvements in consumption and investment are
expected to push up growth to 2.8% in 2016 and
3.1% in 2017. The short-term outlook is also
supported by a slight improvement in economic
sentiment. The risks to the forecast appear broadly
balanced as the uncertain external environment and
the reported slowdown in the use of EU funds are
offset by a more positive outlook for Latvia’s
major trading partners in the EU, a fading negative

set to regain momentum. Among business sectors,
the outlook in construction and transit cargo
services has deteriorated over the past months
while continuous improvement in tourism and a
recent upturn in energy utilities are set to make a
positive contribution to growth.
External balance set to deteriorate

Imports are projected to rise faster than exports
over the forecast horizon as domestic demand is
expected to grow faster than demand from trading
partners. However, the negative balance of trade in
goods and services is set to increase only
marginally in relation to GDP. In 2016,
the nominal balance should also benefit from
cheap energy imports. Nevertheless, the
announced plans for repatriating banking sector
profits are expected to widen significantly the
current-account deficit in 2016. The deficit is then
expected to correct downwards in 2017 in the
absence of one-offs but still deteriorating in
relation to 2015.

Income, energy prices boost demand

On the demand side of the economy, private
consumption is supported by high income growth
and low energy prices. Investments are to some
extent restrained by the slower-than-expected use
of EU funds but on the other hand bank funding is
picking up after a very strong rebound in new
loans in the second half of 2015. Nevertheless, a
more significant acceleration in investment is
projected for 2017 when EU-funded projects are

Headline inflation (HICP) is projected to remain at
0.2% in 2016 as low energy prices are fully
offsetting the counteracting income effects. Core
inflation, though still indirectly affected by energy
prices, is forecast at around 1% in 2016. The
appreciation of the euro in the first months of 2016
is also contributing to the very low rate of
inflation. With the assumed rebound in oil prices,
both headline and core inflation rates are expected
to increase to about 2% in 2017.
Job creation expected to slow down

The unemployment rate dropped from 10.8% in
2014 to 9.9% in 2015. However, it is forecast to
decline less rapidly than previously envisaged to
9.6% in 2016 and 9.3% in 2017, as job creation is
facing serious structural restraints. In addition to
the decline in the working-age population, some
sectors are reporting increasing shortages of skilled
workers. On the other hand, the government is

Member States, Latvia

committed to expanding active labour market
policies aimed at reducing structural deficiencies.
Wage growth is expected to slow down marginally
in 2016 linked to a much weaker minimum wage
adjustment than in previous years. Consequently,
the growth in unit labour costs is forecast to
weaken in 2016.
Stable fiscal outlook

The general government deficit stood at 1.3% of
GDP in 2015. The strong central government cash
returns for 2015 were supplemented by a positive
surprise from local governments and by positive
cash-accrual adjustments. However, the previously
unaccounted public-private partnership project of
the State Revenue Service building was recorded
in 2015 leading to a one time increase in the deficit
of 0.3% of GDP.
In 2016, the government deficit is projected to
improve to 1.0 % of GDP. (64) Tax revenue growth
is underpinned by the pick-up in the private
consumption and the strong wage growth, as well
as a range of revenue-increasing measures in 2016

and 2017. The updated government plans
demonstrate slightly higher growth in social
benefits and purchases of goods and services,
while capital expenditure is projected to be lower,
due to delays in new EU-funded projects.
For 2017, revenue is projected to benefit from the
higher GDP growth, as well as the introduction of
the minimum social contribution and measures
improving tax collection. On the expenditure side,
capital expenditure is projected to accelerate once
the implementation phase for EU-funded projects
begins. A strong growth in current spending on
wages, social transfers and public purchases is
projected to continue, based on a no-policy change
assumption.
The structural deficit is forecast to remain at
around 1½% of GDP over 2016 and 2017.
The general government debt declined to 36% of
GDP at the end of 2015. While operational cash
balances are expected to stay low, the authorities
plan to pre-finance a large bond redemption in
early 2017, as a safeguard against external
uncertainty. Therefore, Latvia’s public debt-toGDP ratio is projected to increase to 39.8% at the
end of 2016 before declining to 35.6% in 2017.

Growth balances as exports recover

GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to around 3% in 2016 and 2017 on the back of strong private
consumption and recovering exports. Investment growth is expected to slow down in 2016 as the new
cycle of EU-funded projects still gathers pace. Tightening labour market conditions and accelerating
wage growth are expected to drive inflation in 2016, while external price pressures remain weak. The
improvement in public finances is set to stall in 2016.

2015 ends on a positive note

Real GDP growth in Lithuania accelerated to 1.9%
(y-o-y) in the fourth quarter of 2015 to reach 1.6%
annually. While domestic demand exceeded initial
expectations considerably, plummeting demand
from outside the EU caused exports to disappoint.
A surge in EU fund disbursements fuelled rapid
investment growth in 2015. At the same time,
increasing competition for labour ensured robust
wage growth, while falling energy and food prices
further supported real disposable incomes.

Private consumption and exports to carry
growth in 2016

GDP growth is forecast to accelerate from 1.6% in
2015 to 2.8% in 2016, driven by solid private
consumption and recovering exports. A further
pick-up in exports and recovery in investment are
expected to lift real GDP growth to 3.1% in 2017.
Supported by strong wage growth, private
consumption is expected to remain the main
growth driver. Over the forecast horizon this will
weaken due to slowing employment growth and
recovering inflation. Following the strong showing
in 2015, investment growth is bound to slow down
due to lower disbursements from EU funds. This
will be partially be counterbalanced by strong

94

Strong import demand from the main EU trading
partners is forecast to drive export growth in 2016,
while the drag from the continuing recession in
Russia and other CIS countries is foreseen to be
milder than in 2015. Export growth is forecast to
accelerate even further in 2017 as demand growth
from non-EU markets is projected to pick up. Due
to the temporary slowdown in investment, import
growth is expected to slow down in 2016 and
recover in 2017.
The unemployment rate is forecast to decline
further in 2016 and 2017; however, the effect of a
declining labour force is set to overtake job growth
as the main driver behind this process. A tight
labour market is set to ensure solid wage growth
over the forecast horizon.
Risks to the forecast are tilted to the downside and
stem from declining global trade and a prolonged
recession in Russia which could dampen export
growth.
Wage growth is set to drive an increase in HICP
inflation in 2016 and 2017

Following deflation in 2015, positive inflation is
expected to return in 2016 primarily driven by
increasing service prices. A moderate fall in
energy prices and subdued price pressures from
external forces are expected to keep inflation in
check. An expected increase in energy prices is
bound to accelerate inflation significantly in 2017.
Fiscal targets likely to be exceeded

The general government deficit declined from
0.7% of GDP in 2014 to 0.2% in 2015 – 1 pp. of
GDP below the initial budget target. Accelerating
growth in tax-rich domestic consumption and
wages led to tax revenues above the government’s
plan, although nominal GDP growth was lower
than expected. In addition, one-off factors had a

positive impact on the 2015 deficit as the 0.6 pps.
of GDP surplus coming from the deposit insurance
fund exceeded the one-off compensation of public
wage cuts that had been ruled unlawful by the
constitutional court.
For 2016, the general government’s deficit is
forecast to increase by 0.9 pps. of GDP to 1.1% of
GDP. The deficit is set to widen due to an increase
in non-taxable income allowance, pensions, and
public wages. Higher spending is expected to be
partially offset by revenue growth, supported by
strong domestic demand, buoyant wage growth
and modest tax increases.
Under a no-policy-change assumption, the general
government deficit is forecast to fall to 0.4% of
GDP in 2017, mainly on the back of robust
economic growth and a limited increase in
expenditure.

Risks to the public finance forecast are tilted to the
upside due to the expected robust growth of the tax
base, but only if expenditure discipline is
maintained during the 2016 electoral cycle.
Lithuania’s structural deficit is expected to have
decreased to about ½% of GDP in 2015 and is
forecast to increase to about 1¼% of GDP in 2016
due to the additional expenditure measures, before
decreasing to below 1% of GDP in 2017.
General government debt has increased from
40.7% of GDP in 2014 to 42.7% in 2015, due to
the pre-financing of bond redemptions and higherthan-usual
pre-financing
of
EU-funded
expenditures. In 2016, debt is forecast to fall to
41.1% of GDP, while in 2017 it is expected to
increase again to 42.9% due to the end of year prefinancing of forthcoming bond redemptions.

More balanced growth ahead

Luxembourg’s economic growth is projected to ease from 4.8% in 2015 to 3.3 % this year and to
accelerate to 3.9 % next year. Over this time growth is expected to become more balanced, as domestic
demand catches up with the external sector as a leading driver of growth. Unemployment is expected to
decline as job creation remains robust, while inflation should remain subdued as a result of low energy
prices.The general government surplus is expected to fade in 2017 due to the impact of the tax reform.
Strong growth in 2015

Real GDP growth expanded to 4.8 % in 2015
(from 4.1% in 2014), driven by a sharp
improvement in net exports of financial services,
especially in the first half of the year. Private
consumption picked up in the second half, as
spending recovered from a VAT hike in January.

investment. In particular, construction is projected
to remain robust over the forecast period,
supported both by household and public sector
investment plans, the latter being engaged with the
execution of large public infrastructure projects.
By contrast, in spite of the accommodative credit
stance, equipment investment is expected to
remain subdued, as capacity utilisation remains
low.

Recent trends shape slower growth for 2016

Both soft and hard indicators point to a
continuation of the trends observed in the second
half of 2015. In 2016, GDP is expected to grow by
3.3%, still driven by a large, though decreasing
contribution from external sector. Less favourable
financial markets are likely to have a dampening
effect on the export-focused financial industry and
limit the contribution to growth of net exports. By
contrast, the contribution from domestic demand is
expected to strengthen. Low oil prices, favourable
financial conditions and positive employment
prospects should provide tailwinds to private
consumption, even if indexed wage increases are
now only expected to take place by the beginning
of 2017. It is worth noting that buoyant job
creation is contributing to population growth by
attracting immigration flows. As a result, per
capita gains should remain moderate. Steadily
favourable lending conditions should support

96

Buoyant job creation continues

In 2015, employment increased by 2.5%. Labour
market prospects are projected to remain positive,
with employment growth set to average around
2½ % per year over the forecast horizon, driven by
the
economy’s
strong
momentum.
The
unemployment rate was 6.4% in 2015 and is
expected to decline to around 6% in 2016, not as
much as employment figures would suggest due to
the high share of non-residents among new
workers.
Inflation pulled down by energy prices

HICP inflation is set to fall to -0.1% in 2016 from
0.1% in 2015, mainly because of the pronounced
drop in oil prices, which are expected to remain
low for a protracted period, thus postponing the
automatic indexation of wages to the beginning of
2017. Core inflation is projected to remain
subdued over the forecast horizon, given the
lengthy low energy prices are spreading to other
sectors and as the impact of the increase in all
VAT rates that occurred at the start of 2015 phases
out.

Member States, Luxembourg

The general government surplus, however, is
expected to fall to just 0.1% of GDP in 2017, due
to the impact of the recently announced taxation
reform that should take effect in that year. Both
households and corporations are expected to
benefit from the reform, with the former
benefitting more. In addition to repealing the
temporary budgetary levy introduced in 2015, tax
brackets will be revised to become less
progressive, while two new tax brackets for high
revenues will be introduced. In addition, tax
credits related to house acquisition will be
increased. Moreover, the corporate income tax rate
will be reduced to 19% from 21% and a more
favourable tax treatment for small entreprises will
be introduced. All in all, the taxation reform is
estimated to shave off revenues by around 0.8% of
GDP.

The budget surplus is expected to fade out

In 2015, the general government surplus surprised
on the up side and came in at 1.2% of GDP.
Expenditure was lower than expected, in particular
for intermediate consumption, public wages and
some local government investment projects were
deferred. On the revenue side, the yield from taxes
on households and corporate income was higher
than anticipated and the loss due to the change in
the e-VAT regulation turned out to be lower than
expected. By contrast, the yield from government
measures to counter the expected loss in e-VAT
revenues came in as planned. These included a
2 pps. increase of all VAT rates, the introduction
of a temporary budgetary levy and the saving
measures in the ‘Pact pour l’Avenir’.
In 2016, the low inflation environment together
with the incremental effect of measures already
adopted in the 2015 budget should help to contain
expenditure and counterbalance the impact on the
government budget of the projected downward
revision of the macroeconomic scenario. All in all,
the surplus for this year is estimated at 1.0 % of
GDP.

The large structural surplus is then expected to
narrow by about 1½ pps. of GDP between 2015
and 2017, but to still remain in positive territory.
The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 21.4% of GDP
in 2015. In spite of a regular primary surplus, it is
set to increase to 22.8 % of GDP over the forecast
horizon, as the social security sector’s surplus
cannot be used to finance the deficit of the central
government.

17. HUNGARY

Private consumption is to drive growth

Hungary’s economy grew by 2.9% in 2015 and real GDP growth is expected to slow down to 2.5% in
2016 before rebounding in 2017. Unemployment is set to decrease further and inflation to pick up
gradually. Following an improvement in 2015, the government deficit is expected to stabilize at 2% of
GDP.
Households’

domestic

Unemployment continues to fall while inflation
picks up

In 2015, real GDP grew by 2.9% after growing by
3.7% in 2014. In domestic demand, households
final consumption posted a slightly higher than 3%
real grow, while gross fixed capital formation only
grew by 1.9% compared to 2014’s 11.2%. Exports
grew more than imports so the net export
contribution eventually was 1.2 pps.

The unemployment rate reached an all-time low of
6.8% in 2015 and is expected to further decrease to
around 6% by the end of the forecast horizon, as
activity continues to expand. Employment is set to
continue growing, driven by higher job creation in
the private sector and the government’s public
works scheme.

Economic growth is forecast at 2.5% in 2016. This
deceleration is mainly due to the decrease in EU
fund absorption and in external demand. This
deceleration should be partially offset by steady
growth in private consumption. Real disposable
income and household spending should benefit
from a boost from a 1.0 pp. cut in the flat personal
income tax rate (from 16% to 15%) and the effect
of an earlier measure to convert foreign currencydenominated loans into Hungarian florins. Housing
investment from households is expected to
increase as well. However, corporate and public
investment should be negatively affected by the
slowdown in EU fund absorption. As a result
overall investment growth will be negative in
2016.

Consumer prices remained broadly stable in 2015.
HICP inflation is expected to accelerate
moderately to 0.4% in 2016. Lower-than-expected
oil prices, subdued imported inflation and low
inflationary expectations imply that the central
bank’s 3% inflation target is not likely to be
reached over the forecast horizon.

In 2017, real GDP is forecast to grow by 2.8%,
mostly driven by robust private consumption and
the implementation of measures in 2016. First, the
reduction of the bank levy from 1 January 2016
and further from 1 January 2017 and new central
bank actions to provide subsidised lending to
SMEs (the so called Growth Supporting
Programme) should create a friendlier lending
environment. In addition, the reduction of the VAT
on newly built homes to 5% since 1 January 2016
and the new housing scheme is projected to
provide an impulse to the housing market and is
expected to take full effect in 2017. Overall,
investment growth is expected to turn positive. Net
exports are forecast to contribute positively to
growth, but to a lesser extent than in 2016, driving
the current account to remain high. Throughout the
forecast horizon, household’s precautionary
savings are set to decrease.

98

Risks are tilted to the upside

As the agricultural sector posted a negative
contribution in 2015 even a better-than-average
harvest is a positive risk to 2016. The slow phasing
out of the Funding for Growth Scheme and the full
implementation of announced policy commitments
towards the financial sector could further improve
lending conditions and boost growth. The
accelerated absorption of EU funds could drive
investments beyond the baseline.
The headline deficit stabilizes at 2% of GDP
despite a significantly increased fiscal room

The 2015 general government deficit reached 2.0%
of GDP, down from 2.3% in the previous year and
0.4 pps. below the official target. The
improvement is mainly the result of strong revenue
dynamics and a fall in interest payments. These
developments were partly offset by additional
spending, in particular on co-financing EU-funded
projects and debt consolidation payments for stateowned companies.
In 2016, the deficit is projected to stay at 2.0% of
GDP. The budgetary breathing space is set to

Member States, Hungary

increase considerably due to positive base effects,
savings in the domestic co-financing of declining
EU-funded projects and steadily decreasing
interest outlays and social payments. In addition,
the forecast counts on sizeable one-off receipts
from agricultural land sales and a large revenue
windfall expected to be paid under a corporate
income tax credit arrangement in 2016 and 2017.
However, these favourable effects are projected to
be absorbed by substantial tax cuts and
expenditure-increasing measures, including a new
housing
scheme,
additional
infrastructure
investments and spending on state education.
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the
government deficit is forecast to remain at 2.0 % of
GDP in 2017. The new draft budget was not
released by the cut-off date of the forecast. Further
projected savings from declining pension
expenditure and interest costs are estimated to be
counterbalanced by the effect of the already
adopted deficit-increasing measures, increases in

domestic spending on EU co-financed projects and
the phasing out of one-off revenues from
agricultural land sales.
Overall, budgetary risks are tilted towards a lower
deficit, in particular in 2016. Public investment
may turn out to be lower than the planned elevated
level due to implementation risks. By contrast, the
open-ended nature of the new housing scheme is a
source of budgetary uncertainty.
While the headline deficit remains stable, the
structural budget balance is expected to deteriorate
sharply to around -3.0% of GDP in 2016 and then
to reverse to around -2.5% in 2017. This reflects
the cyclical upturn of the economy and a one-off
effect in 2016. Hungary’s debt-to-GDP ratio
decreased by 0.9 pps. to 75.3% in 2015. The debt
ratio is expected to decline further to 73.0% by the
end of 2017, even though delays in the receipt of
EU funds are assumed are to have a debtincreasing effect throughout the forecast horizon.

18. MALTA

Strong investment and household consumption

After a stronger-than-expected 2015, growth is projected to moderate somewhat but to remain robust in
2016 and 2017. Investment is forecast to stabilise at a relatively high level while strong labour market
fundamentals should underpin a healthy increase in household consumption. The favourable
macroeconomic environment sets perfect conditions for fiscal consolidation and reduction of the
general government debt.
Strong domestic demand drove growth in 2015

Real GDP growth in 2015 came in at 6.3%,
significantly above expectations. The main driver
was investment, particularly in machinery and
equipment related to large-scale energy sector
projects. Public investment was buoyant, reflecting
the completion of projects financed under the
2007-13 programming period for EU funding.
After a long period of subdued activity, residential
construction rebounded. Household consumption
also grew strongly reflecting a decline in the
saving rate, as lower electricity tariffs, falling
unemployment and a rise in wage growth impacted
positively on consumer confidence. Strong
domestic demand resulted in a decline in the trade
surplus. Nevertheless, the current account balance
increased strongly due to favourable developments
in the primary income account.

Real GDP growth is projected to moderate to 3.5%
in 2017. Household consumption is forecast to
decelerate further reflecting normalisation of the
saving rate, while job creation and real wages are
forecast to continue to rise at robust rates.
Government consumption is projected to increase
strongly, thus also contributing significantly to
growth. Investment is projected to expand
moderately on the back of several additional large
projects in healthcare and education.
Growth could be stronger if the reduction in the
household saving rate, supported by expected
gains in disposable income and population growth,
carries over for the rest of the forecast horizon.
Downside risks are mainly linked to slippages in
the investment schedule for the big projects.

Some moderation expected in 2016 and 2017

Following the peak in 2015, real GDP growth is
projected to slow to 4.1% in 2016. Deceleration is
set to come mainly on the back of investment,
which is seen stabilising from a high base in 2015.
The large energy projects that flattered investment
in 2015 are expected to reach completion, while
the expansion in residential construction is
expected to moderate. Household consumption is

100

also projected to decelerate somewhat but to
remain robust reflecting strong employment
growth and rising real wages. These developments
will be partially offset by stronger net exports,
reflecting weaker demand for imports as well as a
pick-up in demand from trading partners.

HICP inflation is projected to pick up from 1.2%
in 2015 to 1.4% in 2016 and further to 2.2% in
2017. Acceleration is expected to come mainly
from a gradual recovery in energy prices,
following the electricity tariff cuts in previous
years. Services prices are forecast to pick up more
strongly in 2017, thus also contributing to overall
price inflation. Core inflation is projected to
outpace the euro area average and to come in at
1.7% and 2.2% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Budget deficit decreases despite rising current
expenditure

In 2015, the general government deficit decreased
further to 1.5% of GDP, from 2.0% of GDP in
2014, supported by the improvement in nominal
GDP. Current revenue growth benefitted from high
employment growth and consumer demand, as

Member States, Malta

well as the proceeds from Malta’s citizenship
programme (0.6% of GDP). Despite the
moderation in the growth rate for social transfers
and a decrease in interest expenditure, current
expenditure increased by 5.8% year-on-year in
nominal terms. Public investment was boosted by
the finalisation of EU-funded projects, and
subsidies to investment increased on the back of a
further capital injection into Air Malta (0.5% of
GDP).
In 2016, the deficit is forecast to further decrease
to 0.9% of GDP. The positive outlook for the
labour market and consumer demand is expected
to boost current revenue growth. Current revenue
is expected to increase in 2016 as a result of a rise
in excise duties and higher proceeds from the
citizenship programme. These are forecast to be
only partly offset by the lowering in income tax for
low-income earners and the phasing out of the eco
contribution. Current expenditure is expected to
continue growing due to measures introduced with

the 2016 budget, including an upward adjustment
of the minimum contributory pension and the
partial funding of the cost of home care for the
elderly. Public investment is expected to decrease
thanks to the phasing out of the capital injection to
the national airline, while the sharp decline in the
absorption of EU funds due to the beginning of a
new programming period should be partially
compensated for by a higher reliance on national
funds. In 2017, under a no-policy-change
assumption, the deficit is expected to decline
further to 0.8% of GDP thanks to favourable
nominal GDP growth.
The structural deficit ratio is estimated to have
deteriorated marginally in 2015. It is projected to
improve by ¾ pps. of GDP in 2016 and by ½ pps.
of GDP in 2017.
From 63.9% of GDP in 2015, the general
government debt is projected to decrease further to
60.9% of GDP in 2016 and to reach 58.3% by
2017.

19. THE NETHERLANDS

Domestic demand drives growth as the cycle matures

In 2016 and 2017, the economy of the Netherlands is expected to grow by 1.7% and 2.0% respectively,
following strong growth of domestic demand on the back of a robust labour market conditions, low
prices and fiscal stimulus measures. A sizeable tax stimulus is expected to temporarily slow the
reduction of the general government deficit in 2016, before it further improves in 2017. Risks to the
outlook originate from increased global economic uncertainties and the low coverage ratio of pension
funds, which may fuel precautionary savings and hamper consumption growth.
A revival of domestic demand in 2015

The Dutch economic recovery is well underway. In
2015, economic growth accelerated to 2.0% of
GDP, following 1.0% in 2014. Domestic demand
was particularly buoyant. Excluding changes in
inventories, domestic demand contributed 2.6 pps.
to the growth of GDP, compared to 0.7 pps. in
2014 and consistently negative growth rates since
the start of the crisis. The economic outlook for the
Netherlands in 2016 and 2017 is expected to
remain bright, with real GDP forecast to increase
by 1.7% and 2.0% respectively, leading to a
neutral output gap in 2017. Household
consumption is being fuelled by a relatively sharp
increase in real gross disposable income. This is
the result of a robust labour market, increasing
wage growth and a substantial stimulus via lower
labour taxes. Very low inflation, a consequence of
low energy prices, has been providing additional
support to purchasing power. Nevertheless,
uncertainties surrounding the outlook for
consumption growth have increased, as the decline
in the average pension funds’ coverage ratio is
expected to lead to higher compulsory and
precautionary savings and consumer confidence
has been on a downward trend in recent months.
Overall, the household saving rate is expected to
further increase to 14.7% in 2016, before slightly
declining to 14.3% in 2017.
In 2015, investment activity has seen a marked
increase from its very low levels in previous years.
In particular a strong recovery in the housing
market has led to sizeable residential investment
growth (27% y-o-y), while investment in
equipment has also shown strong growth figures.
The recovery in investment growth is expected to
continue in view of increasing capacity utilisation,
sustained demand and positive lending conditions.
Nevertheless, growth rates are likely to decline to
more sustainable figures.
Net exports are expected to detract from growth
throughout the forecast horizon as domestic

102

demand pushes up imports and the slowdown in
world trade negatively affects exports. The surplus
on the current account is expected to decline to
8.9% in 2016 and 8.2% in 2017, down from levels
above 10% in recent years.

Robust labour market performance

Employment growth in the Netherlands by around
1% in 2015, showing a robust recovery after three
consecutive years of decline. As in the current
state of the economic cycle productivity is
expected to pick up as well, the growth of labour
demand is expected to be lower than the growth
rate of domestic production. Public sector
employment, circa 10% of total employment, is
expected to stabilise in 2016 and 2017, after
having been in decline for five years in a row.
Despite the relatively robust growth in
employment, the unemployment rate is forecast to
remain above 6%. This is the consequence of
continued growth in the labour force, resulting
from a relatively sharp rise of the effective
retirement age leading to increased participation
rates of older cohorts and from positive cohort
effects in female labour participation. Also,
cyclical labour supply is expected to grow as the
economic recovery encourages more workers to
join the labour force.

Member States, The Netherlands

Wage growth to pick up, prices subdued

Further decline in headline deficit

Wage growth has picked up since early 2015. This
was initially due to new labour agreements in the
public sector, but private sector wage growth also
reached 1.7% in the first quarter of 2016. After a
number of years of negative real wage growth, real
incomes are on the rise again; due in large part to
very weak price developments. HICP inflation has
remained subdued at 0.2% in 2015, after 0.3% in
2014. In the first quarter of 2016, HICP inflation
came out at 0.4%, but negative base effects are
likely to lead to lower inflation in the next
quarters. In 2017 inflation is expected to increase
again as energy prices are set to stabilise, and all
other main components of HICP inflation are
forecast to be in positive territory. In particular,
healthy wage growth is likely to lead to higher
services price inflation. The projected closing of
the output gap further adds pressure on prices,
while the relatively stable rate of core inflation
does not indicate strong second round effects from
low energy prices. The GDP deflator is forecast to
come out markedly higher than HICP inflation in
2016, driven by higher prices of private and public
consumption, and as a consequence of import
prices falling faster than export prices.

As a result of the continued economic recovery,
the budgetary situation of the Netherlands is
projected to improve over the forecast horizon.
The deficit in 2015 declined to 1.8% of GDP, from
2.4% in 2014. The labour market recovery and the
robust growth of domestic demand are expected to
continue to lead to strong endogenous growth of
the tax base and lower unemployment expenditure.
In 2016, the positive trend is dampened by tax cuts
worth EUR 5 billion (0.7% of GDP) and by lower
natural gas revenues, resulting in a projected
deficit of 1.7%. As the tax stimulus is expected to
raise domestic demand and economic growth
continues, the deficit is projected to fall to 1.2% in
2017. The structural budget balance is forecast to
deteriorate by around ½ pps.of GDP in 2016,
before improving by around ¼ pps. in 2017. The
debt-to-GDP ratio, which declined to 65.1% in
2015, is projected to further decrease to 64.9% in
2016 and 63.9% in 2017. Risks to the fiscal
outlook stem from larger-than-budgeted migration
expenditures. Risks on the revenue side of the
budget may arise from higher precautionary
savings, following increased uncertainty about
future pensions, reducing growth of the tax base.

20. AUSTRIA

Growth to pick up as exports rise despite fragile global outlook

Austria’s economic growth is expected to further accelerate in 2016 and 2017 in spite of slow world
growth and deteriorating business and consumer sentiment. Investment activity is projected to benefit
from the favourable outlook for Austrian foreign trade. The continuing inflow of refugees supports
private and public consumption as well as over time labour supply. Public finances developed positively
in 2015. The government deficit is expected to increase in 2016 and slightly decrease in 2017, while
public debt should continuously decline.
Stable economic growth

Growth continued to accelerate in 2015 with real
GDP increasing by 0.9%. Private and public
consumption in particular contributed to growth in
the fourth quarter, reflecting the additional
spending on refugees. Investment activity saw
strong growth in the second and third quarters but
declined slightly towards the end with the
slowdown in the world economy. This slowdown
also impacted exports and imports which both
declined in the last quarter. However, for the year
as a whole, exports and imports increased at an
equal rate, resulting in only small net contribution
to growth.
Slowly accelerating economic activity ahead

Growth is expected to further accelerate in the
early quarters of 2016, although business and
consumer sentiment indicators turned more
pessimistic in recent months. GDP growth for the
year is projected at 1.5%, ending a four-year
period of sluggish growth. This acceleration is
seen coming mainly from stronger private
consumption, as income tax reforms will increase
the net disposable income of households. Private
consumption should also be supported by
government spending on refugees, which also
strengthens public consumption.
In 2017 GDP growth is forecast to develop
robustly, increasing to 1.6% on the back of rising
domestic demand. Spending on refugees will
continue to add to private and public consumption.
Investment is also projected to contribute
positively. Machinery and equipment investment
in particular is projected to strengthen in the next
few years due to the positive outlook for Austrian
exporters. Construction investment is also
expected to rebound, as the increasing population,
including the inflow of refugees, creates demand
for housing.

104

The outlook for Austrian exporters on the whole is
positive. Given that most of Austria’s trade is with
the EU, Austria may be less affected by slowing
dynamics in overseas and emerging markets.
Positive trends like the increased importance of the
US market for Austrian exports could compensate
for declining exports to other regions. Net exports
are expected to positively contribute to GDP
growth over the next two years, leading to an
increasing current account balance by 2017.
Growing labour force and unemployment

The inflow of asylum-seekers, which recorded
unprecedented levels in the second half of 2015, is
expected to continue in the coming months at
much lower levels. The number of arrivals is
expected to fall following the measures taken by
Austria since the beginning of the year to control
the number of asylum-seekers. The rise in the
population could contribute to a rising labour force
in the future. Labour supply is also likely to be
supported by reforms encouraging greater
participation by women and a higher effective
retirement age. This increase in labour supply
cannot be fully absorbed by the Austrian economy
over the forecast horizon, so unemployment is
expected to increase gradually from 5.7% in 2015
to 5.9% and 6.1% in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Inflation low but above the euro area average

The dampening effect of the oil price on overall
consumer price levels is expected to prevail during
the first quarters of this year and then to fade over
the course of 2016, leading to rising inflation in
2017. HICP inflation is projected to remain close
to 2015 levels, at 0.9%, before almost doubling to
1.7% in 2017. Inflation in Austria remains well
above the euro area average as prices in tourism
and other service sectors have been increasing
steadily. This stability in price developments is
also reflected in core inflation, which is expected
to remain broadly at the level reached in 2015
(1.7%) over the next two years.

Member States, Austria

Public accounts surprise positively but several
risks remain

After spiking in 2014 because of costs related to
the establishment of HETA (the wind-down
vehicle for the impaired assets of the former bank
Hypo Alpe Adria), the general government deficit
declined to 1.2% of GDP in 2015. The better-thanexpected outcome in 2015 was mainly due to
revenue windfalls, unexpected savings in pensions
and low interest expenditure. These favourable
developments more than offset additional costs
related to HETA, which amounted to 0.6% of GDP
in 2015, and the rise in social expenditure mainly
due to migration inflows.
The general government deficit is expected to
increase to 1.5% of GDP in 2016 and to slightly
decline in 2017. Costs related to the restructuring
of nationalised banks are expected to decrease
further in both years. The precautionary provision
budgeted by the government for 2016 amounts to
EUR 700 million, while no additional costs are
expected in 2017. Social transfers are projected to
rise in 2016, also in light of the slight increase in
unemployment and the expected expenditure for
refugees.

On
the
revenue
side,
the
improving
macroeconomic outlook has a positive impact on
revenue collection, but the implementation of the
tax reform this year is expected to weigh on public
finances in both 2016 and 2017. The actual
budgetary impact of the tax reform remains
uncertain, as does the effective expenditure related
to migration inflows. Downside risks also include
the eventual contingency of the 2015 revenue
windfall, which may have been partly caused by a
temporary effect from the anticipation of the 2016
tax reform. In addition, this budgetary forecast
assumes that no further costs will stem from the
resolution of HETA.
After turning positive in 2015, the structural
balance is expected to decline to about -1% of
GDP in 2016 and to about -1¼% of GDP in 2017.
Government debt is expected to have peaked in
2015 at 86.2% of GDP following the inclusion
under government’s accounts of additional
impaired assets from financial defeasance
structures. Also thanks to the divestment of part of
these impaired assets, the debt is expected to
decline to 84.9% of GDP in 2016 and 83.0% of
GDP in 2017.

21. POLAND

Strong private consumption supporting robust economic growth

Poland’s economy is expected to continue growing strongly, driven by domestic demand. Private
consumption should benefit from a fiscal stimulus and the dynamic labour market while price pressures
are set to remain subdued. Following a sizeable fall in 2015, the general government deficit is projected
to increase in 2016 and 2017.
GDP and jobs strong in 2015

Poland’s real GDP grew by 3.6% in 2015, its
fastest annual pace since 2011. Private
consumption was the main growth driver,
supported by solid increases in wages and
employment which reached its highest level since
the 1990s. Investment also contributed to GDP
expansion, rising by 5.8% (y-o-y). Significant
increases in housing and equipment investment
were supported by strong household disposable
income, corporate profits and favourable financing
conditions. Net exports also made a positive, yet
limited contribution to growth.
Growth outlook positive, no price pressures

The outlook remains favourable with real GDP
growth projected to reach 3.7% in 2016 and then
3.6% in 2017. Private consumption is set to remain
the dominant growth driver. Further improvements
in the labour market and an increase in government
transfers, notably a new child benefit, are expected
to boost disposable income and improve consumer
confidence.
Private investment is expected to grow moderately,
helped by a relatively high degree of capacity
utilisation, strong corporate profits and low interest
rates. However, investment decisions are likely to
be affected by uncertainty over the future direction
of economic policies. While overall financing
conditions remain favourable, banks are adjusting
lending rates, especially on low-margin products
such as mortgage loans in response to the new tax
on financial institutions’ assets. Public investment
is set to remain subdued in 2016 but to accelerate
in 2017, as projects co-financed with EU-funds
from the new programming period enter the
implementation phase.
Polish exports are expected to continue growing
robustly as contained labour costs and the zloty’s
exchange rate support cost-competitiveness. In
addition, external demand is projected to gradually
strengthen. At the same time, accelerating
domestic demand is set to fuel imports so that the

106

growth contribution of net exports is forecast to
turn slightly negative in 2016 and 2017.
Inflation is projected to turn positive over the
course of 2016, but price pressures should remain
subdued as energy prices are expected to stay low.
Consumer prices are forecast to remain flat on
average in 2016 and to grow by 1.6% in 2017.

Labour market to improve further

Positive labour market trends are projected to
continue. Employment growth is expected to
decelerate while wages accelerate in an
environment of record-low and still-falling
unemployment. On a positive note, overall
employment gains are set to be driven by a rising
share of permanent employment contracts,
continuing a trend that started in 2015.
Balanced risks

The risks to the macroeconomic forecast are
broadly balanced. On the downside, a continuation
of the issues related to the functioning of the
Constitutional Tribunal and implementation of
some economic policy decisions currently
considered by the authorities, could negatively
affect economic activity. These include the
proposed lowering of the retirement age and an
enforced conversion of foreign currency-

Member States, Poland

denominated mortgage loans into zloty, on
conditions that would significantly burden the
banking system. On the upside, investment could
turn out to be stronger than currently projected and
a swift return to the full functioning of the
Constitutional Tribunal would improve business
confidence.
Government deficit to widen

The general government deficit narrowed to 2.6%
of GDP in 2015, its lowest level since 2007. The
improvement was mainly driven by lower-thanplanned expenditure, including on employee
compensation and on public sector debt service.
The 2016 deficit is projected to stay at 2.6% of
GDP as the new expenditure plans, mainly a new
child benefit (estimated to cost some 0.9% of
GDP) are partially met by one-off revenue of
around 0.5% of GDP from the sale of mobile
internet frequencies and revenues from the new tax
on assets of financial institutions that was
introduced in February 2016. Corporate and
personal income tax collection is projected to
remain strong.

of GDP. This is mainly driven by the lack of oneoff revenue similar to those in 2016, increasing
costs of the child benefit (that enter into force in
the second quarter of 2016) and the legislated
decrease of VAT rates. There remains substantial
uncertainty as to the 2017 fiscal outlook. On the
one hand, there is a pipeline of deficit-increasing
policy proposals, such as a lowering of the
retirement age and an increase in the tax-free
threshold in personal income tax, while on the
other hand, there are continued efforts to improve
tax collection and expenditure on employee
compensation can turn out lower than projected.
After improving to about 2¼% of GDP in 2015,
Poland’s structural deficit is projected to widen
significantly to 3% of GDP in 2016 and further to
about 3¼% of GDP in 2017, under a
no-policy-change assumption.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is set
to increase from 51.3% of GDP in 2015 to 52.7%
of GDP in 2017. The debt projections for Poland
are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty
because of the potential impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the relatively high share of
sovereign debt denominated in foreign currencies.

Under a no-policy-change assumption, the general
government deficit is set to widen in 2017 to 3.1%

22. PORTUGAL

Slow recovery continues amidst significant downside risks

The recovery of the Portuguese economy remains modest and mainly driven by domestic demand amid
high macroeconomic imbalances. The general government headline deficit reached 4.4% of GDP in
2015 and the structural balance is forecast to deteriorate over the forecast horizon.
The cyclical economic recovery has lost some
momentum

Real GDP grew by 1.5% in 2015 and decelerated
during the second half of the year. The recovery
lost momentum on the back of less buoyant
investment growth at the end of the year. However,
investment grew solidly by 3.9% in 2015 due to
the strong first semester. Private consumption
strengthened in 2015 amid a significant drop in
household savings and favourable labour market
developments. Net external demand continued to
detract from real GDP growth, but to a lesser
extent than in the previous year due to more solid
export growth in the first half of 2015.

Trade activity remained weak at the beginning of
2016, reflecting the fragile external environment
since mid-2015. Exports are forecast to grow in
line with foreign demand, but imports are still
expected to outbalance exports over the forecast
horizon. As a result, the contribution of net trade to
GDP growth is forecast to remain slightly negative
although significantly less so than in 2015. After
posting a small deficit in 2015, the current account
adjustment is projected to continue over the
forecast horizon. It should be helped by an
increasing external balance surplus as a
consequence of a positive trade balance of services
and the stabilisation of primary income deficits.
Graph II.22.1: Portugal - Investment growth and its components

The Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator
(ESI) remained at high levels in the first quarter of
2016, supported by stabilisation in all components
except industry. Private consumption is expected
to lose momentum in 2016 and 2017 due to higher
indirect taxes and a slight rebound in energy
prices. The strong rebound in durables
consumption in the first half of 2015 will not be
maintained over the medium term as still high
unemployment and high debt levels are forecast to
maintain upward pressures on household savings.
Nevertheless, short-term growth in private
consumption should be supported by policy
measures such as various low income support
actions and the increase in the minimum wage.
Most of the investment indicators contracted
further at the beginning of 2016, excluding the sale
of heavy vehicles and confidence in construction.
Thus, investment is expected to decelerate to 2%
y-o-y this year. The significant slowdown,
particularly in business investment, is primarily
driven by the negative carry-over effect from the
unexpectedly weak machinery and equipment
investment outcome in the second half of 2015, the
feeble external environment, and the current
volatility in financial markets. In 2017, investment
growth is expected to gain momentum again,
supported by EU structural funds and the
improvement in funding conditions.

Investment (y-o-y%)

Overall, Portugal’s GDP is expected to expand by
1.5% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. Risks to the
macroeconomic outlook are tilted to the downside
and related to policy uncertainty, financial market
developments and persistent deleveraging pressure
in the private sector.
Inflation and labour market outlook improve

HICP inflation increased to 0.5% in March 2016,
above the euro area average. HICP inflation is
expected to increase to 0.7% in 2016, mainly
driven by higher indirect taxes, and then to rise to
1.2% in 2017.
Job creation decelerated slightly at the beginning
of 2016. The employed population grew by 0.7%

108

Member States, Portugal

(y-o-y) on average until February while the
estimated labour force contracted by 0.9% (y-o-y).
Consequently, the estimated unemployment rate
reached 12.2%. Overall, the expected further
moderate decrease in the labour force, coupled
with employment growth forecast around 1%, is
set to bring unemployment down to 11.6% in 2016
and 10.7% in 2017.
Public finances benefitting from the recovery

The general government deficit reached 4.4% of
GDP in 2015 including the fiscal impact of the
Banif bank resolution one-off operation worth
about 1.4% of GDP. Excluding this and other oneoff operations, the headline deficit would have
been 3.2% of GDP. Since the reduction of the
headline deficit (net of one-offs) was based on
cyclical factors rather than additional structural
measures, the structural balance deteriorated by
about half a percentage point of GDP in 2015.
Taking into account the detailed specifications of
all measures included in the 2016 budget, the
headline deficit is forecast to reach 2.7% of GDP
in 2016. Due to the limited volume of fiscal
consolidation measures, the structural balance is

expected to slightly deteriorate further by about a
quarter of a percentage point of GDP in 2016. The
headline deficit is projected to decrease to 2.3% of
GDP in 2017, mainly due to the BPP guarantee
recovery one-off operation worth ¼ pps. of GDP.
In the absence of sufficiently specified further
consolidation measures, the structural balance is
expected to continue to slightly deteriorate,
bringing the cumulative deterioration to about half
a percentage point over the forecast horizon.
Risks to the fiscal outlook are tilted to the
downside, linked to the uncertainties surrounding
the macroeconomic outlook, possible spending
slippages and potential lack of agreement on
further consolidation measures for 2016 and 2017.
The gross public debt-to-GDP fell only slightly to
129.0% by end-2015, due to the postponement of
the Novo Banco sale, the Banif resolution
operation and statistical revisions. The ratio is
expected to decrease more markedly to 126.0% in
2016, mainly due to projected sales of financial
assets, including Novo Banco, and further to
124.5% in 2017, due to primary budget surpluses
and domestic demand growth.

23. ROMANIA

Fiscal expansion fuels domestic demand as financial risks increase

Real GDP growth is set to remain above potential over the forecast horizon, driven by robust domestic
demand. Inflation is expected to return to positive territory from mid-2016 while the labour market stays
overall stable. The general government deficit is projected to substantially increase in 2016 and 2017
on the back of tax cuts and expenditure increases.
Strong growth ahead

The Romanian economy grew by 3.8% in 2015.
Surging domestic demand drove the expansion,
while strong imports led to a significantly negative
growth contribution of net exports (-1.5 pps.). A
fiscal stimulus amounting to almost 2% of GDP is
expected to further boost domestic demand in
2016. Accordingly, GDP growth is forecast to
accelerate to 4.2%. Economic growth is then
projected to ease somewhat to 3.7% in 2017,
supported by an additional fiscal stimulus, albeit of
a lower magnitude than the one in 2016.

The current-account deficit widened in 2015 due to
(i) lower export growth on account of a slowdown
in external demand and (ii) an increase in imports
as the growth rate of domestic demand almost
doubled compared with 2014. The trend is
expected to be sustained over the forecast horizon,
as domestic demand continues to grow.
Inflation to turn positive from mid-2016

Inflation reached a historical low in March (-2.4%
y-o-y) after the reduction of the standard VAT
rate. Inflation is expected to stay negative until
mid-2016, when the base effect of the food VAT
cut from June 2015 will wear out and the output
gap is projected to close. The surge in domestic
demand combined with accelerating wage growth
and the increase of the minimum wage from May
2016 is likely to add to the upward pressures on
prices, but the impact of the VAT cut is expected
to curb inflation to -0.6% on annual average. The
annual average inflation rate is forecast to increase
to 2.5% in 2017 despite the additional 1 pp. cut of
the standard VAT rate envisaged for January 2017.

The 4 pps. cut of the standard VAT rate from
January 2016 along with accelerating wage growth
and a 19% increase of the minimum wage from
May 2016 are expected to raise household
disposable income and push private consumption
to a post-crisis peak in 2016. The recent rebound
of credit to households on the back of record low
real interest rates has been supportive of this trend,
but future credit developments are surrounded by
increasing uncertainty. Investment picked up in
2015 (8.8% y-o-y) and is likely to continue
growing, but at a slower pace in 2016 with the end
of the 2007-2013 financing period for EU funding.
Stronger implementation under the 2014-20 EU
financing period and the abolition of the
construction tax from January 2017 are set to
support investment growth in 2017.

110

Wage dynamics may erode competitiveness

Overall employment growth is set to remain
broadly flat with modest improvements in labour
force participation and job creation in the context
of continued rigidities in the labour market. The
unemployment rate is expected to decline very
slightly from 6.8% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2017.
Enacted increases of both public sector wages and
of the minimum wage are likely to weigh on
competitiveness and temper job creation and, with
the closing of the output gap, unit labour costs are
expected to trend upward over the forecast
horizon.
Risks are tilted to the downside

On the domestic side, downside risks to the
macroeconomic
outlook
have
increased
significantly due to the uncertainty caused by the
adoption of a debt discharge law by Parliament on

Member States, Romania

13 April. This law could have a substantial
negative impact on investor confidence and credit
outlook over the forecast horizon and beyond. The
external environment is surrounded by uncertainty.

public wages were considerably increased. In
contrast, public investment is projected to drop due
to a slow take-up of big projects in the 2014-20
programming period of EU funding.

General government deficit set to increase

The headline deficit is projected to further
deteriorate to 3.4% of GDP in 2017 on a nopolicy-change assumption. An additional cut in the
standard VAT rate by one percentage point, the
abolition of the extra excise duty on fuel and of the
special construction tax are expected to have a
negative impact on revenues.

In 2015, the general government deficit improved
to 0.7% of GDP, from 0.9% of GDP in 2014,
thanks to a robust growth of tax revenues. Strong
economic growth and enhanced tax compliance
more than offset enacted tax cuts, such as the cut
in the VAT rate for food products as of June 2015
and in the special constructions tax.
Despite robust economic growth, the headline
deficit is set to rise significantly within the forecast
horizon on the back of further tax cuts and
expenditure increases.

The structural deficit is forecast to increase
strongly from just above ½% of GDP in 2015 to
about 3½% in 2017 as a consequence of the fiscal
easing. Despite strong GDP growth, Romania’s
debt-to-GDP ratio is thus projected to rise from
38.4% of GDP in 2015 to 40.1% of GDP in 2017.

In 2016, the headline deficit is expected to increase
to 2.8% of GDP. The standard VAT rate has been
decreased by 4 pps., the tax on dividends has been
cut, and new exemptions in Personal Income Tax
have been introduced. On the expenditure side,

The main downward risk to the fiscal outlook
stems from additional expansionary legislative
initiatives in the run-up to the local and
parliamentary elections in 2016, including public
sector wage policy.

24. SLOVENIA

Private consumption to drive growth, while public investment eases

Slovenia’s economic growth is expected to benefit from an improving labour market and favourable
financing conditions. As the contribution of net exports is forecast to decline gradually, the main driver
of growth in both 2016 and 2017 is expected to be private consumption. Both the general government
deficit and debt levels are projected to gradually decline due to favourable macroeconomic conditions.
Strong growth aided by tailwinds

Slovenia’s economy maintained strong growth in
2015, with real GDP rising 2.9% after 3.0% in
2014. Tailwinds, including lower energy prices
and a surge in EU investment funding, coupled
with rising employment helped the economy to
sustain considerable momentum. Strong exports
and recovered private consumption carried the
economy in 2015, with additional support from
inventories. Public investment was even slightly
higher than it was in 2014, while private
investment showed some signs of recovery.

Private consumption to become the main
driver of growth

GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 1.7% in
2016, mainly due to lower public investment
reverting to the historical average after two years
of exceptionally high investment at the end of the
drawdown period of EU funding. Despite growing
private investment, the drop in public investment
will lead to a contraction in total investment in
2016. Private consumption, boosted by increasing
employment, rising wages and a mild housing
market recovery, is forecast to remain the main
driver of growth in both 2016 and 2017. Exports
are expected to continue to contribute substantially
to growth but with a decreasing net effect over the

112

forecast horizon, as rising private consumption
fuels imports.
GDP growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.3% in
2017, led by private consumption, the recovery of
total investment and a further increase in public
consumption.
Slovenia’s economy achieved a record large
current account surplus in 2015, aided by
favourable terms of trade and continued
deleveraging. This surplus is expected to remain
large as long as deleveraging continues.
Further labour market improvement and a
protracted period of low prices

The labour market improved strongly in 2015 and
this trend is expected to continue albeit at a slower
pace. Strong demand for labour in the private
sector, particularly among manufacturers, is
expected to be the main factor reducing the
unemployment.
Falling energy prices pushed inflation into
negative territory in 2015. With oil prices likely to
remain on average below 2015 levels, the annual
rate of inflation looks set to remain negative in
2016. However, prices are expected to start rising
again in the fourth quarter of 2016 and inflation
should accelerate in 2017 as oil prices recover and
wages increase.
Risks to the growth forecast are mainly external
and to the downside. Exports to Slovenia’s main
trading partners could be indirectly affected by the
slowdown
in
emerging
markets.
Also,
implementation of EU-funded projects in 2016
could be delayed. On the positive side, quickerthan-expected stabilisation in Russia and Ukraine
could boost demand for Slovenia’s exporters.
Considerable improvement in the government
balance in 2015

In 2015, the general government deficit fell
considerably to 2.9% of GDP from 5% in 2014.

Member States, Slovenia

This reduction was driven by the non-recurrence of
temporary measures. Higher tax revenues due to
the improved economic environment and
temporary surpluses recorded by local authorities
and several government funds were offset by a
much higher than expected impact from the
activities of the Bank Asset Management
Company (BAMC) which contributed 1% of GDP
to the deficit. In 2016, a large decline in public
investment is anticipated following the ending of
the drawdown period of EU funding for 2007-13
which should offset expenditure pressures from the
wage bill. The impact of the BAMC activities is
expected to decline resulting in a projected
government deficit of 2.4% of GDP in 2016.
Following a large influx of migrants in the final
quarter of 2015, the number entering Slovenia has
moderated in recent weeks and the authorities
expect this to continue throughout 2016. The net
effect of migrant related expenditure in 2016 is
estimated at 0.1% of GDP.
In 2017, under a no-policy-change assumption
Slovenia’s deficit is expected to decline further to
2.1% of GDP mainly due to buoyant tax receipts.

Overall risks to public finances over the forecast
horizon are tilted to the downside as uncertainty
remains regarding the expenditure linked to
migration, as no net impact has been included for
2017. Furthermore, the ongoing work out of nonperforming loans poses risks to the government
deficit through the activities of the BAMC and the
possibility of an adverse impact from the
resolution in the first quarter of 2016 of two
financial institutions currently in wind down.
The structural balance remained broadly
unchanged in 2015. It is expected to improve
slightly in 2016, due to an improvement in the
nominal deficit before deteriorating by about
½ pps. of GDP in 2017, under a no-policy-change
assumption.
The debt-to-GDP ratio continued to increase in
2015 and is expected to have peaked at 83.2%.
This increase was driven by the continued
accumulation of cash buffers due to favourable
market conditions. Debt is expected to fall to
80.2% and 78.0% of GDP in 2016 and 2017
respectively, helped by the economic recovery and
a reduction in precautionary cash buffers.

Domestic demand drives the recovery

The economic recovery is expected to continue in 2016, driven mainly by accelerating household
spending. The unemployment rate is forecast to gradually decline throughout 2016 and to fall below
10% in 2017. Inflation is expected to turn positive in early 2017. Tax-rich growth is projected to
continue supporting consolidation plans.
Recovery continues on a sustainable path

Slovakia’s real GDP grew by 3.6% in 2015 on the
back of a surge in investment activity and robust
private consumption. Booming investment
reflected heavy use of EU funds, as the possibility
to draw on funds available under the 2007-13
programming period came to an end. Investment
accounted for 2.9 percentage points of total output
growth in 2015, the highest such contribution since
2005. Slovakia’s economic expansion is set to
continue, with real GDP growth exceeding 3% in
both 2016 and 2017 on the back of robust domestic
demand. With large investments in the automotive
industry scheduled over 2016 to 2018, foreign
direct investment looks primed to drive overall
investment growth. Public investment spending,
however, is set to decline in 2016, as the
drawdown on EU funds returns to more normal
levels. The output gap is expected to continue
closing over the forecast horizon.

household credit. Low energy prices continue to
benefit real disposable incomes, including via
windfall gains such as refunds paid by the
government to households on recent gas bills.
These factors are likely to support household
spending in the coming quarters. Overall,
household consumption growth is expected to
reach 3.6% in 2016 and to slow only marginally in
the next year.
Imports driven by investment dynamics

The high level of public investment in 2015 drove
an increase in imports which outweighed the
growth in exports. As a result net exports detracted
from growth in 2015. The trade balance is forecast
to turn positive in 2016, reflecting a deceleration in
imports on the back of the slowdown in overall
investment growth. In 2017, imports are forecast to
accelerate, as the announced investment in the
automotive sector is expected to peak.
Labour market recovery continues

Employment gains were strong throughout 2015,
and labour market conditions are expected to
further improve in line with the robust economic
expansion. Unemployment fell to 11.5% in 2015
and is expected to continue receding over the
coming years, falling below 10% in 2017. The
increasing number of foreign workers also reflects
the ongoing recovery of the labour market. The
long-term unemployment rate fell in 2015,
although it remains elevated. Nominal wage
growth increased in 2015 and is set to rise to over
3% in 2016 and thereafter, providing a significant
stimulus to household purchasing power in a lowinflation environment.

Household demand takes the lead

Strengthening household spending is forecast to
become the main driver of growth in 2016 and
thereafter, gaining support from steady increases in
employment and solid real wage growth. At the
same time, the easing of credit conditions,
reflecting the ECB’s accommodative monetary
policy stance, contributes to ongoing increases in

Inflation remains subdued

Consumer prices declined by 0.3% in 2015 as a
result of the sharp fall in energy prices.
Deflationary pressures are expected to dissipate
gradually, in line with the pickup in household
demand and solid nominal wage growth. Overall
inflation is set to remain close to zero in 2016,

Member States, Slovakia

with the decline in energy and food prices being
offset by a recovery in the prices of services.
Overall inflation is likely to recover in 2017, also
due to the low base of the preceding year.
Strong growth of
consolidation plans

tax

revenues

supports

The general government deficit deteriorated in
2015 to 3.0% of GDP. This was in part due to the
accelerated drawdown of EU funds in the context
of the expiring programming period, which lead to
increases in co-financed spending. Furthermore,
financial corrections related to EU funds and
higher-than-planned spending by the local and
central governments (including on health care) also
contributed to the worsening of the fiscal position
of the general government. On the other hand,
growth in tax revenues was strong in 2015.
In 2016, the headline deficit is projected to decline
to 2.4% of GDP. Reflecting favourable economic
conditions and past efforts to fight tax fraud,
robust tax revenues are expected to continue
supporting the government’s consolidation plans.
Savings from a programme to reduce spending on
pharmaceuticals look likely to disappoint, so that

healthcare expenditure growth is projected to be
little changed from recent years. The forecast
assumes that, as in 2015, the local governments
continue to run lower surpluses than assumed by
the government. In conjunction with welfareoriented measures such as the reimbursement of
gas bills to households due to lower gas prices, this
limits the pace of deficit reduction.
For 2017, the government announced a reduction
of the corporate income tax rate by 1 pp. to 21%.
The resulting revenue loss is expected to be
broadly compensated by prolonging a special levy
on companies operating in regulated industries.
Assuming no other changes in government
policies, tax-rich growth should contribute to a
decline in the deficit to 1.6% of GDP in 2017. A
risk to the forecast in that year stems from the
measures that might be agreed by coalition
partners of the newly-elected government after the
publication of this forecast.
After a deterioration in 2015, the structural deficit
is likely to progressively decline in the following
years. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
ease slightly over the forecast horizon to some
53% in 2017.

Gradual recovery taking hold

Finland’s economy returned to growth in 2015, with real GDP expanding by 0.5% after three years of
recession. As export growth remains subdued, GDP growth will depend on domestic demand in 2016
and 2017. Fiscal consolidation and weak household income growth will constrain consumption but
investment is expected to pick up this year. The general government deficit fell below 3% of GDP in
2015 and is expected to improve further, although the debt-to-GDP ratio looks set to rise.
From a downturn to a gradual recovery

Preliminary data for 2015 suggest that Finland’s
economy has come out of the recession which
began in 2012. Domestic demand rose on the back
of higher private consumption, which increased by
1.4% last year compared with 2014. This
improvement was largely thanks to falling energy
prices which boosted real disposable incomes.
Investment declined in 2015 compared with 2014
but a turnaround was registered in the course of
2015. As real exports increased slightly while
imports decreased, net foreign trade rose over all.
On average inflation ran slightly below zero in
2015. Despite increased economic activity,
employment continued to decrease but less than in
2014. The unemployment rate rose to 9.4%.

pace. Other components of the ‘Competitiveness
Pact’ such as increases in annual working time are
not included in the forecast either. Despite the
growth of real income, private consumption
growth this year is expected to decelerate from
2015 reflecting the end of a widely used
opportunity offered by the banks to halt mortgage
repayments for maximum of one year launched in
early 2015. Towards the end of forecast horizon
accelerating inflation is expected to limit the
increases in real income and consumption.

Real GDP is forecast to grow by 0.7% this year
and next. Over the forecast horizon, domestic
demand should continue to support growth, while
growth in exports is expected to remain sluggish
and imports are expected to increase due to higher
investment. On the production side of the economy
construction has turned to growth and is expected
to drive growth alongside services. Despite some
improvement in confidence indicators of
manufacturing
industries,
no
significant
improvement in production is expected this year.

Consumption growth to decelerate in 2016

The rise in economic activity is expected to
increase job creation but companies remain
cautious about hiring new staff to secure positive
labour productivity growth. As a result, the
unemployment rate is expected to fall only
gradually in 2016 and 2017. Nominal wages are
expected to rise by about 1.2% in 2016 according
to the wage deal sealed in 2015. As it will be
known only in June 2016 whether the
‘Competitiveness Pact’ to improve Finland’s
cost-competitiveness will be implemented or not,
this forecast assumes that the increase in nominal
wages in 2017 will be similar to previous years’

116

Investment growth is expected to turn positive in
2016. Confidence in construction sector has
improved as companies have received an
increasing amount of new orders. A rise in the
number of building permits granted also suggests a
positive outlook over the forecast horizon. Also
equipment investment is expected to increase in
2016, mainly on the back of large investment
projects such as a new pulp mill in central Finland.
Investment growth is expected to slow down in
2017 as some large projects are completed and
because generally incentives to invest in new
production capacity still remain fragile.

Member States, Finland

In 2015 goods exports declined slightly but thanks
to increasing service exports, the total volume of
exports increased. Export growth will remain weak
in 2016-17 and Finnish exports continue to lose
export market share. At the same time, increasing
domestic demand, in particular an increase in
investment is expected to raise import volumes,
resulting in slightly negative net exports. The fall
in the oil price in 2015 improved Finland’s current
account balance significantly. Low import prices
are expected to help sustain a positive external
balance in 2016-17.
The forecast for 2017 depends on the outcome of
the ‘Competitiveness Pact’ negotiations. If the Pact
is realised, uncertainties would be reduced in the
short to medium run, possibly resulting in
increased confidence and investment and thus
higher growth. If the contract fails, continued and
possibly increased uncertainty could harm the
economy.
Public deficit improves, while debt increases

The general government deficit in 2015 turned out
at 2.7% of GDP, below previous expectations,
whereas the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 63.1%.

On the back of expenditure cuts announced, the
deficit in 2016 is expected to decline to 2.5%. The
growth of public consumption as well as
investment is expected to remain below nominal
GDP growth in 2016 and 2017. Population ageing
will increase pension expenditure, and the costs
linked to the asylum seekers who arrived in 2015
is expected to increase government expenditure in
2016. To balance the unemployment insurance
funds, the contribution rate was increased by one
percentage point in 2016.
To further consolidate public finances, the
government has announced across the board cuts
in entitlements, except pensions in 2017. In 2017,
the pension contribution rate will also increase and
reforms introduced to dampen the rise in pension
expenditure start gradually to have an impact. The
deficit is expected to fall to 2.3% of GDP in 2017.
As the public balance is improving only
moderately and nominal GDP growth remains
tepid, the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to increase to
65.2% in 2016 and reach 66.9% in 2017. The
structural balance improved by about ¼ pps. of
GDP in 2015, but is projected to worsen by about
¼ pps. of GDP in 2016 and thereafter improve
marginally in 2017.

27. SWEDEN

Growth momentum remains strong

After expanding by more than 4% in 2015, Sweden’s economic growth is set to stabilise at around 3% in
the coming years, driven by robust domestic demand. Unemployment is expected to gradually fall, in
spite of the high influx of 2015 asylum seekers starting to enter the labour force towards the end of
2017. Inflation is set to rise slowly over the forecast horizon, but to remain below 2%. The general
government deficit is projected to rise on the back of higher expenditure but is forecast to stay at rather
low levels.
Broad-based growth ahead

Real GDP in Sweden rose by 4.1 % in 2015, its
fastest rate since 2010. Private and public
consumption were important growth drivers, but in
addition
exports
and
investment
were
unexpectedly strong. Going forward, economic
growth is expected to gradually slow to 3.4% in
2016 and 2.9% in 2017, rates which are slightly
above the economy’s potential. Continued robust
domestic demand is set to be the main growth
engine, powered by the buoyant labour market and
increased government consumption.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Public consumption growth to peak in 2016

Government consumption growth is projected to
rise in 2016 due to higher spending related to the
large influx of migrants in 2015 and higher
expenditure in the welfare system. Supported by
low interest rates, steadily growing disposable
incomes and rising house prices, private
consumption is forecast to remain vigorous,
contributing to around 1/3 of real GDP growth.
Investment expected to decelerate

Strong investment growth in 2014 continued in
2015 at a rate of 7.3%. It was mostly driven by

118

housing investment expanding at a rate of 17%,
but also by a pick-up in machinery and equipment
investment. In addition, a large one-off R&D
investment in 2015-Q4 temporarily boosted
growth. Nevertheless, all components are expected
to slow down in the coming years, mainly due to
the uncertain external environment. Accordingly,
investment growth is projected to moderate to
4.0 % in 2016 and 3.2 % in 2017.
Net exports slightly positive

Exports expanded at a high rate in 2015 (5.9%)
supported in particular by the weak krona and a
recovering EU economy. Services exports
constituted the bulk and grew at a remarkable rate
of 12%, helped by a large one-off transaction. In
addition, goods exports, particularly automotive
products, accelerated in the third and fourth
quarters of 2015. Exports are forecast to increase
by 4.1% in 2016 and by 4.3% in 2017, slightly
above demand in Sweden’s main export markets.
On the back of strong household consumption and
the high import-content of exports, imports are
projected to grow faster than exports throughout
the forecast horizon. Still, net trade is set to make a
small, positive contribution to growth while the
current account surplus is expected to remain
stable.
Declining unemployment

Labour supply continues to increase swiftly due to
Sweden’s growing population. The recent
downward revision in the number of asylum
seekers expected for 2016 and 2017 only
marginally affects the labour force forecast, since
it takes some time to be granted asylum and to be
able to participate in the labour market. With
robust employment growth, unemployment is
forecast to fall gradually from 7.4% to 6.8 % in
2016 and then to 6.3 % in 2017. However, the
unemployment rate among foreign-born citizens
will likely remain higher.

Member States, Sweden

Inflation subdued, but slowly rising

Despite further monetary easing and strong
domestic demand, inflation remains subdued. The
recent fall in oil prices and the very modest
increase in rent prices, which was the outcome of
annual negotiations, are expected to prolong the
period of low inflation until 2017. While some
sectors have challenged the agreed benchmark,
wage increases should be relatively modest,
overall in line with the 2.2% one-year agreement
with industry. HICP is projected to average just
0.9 % in 2016, and to reach 1.2 % in 2017.
Risks broadly balanced

Positive risks to the forecast are related to
household consumption, which could grow at a
higher pace on the back of stronger-than-expected
employment growth and higher real disposable
income. A positive impetus to the economy could
come in the medium term if migrants are
successfully integrated into the labour market. On
the downside, a correction in house prices could
dampen
business
confidence,
household
consumption and construction investment.

Resilient public finances in spite of increasing
expenditure

Public finances improved significantly in 2015 and
the general government achieved a balanced
budget. Strong economic growth and tax increases
(social fees for young people, energy and fuel
taxes and some excise duties) resulted in growing
revenues. In addition, a temporary high corporate
tax payment in 2015-Q4 significantly improved the
budget balance. Further tax increases in 2016
relate predominantly to labour taxes (by 8.6% due
to the combined effect of a sharp increase in the
tax bases and tax hikes) and to local government
taxes. Under a no-policy-change assumption the
deficit is projected to widen to 0.4% and 0.7% of
GDP in 2016 and 2017 respectively, on the back of
large expenditure growth due to the reception and
integration of asylum seekers, as well as sickness
leave benefits. The structural deficit is projected to
worsen, but it is set to stay below the medium-term
budgetary objective of 1.0% of GDP over the
forecast horizon. The debt-to-GDP ratio is set to
decrease from 43.4% in 2015 to 40.1% of GDP in
2017. The arrival of more asylum seekers than
expected could lead to further increases in
government expenditure.

Moderation in growth while inflation rises

Growth is expected to ease in 2016 and 2017 as the output gap becomes positive. Domestic demand is
projected to remain strong, but ease somewhat as private consumption growth moderates. Net exports
are forecast to continue to detract from growth although less markedly in 2017. Inflation is expected to
rise from historically low levels while the labour market remains robust. The budget deficit is projected
to continue to decline and gross government debt to peak in 2016.
Domestic demand drove growth in 2015

After moderating from 2.9% in 2014, GDP grew at
a healthy rate of 2.3% in 2015. Growth was driven
by an increase in domestic demand of 2.6%. This
reflected a strong rise in private consumption and
business investment, although growth in the latter
was weaker than in 2014. Net exports detracted
from growth, by 0.5 pps., as buoyant exports were
more than offset by a sharp pick up in imports. As
a result, the pattern of growth remains somewhat
unbalanced.

Growth to ease in 2016 and 2017

After growth of 0.6% in 2015-Q4, the rate of
quarterly growth is projected to slightly abate to
0.4% in 2016-Q1. This is consistent with a
softening suggested by recent partial indicators of
activity such as Purchasing Manager Indices and
some business surveys.
The pace of quarterly growth is projected to pick
up in the middle of the year, reflecting the solid
underlying momentum in the economy. As a
result, annual growth of 1.8% is projected in 2016.
Annual growth is forecast to edge up to 1.9%, in
2017. The output gap is forecast to be modestly
positive.
Despite tempering somewhat, growth in private
consumption is expected to remain robust and to
exceed that of GDP. Renewed momentum in real

120

household disposable income in 2016 and 2017,
and resilient consumer sentiment, should support
consumption. The household saving ratio fell to
4.2% in 2015 and is forecast to remain stable at
around 4% in 2016 and 2017. However, a desire
by households to rebuild savings, or a lower-thanexpected increase in employee compensation,
could curb consumption growth below projections.
Business investment is projected to continue to rise
at around 4% in 2016 and 2017, about double
growth in GDP. Low borrowing costs, better
access to finance, strong corporate balance sheets,
improving corporate profitability and previous
rises in demand should underpin business
investment. However, an increase in uncertainty,
perhaps reflecting external developments, may
jeopardise businesses’ investment plans.
The weakness in net exports is projected to
continue in 2016 but fade significantly in 2017.
Export growth is projected to slacken, reflecting
conditions in major trading partners and geopolitical uncertainties. Growth in imports is
projected to diminish in 2016 and 2017, consistent
with the moderation in domestic demand.
Overall, risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside, reflecting less favourable external
demand and uncertainty in the lead-up to the June
referendum.
Buoyant labour market to continue

The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in 2015 and is
expected to fall further, albeit slightly, to around
5.0% in 2016 and 2017. Robust increases in
employment are forecast to continue, although
receding somewhat from recent high rates, while
the activity rate is forecast to rise somewhat.
Growth in compensation of employees is expected
to accelerate as the labour market tightens further.
However, productivity remains muted. A downside
risk to the forecast is that modest expected
productivity growth does not materialise, reducing
future growth prospects.

Member States, The United Kingdom

Inflation to accelerate in 2016 and 2017

The price level remained unchanged in 2015 but
inflation is projected to rise to 0.8% in 2016 and
1.6% in 2017. Nevertheless, inflation is expected
to remain subdued and below the Bank of
England’s target (of 2%). The waning of the
impact of previous falls in energy prices on the
price level should bolster inflation in 2016 and
2017. However, in other sectors, price pressures
remain low. For example, the compression of
retailers’ margins in the supermarket sector should
continue to dampen price increases. Further falls in
world energy prices pose a downside risk to
inflation, although the impact depends on the
extent to which they are passed through to
reductions in retail fuel and energy prices.
Budget deficit continues to decline and gross
debt peaks

The general government deficit is forecast to have
fallen to 4.0% of GDP in 2015-2016 and the
structural deficit is projected to have fallen by
more than ½ pps. of GDP. The improvement is
driven by lower expenditure as a share of GDP. In

2016-17 the deficit is expected to further decline to
2.9% of GDP and the structural balance to improve
by around 1 pp. of GDP. The government debt
ratio is expected to peak in 2015-16 at 88.0% of
GDP and decrease slightly in 2016-17
and 2017-18.
The 2016 budget, delivered in March, sets out
plans for a slightly slower pace of fiscal
consolidation over the next two years than
previously planned. The net impact of the budget
is expected to be small in 2016-2017, while in
2017-18 it is expected to increase the deficit by
almost 1 pp. of GDP. On the revenue side, this
includes the deferral by two years of a measure
that brought forward tax payments by large firms.
On the expenditure side, the largest measure
involved the movement forward of some public
investment spending from 2019-20 to 2017-18.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Risks to domestic demand-led growth are increasing

The economic expansion picked up pace in 2015, supported by household spending, exports, and a
sizeable public stimulus. Fiscal discipline disappointed again, even though the government managed to
reduce the deficit markedly. The outlook remains optimistic, with domestic demand becoming the sole
growth driver over the forecast horizon, but downside risks have increased.
GDP growth accelerates in 2015 on better
balanced grounds

Carried by solid increases in household
consumption, a surge in government spending, and
a positive contribution from net exports, output
growth accelerated to an estimated 3.7% (y-o-y) in
2015, after 3.5% in 2014, according to the State
Statistical Office. While industrial production,
including manufacturing, disappointed, the
construction sector continued its robust
performance, supported by demand from the
government’s public works agenda. Still, gross
capital formation remained flat.

Domestic demand as sole future growth driver
is subject to important downside risks

The expansion is expected to continue at a slower
pace and on a narrower base. Domestic demand is
likely to be the sole source of growth, with private
consumption providing the biggest contribution in
both years, as it benefits from positive wage and
employment trends, a benign price environment,
and further increases in social transfers and
pensions. Yet, consumer spending may be stunted
by a slowdown in credit growth to households, in
response to central bank prudential measures to
curb the increase in consumer loans. Moreover, the
growth of net real wages, which have been rising
for 20 months in a row, was more subdued

124

recently, as nominal wages increased more slowly.
Their dynamic might weaken further on account of
the projected increase in inflation. Private
investment spending is expected to pick up on the
back of strengthening investor confidence, as the
political crisis would abate. Government
investment expenditure is likely to increase
slightly as a share of GDP in 2016, and to remain
at about that level in 2017. Investment prospects
are, however, subject to important downside risks
stemming from delayed implementation of public
infrastructure projects, and from a continuation of
political uncertainty.

Short-term external vulnerabilities remained
contained in 2015. Weathering a difficult external
environment, net exports contributed positively to
GDP growth. The trade balance improved on
account of slower import growth, supported by
lower oil prices, and strong export growth. The
current account deficit widened, as the primary
balance worsened, but at 1.4% of GDP it remained
moderate. Going forward, external balances are
projected to deteriorate somewhat, with a negative
contribution from net exports to growth in both
forecast years. Stronger export growth is likely to
be overcompensated by an imports surge, as a
large share of inputs for production by foreign
companies, accounting for two thirds of the
economy’s exports, and for public infrastructure
works comes from abroad. In spite of a further
increase in the services surplus, the current account
deficit would widen, as the goods trade balance
deteriorates and transfer inflows drop.
Employment growth continues, and inflation is
set to remain low

Employment growth accelerated in 2015 with job
creation increasing by 2.3%, in annual terms – a
large share of it taking place in the FDI
manufacturing sector and as a result of
government-subsidized employment schemes.
Employment growth is likely to continue at solid

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

rates, averaging 2.1% over the forecast horizon,
yet with little improvement in the structure of new
jobs. In spite of a further declining labour force,
the unemployment rate would continue to drop.
Consumer prices decreased again towards the end
of the year and beyond, after a temporary rise over
the summer. Annual deflation in 2015 amounted to
0.3%, the same as in 2014, mainly on account of a
decline in energy-intensive transport services, and
in food prices (41% of the index). The price
environment is expected to stay benign. Moderate
pressures are likely to arise from an expected
increase in the price of oil and other imported
commodities, as well as in food prices, with no
pressures expected from the further strengthening
of domestic demand.
Fiscal consolidation remains a challenge

Budget execution slipped again in 2015, with the
general government deficit revised upwards in the
summer, by 0.3 pps. This came in spite of marked
revenue over-performance in the first half of the
year, on account of a surge in profit tax collection
after the government reduced exemptions. The
2015 fiscal outcome - 3.5% of estimated GDP overshot the original target by 0.2 pps., but was
lower by 0.7 pps. compared to the 2014 outturn.

Public finances are likely to further support the

the deficit targets for 2016 and 2017, anticipating a
drop to 2.9%, but has not specified concrete
consolidation measures. The government debt ratio
remained stable in 2015, driven by IMF loan
repayment and Eurobond issuance. Sustainable
stabilisation remains a challenge, as deviations
from the fiscal path, or disappointing GDP growth
would markedly derail the debt trajectory.

Volatile growth amid public finance concerns

Tourism and capital-intensive projects continue to be the main drivers of growth, albeit their
contribution appears more volatile than previously expected. The growth potential is hampered by the
sluggish recovery of bank lending. Budget deficits remain high due to a surge in public investment and
social security transfers, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability. External imbalances have
narrowed but the trend is set to reverse in view of a projected increase in investment-driven imports.
Growth performance was more volatile than
expected

After recording a strong expansion in the first three
quarters of 2015 the economy slowed down
significantly in the last three months, due to a
sharp contraction in government consumption and
gross fixed capital formation as major public
works were delayed. On the other hand, private
consumption gained further strength in the last
quarter, partially offset by a weaker contribution of
net exports resulting from strong growth of
imports.

expected from a modest revival of bank lending to
households too. However, although higher
economic growth is expected to improve banks’
profitability and ease lending conditions, a weak
asset quality in combination with low provisioning
is likely to constrain overall credit growth over the
forecast horizon.
Investment-driven imports would increase the
external deficit

The current account deficit remains significant
albeit some gradual reduction has been recorded
over the last years. In 2015, the strong services
account surplus (above 20% of GDP) helped
reducing the external deficit in spite of some
further deterioration of the trade deficit. However,
it appears difficult for services performance alone
to further improve and offset - also in 2016 and
2017 - an investment-driven deterioration of the
trade deficit, especially when considering the
narrow export base of the country.

Underlying assumptions remain unchanged
but growth path is reviewed downwards

The medium-term growth continues to rely on
large infrastructure and FDI projects already in the
pipeline. However, given the weaker performance
observed in the last quarter of 2015, the pace of
implementation in gross fixed capital formation
has been reviewed downwards compared to the
winter forecast.
Real GDP growth is projected to remain relatively
robust at slightly below 4% in 2016 and 2017. The
recovery of private consumption is to be boosted
by recent increases in pensions, public sector
wages and social transfers. A contribution is

An environment of moderate inflation

Inflation trends fell markedly in the first months of
2016 reflecting the combination of low commodity
prices and the still weak private consumption. As a
result the inflation forecast for 2016 and 2017 has
been slightly revised downward.
The impact of the economic recovery on the
labour market is low

Despite some further improvement, labour market
dynamics remains hindered by rigidities, skills
mismatch and demand side constraints. The overall
situation is expected to offer a similar trend in the
coming years.
After several years of weak or negative growth,
wages are set to increase in 2016 following the
adoption of the Law on public sector employees.
As a result, public sector wages could increase by
average 5% in 2016. However, the wage increase
in the private sector could be more moderate given

the still large unemployment rate. In 2017, wages
would increase less than in 2016 due to the
absence of elections and of fiscal space.

highway, despite further contraction of domestic
public debt.
Graph II.30.2: Public debt stock
% of GDP

A substantial deterioration in public finances

forecast

Highway related expenditures and borrowing
started taking their toll in 2015, swelling general
government deficit and debt. Thus, at the end of
2015, the general government deficit surged above
8% of GDP, half of it accounting for expenditure
on one highway section, and additional 2% of
GDP on unplanned repayment of arrears of local
governments. Political uncertainty emerges in the
electoral year 2016 as a risk for the sustainability
of public finances and the implementation of the
structural reforms agenda. So far, the situation has
already further deteriorated in early 2016 due to a
series of increases in pensions, social benefits and
public sector wages partially related to the
electoral cycle.

Considering the very high gross financing needs,
maintaining access to capital markets appears as
the key challenge. Another important risk is the
uncertainty related to the political situation and the
possible agreement between government and
opposition to share government responsibilities
before elections, which could delay the reforms
necessary to stabilize public finances.

Under a no policy change assumption, the forecast
projects a narrowing of fiscal deficits in 2016 and
2017 due to the growth effect and the contention of
expenditure on real terms, while public debt would
further increase driven by the loan-financed

Investment and exports to remain the engines of growth

GDP growth is forecast to accelerate, supported by robust investment and export performance. Private
consumption, after being a drag on growth for a number of years, is also expected to rebound
marginally on the back of rising private sector wages and employment. Continuously strong revenue
outturn, including one-offs, is seen contributing to the lower than planned budget deficit in 2016.
However, fiscal risks remain elevated and government debt is still set on an upward trajectory.
In a recovery mode

Despite a significant fiscal consolidation in 2015,
increased confidence as a result of implemented
reforms and low oil prices helped the economy
recover faster than initially expected. Investments,
in particular, benefitted from significant monetary
easing and from recent measures to reduce the
budget deficit and improve the business
environment. Helped by rebounding economic
activity in major trading partners and gains in
competitiveness, exports increased as well. FDI
inflows grew markedly and covered the current
account deficit. They were channelled mainly in
tradable sectors, likely to sustain further export
growth. Household consumption declined for a
fourth year in a row, supressed by lower public
transfers and the still weak labour market. Public
consumption also had a negative contribution to
growth, although it increased in the second half of
the year.
High-frequency indicators suggest that economic
recovery has accelerated in early 2016. Industrial
production, still largely driven by energy and
mining, picked up in the first two months of the
year. Manufacturing performed well, growing
across most of the sectors. Retail trade and wage
data also signal a revival in private consumption.
Investment and exports to remain the engines
of growth

Export growth is expected to remain robust over
the forecast horizon, supported by an ongoing
recovery in Serbia’s major trading partners, recent
and new investments, and productivity gains due to
domestic reforms. However, net exports are
forecast to contribute only marginally to growth as
rising domestic demand triggers higher imports.
The new investment cycle, launched in 2015 from
a very low base, implies a relatively strong
investment growth in the next few years. Capital
formation is seen boosted by confidence effects
from recent and ongoing reform efforts, past
monetary easing, rising foreign direct investments,

128

and higher public capital expenditure. Contrary to
the previous investment peak in 2012, which was
largely driven by a single project in the automotive
industry, the ongoing investment profile is much
more diversified. As the economy recovers, private
consumption is forecast to pick up as well, largely
driven by continuous increases in private sector
wages and employment. The trajectory of public
consumption is uncertain, depending on the
magnitude and timing of announced employment
cuts. As at present these measures are not
sufficiently well defined, the forecast assumes
their effect on public consumption to be marginal.
The economy continues to be exposed to multiple
external risks and remains highly sensitive to
international capital flow reversals and fluctuations
in oil prices. Although reduced as a result of recent
policy measures, major risks to the forecast
scenario also come from potential relaxation in
fiscal consolidation and structural reform efforts.

Low inflation and small employment gains

Buoyant investments are expected to lead to
limited employment gains, as growth in private
sector employment is set to be partly offset by
lay-offs related to ongoing and planned
restructurings of state-owned enterprises. Price
pressures are likely to remain low and exchange
rate stability and stable inflation expectations are

Candidate Countries, Serbia

envisaged to continue anchoring price dynamics.
However, inflation is forecast to gradually increase
and enter the central bank tolerance band, pushed
up by rising domestic demand, adjustments in
administered prices and as disinflationary effects
from the international environment start to wane.

Strong revenue growth to support further
budget deficit reduction

The strong revenue performance continued in the
first months of 2016, also due to significant and

unbudgeted one-off revenue from a concession for
the use of several telecommunication frequencies.
Over-performing revenue are expected to lead to a
better than planned budget deficit this year.
However, the budget deficit is forecast to decline
only slightly in 2017.
Mandatory expenditure are set to continue falling,
although rising interest payments, higher capital
expenditure, and pension and wage indexations
adopted at the end of 2015 are likely to offset
them. With the exception of increases in excise
duties on oil products and the full impact of the
excise duty on electricity, introduced in August
2015, major tax rates are planned to remain
unchanged.
The fiscal scenario faces a number of uncertainties.
As the public administration reform and the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises remain the
two pillars for a sustainable reduction of fiscal
imbalances, further delays in their implementation
are a key risk. Reversing the trend of growing
government debt would, therefore, require a
steadfast implementation of reform intentions and
a careful evaluation before underwriting new
expenditure commitments.

32. TURKEY

Domestic demand remains the driver of growth

Economic activity is set to expand at a moderate pace based on the low oil price, an accommodative
monetary policy, and hikes in government-controlled wages. Net exports will subtract from growth,
partly due to Russian sanctions and the unstable security situation domestically and in the near abroad.
Inflation is set to remain in high single digits in the context of pass-through from last year’s
depreciation and domestic inflationary pressures. The current account benefits from the low oil price
while the public debt ratio continues to decline.
Domestic demand has strengthened

The Turkish economy expanded at a surprisingly
strong rate of 4.0% in 2015. There was a
pronounced shift towards domestic-demand driven
growth with consumer spending increasing by
4.5%, supported by the lower oil price and easy
financial conditions. Private investment mustered
2.7% growth after having been close to stagnation
for two years. In contrast to 2014, net exports
exerted a drag on growth as exports contracted
while imports expanded. For the first quarter of
2016, the data suggest that final demand expanded
at a moderate pace.

moderate rate, supported by a pent-up need for
replacement investment. While household
borrowing appears to have been curbed by macroprudential measures, non-financial corporations
increasingly seem to take advantage of the easy
financial conditions.

The forecast projects that the external sector will
continue to subtract from output growth in 2016
and 2017 in spite of the lira’s real effective
depreciation in 2015. Import growth is projected to
outpace export growth, but both remaining at
relatively low rates. In the short term, exports are
expected to be held back by (1) Russian sanctions
on Turkish exports since the beginning of 2016,
(2) a disproportionally high impact from the lower
oil price on export demand since oil-producing
countries are important markets for Turkish
exports, (3) the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and (4)
an unstable domestic security situation reducing
foreign tourism significantly. On the positive side,
the repeal of international sanctions on Iran is
expected to support Turkish exports slightly.

-8

On the domestic demand side, consumer spending
is projected to increase at an average annual rate of
3.6% over the next two years, i.e. roughly the same
as the average for the past three years. It will still
be supported by the purchasing power provided by
the lower oil price and, in addition, by the
30%-hike of the minimum wage on 1 January
2016. Restraint on consumer spending will come
from indirect taxes hikes, the unstable security
situation, and significantly less tourism. Business
investment is projected to continue growing at a

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Returning to potential growth

In 2016, net exports are forecast to exert a heavier
drag on GDP growth than last year, lowering GDP
growth to 3.5%. Next year, the support to
consumer spending from lower oil price is
expected to have vanished, but a normalisation of
the export performance should provide sufficient
counterweight to allow GDP growth to strengthen
to 3.7%.
This growth forecast is associated with significant
risks. On the upside, accelerating wages and
stronger household borrowing may provide a
sharper-than-projected
boost
to
consumer
spending. On the downside, there is a risk that the
security situation might worsen, domestically and
in the near abroad. But the largest risk may be that
capital outflows will require a sharp policy
adjustment and result in domestic demand
suppression. In 2015, there was a sharp turn
towards outflow of portfolio capital, partly because
global investor sentiment shifted away from

Candidate Countries, Turkey

emerging economies, not least from those with
large current account deficits like Turkey.
Inflation is ticking up

Headline inflation rose by 0.6 pps. to 8.8% in the
course of 2015 as the Turkish lira depreciated
significantly
against
major
international
currencies. Exchange-rate pass-through, together
with strongly rising food prices, more than offset
the disinflationary effect from the lower oil price.
In spite of overshooting the official 5% inflation
target by a wide margin, the central bank has kept
its main policy rate unchanged at 7.5% between
February 2015 and April 2016. On the basis of the
current monetary policy stance, the recent hikes in
government-controlled wages, and ingrained
inflation expectations the forecast projects an 8.5%
increase of the CPI’s annual average in 2016. As
some of the factors pushing prices higher are
expected to diminish in force in the course of the
forecasting period, annual inflation is projected to
recede slightly in 2017.
Rising unemployment, but a lower current
account deficit

Employment growth is expected to continue
running somewhat below output growth. The

unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually to
10.9% in 2017 assuming that the labour force
(aged 15-64 years) will increase by its trend
growth rate in recent years.
Turkey’s long-standing current account deficit has
narrowed for the second consecutive year in 2015,
falling to 4.5% of GDP. Due to large energy
imports, the current account has benefitted
strongly from the oil price decline. This effect
should still benefit the current account in 2016
although a weak export performance is projected
to increase the deficit somewhat. By 2017, the
deficit is projected to exceed 5% of GDP again.
Public finances remain relatively stable

Based on the budget realisation for the central
government, the general government deficit is
estimated to have narrowed slightly to 1.4% of
GDP in 2015. The government’s decision to
finance part of the minimum-wage hike will
contribute to the projected widening of the deficit
in 2016. Next year, the deficit is forecast to narrow
again in the context of somewhat stronger
economic growth. General government debt as a
share of GDP is projected to continue its
downward trend towards 30%.

Strengthening domestic demand, weak price dynamics

The economic upturn is projected to continue, supported by strong investment and recovering private
consumption. Inflation remains weaker than expected, which suggests that monetary policy will remain
loose. However, the pass-through of monetary easing to the economy is still hampered by high, albeit
declining, non-performing loans. Fiscal consolidation is forecast to continue and put a small dent in the
public debt ratio already this year. Weak trade dynamics are expected to improve gradually.
Growth decelerates at the end of 2015

Supported by improving sentiment and
employment
growth,
private
consumption
continued to recover in the fourth quarter of 2015.
At the same time, investment decelerated markedly
from the double-digit growth recorded in the
previous two quarters. Continued fiscal
consolidation meant that the drag on growth from
public consumption intensified in the same period.
Trade dynamics remained weak, with an overall
positive contribution from net exports. Overall,
GDP growth in the fourth quarter slowed to 2.2%
year-on-year from 3% in each of the previous two
quarters, whereas flash estimates put growth in
2015 as a whole at 2.6%.
Private domestic demand set to continue lifting
growth

Economic growth is expected to strengthen
gradually thanks to rising private investment and
consumption. Investment should be supported by
some large FDI-financed projects which are
forecast to outweigh the oil price-driven reduction
in gross fixed capital formation in the extractive
sector. Household consumption is projected to rise
gradually on the back of gains in employment and
disposable income, as well as easing precautionary
saving behaviour. Foreign trade, on the other hand,
is expected to have a negative growth contribution
in the medium term as rising domestic demand
drives up imports. Lifted by progressively reviving
foreign demand, exports are also projected to
recover gradually, even if continued low prices for
oil, one of Albania’s main export commodities,
will weigh on the output and foreign sales of the
extractive sector.
Inflationary pressures remain weak

Households’ purchasing power has been supported
by weak price dynamics. At only 0.6% in the first
quarter of 2016, annual price inflation surprised on
the downside due to low imported inflation,
subdued food prices, and base effects. With its 3%

132

target in danger of being missed for an extended
period, the central bank reacted in early April by
cutting its policy rate by 25 bps. to 1.5%.
One important reason why the record-low policy
rate has not so far translated into strong credit
growth is the high share of non-performing loans
(NPLs), which makes banks risk averse and credit
standards tight, especially for businesses.
Mandatory NPL write-offs by banks have caused
the NPL ratio to decline to 17.7% in the fourth
quarter from 22.8% a year earlier, and credit
standards eased in the same period for both
households and corporates. Further gradual
improvement in financial conditions is expected,
supported by ample banking-sector liquidity and
less domestic borrowing by the government.
However, a material improvement in private credit
is conditional on the pace at which the authorities’
plan to address the root causes of high NPLs is
implemented.

Risks to the macroeconomic forecast are tilted to
the downside. The extractive industry, which has
been an important growth driver in recent years,
might suffer a deeper-than-expected contraction if
oil prices stay low for long. Agriculture and
electricity production remain subject to weatherinduced volatility. The improvement in Albania’s
external environment remains fragile and may turn

tightening,

To address debt-related vulnerabilities, the
authorities plan to improve the headline deficit by
an annual average of 1.1 pps. in 2016-18. The bulk
of the adjustment is anticipated to come initially
from raising the revenue-to-GDP ratio by 1.0 pp.
in 2016, based mainly on ensuring better tax
compliance. Revenue data for the first two months
of 2016 are encouraging, but sustained efforts in
terms of addressing the informal economy and
enlarging the tax base will be needed to achieve
targets. In 2017-18, spending restraint is expected
to drive fiscal consolidation, but this commitment
may be tested in the run-up to Parliamentary
elections in 2017. Overall, fiscal performance is
expected to improve and, barring negative

surprises affecting nominal GDP, the exchange
rate, or the materialisation of fiscal risks such as
contingent liabilities, the public debt ratio (which
includes state guarantees) is projected to start
declining in 2016.

Weaker growth amid a maturing cycle

Stronger external headwinds, retrenchment in the energy sector and the sharper inventory adjustment
weakened the momentum of the US economy and led to the downward revision of the forecast. Growth is
now expected to slow progressively to roughly 2¼% in both 2016 and 2017 amid a maturing cycle and
closing output gap. Strong labour market, buoyant consumption and residential investment are expected
to remain key growth drivers, supported by the still favourable policy environment
Real GDP growth slowed to 0.3% (q-o-q) in
2015-Q4 (from 0.5% in 2015-Q3) as the steadily
appreciating dollar combined with weak external
demand weighed on net exports. In addition,
inventories contracted sharply and falling oil prices
triggered a renewed retrenchment in the energy
sector. Most of these headwinds have become
more pronounced since the winter forecast, leading
to downward revisions for both forecast years.
However, key drivers of domestic demand, namely
private consumption and residential investment,
remain robust and should keep recovery on track.
Low energy prices and a buoyant labour market
are expected to support consumption and
residential construction going forward, in the
favourable environment of mildly expansionary
fiscal policy and continued accommodative
monetary policy.

home prices, low mortgage rates and a steady
increase in household formation.

Consumption and housing remain supportive

External headwinds have intensified

Private consumption grew by over 3% in 2015, the
strongest in 10 years, and despite the recent
weakness, is set to remain strong in both forecast
years. Households will continue benefitting from
low energy prices, robust job growth accompanied
by progressively accelerating wages, and
supportive policy environment. Consumption will
also be supported by the much-improved
household balance sheets (65), rising home prices
and net wealth that is near all-time highs. An
additional fillip to spending may come from the
projected slight moderation of the savings rate.

The drags created by external factors grew towards
the end of 2015, as the strong dollar and weak
demand among key trading partners weighed on
net exports, subtracting as much as 0.7 pps. from
growth in 2015. While appreciation has eased
somewhat since mid-January, the dollar is assumed
to remain strong over the forecast horizon. Given
the persistently fragile outlook for global trade and
the lagged effects of past appreciation, net exports
will continue to act as a major drag on growth,
subtracting roughly 0.4 pps. from growth in both
forecast years 2016 and 2017.

Residential construction posted strong gains in
2015, remaining one of the bright spots of the
recovery and expected to advance further during
the forecast horizon. Following a sustained decline
over the past 10 years, the home ownership rate
remains near its recent lows. Yet, key conditions
for a continued unfolding of pent-up demand for
housing are in place, including healthy household
balance sheets, good employment prospects, rising

The sustained fall in oil prices since mid-2014
prompted massive cutbacks in capital expenditure
and employment in the energy sector, even though
output proved quite resilient so far. Non-energy
investment also lost momentum towards the end of
the year, resulting in a contraction in total business
investment in 2015-Q4, the first in more than 3
years. While some of the drags related to mining
and manufacturing are expected to be transitory,

than 200,000 a month) and the unemployment rate
falling to below 5%, roughly its natural rate, have
led to a progressive tightening of labour market
conditions, with greater evidence of firming wage
and price pressures. Importantly, improved
conditions have also triggered the first meaningful
up-tick in the labour force participation in more
than a decade, providing further evidence that
labour market slack has largely been absorbed.
Further improvements are anticipated in the near
term, though their pace is set to ease gradually, as
the cycle matures and growth moderates.
Nominal wages have been firming modestly since
late 2015 and are expected to accelerate further in
the forecast horizon, in line with the progressively
tightening labour market. Likewise, consumer
inflation has been on a steady upward trend since
late 2015, with the core index averaging 2.2%

Together with the buoyant labour market, firming
price pressures underpinned the Federal Reserve’s
December decision to raise rates for the first time
since 2006. In the meantime, early-year turbulence
in financial markets and stronger external
headwinds led the Fed to downgrade its outlook
for the US economy, and leave the rates
unchanged during two subsequent meetings (in
January and March). While markets expect two
more increases this year, the Fed continues to link
future interest rate decisions to “the economic
outlook as informed by incoming data”.
Risks to the US outlook remain tilted to the
downside. They relate largely to a higher-thanexpected drag on growth from appreciation and
weak external demand; a more severe contraction
in the energy sector in case of weaker recovery in
oil prices; and potential negative impact of
monetary normalisation, both direct via tightening
of domestic financial conditions, and indirect,
through spillovers from the weaker global outlook.

35. JAPAN

Slower and more volatile growth

Following disappointing economic performance in 2015, growth is expected to remain lacklustre over
the forecast horizon as monetary stimulus is increasingly less effective, fiscal consolidation needs are
looming, and sluggish wage growth keeps holding back private consumption.
In 2016, real GDP growth is expected to pick up to
0.8% as domestic demand firms up temporarily
ahead of the consumption tax hike planned for
2017-Q2. In the wake of the tax increase, quarterly
growth is expected to turn increasingly volatile and
annual growth is set to decelerate to 0.4% in 2017.
After three years of quantitative easing, monetary
stimulus appears increasingly insufficient to
underpin growth and inflation dynamics. While
domestic demand has turned increasingly volatile,
with sluggish wage growth holding back private
consumption, the investment outlook is hampered
by weak potential growth and worsening external
conditions, while adverse demographic and
productivity trends weigh on the medium-term
outlook in the absence of bolder structural reform,
in particular to reduce labour market duality, lift
labour supply, and deregulate domestic markets.
Economic growth surprised to the downside in
2015…

Growth in 2015-Q4 surprised to the downside at
-0.3% (q-o-q), entailing 0.5% growth for 2015 as a
whole. Domestic demand subtracted 0.4 pps from
growth in Q4 on the back of declines in private
consumption, public investment and private
residential investment. Private consumption alone
- which accounts for around 60% of GDP subtracted 0.65 pps, and growth is set to remain
fragile and uneven despite tight labour market
conditions.
…while domestic demand is set to remain
volatile…

Weak real household income growth is set to
weigh on private consumption, which is expected
to remain fragile and volatile. The unemployment
rate remains steadily close to historic lows of just
above 3%, and the new-job-opening-to-applicants
ratio hovers around the highest levels in 25 years.
Nevertheless, wage growth is hampered by deeply
entrenched labour duality entailing subdued wage
pressures from a large share of non-regular
workers, low labour mobility, and rigidities in the
wage setting mechanism. Front-loaded demand
ahead of the April 2017 tax hike is likely to entail

138

a temporary acceleration in private consumption,
but the subsequent fall in the aftermath of the hike
will drag down growth in 2017.

Growth in gross fixed capital formation
decelerated in 2015 to 0.1%, on the back of the
contraction in residential investment after the April
2014 tax hike, and a drop in public investment.
Residential investment declined -1.2% (q-o-q) in
2015-Q4, but housing starts suggest a rebound in
2016-Q1. Looking ahead, residential investment is
expected to continue improving moderately
reflecting increasing demand ahead of planned
fiscal consolidation, resilient employment, and
supportive financial conditions. Private nonresidential (business) investment rose moderately
over the last two years. Machinery orders point to
a continued recovery on the domestic front, but
business sentiment has deteriorated on the back of
the more subdued external outlook and the nearterm exchange rate appreciation. Financial
conditions should remain broadly supportive, and
continue to underpin a moderate near-term
recovery in the run-up to the April 2017
consumption tax hike. However, planned fiscal
consolidation is likely to weigh on the investment
environment and entail heightened near-term
volatility in 2017, in particular for private
residential investment, while weak potential
growth and adverse demographic dynamics should
constrain investment over the medium- and longterm.

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

…and the external outlook has turned bleaker.

Exports declined by -0.8% (q-o-q) in 2015-Q4.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated by
6.6% since end-2015, denting exporters’
confidence, while the external outlook has turned
more negative reflecting somewhat weaker growth
prospects for advanced economies and continued
weakness in emerging and oil-exporting
economies. While exports are expected to grow at
a more moderate pace, net exports are set to
provide a positive contribution as fragile domestic
demand should entail weaker import growth.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to go ahead
as planned…

The budget deficit should decrease gradually in
line with the tax hike and overall moderate
expenditure growth. The April 2017 consumption
tax hike is expected to go ahead as planned, but
might be called into question in view of the weak
growth
outturn
in
2015-Q4
and
the
uncertain outlook. While the tax increase is
necessary to achieve the medium-term target of a
primary balance by FY 2020, this remains
contingent on sustained output and revenue
growth.

…and monetary policy is set to remain
accommodative.

Headline CPI inflation remains subdued (0.3%
y-o-y in January), and well below the 2% target,
reflecting lower energy prices, the waning impact
from past currency depreciation, and weak wage
growth. Monetary policy turned even more
accommodative at end-January with the
introduction of a negative interest rate of -0.1%
applied to deposits at the Bank of Japan. While the
monetary stance is expected to stay supportive
throughout the forecast horizon, the inflation
outlook remains subdued on the back of volatile
and weak domestic demand as well as near-term
exchange rate appreciation.
Downside risks have heightened on both the
domestic and external front

Weakening business and consumer sentiment and
subdued wage growth may weigh on domestic
demand more heavily than anticipated. At the same
time weaker-than-expected external demand, in
particular from the Asian region, may negatively
affect business conditions, with negative
repercussions on profits and domestic wage
dynamics.

36. CHINA

Growth remains solid, but underlying tensions persist

Economic growth is expected to continue to slow gradually provided China continues to rebalance away
from investment-driven growth towards higher consumption and service sector growth. Macroeconomic
policy is expected to support this transition if appropriately targeted, but will have to tread a path
between two different risks. On the one hand, high corporate debt levels pose a threat should overall
activity weaken too sharply. On the other, stimulus that sustains past patterns of unbalanced growth
would risk making future structural adjustment more challenging.
China’s real GDP grew by 6.7% in 2016-Q1,
following growth of 6.9% in 2015. Growth is
projected at 6.5% in 2016 and 6.2% in 2017, which
is unchanged from the winter forecast. This is a
largely benign scenario predicated on continued
economic rebalancing, and no sharp correction or
“hard landing”. Some high frequency indicators
suggest that recent policy stimulus is taking effect
and a sharp collapse in activity appears unlikely in
the short term. Volatility in stock markets and
foreign exchange markets has also moderated.
China retains capacity to provide additional shortterm stimulus to meet the official target growth of
6.5 to 7.0%, agreed at the March National People’s
Congress, should activity weaken unexpectedly.
There are risks however that short term growth
may be bought at the cost of worsening
imbalances, unless macroeconomic support is
accompanied by structural reform measures.
Steady growth and rebalancing in 2015

In 2015 China’s economy grew at a steady pace, at
close to 6.9% in each quarter, despite a sharp
downturn in fixed asset investment and a
protracted recession in the real estate sector.
Growth in industrial value added slowed to 6% in
2015, the slowest pace in over 25 years. Fixed
asset investment grew by 12% in nominal terms,
sharply down on previous years, with an even
bigger fall in real estate investment. China’s goods
trade also saw a retrenchment, with an unexpected
fall in export volumes and almost flat growth in
imports. By contrast, growth in domestic retail
sales was above 10% in real terms. Robust service
sector imports and elevated service sector PMIs
also confirmed a picture of restructuring in the
composition of demand. In terms of composition
of growth, consumption contributed 4.6 pps of
growth in 2015, capital formation contributed
2.5 pps., while net exports accounted for -0.2 pps.
In short, China’s headline growth in 2015 was
relatively stable, with signs of economic
rebalancing away from investment and towards
more consumption-driven growth.

Recent data gives more mixed signals

Early 2016 saw a marked upturn in a number of
high frequency indicators that had been on a
downward trend. Real estate investment growth
rates picked up notably and there was a sharp
improvement in real estate land and floor space
sales, as well as an upturn in manufacturing PMIs.
Overall fixed asset investment and industrial
production however showed further modest
declines. While positive for short term growth,
signs of recovery in real estate may be an
indication that stimulus measures are boosting
sectors where structural adjustment is needed.
Credit growth also saw a sharp spurt in early 2016
and continues to outpace nominal GDP growth,
adding to the build-up of already high debt levels.
Macroeconomic policies are likely to remain
flexible and accommodative. Monetary easing in
2015 consisted of cuts in policy interest rates and
reserve ratios and targeted liquidity injections in
specific sectors. The interbank rate has
subsequently been kept stable at just above 2%,
while CPI inflation has picked up from around
1.6% in mid-2015 to close to 2.3% in March 2016,
marginally reducing real interest rates. Fiscal
policy has also been loosened, with a widening of
the central government fiscal deficit target in 2016.

Other non-EU Countries, China

Fiscal policy in particular can be expected to
continue to respond flexibly to any unanticipated
weakness in demand.
Trade is expected to recover slowly

China’s trade in 2015 saw a brusque adjustment.
Goods export volumes contracted for the first time
since the global financial crisis in 2009, reflecting
subdued global demand and a significant (15%)
rise in the RMB real effective exchange rate from
mid-2014 to mid-2015. Goods exports are
expected to recover to only modest positive growth
rates in 2016 given the tepid outlook for global
growth and likely continued strength of the RMB
on a trade-weighted basis. Goods imports also fell
in volume terms, with a somewhat steeper fall in
trade values, reflecting low commodity prices.
Explanatory factors include the slowdown in real
estate and lower construction material imports, the
restructuring of the economy away from importintensive investment, and reduced imports for
reprocessing into exports. In sharp contrast,
services imports grew strongly in 2015 leading to a
small positive increase in total import volumes.
This pattern is expected to continue into 2016 and
2017, with goods imports recovering slowly and
growth of services imports remaining brisk.

Policy space limits downside risks, but with
potential medium term costs.

Recent data suggest that stimulus measures are
having some effect, and risks of a sharp collapse in
activity are low. However, China’s recent growth
has been buttressed by rapid growth in
consumption spending which may prove difficult
to sustain without measures to transfer additional
income or assets to households. A sharper-thanexpected slowdown in investment also remains
possible, with high levels of corporate debt
interacting with real economy weaknesses to
generate a self-feeding cycle. The Chinese
government retains significant direct influence in
the financial system and has monetary and fiscal
policy space to sustain activity in the short run,
limiting these downside risks. However, policy
measures to assure stability in the short run may
worsen existing imbalances and raise the future
costs of adjustment unless part of a package to
cushion structural reforms and support more
balanced growth. A growing appreciation of the
complexity of the task China faces in managing the
adjustment to lower but more sustainable growth
has raised considerable doubts about whether this
process can be managed smoothly.

37. EFTA

Rough sailing for small open economies

Each of the three EFTA countries faces substantial economic challenges: in Switzerland, the economy
has to cope with a strengthened currency and subdued investment. Norway has to face lower oil-related
revenues and deteriorating consumer confidence, while Iceland experiences a boom in tourism and
related construction and uncertainties stemming from plans to lift capital controls.
Switzerland

The strength of the Swiss franc, following the
decision by the Swiss National Bank to abandon
the exchange rate ceiling of Swiss franc with the
euro in January 2015 keeps weighing on the
growth
outlook
for
Switzerland.
After
strengthening by almost 20% against the euro in
January, the Swiss franc stabilised and depreciated
slightly towards the end of 2015.
Real GDP grew at a moderate 0.9% (y-o-y) in
2015, supported by a stronger-than-expected
expansion in the last quarter (0.4% q-o-q). The
main driving force in 2015-Q4 was a greater value
added in manufacturing, while the performance of
other business activities remained weak. The
contribution of net exports of goods, excluding
valuables, was declining in the second half of
2015. The impact of strong currency differed
across sectors with chemical and pharmaceutical
exports holding relatively well while other
categories (watches, precision tools, jewellery)
either stagnating or declining. Growth of grossfixed investment declined in light of squeezed
profit margins and low capacity utilisation, while
investment growth in construction remained
roughly stable. The contribution of private and
public consumption to GDP growth was positive
throughout the year.
The growth outlook remains subdued due to the
weak external environment and slowly diminishing
effects from the lagged currency appreciation.
Subject to the downside risks stemming from low
inflation and moderate growth in neighbouring
countries, real GDP projections for 2016 and 2017
are set at 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively. Further
downside risk relates to the slowdown in emerging
economies and volatility in financial markets
which could result in renewed capital inflows into
Switzerland.
Public and private consumption are expected to
continue to sustain growth over the forecast
horizon in Switzerland, through real gains in
household disposable income from low inflation.

142

Exports of goods and services are likely to show
only limited growth due to a gradual improvement
of the competitive position. After destocking in
2015, the contribution of stocks to GDP growth
should recover in 2016-17. Following a significant
fall of the number of employed persons in the first
half of 2015, the total employment in 2016 is
likely to stay below an annual average of the
previous year. In view of this slow improvement,
the unemployment rate is expected to start
declining only from 2017 onwards.

Throughout 2015, Switzerland experienced
declining consumer prices. The strength of the
Swiss franc and the slump in oil prices implied a
negative contribution of import prices to the
annual CPI rate. Moreover, prices for services also
fell significantly in 2015, reflecting the subdued
domestic demand and wage inflation. Due to
moderate recovery of GDP growth and low
international commodity prices the negative trend
in Swiss consumer prices is likely to continue in
2016, while an increase in the range of 0.2-0.7 is
expected in 2017.
Currency appreciation put pressure on government
finance through lower revenues from income and
profit taxes. Public consumption rose by
preliminary 1.7% in 2015, but it is expected to
decelerate in 2016. Planned fiscal consolidation,
including reforms of labour market and social

Other non-EU Countries, EFTA

security laws, should help to strengthen the
medium-term fiscal outlook.
Norway

The outlook for growth in Norway has weakened
as persistently low oil prices are set to weigh on
investment across the petroleum industry, amid
emerging spillovers to other parts of the economy
and a gradual deterioration of consumer and
business sentiment. Real GDP growth is now
expected to slow to 1.2% in 2016 (from 1.6% in
2015) before rebounding to 1.7% in 2017.

Growth in 2015 as a whole came in at 1.6%, lower
than expected, as the buoyant expansion in the
third quarter (1.6% q-o-q) was almost fully
reversed by a contraction in the fourth (-1.2%),
leaving a negative carryover into 2016. The
volatile GDP profile during the course of 2015
largely reflects the exceptionally high fluctuations
in natural-gas production. However, weakness in
the offshore sector is gradually spilling over to the
mainland economy, with signs of softness
emerging in manufacturing and services, e.g. retail
sales. While private consumption has held up
relatively well throughout 2015, the steady
deterioration in consumer confidence amid a
modest worsening in employment prospects and
rising uncertainty, is set to dampen household
spending in the forecast horizon.
Business investment contracted by 4% in 2015,
dragged down by the retrenchment in the off-shore
investment which accounts for roughly one-quarter
of total capital spending. While stabilising oil
prices and solid public investment should limit
further decline, business investment is expected to
remain very weak in the near term, contracting
further in 2016, before rebounding somewhat in

2017 on stabilising oil prices. On the other hand,
residential construction is set to continue solid
expansion in the forecast horizon, driven by
favourable financing conditions.
Contraction in the energy sector together spilling
over to other parts of the economy led to a gradual
pick up in unemployment rate to roughly 4.5% in
the second half of 2015, the highest in a decade.
Unemployment rate is expected to rise further, to
4.7% in 2017, reflecting weaker employment
prospects in both offshore and mainland economy.
The weaker outlook led the central bank to cut the
policy interest rate by 25 bps. to 0.5% in March,
despite inflation running above its 2.5% target
since late 2015. Consumer price inflation, boosted
by the depreciation of the krone, is expected to
ease gradually, converging to the target over the
forecast horizon, as the currency stabilises in line
with oil prices. Fiscal policies will remain
expansionary in the forecast horizon, as
government steps up spending to make up for the
revenue decline due to the downturn in the oil
sector. Budget surpluses will decline to 5.5% of
GDP in 2016, the smallest since 1998, to recover
somewhat in 2017 on rising oil-related revenue.
Risks to the outlook are largely tilted to the
downside and relate mainly to the oil price
assumptions and the impact of retrenchment in the
energy sector onto the mainland economy.
Iceland

Strong consumption, investment and exports
resulted in real GDP growth by 4.0% in 2015.
Employment
rose
by
3.4%,
bringing
unemployment further down to pre-crisis levels of
4.2%. A strengthening exchange rate (by nearly
6%) and low import prices have helped to keep
average inflation low, at 1.6% in 2015. After an
annual fiscal deficit of 0.1% of GDP in 2014, the
2015 budget deficit rose to 0.5% of GDP, mainly
due to high fiscal deficits in the first three quarters.
The high import content of investment and private
consumption resulted in a worsening of Iceland’s
trade balance, increasing the deficit to 3.6% of
GDP by end of 2015.
During 2016 and 2017, key drivers of growth will
be tourism, related investment and strong private
consumption, benefitting from low prices, tourism
and construction driven employment growth and
high wage agreements, concluded in 2015.

143

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

Investment is expected to remain strong reflecting
tourism-related construction, capital renewal in the
fishing and tourism industry and silicon-related
investment projects. These supporting effects are
expected to peter out over the forecast horizon.
Exports are projected to benefit from a flourishing
tourism sector. Stronger domestic demand will
lead to a widening of the trade deficit, while the
services balance will continue to benefit from
strong tourism. Overall, the current account
balance is forecast to deteriorate in 2016-17.

Inflation is likely to rise, reflecting lagged effects
from high wage agreements of 2015, but also due
to strong demand from tourism. The high wage
agreements might dampen employment growth in
the coming years, but will also increase labour
supply. This will have to increasingly come from
abroad, as domestic employment rates are already
high. As a result, the unemployment rate will drop
at a rather moderate rate.
The government’s fiscal target for 2016 of largely
balanced accounts is in line with the current
growth outlook. Exceptional one-off revenues
related to the planned lifting of capital controls
could lead to substantial revenues in 2016. If those
funds are used primarily for lowering the debt
burden, the debt ratio could drop well below 60%
of GDP by end 2017.

The government intends to proceed in the coming
months with the announced capital account
liberalisation. This would have a positive effect on
the country’s medium-term outlook, but could lead
to sudden swings in capital flows, potentially
destabilising the currency, domestic prices and
international price competitiveness.

38. RUSSIAN FEDERATION

A protracted recession and a long path to recovery

Russia is in a protracted recession due to the combined effect of the fall in oil prices, sanctions and
structural bottlenecks. The path towards recovery is set to be extremely slow and gradual amid a
difficult adjustment process to low oil price for longer and the prolongation of sanctions. Hence the
economy is expected to contract further in 2016, before very weak growth resumes in 2017.
Recession and delayed recovery

slight rebound in oil price and the central bank
resuming a monetary easing cycle.

Russia’s economy slid into recession in 2015 as
the collapse in oil prices and economic sanctions
have
exacerbated
pre-existing
structural
weaknesses, mainly the excessive reliance on the
oil and gas sector.

Consumption and investment should keep
declining in 2016

Gov. consumpt.
Net exports
Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Real GDP contracted by 3.7% due to a sharp
decline in private consumption and investment on
the back of elevated borrowing costs, weak
economic confidence and high inflation.
Latest releases of quarterly figures point to a
protracted recession and a further delay in the
recovery, as the fall in GDP decelerated only
slightly in the second half of 2015 (-3.7% and
-3.8% y-o-y in 2015-Q3 and 2015-Q4,
respectively, after a peak of -4.5% in 2015-Q2)
reflecting a continued contraction in investment,
industrial production and retail sales. High
frequency data for the first months of 2016 point to
only modest improvement in retail sales and
industrial production whereas investment remains
in firmly negative territory. The near-term outlook
remains centred on a protracted stagnation due to
low oil price for long, sanctions, weak business
sentiment, very slow recovery in household
income after the large squeeze of 2015 and no
acceleration of structural reforms ahead of
elections. GDP is expected to fall by 1.9% in 2016
and to grow very modestly in 2017 (by 0.5%) due
to gradually subsiding geo-political tensions, a

Investment fell sharply in 2015, with the decline
accelerating again towards the end of the year.
Weak economic confidence, reflecting constrained
access to Western capital markets amid sanctions,
subdued bank lending and lacklustre demand are
set to continue weighing on investment in 2016,
leading to a further contraction.
Private consumption fell even more than
investment, reflecting a slump in real wages amid
high inflation and no or reduced indexation of
public wages, pensions and social transfers, as well
as reduced bank lending to consumers. As
disposable income is expected to recover only very
gradually, given reduced room for wage increases
and severe fiscal consolidation pressures, private
consumption is forecast to decline in 2016 and
remain close to stagnation in 2017.
Exports increased slightly in 2015, as oil
production/export reached record levels and the
rouble depreciation provided a boost to some nonfuel sectors, such as agriculture, metals and
chemicals. Albeit remaining in positive territory,
exports are projected to be on a decreasing trend as
the gain in external competitiveness will be more
than offset by sluggish investment, lack of
structural reforms and approximately flat oil
production amid a coordinated strategy to control
supply among key oil producers. Imports collapsed
in 2015 on the back of the large fall in domestic
demand, the sharp depreciation of the rouble and
the embargo on Western food imports. They are
expected to contract further in 2016 – albeit at a
much smaller pace – and to grow only marginally
in 2017, reflecting a very weak growth recovery.
A somewhat deteriorating labour market

Although the labour market is expected to remain
relatively resilient, adjusting mainly through

145

European Economic Forecast, Spring 2016

wages, employment is expected to contract slightly
over the forecast horizon, as corporates will be
increasingly unable to cut costs without laying off
workers. As a result, unemployment should also
gradually increase, exceeding 6% as of 2016.
Inflation on a downward trend

After reaching new record lows in January 2016,
reflecting a renewed decline in the oil price, the
rouble recovered somewhat, while remaining at
around half of its value in mid-2014 against the
USD. Inflation decreased quite rapidly since the
end of 2015 and reached 7.3% in March (from a
peak of nearly 17% one year earlier) as a result of
low domestic demand, reduced exchange rate passthrough due to lower imports and declining global
food prices. Limited price pressures are expected
to resume later in 2016 amid increased fuel excise
duties, with average annual inflation remaining at
7.5% before falling to 5.4% in 2017 (i.e. closer to
the Bank of Russia’s medium-term target of 4%).
However, the central bank remains wary of
inflation risks stemming from a slow reduction of
inflation expectations, oil price volatility and
uncertainty over budgetary prospects. Hence, it has
refrained from introducing interest rate cuts since
August 2015, although pressures for monetary

easing are likely to mount as inflation declines
further.
Fiscal position to deteriorate further

The fiscal deficit has sharply widened in 2015 due
to lower revenues linked to the slump in oil prices
and was to a large extent financed by tapping the
Reserve Fund. It is set to increase further in 2016,
as budget plans were based on overly optimistic
assumptions about growth and oil price. Also,
additional fiscal consolidation measures remain
unspecified and are unlikely to be significant amid
an election year. Hence, Russia is at serious risk of
fully depleting the Reserve Fund by the end of the
forecast horizon, which should trigger efforts to
achieve a modest deficit reduction in 2017.
Risks to the outlook

Downside risks to the outlook are related to the
possible prolongation of sanctions throughout
2017, which would worsen economic confidence
and further delay investment recovery. A renewed
volatility of oil prices, putting further pressure on
the fiscal and financial sector, via additional
revenue shortfall and rouble depreciation,
respectively, could also weigh on the outlook.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The directorate general for economic and financial affairs (DG ECFIN)
produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged economic
forecasts in Winter, Spring and Autumn. These forecasts cover the
principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member States, the
candidate countries, the European Union as a whole, the euro area and
the international environment.

2. Data for 2015, 2016, and 2017 are forecasts. The source for all tables is the
European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for the
Member States are based on the European System of Accounts (ESA
2010). US national accounts are based on SNA 2008, whilst the Japanese
accounts use SNA 1993.

3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4.

In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.

5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential output
as estimated via a production function, where the increase in the capital
stock and the difference between actual unemployment and the
NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-timeequivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, Italy, and
the Netherlands report FTE data. In the absence of FTE data, employment
is based on numbers of persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area
aggregates, priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more
representative of diverse patterns of working time.

the aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis third
countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the individual
countries in the EU or the euro area. However, intra-EU or intra-euro-area
balances are non-zero because of reporting errors. The creation of the
internal market in 1993 reduced border controls and formalities, and
accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage.
Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU
exports, leading toerestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted"
balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro
area. For the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the
extrapolation of the discrepancies observed in 2015.

9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI,
SK, and FI)
European Union :
EU28 (EA19, BG, CZ, DK, HR, HU, PL, RO, SE, and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedoni
Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Potential candidates :
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Norway,
Switzerland, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :

Asia :
7. Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010). Discrepancies with balance of
payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences and
revision schedules.
8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. World
GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In the tables
on world trade and international payments,

Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar.

All countries in that region except Japan and the Asian MENA
countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
