   Effective Government for Stronger Growth  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Economic growth remains solid in much of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe 
(CESEE). Outside the Commonwealth of Independent St
ates (CIS), growth has continued at a good pace on the back of accommodative macroeconomic policies as well as buoyant 
consumption supported by strong real wage and
 employment growth. In Russia, the pace of 
economic contraction has moderated, as the ec
onomy appears to have adjusted to lower oil 
prices and the sanctions shock. Other CIS econ
omies are gradually exiting from recessions on 
improved external demand. For the region as 
a whole, GDP growth is projected to reach 
1.3 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017, largely 
reflecting the improved outlook in the CIS.  
Given mediocre prospects for potential growth
 and a cyclical rebound near completion 
outside the CIS, current growth may be difficult to sustain
. With several years of growth near 3 percent, there are signs that output gaps a
ppear closed outside the CIS, as unemployment 
rates are falling to pre-crisis levels, real wage
s are growing strongly, and credit growth is reaccelerating. However, inflationary pressures are 
still low and external balances healthy. Still, 
given subdued productivity growth and adverse demographics, these countries may not be able 
to maintain strong growth without rene
wed widening of external imbalances. 
While some risks to the outlook have diminished, downside risks still dominate
. Some risks, such as the pace of monetary normalization in 
key advanced economies and the refugee crisis in 
Europe, appear less prominent than six months 
ago. Other risks, however, such as those 
associated with rising political discord, have become more pronounced. Despite its modest 
impact so far, the longer-term effects of Brexit
Šthe U.K. vote to leave the European UnionŠare 
yet unclear, given the uncertainty about th
e new U.K.-EU economic arrangements.  
Policies need to strike the right balanc
e between supporting near-term growth and 
rebuilding fiscal space
. Over the near-term, 
monetary policy
 is expected to remain 
accommodative or to ease in countries where it 
is tight, which seems generally appropriate given 
expected inflation. At the same time, 
fiscal policy
 appears to be neutral or expansionary in many 
countries. In those economies where growth has 
been running above potential and output gaps 
are closing, this is no longer appropriate. Rath
er, the relatively good times should be used to 
rebuild fiscal buffers by following growth-friendl
y fiscal consolidation, which would also help reduce still high external debt levels.  
For the entire region, the defining challenge is to re-accelerate potential growth and 
convergence
. This will require a new round of struct
ural reforms to raise investment and productivity, as discussed in the Spring 2016 
Regional Economic Issues
 (REI) report. Priorities vary 
across countries and include strengthening govern
ance and institutions as well as improving 
labor supply by increasing participation rates and 
reducing structural unemployment. This report 
focuses on measures to improve public in
vestment management and tax administration. 
November 2, 2016 
  
CESEE REI SPRING 2016 
2    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND        The need to lift potential growth and rebuild fiscal buffers puts a premium on improving 
public investment management and ta
x administration in CESEE countries
. High-quality public investment can help boost potential growth
 in the region, given still large infrastructure 
gaps relative to advanced Europe and generally 
low investment rates. At the same time, many 
CESEE countries are still facing sizeable fiscal 
imbalances. In this setting, improving public 
investment management institutions and tax admini
stration can help create fiscal space that can be used to boost public investment or to reduce the still-elevated fiscal deficits. Based on an in-depth analysis of public inve
stment management and tax administration in 
CESEE, this REI finds the following
:  Closing efficiency gaps in public investment and tax collection could bring sizable 
benefits. Public investment in many CESEE countries, 
except the Baltic states, is less efficient 
than in other European countries. Tax efficiency gapsŠand in particular, tax compliance 
gapsŠremain a challenge in much of the region 
as well. By reducing these efficiency gaps 
(estimated relative to the income level-specif
ic benchmarks), CESEE countries could generate 
between 2 and 4 percent of GDP in fiscal space 
annually that could be used either for public 
investment or for fiscal consolidation. Based on the standard es
timates for public investment 
multipliers (see the October 2014 
World Economic Outlook
), such additional public 
investment could increase the level of GDP by 2Œ4 percent over the medium term, with the 
exact numbers depending on the degree of slac
k in the economy and on the efficiency of 
public investment. There are also broader bene
fits from having better public institutions, 
including a smaller shadow economy. 
  Further upgrades of public investment 
management should focus on improving 
allocation and implementation frameworks and procedures
. Project appraisal and management could be strengthened by building 
capacity, publishing cost-benefit analyses 
of major projects, developing procedures fo
r project adjustment, and conducting ex-post 
evaluations. In CESEE EU countries, stronger pu
blic investment management institutions are 
associated with higher absorption of the EU structural and cohesion funds.    Improvements in tax administration sh
ould aim at reducing compliance gaps
. Countries where tax collection is not unified in a single body or where a functional structure is lacking 
need to bring their institutional arrangements 
in line with best practice. Also, many CESEE 
countries seem to be lagging in provision of
 online services due to outdated and fragile 
systems that significantly constr
ain their reform efforts, including adoption of a strategic 
management approach to tax compliance. Se
veral countries also need to improve 
operational performanceŠparticularly those with high tax debt. 
  Successful reforms to raise government effectiveness require taking into account 
political economy factors
. Certain features of political institutions, such as poor 
accountability, low quality of bureaucracy and weak
 control of corruption 
in politics, tend to 
be negatively correlated with the strength
 of public investment management and tax 
administration. To overcome these constraints, the design of reforms should include 
elements that help reduce resistance to reforms and build the support base for their 
successful completion. CESEE REI FALL 2016

5 I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS 
Growth remains solid in much of the region, 
despite mediocre global activity. Outside the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) the re
covery is now well advanced, but medium-term 
prospects are appreciably less bright than before th
e global financial crisis, as elsewhere in the 
world. In these economies, growth is forecast 
to continue at a good pace, driven by private consumption as wage growth is strengthening. Investment is lagging but should eventually pick up pace. In other economies, notably the CIS, low 
commodity prices and other shocks continue to reverberate, but the worst seems to be over and growth is beginning to turn positive. A.   CESEE Recovery Continues 
amid Mediocre Global Growth 
Both structural and cyclical forces continue to shape the recovery globally and in CESEE
:  Excess supply concerns have 
kept commodity prices low. Together with low imported inflation, 
low oil prices have, in part, supported the CESE
E recovery, keeping inflation in the CESEE EU 
economies subdued and boosting income and 
consumption growth. At the same time, low commodity prices as well as the sanctions in
troduced in 2014 have adversely affected Russia 
and, through various economic linkages,
 its neighboring CIS economies.   
 Structurally weak growth in advanced economies
 has held back global growth. The 
rebalancing in China, while a necessary and 
a welcome process, has added to downward 
pressures. As a result, global trade is anemi
c, continuing to weigh on CESEE activity. 
 Delays in normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies
 due to growth setbacks 
benefited emerging market economies, including in the CESEE region, by keeping financial 
conditions supportive. The impact of Brexit 
on CESEE financial markets has been relatively mild and short lived, given relatively limited direct trade and financial exposure of the region 
to the United Kingdom. After an initial spik
e following the Brexit vote, financial market 
volatility has declined (Figure 1.1, panel 1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Much of the CESEE region continues to grow at a solid pace 
The region has adjusted relatively fast in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis,
 with growth in many economies running about 3 percent for some time
. Most CESEE economies experienced a deep recession after a credit 

boom ended abruptly with the onset of the 

crisis. Following a sizable adjustment, 
however, the region reached pre-crisis GDP 

levels within two years, much faster than 

the euro area (Figure 1.2). In many CESEE 
countries outside the CIS, the appreciable 

reduction in pre-crisis imbalances has 
helped them maintain solid growth. In 

Russia and the rest of the CIS, while the 

adjustment to lower commodity prices 

continues, the growth outlook has 

improved modestly, re
flecting firming oil 
prices. The key developments in the region 

in the first half of 2016 include the 

following:   Outside the CIS
, growth has continued 
at a solid pace on the back of accommodat
ive macroeconomic policies, buoyant private consumption supported by strong wage growth and declining unemployment (Figure 1.3, 
panels 1 and 2). Investment has been sluggish 
in many countries, in the CESEE EU countries, 
this weakness partly reflects lower absorption of the EU Structural Funds during the transition 
to the new 2014Œ20 program (Figure 1.3, panel 2), although investment increased in SEE-EU 
driven by Romania. In the SEE non-EU countri
es, stronger domestic demand in the second 
quarter of 2016 (both consumption and investment
) has been offset by weaker net exports.  
 In the CIS
, the pace of contraction has been moderating
 in Russia as oil prices edged up from 
their lows, while the rest of the CIS is grad
ually exiting from recession, on the back of 
improved external demand.   
The cyclical recovery may be near completion in much of the region 
Most indicators suggest that the recovery is largely completed and that output gaps are 
likely closed outside the CIS
. In particular, unemployment rates are close to pre-crisis levels, 
wages are growing at a solid pace, and credit reco
very is picking up. These developments are in 
contrast to the still-low inflationary pressu
res and healthy current account balances.

 Unemployment is reaching pre-crisis lows, wages have been growing at a strong pace for 

some time, and the current account balances have begun to deteriorate again
. Labor markets have strengthened further in the CE
SEE countries outside of the CIS. With 
unemployment close to historical lows (Figure 1.4,
 panel 1), wage pressures continue to build in several countries (Figure 1.4, panel 2), reflecti
ng also sizable increases in minimum wages (SEE EU, some of the Baltics, and Turkey). In the 
CESEE countries, according to available data, the 
share of workers earning the minimum wage rang
es from 4 to 20 percent. Increases in minimum 
wages contribute to overall wage growth directly and indirectly by pushing up average private 
sector wages. As discussed in Box 1.2 of the Spring 2016 
Regional Economic Issues 
report (REI), 
the elasticity of average wages with respect to
 minimum wages varies from 10 to 40 percent 
across the region. While the strong wage growth does not seem to have had negative effects on 
unemployment yet, if it continues, it would harm competitiveness and job creation (see Box 1.2).

  The credit recovery appears to be catching up with business activity, with the divergence 
across countries driven mainly by local conditions
. Overall, the region is in the repair or the 
early expansion stage of the credit cycle. Outside 
the CIS and Turkey, credit growth has generally 
improved since end-2015, reaching 3Œ5 percent in the second quarter of 2016 in most sub-
regions. In the SEE EU countries, credit contra
ction continues driven by Bulgaria and Croatia (Figure 1.5). However, credit growth dynamics va
ry across CESEE countries. Reflecting growth in household incomes, credit growth to households
 has been improving more consistently across 
the region, while credit to businesses has fared une
venly. The divergence in credit developments 
across these economies is related to demand and supply factors (see Box 1.1). On the supply 

side, in countries where nonperforming loans (NPL
s) have been low or reduced significantly post 
crisis (for example, CEE, Estonia, Lithuania,) and
 where banks have been more profitable (for 
example, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovak Repu
blic,), credit growth has been stronger. On the 
demand side, in countries with lower corporate leve
rage, credit to corporates is expanding, while 
it is still contracting or anemic in countries with 
higher leverage (for example, Croatia, Latvia).

 Accordingly, the IMF staff estimates that 
output gaps outside the CIS have likely 

closed (Figure 1.6). A variety of estimates 
suggest that the cyclical recovery in CESEE 

economies has been completed, except in the 

CIS. In countries outside the CIS, output gaps 

are broadly closed, except for persistent 

negative output gaps in Bosnia and 

Herzegovina and Croatia. Closed or small 

positive output gaps largely reflect elevated 

capacity utilization and cyclical increases in 
employment and hours worked, against an 

appreciably lower estimate for post-crisis 

potential output growth.   That said, there is a wide margin of uncertainty around output gap estimates
. Output gap estimates are prone to change 

appreciably over time: frequent data revisions 
  Figure 1.6. CESEE: Esti
mated Output Gaps, 2016 
 Sources: IMF World Economic Outlook database; and IMF staff 
calculations.  
Note: Output gaps in this figure reflect IMF country desk estimates. 

Ranges are defined as (1) largely closed gap: narrower than Œ1.5 

percent; (2) small negative gap: between Œ3 and Œ1.5 percent; and (3) 

large negative gap: wider than Œ3.5 percent.
 and the end-point bias of filtering methods can lead to major revisions. Also, given the structural 
changes that the CESEE economies have undergone and the short time series available to 

estimate output gaps, the confidence bands around estimates are large. Thus, in assessing the 

macroeconomic policy stance, a wide variety of
 indicators should be taken into account, 
including country-specific data, rather than just econometric estimates of output gaps.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Despite many indicators pointing to largely closed output gaps however, inflationary 
pressures remain low outside the CIS and Turkey
. Both headline and core inflation are low, 
partly as a result of common external factors 
(for example, low energy prices), and inflation 
expectations continue to be low 
and falling (Figure 1.7, panel 3). In the SEE EU countries (Figure 
1.7, panel 1), negative inflation is driven by value added tax cuts in Romania. The upshot of low 
inflation and the relatively high wage growth ma
y be that corporate profit margins are falling, 
despite some recovery in productivity. Box 1.2 looks at the potential implications of lower profit 
margins for inflation and growth. In contrast, Russia and the CIS continue to experience appreciable slack
 (Figure 1.6). Output 
gaps remain negative, on the back of subdue
d private consumption and investment, and real credit growth, while improving, is still negati
ve. Although still elevated, inflation in these 
countries has declined, reflecting the still nega
tive output gaps together with lower-than-
expected exchange rate pass through and declin
ing international food prices (Figure 1.7).

 B.   Monetary, Financial, and Fiscal Conditions 
Monetary policy is expected to remain accomm
odative over the near term or to ease in places where it is contractionary
. Monetary conditions continue 
to be very accommodative in 
economies pegging to the euro, reflecting the Eu
ropean Central Bank™s policies. In the inflation-targeting CEE countries, given negative headline 
inflation, low core inflation, and subdued 
inflation expectations, monetary policy is expected to stay easy as 
well, given that inflation, while 
gradually increasing, is projected to remain be
low targets by end-2017. The forecasts assume no significant changes going forward. In Turkey, de
spite above-target inflation, the central bank 
eased monetary conditions by lowering the ov
ernight lending rate, as the economy has been 
slowing following a strong finish in 2015. Again,
 the forecast assumes no significant change in 
monetary conditions. In Russia, the monetary st
ance is still tight, although the central bank 
lowered its key policy rate in 2016 as inflation and
 inflation expectations have declined, and more 
easing is assumed going forward as inflation 
gradually converges to the inflation target. Financial conditions are expected to remain supportive, as monetary policy in advanced 
economies is expected to tighten more slowly than envisioned in April
. Financial market 
sentiment toward emerging market economies has 
improved as concerns about a fast pace of 
Federal Reserve tightening eased and very low interest rates are ex
pected to continue for longer 
in the other major advanced economies, keepin

balance of payments data suggest that net capita
l flows have improved in
 most countries since end-2015 (Figures 1.8, panels 1Œ3). Against the backdrop of favorable external financing conditions, negative country specific shocks 
appear to have had a limited impact so far
. For 
example, in Turkey, the failed coup attempt and subsequent imposition of a state of emergency 

have had only a small effect on capital flows (Fig
ure 1.8, panel 3), notwithstanding an easing of 
Turkish monetary policy and a still large current 
account deficit. And, market reaction to the 
recent downgrade of Turkey™s sovereign credit 
to non-investment grade by Moody™s (Ba1, stable 
outlook) has been negative, but orderly.

13 Western banks™ exposures to the region are showing signs of stabilization, following 
several years of deleveraging after the financ
ial crisis, and the trend is likely to continue. In the aftermath of the crisis, Western banks began to
 reduce their external positions in the CESEE 
region because of the need to reduce leverage 
and rebuild capital buffers, as well as weak credit 
demand. The decline in foreign banks™ claims on CIS countries accelerated after these countries 
slipped into recession in 2014 (Figure 1.9, panel 2). Since late 2015, 
however, external positions of 
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)-re
porting banks outside the CIS have shown some signs of stabilization (Figure 1.9, panel 1). Acco
rding to bank surveys, Western banks adjusted 
their exposures in the region, differentiating a
cross countries based on their economic prospects 
and progress on private nonfinancial sector de
leveraging (EIB, 2015, 2016). Banks have gradually 
increased exposures to countries with better econ
omic fundamentals and market potential, while continuing to withdraw from countries strugglin
g with high NPLs, high corporate leverage, and 
weak aggregate demand (for example, Croatia,
 Hungary, Slovenia) (see also Box 1.1). Going 
forward, challenges remain, as many European banks 
continue to struggle with still high levels of 
impaired assets and low profitability in a low-gr
owth and low-interest rate environment (IMF 
2016c, Chapter 1). Thus, further improvements in le
nding conditions will likely be very gradual.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Fiscal policy is expected to be neutral or expansionary in many economies in the region, 
while structural fiscal deficits remain large. On the back of largely closed output gaps outside 
the CIS, fiscal policy is pro cyclical in 
several economies, with structural fiscal 

deficits estimated to deteriorate in 

2016Œ17 relative to 2015 (for example, 

the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, 

Romania, Turkey). The deterioration of 

structural fiscal balances in these 
economies reflects a combination of 

spending slippages and tax cuts. For 
example, in Romania, a package of tax 

cuts and expenditure hikes, including an 

ad-hoc salary increase, is expected to 

reverse the consolidation trend seen in 

recent years. In Turkey, higher 

expenditures (for example, due to the 

increase of the minimum wages) will 

push up fiscal deficit in 2016. More 

broadly, structural fiscal deficits are 

projected to stay large (2Œ3 percent of 

GDP) in many CESEE countries (Figure 1.10).   C.   CESEE Outlook: Question
s about Medium-Term Growth Can the current pace of growth in CESEE economies be sustained?  
 Growth is projected to continue at a similar pace or strengthen in many CESEE countries 
over the near term
. Accommodative macroeconomic policies and buoyant consumer 
confidence are likely to propel near-term grow
th. In addition, growth should increase as a 
number of emerging market economies that ex
perienced deep recessions, including Russia, 
begin to recover. The near-term outlook
 across sub-regions is as follows:   In the Baltics, growth is projected to firm up, driven by private consumption and supportive 
macroeconomic policies. In the CEE region, although somewhat slower than in 2015, in large 
part as a result of lower EU funds usage for 
the 2014Œ20 cycle, growth is projected to remain solid at about 3 percent in 2016Œ17, as fiscal 
stances ease and investment recovers. In the 
SEE EU economies, growth is projected to hover around 3¼Œ3½ percent, driven by private 
consumption and easier fiscal policy in some. In the 
SEE non EU economies, growth is 
expected to improve in 2017, mainly reflec
ting stronger growth in Serbia.    
 In Russia, following a significant moderation of th
e recession in 2016, GDP is projected to 
return to growth in 2017 supported by higher o
il prices. In the CIS, the recovery is projected Figure 1.10. CESEE: Structural Fiscal Balance

oved outlook in Russia, given the close linkages 
between Russia and the rest of the CIS through trade and remittances. 
 In Turkey, growth is expected to be below potential over the next couple of years. In 2016, 
slower growth reflects adverse external shocks, alongside the negative impact of the credit 
slowdown, real effective exchange rate apprec
iation, and weakness in consumer and investor confidence amidst heightened 
political uncertainty. In 2017, gr
owth is projected to remain 
below potential as the one-off factors pushing 
growth in 2016 dissipate, and headwinds from 
eroded business confidence further weigh on investment.

. In part reflecting common external 
factors, headline inflation in these 
countries is now projected to increase more grad
ually in the near term relative to the April 
expectations, with the inflation forecast revi
sed down by ¾ and ½ percentage points for 2016 and 2017, respectively (Figure 1.12). For 2017, th

factors.  
 
In the CIS and Turkey, inflation is projected to remain high. In the CIS, inflation is projected 
to moderate further over the near term reflecting
 somewhat stronger exchange rates. In Turkey, 
inflationary pressures are expected to stay elevated amid carryover effects from last year™s 

depreciation and monetary easing.

. 1/ Domestic policies include monetary and fiscal (changes in ta
xes) and other factors, including output gap and inflation expec
tations.  
Looking further ahead, the current pace of
 growth may be challenging to sustain
. The region is exposed to global headwinds and its growth potential appears to
 have declined after 
the global financial crisis. As discussed in th
e Spring 2016 REI (Chapter 2), reflecting lower investment rates and weaker productivity growth, potential growth across the region has 
declined significantly following the crisis (to 1Œ4 percent across countries during 2013Œ15, from 
3Œ8 percent during 2002Œ08). In an environment of 
a mediocre global activity, with largely closed 
output gaps and growing pressures on profits outside the CIS, CESEE countries may not be able 

to maintain strong growth without either signific
antly boosting productivity or facing a renewed widening of external imbalances.  
 D.   Risks Remain Tilted to the Downside The risks to the outlook have diminished somewhat compared with the Spring 2016 
Regional Economic Issues
, but continue to be tilted to the downside
. While some risks, such 
as the pace of monetary normalization in key advanced economies and the refugee crisis in 

Europe, appear less prominent relative to the spring, other risks, particularly those associated 

with rising political discord have become more
 pronounced. The main downside risks are:  
 Tighter and more volatile global financial conditions
. The likelihood and the impact of this risk 
is assessed by the IMF staff as broadly unc
hanged from six months ago (Figure 1.13). Although markets have shown resilience in response to the Brexit shock, market risk 

premiums in the CESEE economies appear generally compressed, which leaves countries 

exposed to the risk of an abrupt correction. Count
ries with a relatively high leverage or with 
financing needs (fiscal or externalŠfor example, Belarus, Croatia, Hungary, Montenegro, and 

Turkey) are more vulnerable to an abrupt shif
t in market sentiment. This is particularly

17 relevant for Turkey, given a larg
e negative net international investment position and sizeable external financing needs.  
 Structurally weak growth in major adv
anced economies, notably the euro area
. The likelihood and impact of this risk are broadly unchanged since the spring. Persistently slow growth in advanced economies, and notably the euro area, 
is an important risk for the region, given its 
high real and financial linkages with the euro area. Moreover, although the initial impact of 

Brexit was less than feared, the medium- and 
long-term effects are unclear, including the 
impact on the EU budget and EU structural funds, given the uncertainty about the economic 

arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  
 A significant slowdown in China or a failure 
of other major emerging market economy to 
gradually heal. Both the likelihood and impact of this risk are broadly unchanged from six 
months ago. An appreciable slowdown in Chi
na would affect CESEE economies via different 
channels (for example, CEE and some in SEE economies via lower exports and commodity 
exporters, notably Russia, through negative 
terms of trade shocks, as commodity prices decline).   Political discord and policy uncertainty. This risk has been first discussed in the Spring 2016 
REI, but is now seen as more likely and with a 
higher impact than six months ago. Since then, 
there has been an increase in political uncertain
ty in some CESEE countries, while others have 
seen rising inward-looking sentiments, which 
may lead to increased pressures for policy 
reversals or failure to implement needed refo
rms. The economic fallout from inward-looking 
policies and protectionism can be appreciabl
e, with an adverse impact on both local 
economies and trade.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Box 1.1. Credit Recovery: What Is Behind the Divergence? 
After several years of contraction since the global fina
ncial crisis, credit is finally picking up in many 
CESEE countries outside the CIS and Turkey
. In 
the Czech Republic, Po
land, and the Slovak 
Republic, and more recent
ly, Lithuania, credit 
growth has increased notably since 2014 (Figure 
1.5). In contrast, credit has continued to contract in 
a number of countries, most notably in Croatia, 
Hungary, Latvia, and Slovenia, while corporate 
credit growth has remained slightly negative in 
Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania (Figure 1.1.1). 
However, there are signs that credit contraction may be nearing a trough, with economic recovery 
now well advanced. 
The data suggest that the divergence in credit 
recovery is explained by both supply and 
demand factors 
(see IMF (2014a, 2014b for 
analysis based on bank 
level data before 2014). 
Almost all CESEE economies have gone through a 
credit boom and bust cycle, despite differences in 
the pace of financial deepening (see IMF 2015d). 
Following the crisis, banks were laden with high 
non-performing loans (NPLs), which re
duced earnings and tied up resource
s that could have been used for 
new loans. Lending was also initially affected by the ch
anges in regulation and by 
the funding conditions of 
parent banks. Output contraction in the early stage of the crisis also lowered credit demand. Now that 
funding conditions have improved, and economic recovery has taken hold, the divergence in credit growth 
across CESEE countries is more closely associated with di
fferences in the health of 
domestic banks (affecting 
credit supply) and private non-financial se
ctor leverage (affecting credit demand). 
On the supply side, the health of banks™ balance sh
eets is an important determinant of differences in 
credit growth
. The key indicator of asset quality is the level of NPLs, which are generally higher for the 
corporate sector than for the retail sector. Consistent 
with earlier bank-level anal
ysis, the latest aggregate 
data suggest that credit growth tends to be stronger
 where NPLs are lower. In addition, bank profitability 
(for example, measured as return 
on equity) is another factor associ
ated with credit growth. While the 
causality can go both ways, in countries where banks 
have been more profitable (for example, the Czech 
Republic and the Slovak Republic), 
credit growth has been stronger than in countries with weaker bank 
profitability. In contrast, bank
 leverage and capitalization seem less relevant (Figure 1.1.2). 
On the demand side, credit to firms has also b
een affected by the level of corporate leverage
. High 
corporate leverage may deter 
lending because of banks™ concerns about credit quality, but also because of 
the weak demand from firms that are still suffering fr
om debt overhang. Leverage ratios have declined in 
CESEE countries following the crisis (see IMF 2015d). Howe
ver, they remain high in a few countries (Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Latvia, Slovenia, and Romania) where credit continues to contract. At the same time, in countries 
with lower corporate leverageŠthe 
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Lithuania (Figure 1.1.3)Šcredit 
growth to businesses is expanding.  
The relative importance of supply-vers
us-demand factors varies across countries
. For example, while 
the strength of bank™s balance sheets in
 Latvia is similar to that in Lithua
nia, corporate sector credit remains 
flat in Latvia likely due to a much higher level of co
rporate indebtedness. In Hung
ary, however, even though 
leverage levels of businesse
s are lower or comparable to those in co
untries where credit is expanding, the 
low profitability of banks, which has been affected
 by the bank tax and foreign exchange conversion 
introduced in recent years, seems to ha
ve limited the issuance of new loans.

 Looking ahead, a recent European Investment Bank
 (EIB) bank lending survey suggests that credit 
demand will continue to increase faster than credit supply
. The June 2016 EIB survey suggests that 
corporate sector credit demand la
rgely reflects demand for debt re
structuring, working capital, and 
investment (EIB 2016). With both the regulatory environment generally more stable, and banks™ capital 
conditions normalizing, credit supply should continue 
to improve gradually. Nevert
heless, for countries that 
still have relatively high corporate 
leverage, meeting the credit demand
 for debt restructuring may be a 
challenge without measures to alleviat

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Box 1.2. CESEE EU: A Closer Look at Corporate Profit Margins 
Real wages have grown strongly in many CESEE EU
 countries over last several quarters, putting 
pressure on corporate profit margins
. On the back of a tight labor ma
rket in several economies, with 
unemployment reaching pre-crisis levels and a wave 
of minimum wage increases across the region (May 
2016 
Regional Economic Issues
, Box 1.2), corporate wage bills have 
grown fast. While employment has been 
rising as well, wage growth has ac
counted for most of the labor cost 
increases in many CESEE EU countries 
since early 2015 (Figure 1.2.1). This trend has weighed 
on profit margins, which have fallen below their long-
term averages in several countries 
(Figure 1.2.3). Corporate profit ma
rgins have declined the most in 
countries with faster labor co
st growth (Figure 1.2.2).

Note: Profit margin = 1Šcompensation of employees/gross value 
added (nonfinancial private sector).
 The gap is calculated as the 
deviation of profit margins from their 2002Œ16:H2 average.  
 How could the pressure on profit margins potentially play out?
 If labor market pressures persist, firms 
may not be able to allow a further decline of the alre
ady compressed profit margins, since this could erode 
their profits and negatively impact investment. The pote
ntial macroeconomic implicat
ions of firms™ responses 
to shrinking profit margins could be as follows:  
 Passing wage costs to prices of final goods
. Under this scenario, inflation will increase and the 
recovery will likely continue
, albeit at the price of deteriorating co
mpetitiveness. Given the relatively weak 
external competitiveness (exchange rate above long term average) for some countries however, firms may 
not be always able to pass wage increases to prices with
out losing market share and further loss of profits.  
 Labor productivity catching up
. If firms could increase the labor productivity, this would help rebuild 
corporate margins, while inflation would remain contained. However, lifting productivity on a large scale 
would likely require reforms to addr
ess structural bottlenecks and othe
r institutional deficiencies (as 
discussed in the Spring 2016 REI)
. Such structural reforms typically take time to bear fruit. 
 Reducing corporate sector costs by cutting employment or wages.
 If cost pressures cannot be passed 
on to final goods (for example, beca
use of tight external competition), firms could be forced to contain the 
wage bill by reducing workforce or 
wages. As a result, growth could slow
 and inflation would remain low.

21 With profit margins near 2009 lows in some and fa
lling appreciably in other CESEE EU countries, the 
current solid growth may be difficult to sustain
. In Hungary, the Slovak Republic, and the Baltics, 
corporate margins are already close to
 the lows seen during the 2009 
crisis, when businesses started to 
reduce labor costs through layoffs an
d wage cuts. And, in the Czech Repu
blic, Poland, and Romania, margins 
have deteriorated appreciably since end-2015 (Figure 1.
2.3). While there is uncertainty about how the decline 
in margins will play out, without a rebound in producti
vity, which takes time, it may be difficult to achieve 
durable growth. In countrie
s where margins are at very low levels 
and firms cannot pass through increased 
labor costs to goods prices, for exampl
e, because of emerging signs of ex
ternal competitiven
ess pressures in 
some cases (Figure 1.2.4), growth w
ill likely moderate. In countries wh
ere corporate profit margins have 
deteriorated, but corporates could ab
sorb higher labor costs or pass it
 onto prices of final goods (for 
example, CEE, Romania), solid growth 
may continue in the near term, but it may be hard to sustain over the 
medium term.  Figure 1.2.3. CESEE EU: Gap in Corporate Profit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND E.   Policy Priorities Given headwinds to growth as well as the need to 
rebuild fiscal space, a combination of supportive 
monetary policy and growth-friendly fiscal cons
olidation is the appropriate policy mix for many 
economies in the region. In Russia 
and the CIS, the challenge is to
 put in place solid medium-term 
fiscal consolidation plans, while proceeding gradually with consolidation in the near term to foster 
continued recovery of economic activity. For the enti
re region, structural reforms are critical to raise investment and productivity and secure durable growth.  
Policies need to strike a balance between supporting near-term growth, and rebuilding 

fiscal buffers. This calls for a combination of easy 
monetary policy and removal of fiscal 
accommodation where relatively solid gr
owth has been closing output gaps: 
 
 Monetary policy
: given very low inflation and appr
eciable downside risks, premature 
tightening of monetary policy in countries with
 closing output gaps should be avoided. In 
light of persistently low inflat
ion, if growth surprises on the downside, inflation targeting 
central banks with space should cut rates further. More generally, policy rates are close to the 
zero lower bound and risks rela
ted to inflation overshooting appear to be lower than risks 
related to undershooting, arguing 
for patience in raising rates.  
  Fiscal policy
: given still large fiscal deficits and th
e state of the cyclical recovery, many 
economies in the region should consolidate in
 a growth-friendly manner, which would also 
help reduce still high external debt levels. Th
is means further reforming entitlement systems, 
for example by raising statutory retirement
 ages and better targeting support to the vulnerable; reforming the civil services where wages are high relative to the private sector and public employment is large; and restructuring loss-making public enterprises, while 
eliminating subsidies. 
  Balance sheet repair
: further progress in addressing NPLs is needed to revive credit and 
investment growth in the region (see Box 1.1). Several countriesŠ Hungary, Kosovo, Romania, and SloveniaŠhave made notable pr
ogress in reducing NPLs (including by adequate provisioning and subsequent write-offs) and others (for example, Albania, Serbia) 
have put in place comprehensive action plans that have yet to bear fruit (see the 
new Vienna 
Initiative NPL website
 for details).  
 The two largest economies which are dealing wi
th the impact of shocks need to further 
strengthen resilience and avoid premature an
d excessive monetary or fiscal tightening
.   
 In Russia, while helped by firming commodity prices, the economy is still in a recession and 
operating below potential, arguing for a 
cautious approach to removing fiscal accommodation. At the same time, to su
pport the recovery and offset the less 
accommodative fiscal stance, monetary polic
y should be eased further but at a pace 
commensurate with the decline in underlying 
inflation and inflation expectations. For the CESEE REI FALL 2016
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND    
23 medium-term, policies need to address the cha
llenge of persistently lower oil prices, which requires high-quality and durable fiscal adjustment.  

  For 
Turkey, policies should aim at using the favorable 
external conditions to build buffers and address external imbalances, reducing inflatio
n, and addressing long-lasting structural 
weaknesses. Automatic stabilizers should be allo
wed to work this year, and in the event of 
further slowdown in 2017. Over the medium te
rm, additional tighteni
ng may be needed, if external imbalances persist and inflation remains high. 
 
Amid diminished prospects for global growth, reforms to boost productivity and investment and reinvigorate convergence of the region gain in importance
. Structural reforms are key to reinvigorate investment and 
productivity and secure durable growth in the CESEE region. As discussed in the Spring 2016 REI, to close appreciable productivity gaps with 
advanced Europe, reforms should focus on strength
ening institutions (for example, legal systems, 
property rights, healthcare), increasing the affordability of financial services (especially for small 
but productive firms), and improving government
 efficiency. Given unfavorable demographics 
and emigration, active labor market policies aimed at increasing participation rates and reducing structural unemployment may be 
needed to boost labor supply. For Russia, structural reforms 
remain essential to leverage 
the more competitive exchange ra
te and raise productivity and 
investment, while diversifying the sources of ec
onomic growth. For Turkey, structural reforms 
should focus on increasing private saving rates and improving the business climate. 
 
Enhancing government efficiency can contribu
te to higher potential growth in CESEE 
countries. The gains from more efficient government 
go beyond fiscal implications. Increasing government efficiency can help 
lift productivity and growth through both higher and better 
quality investment, while avoiding additional fiscal
 pressures. The efficiency
 of public investment and tax administration is the focus of the next chapter.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CESEE REI FALL 2016 
24    
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND II. EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT FOR STRONGER GROWTH
 Lifting potential growth is a key challenge and policy priority for CESEE. 
After the crisis, 
potential growth in CESEE has halved on account of weaker investment and lower total factor 
productivity (TFP) growth, prompting countries in the region to search for a new growth model. 
The reasons behind weak investment and ways of 
boosting it, including by using public resources 
for infrastructure projects, have been the focus 
of policy debates and recent initiatives at the 
global, national, and EU level (for example, the J
uncker Plan). The scope for public investment to 
boost growth in CESEE is significant because in
frastructure gaps are still large relative to 
advanced Europe, while invest
ment rates are generally low.1 However, public investment can 
serve as a catalyst for growth only if it™s done 
right. Recent studies found that public investment 
tends to lift short- and long-term output higher when public investment is efficient (see October 
2014 World Economic Outlook).  
At the same time, fiscal consolidation remains imperative for many CESEE countries.
 Most CESEE countries still face sizable adjustment needs to
 stabilize their debt levels or to return to full 
compliance with the EU fiscal rules.
2 The need to gradually rebuild fiscal buffers limits the fiscal 
space for public investment.  

 
The need to lift potential growth and rebuild fiscal buffers puts a premium on improving 

public investment management and tax administration in CESEE
. More efficient public 
investment would improve the quality and accessibility of infrastructure, which would enable private sector to allocate resour
ces more efficiently and raise pr
oductivity. A more efficient tax administration would provide additional resources to pursue grow
th-friendly fiscal consolidation or may create fiscal space to step up pu
blic investment to boost growth further.  
The efficiency of public investment an
d tax administration across CESEE countries
 is the 
focus of this chapter. 
In part as a response to calls for a more granular analysis of institutional 
reforms and ﬁreform champions,ﬂ this chap
ter aims to accomplish the following:  
 Estimate efficiency gaps in public investme
nt and tax administration in CESEE countries 
 Assess which institutions need to be strengthen
ed in order to increase efficiency of public 
investment management and tax administration 
 Estimate potential (fiscal and economic) gain
s from closing efficiency gaps in public 
investment and tax administration 
 Distill lessons from the experiences of 
best performers and ﬁreform championsﬂ  Consider the political economy aspects of government effectiveness 
 Draw policy implications and recommendations.

25 A. Making Public Investment More Efficient 
Most CESEE countries have upgraded their pub
lic investment management institutions and 
increased efficiency of public investment over 
the past decade. While there is scope for further 
improvement of project appraisal and management 
in most countries in the region, the non-EU 
CESEE countries would also benefit from increasing transparency of implementation, ensuring 
timely availability of funding, as well as im
proving company regulati
on and management of public-private partnerships (PPPs).   
1. How Efficient is Public Investment in CESEE? 

 
Efficient public investment can he
lp boost productivity and growth. Public investment through delivery of key public services and 

infrastructure creation can boost returns to 

private investment and education, raise 
productivity, and support growth (October 
2014 World Economic Outlook; Easterly and 
Rebelo 1990; Dhont and Heylen 2009). 

However, the economic impact of public 
investment depends on its efficiency. Poorly 

selected and implemented projects waste 

resources, while more efficient public 

investment leads to better economic 
outcomes (IMF 2015a; Gupta and others 

2014). Given that most CESEE countries have 

large gaps in public capital stock and 

infrastructure relative to advanced Europe, 

there is significant scope for public investment   

Šif carried out efficientlyŠto boost potential 
growth in the region (Figure 2.1).   

 
The efficiency of public investment is assesse
d by comparing the quality of infrastructure and access to public services with invested resources.
 The public investment efficiency scores
 presented here are constructed following the a
pproach used in IMF (2015a) and in line with 
standard literature. Countries with the highest level of infrastructure coverage and quality 
(outputs) for a given level of public capital stock 
and income per capita (inputs) are assigned the efficiency score of 1 and form the 
efficiency frontier
, while other countries are assigned a score of 
between 0 and 1, based on their proximity to the fr
ontier (see Annex IV for details). The closer to 
the efficiency frontier, the high
er the efficiency score and the smaller the efficiency gap.   
 
On average, public investment efficiency in 
CESEE is in line with other emerging market economies (EMs), but somewhat lower than in advanced economies 
(Figure 2.2). CESEE countries have, on average, an efficiency gap of 
about 15 percent, which is similar to other EMs,

Europe (20 percent).

Šsuch as Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Poland, and Turkey
Šhave made significant progress (Figure 2.2).
3  2. Institutional Framework for Public Investment Management 
Differences in public investment efficiency across countries can be linked to differences in 
their public investment management frameworks. 
Many factors could affect how public investment is translated into quality infrastructure. These factors could include the level of 

economic development, the quality of governance, and structural characteristics of the economy, 

as well as geography (which could affect transpor
t connectivity and access). Nonetheless, there is 
growing evidence that institutions and processe
s that comprise public investment management 
(PIM) matter for public investment efficiency (B
alassone and Franco 2000; Creel and others 2007; 
Dabla-Norris and others 2012).  

                                                                                           

Public Investment Management Assessment 

(PIMA) methodology developed by the IMF 

provides a scorecard for assessing the strength of 

PIM institutions and practices (IMF 2015a). PIMA evaluates and quantifies the strength of 15 key 

institutions in the following three stages of investment 

process (Figure 2.3):  
1. Planning sustainable levels of investment requires 
institutions that ensure public investment is fiscally 

sustainable and effectively coordinated across 

sectors, levels of government, and between public 

and private sectors. PIMA quantifies strength in 

five areas: (1) 
fiscal rules, (2) 
national and sectoral plans, (3) central-local coordination
, (4) management of public-private partnership; and (5) regulatory framework of infrastructure companies
. 2. Allocating investment to the right sectors and projects requires institutions that create a 

comprehensive, unified, and medium-term 

perspective to capital budgeting. It also depend
s upon objective and transparent criteria and procedures for appraising and selecting particul
ar investment projects. In this regard, PIMA 
                                                   3 Alternative efficiency scores includ
ing those with purely physical or qualit
y outputs have also been considered 
and may show somewhat different trends for individual c
ountries, but are all highly correlated (see Annex IV for 
details). Another caveat is that such e
fficiency scores, which are meant to pr
ovide an indication of available room 
for improvement, are not to be taken in isolation and need 
to be interpreted using countr
y-specific information.   Figure 2.3. The PIMA Framework

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND evaluates the strength of (6) multi-year budgeting, (7) budget comprehensiveness (reflecting all investments in budget documentations re
gardless of the source of financing), (8) 
budget 
unity (proper accounting of immediate capital and future recurrent operating and 
maintenance costs), (9) project appraisal (extent of transparency, standardized approach, and 
reflection of risks), and (10) 
project selection (transparent, systemic vetting of projects to be 
included in the pipeline of approved projects).  
3. Implementing 
projects on time and on budget.
 The timely and cost-effective 
implementation of public investment projects 
depends on institutions that ensure projects 
are fully funded, transparently tendered, and effectively managed throughout their 

implementation. In this regard, PIMA evaluates the existence and strength of: (11) protection of investment (ensuring sufficiency of funds and preventing diversion of budgeted funds to 
other uses), (12) availability of funding 
(timely cash flow from treasury), (13) transparency of 
budget execution (competitive and transparent tender
ing of major projects, independent 
audits), (14) project management (well-identified project manager and standardized 
guidelines for adjustments); and (15) monitoring of public assets (proper accounting, recording of assets and depreciation in financial accounts) 
How does the scorecard approach work?
 For each of the 15 institutions described above, three 
key features are identified and are given numerical
 scores based on whether that feature is fully 
met, partly met, or not met (see
 Annex V for details). The scores for each of the 15 institutions 
are normalized between 0 and 10, with 10 representing ﬁbest practice.ﬂ An aggregate PIMA score 

and sub-aggregate scores for Planning, Allocation, and 
Implementation are constructed by 
averaging scores for the corresponding institutions.4   
The analysis of the link between PIM strength an
d efficiency of public investment is based 
on a large and diverse data set
, which contains PIMA scores for 50 countries, comprising 20 
CESEE countries, 11 advanced economies and 19 other emerging market economies.
5 This dataset builds on the PIMA database used in IM
F (2015a), but it has broader coverage due to 
inclusion of additional CESEE countries. The PIMA
 scores for added CESEE countries are based on 
country authorities™ and IMF staff assessments. 

 
Countries with higher overall PIMA scores tend
 to have more efficient public investment. 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the correlations of the over
all and institution-specific PIMA scores with 
efficiency of public spending in CESEE countri
es. The overall PIMA score and particularly the 
                                                   
4 PIMA framework is similar to several other diagnostic tools, such as the Public Investment Management Index (Dabla-Norris 
and others 2012) and the World Bank™s ﬁuni
fied frameworkﬂ (Rajaram 
and others 2014), but it is more comprehensive as it 
brings in the macro-fiscal dimension of the public investment process such as fiscal rules, central-local coordination, PPP 
management, and regulation of state-ow
ned infrastructure companies.    
5 The sample covers a broad range of countries in terms of income, geography, and size. It includes 21 CESEE countries (all 
CESEE countries except Moldova), another 11 advanced economies 
(Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and United
 States) and 19 emerging market economies (Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, 
Cameron, Chile, China, Ghana, India, Indone
sia, Jordan, Mexico, Philippines, Qatar, 
Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sri Lanka,
 and South Africa). Low-income countries are not included in the analysis presented in this report.

29 implementation score appear to be most closely 
associated with public investment efficiency. 
Weaker statistical significance of correlations
 for some PIMA scores may be due to lower 
variability within the sample or could mean that 
some institutional weakne
sses are less binding.   
High cross-correlations among some of the instit
ution-specific PIMA scores suggest strong 
complementarities
, as also discussed in IMF (2015a). For 
example, project appraisal, selection, 
and project management are strongly correlated 
suggesting these institutions and capacities 
may need to be developed in tandem. Multiy
ear budgeting and protection of investment allocations are strongly correlated in CESEE hi
ghlighting the link between sound budgeting and 
orderly financing of projects. High cross-corre
lations suggest the need for a comprehensive 
approach to PIM reforms.

in terms of the quality of 
planning institutions, partly reflecting the adoption of fiscal rules in 
many CESEE countries, while 
allocation and implementation institutions in CESEE have more 
scope for improvement. There are also notable differences in the quality of PIM frameworks 

between CESEE EU and non-EU countries. The PI
M institutions in CESEE EU members are on 
average as strong or in some areas (for example, central-local coordination and monitoring of assets) stronger than in the rest of the EU, while
 the PIM institutions in non-EU countries are generally weaker.

31 And most CESEE countries have better public investment management institutions than 
one might expect given their per capita income levels. 
Admittedly, it is not straightforward to 
sort out the direction of causality or rule out ot
her factors that could drive both income and PIM 
institutions. However, it is clear that severa
l aspects of PIM, such as appraisals, project 
management, and monitoring of assets, are resour
ce and skill-intensive activities; the ability to 
improve them would depend on not only the 
willingness to carry them out but also the 
availability of adequate resources. As Figure 
2.6 illustrates (and consistent with IMF (2015a)) 
countries with higher per capita income levels te
nd to have better PIMA scores. If one thinks of 
the fitted line in Figure 2.6 as an expected PIMA
 score for a given level of per capita income, 
most CESEE countries appear to have stronger PI
M institutions than what would be implied by 
their income levels. But those CESEE countries 
that are below the line could do much better 
given resources they have and are likely to bene
fit the most from a granular diagnostic and 
upgrading of their PIM institutions.
 4. How to Improve Public Investment Management in CESEE? 
The PIMA assessment is a good starting po
int for identifying areas for improvement. 
Figure 2.7
 illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of
 each of 15 PIMA indicators in CESEE 
countries relative to best practice: red and green 
colors, respectively repres
ent scores that fall in the bottom and top quartile of the distribution of each score among all advanced and emerging 
market economies in the sample, and yellow 
represents the middle two quartiles of the 
distribution.  
 
Project appraisal
 and management appear to be common weaknesses in the region. 
In addition, for each CESEE sub-region, we highlight
 the following specific areas with the largest 
scope for improvement based on the PIMA scores, t
hat is, where institutions are relatively weak 
compared to peers and in addition, are strongly 
linked with efficiency of public investment (as 
shown in Figure 2.4): 

 
 Baltic counties
 have overall strong PIM institutions
 (see Box 2.1 for a case study of 
Lithuania), though 
project appraisal and management of PPPs
 can be further improved by (1) 
undertaking appraisals for all projects (not only for EU-funded projects); (2) publishing the 
cost-benefit analysis of major projects; (3) better 
reflection of fiscal risks from PPPs in budget 
documents.  
 CEE countries
 also boast strong institutions comp
ared with their peers and in some 
instances PIM institutions improved with the 
EU accession and as countries gained more experience with the use of the EU Funds (Box 2.1).  
Project appraisal and project management can be further improved by (1) undertaking and 
publishing appraisals for all major projects 
(not only EU-funded projects), (2) developing 
procedures for project adjustment throughout 
the implementation, and (3) conducting ex
-post review/evaluation of projects.  
CESEE REI FALL 2016 
32    
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  SEE EU countries
 have stronger planning processes than S
EE-non-EU in light of having fiscal 
rules in line with EU guidelines (see Box 2.
1). Despite some improvement after the EU 
accession, project appraisal, selection, and transparency of execution could be further improved by: (1) undertaking and publishing appr
aisals for all major projects (not only EU-
funded projects), and (2) undertaking open and transparent procurement process and 

publishing results for major projects. 
 Non-EU CESEE countries
 vary considerably in their level of development and institutions. All 
countries in this group would benefit from improving project appraisal
, and transparency of execution. Some need further improvement in 
availability of funding 
and protection of investment by ensuring that allocated cash flows to
 approved projects are not appropriated 
for other uses.  Better frameworks for 
company regulation and management of PPPs can also improve performance of state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) in provision of infrastructure and minimize fiscal risks from PPPs.  Figure 2.7. Relative Strength of Public In

33 Box 2.1 takes a closer look at the experiences of
 CESEE countries that enjoyed marked increase in 
the efficiency of their public investment during 
2006Œ13 (as shown in Figure 2.2).  For several EU 
countries, the objective of increasing the absorp
tion of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds provided strong incentives to improve PIM institutions, particularly in the areas of project 
appraisal and management. In Turkey, particular 
infrastructure deficiencies were targeted and 
addressed through national and sectoral development plans.  5. What Are the Payoffs from Improving Public Investment Management? 

Improving public investment management woul
d help increase public investment without 
creating additional fiscal pressures
. Higher efficiency of public investment means that the 
same quality and access can be achieved with less fiscal resources. Analysis shows that closing 
efficiency gaps in CESEE countries can save
 between 0.1 and 1.5 percent of GDP a year 
(Figure 2.8, panel 2). Given that the infrastructu
re investment needs in CESEE remain quite large and the level of public investment is far from excessive
6 (Figure 2.8, panel 1), countries could use these fiscal savings to boost infrastructure investment. 
 
More efficient public investment can be a catalyst for higher productivity and growth. 
Efficient public investment has been identified 
in the literature as a factor that amplifies the 
impact of public investment on growth (IMF 2015a, Gupta and others 2014). Indeed, countries 
that are able to provide higher quality infrastructu
re tend to have higher total factor productivity (Figure 2.8, panel 3). Using standard estimates 
for public investment multipliers (see October 
2014 World Economic Outlook), one can estimate the potential growth impact from additional 
public investment. Given the mix of countries in 
the CESEE region, a permanent increase in public investment of about 1 percent of GDP could lead 
to roughly a 1 percent increase in the level of GDP over the medium term, though an exact number would depend on the degree of slack in 
the economy and efficiency of public investment.
7  
For the EU members and EU-pre-accession 
countries, improving public investment 
management can help make better use of 
the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. Better 
public investment management can 
facilitate better selection of proj
ects by national authorities, 
timely certification by the European Commission and orderly implementation of approved 
projects. Countries with better PIM institutions, part
icularly better appraisal capacities, have been 
indeed better able to absorb the EU Structur
al and Cohesion Funds over the 2007Œ13 ﬁprogram 
periodﬂ (Figure 2.8, panel 4). In both the EU and EU pre-accession countri
es, the authorities need                                                    
6 Spence (2008) argues that 
for fast-converging countrie
s, public investment rate should be
 about 5 percent of
 GDP or higher. 
The analysis presented in
 the May 2016 REI suggests 
that the overall investment rates ac
ross CESEE are generally low, when 
compared with the pre-crisis period, as well as when compared with various optimal benchmarks. 
 7 The October 2014 WEO estimates the effect of a permanent increase of public investment by 1 percentage point of GDP to be 
between 2.2 to 2.8 percent increase in GDP in advanced econom
ies with the magnitude depending 
on the efficiency of public 
spending and the degree of slack in the economy. The impact fo
r emerging market and developing economies is found to be 
closer to one due to lower efficiency. In this report, given the 
mix of advanced and emerging economies in the region as well a
s closing output gaps in many CESEE countries, the impact on GD
P is calculated using a multiplier of 1 for public investment.

35 Box 2.1. Improving Public Investment Management: Selected Country Experiences 1/ 
Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, and Turkey provide good
 examples of countries that have achieved public 
investment efficiency gains as a result of improving PI
M institutions. These countries™ experiences suggest that 
improving capacity in project appraisal, selection, and 
management, as well as identifying infrastructure gaps 
through better national and sectoral planni
ng can lead to more efficient outcomes.  
 Croatia 
 Outcomes: The efficiency of infrastructure investment improved notably during 2006Œ13, narrowing the 
efficiency gap from 20 to 10 percen
t (Figure 2.2, panel 4), as Croatia und
ertook efforts to upgrade airports, 
roads, and maritime transport infrastructure, pa
rtly aided by the EU pre-accession funds.   
 Institutional changes
: Several aspects of public investment ma
nagement framework were upgraded during 
this period. 
Budget unity and comprehensiveness
 was enhanced by passing th
e Fiscal Responsibility Act 
(2010), which helped better coordinate national strategi
c priorities with plans being prepared for the EU 
financing. 
Project selection and appraisal
 was improved as Croatia introd
uced a one-stop-shop model to 
streamline the multistage process 
of assessment and adoption of st
rategic projects by state-owned 
companies or the PPP projects. However, there is still
 scope for improvement on 
the timeliness of project 
approval and the harmonization of the EU and national criteria. 
 Reform drivers: Public financial management 
reforms have been key priori
ties under the EU accession 
program, these in turn have helped to improve absorption of EU Funds.  
 Lithuania 
 Outcomes: Efficiency of public spending and quality of 
institutions have been ge
nerally high in Lithuania 
even prior to its entry into
 the EU. Nonetheless since 
joining the EU in 2004, it has taken further steps to 
improve planning and impl
ementation of public 
investment projects, particularly those financed by the 
EU Funds. 
  Institutional changes
: After joining the EU, it was 
realized that the existing mechanisms for PIM were 
not sufficient and ther
e was a need to base 
investments on national 
strategic documents and 
operational plans which were
 missing at the time. To 
deal with an expanding pool of potential project 
applications to use the EU funds, a competition-based 
project selection procedure was introduced which 
meant that public entities and public service providers 
had to apply for financing on an equal basis and to 
follow the well-defined criteria and procedures. Despite 
increased administration costs, 
this had a positive impact on 
transparency 
and strengthened administrative 
capacities for 
project appraisal and selection
.   
 Reform drivers: EU accession and the goal of reaping the full benefits from the EU Funds appear to have 
acted as the key catalysts for latest phase of
 upgrading PIM institutions in Lithuania.

 CESEE REI FALL 2016

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Poland  Outcomes: The efficiency of public investment increased during 2006Œ13, along with the access, quality, and 
quantity of public capital stock, narrowing 
the efficiency gap from 30 to 20 percent.   
 Institutional changes
: Poland has implemented a range of reforms to enhance the capacity, absorption and 
impact of public investment. 
Central-local coordination
 of investment has been
 strengthened through 
introduction of territorial contractual agreements to en
sure coordination of initiatives by national and sub-
national bodies across all policy in
struments that have a territorial dime
nsion. A forum has been introduced 
for coordination of strategic planning 
for the EU-funded investments as well. 
Project Management and Transparency of Execution
 have improved as part of efforts to better absorb the EU Funds. Technical 
assistance funds have been used 
to train regions and beneficiaries 
of project funds in performance 
monitoring. An Informational System 
for Monitoring and Controlling Stru
ctural and Cohesion Funds was put 
in place in 2007 to monitor the financial and physical progress of projects co-financed by EU Funds 
throughout their implementation, which was meant to fac
ilitate the certification proc
ess for release of the EU 
Funds. Each such project was also assigned a moni
toring committee that carried out systematic progress 
assessments over the life of the project.  
Reform drivers: Overall, EU membership and aiming to achiev
e a higher absorption of the EU Funds have 
spearheaded improvements in the PIM institutions in Poland. 
Turkey 
 Outcomes: Efficiency of public investment improved 
markedly during 2006Œ13, with efficiency gap 
dropping from about 30 percent to 10 percent. The 
improvements largely reflec
ted increase in access as 
well as better quality of infrastructure. Public 
investment picked up duri
ng this period as well, 
following the authorities™ program of 
macroeconomic stabilization 
and fiscal consolidation 
in the aftermath of Turkey™s 2001 banking crisis.  
 Institutional changes
: Promoting regional 
development has been one of
 the key pillars of the 
ninth national development plan (2007Œ13). During 
these years, 
national and sectoral planning
 institutions were strengthened 
through a variety of mechanisms 
supporting sub-national entities to un
dertake an increasingly larger share of public investment. Each region 
has a regional development agency, 
whose establishment was facilitated by legislation in 2006. These 
agencies prepare regional plans for all regions under regional planning guidelines and within the broader 
national development framework. National level inst
itutions such as the Supreme Regional Development 
Council and Ministry of Development ensure regional 
and sectoral coordination among different levels of 
government. National sectoral representatives are appo
inted to regional levels and forums that bring sub-
nationals together. There are also mechanisms and 
incentives to encourage cooperation for public 
investment across sub-national authorities. 
 Reform drivers: Strengthening regional developm
ent has enjoyed both domestic 
political support as well as 
being encouraged by prospect 
of EU-accession in mid-2000s.

37 B. Improving Tax Administration Efficiency  
Although many CESEE countries have core elemen
ts of modern tax administrations, tax compliance 
gaps are still large. Reform efforts should focus on 
bringing institutional arrangements in line with 
best practices (in countries where tax collection is no
t unified in a single body or where a functional structure is lacking), upgrading information technology systems, strengthening the risk management approach to compliance and improv
ing operational performance (especially in 
countries where tax debt is high). Closing tax efficiency gaps could result in sizeable revenue gains, 
as well as broader benefits for the economy.  1. How Efficient Is Tax Collection in CESEE?
   An efficient tax system
8 can be characterized by high tax collection efficiency for a given 
cost of collection. The standard measures of tax collect
ion efficiency compare the revenue 
actually raised (for a given tax) with that which 
could be raised if it were perfectly enforced and 
levied at a uniform rate on the full tax base. In this chapter, ﬁ
tax efficiency
ﬂ is measured using tax 
collection efficiency indicators for the main taxes,
 such as the widely used C-efficiency indicator 
for the value-added tax (VAT),9 and similar indicators for the corporate income tax (CIT), and the 
personal income tax (PIT) (see Annex VI for deta
ils). Another aspect of the tax system is how 
much revenue can be raised per unit of
 resources spent on tax collection (ﬁ
cost of collectionﬂ). In the discussion that follows, both aspects are considered.
   
The relationship between tax efficiency and the cost of collection differs significantly 

across countries (Figure 2.9). In some countries (Bulgari
a) high tax efficiency is achieved at 
relatively high cost of collection, in others with lower collect
ion cost (Estonia or Lithuania).10 This is also the case for advanced European economies. Some 
comparisons follow:  
 Tax efficiency. The VAT C-efficiency indicator among CESEE countries is on average similar to 
that of advanced Europe, and the highest amon
g SEE countries, where VAT revenue is by far 
the most important source of revenueŠabou

tax revenue. However, 
CESEE countries seem to lag advanced Europe 
in terms of efficiency of direct taxes.  
 Cost of collection. The cost of tax administrations in CESEE is estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP 
(or at about 1 percent of tax revenue), only s
lightly higher than in Western Europe. Estonia, 
Lithuania, Russia, and Turkey have the lowest cost
 of collection in CESEE (0.1 percent of GDP).
                                                     
8 Efficiency here is 
not analyzed from a pure excess welf
are burden of taxation perspective 
(Auerbach 1985) but 
rather from the 
revenue collection perspect
ive, that is maximizing revenue collected at th
e lowest cost possible to the administration. 
9 Widely used for evaluating value-added tax (VAT) systems, the C-efficiency indicator compares VAT™s actual collection with 
that using the stan
dard rate on all consumption (Ebrill and other, 2001). 
10 This indicator does not capture the implied cost of compliance to taxpayers. Importantly, a low cost of collection should not 
be the result of unfunded tax administrations, eventually leading to lower tax compliance. Evidence from EU countries, however,
 suggests that VAT compliance is higher in countries where cost of tax collection is lower (Annex VI).

countries (Figure 2.9). The efficiency of tax system
s has improved substantially in Bulgaria, 
Estonia, and Russia, but to a lesser extent in ot
her CESEE countries. Efficiency improvements in 
some cases have been driven by reforms in the context of the EU accession process, as in the 

cases of Estonia and Bulgaria (see Box 2.2 for de
tails). There is also some evidence that IMF

39 While tax efficiency is a complex concept that reflects both tax policy design and tax 
compliance, it seems to be largely reflecting compliance in CESEE and policy gaps in 

advanced Europe. A tax efficiency gapŠa 
gap between actual receipts and those 

under some perfectly enforced benchmark 

tax system11Šcould arise either because of 
the policy gap, which reflects deviations of current tax rules from the benchmarkŠas a 

result of tax exemptions and reduced tax 

ratesŠor the so-called compliance gap, which refers to imperfect compliance under 

the current tax system (Keen 2013). Because 

many tax systems in CESEE were designed 
from scratch based on international best 

practices during the transition from 

socialism in the early 1990s, policy gaps 

may be smaller in CESEE than in other 

European countries with ﬁolderﬂ tax systems. 

This finding is particularly true for the VAT, 

which replaced more distortionary sales and 
trade taxes. Figure 2.10 shows the 
relationship between the VAT C-efficiency 

indicator used in this chapter and a VAT 

compliance indicator prepared by the 

European Commission for all EU countries. 12
 While among CESEE countries (red dots) 

there is a strong link between the two 

indicators, this is not the case for advanced 

Europe. This is consistent with previous 

studies that found that tax efficiency gaps in 

advanced European countries are largely 

due to policy gaps rather than low tax 
compliance. In contrast, for emerging 
economies, compliance gaps are the 

primary concern (see IMF 2010), and are 
                                                   11 This refers to a tax system without any policy or compliance gaps, that is free from exemptions, loopholes, and excessive rate 
differentiation, but also free of evasion. 
 12 While compliance gaps™ estimates for developing countries are rare, the EC provides regular estimates of the VAT 
compliance gap for the EU me
mbers (CASE 2016). The VAT compliance indicator is
 computed as [1-(VA
T Compliance GAP/100)]

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND indeed large in many CESEE countriesŠVAT comp
liance gaps in the CESEE EU countries are on 
average about 60 percent higher than in advanced Europe. 

 
Despite notably lower income levels, the overall tax efficiency in CESEE is close to 

advanced European standards, even though 
compliance gaps can be large in some cases
. This relatively high tax efficiency level could be owing to desi
gn features that reflect best international practices and limited policy gaps, as discussed previously.13 For some countries, tax 
administration reforms took place in the context of the EU accession. However, there are notable 
differences within the region. Estonia stands out as having a very high tax efficiency not only in 
absolute terms but also relative to what might be expected given its per capita income level (it is well above the fitted line in Figure 2.11). In SEE,
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, and Serbia score well relative to their expected levels of tax 
efficiency for their income levels but again here, 
their relatively high tax efficiency could be re
flecting policy design and hiding large compliance 
gaps (Figure 2.10). By contrast, tax efficiency is rather low among CIS countries, except Russia, 
and could also be higher in CEE countries
, given their per capita income levels. 
 
2. Tax Administration Reform and Tax Efficiency
  
The key features of an efficient tax administration are well established.
 A modern tax administration needs to be able to accurately identify compliance risks, and to effectively allocate 
limited resources and actions (administrative, enforcement) to address them. To achieve this, 
revenue bodies need to pay proper attention to 
basic tax administration functions, they need 
effective prioritization in addressing multiple 
compliance risks, and a strong commitment to and 
capacity for data collection and analysis. Efficien
t tax administration also requires the right 
institutional and legal approach enabling th
ese capabilities to be
 developed (IMF 2015b).
   
The choice of the methodology to assess ta
x administration efficiency in CESEE is 
determined by available information
. The Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool
14 (TADAT), developed by IMF™s Fiscal Affairs 
Department is a comprehensive standardized framework for evaluating the performance of ta
x administration systems, which provides an 
evidence-based and scored assessment of perf
ormance in all key areas. However, TADAT™s 
coverage of CESEE region is limited and data are confidential.
 Therefore, the assessment in this 
chapter is based on indicators15 compiled by the OECD reflecting key organizational and 
operational aspects of revenue administrations in 
different countries relati
ve to ﬁbest practicesﬂ (see Annex VII for details). These indicators can be grouped into six key areas (Figure 2.12):
16                                                    
13 In some countries, the relative high tax efficiency co
uld also be related to the adoption of a flat PIT rate. 
14 Detailed information on this init
iative can be found online at: 
http://www.tadat.org/. 
In addition, the IMF™s Fiscal Affairs 
Department Revenue Administration Fiscal Information Tool (RA-
FIT) is a new initiative to ga
ther and analyze core tax and 
customs administration data
 annually, and make these data availa
ble to member countries (IMF 2015b). 
15An additional limitation to our approach is that these indica
tors are largely input-based as opposed to result-based, which 
limits the link to tax administration performance. 
16 The areas used here follow closely OECD (2015). 
CESEE REI FALL 2016
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND    
41 1. Institutional Arrangements
ŠA unified body
 is responsible for the administration of both 
direct and indirect taxes, as well as the collection of social 
security contributions. It has sufficient autonomy, in particular concerning aspects of organization and planning, budget 
management, performance measurement, and in
formation technology 
(IT)/human resource 
management (Barrand and others 2004; Kidd and Crandall 2010) 
2. Organizational Structure
ŠThe revenue body possesses a 
functional structure, operating a dedicated processing centerŠfor tax returns an
d paymentsŠwith dedicated divisions for the investigation of serious fraud/evasion cases, an
d in-house debt collection functions. It also 
includes a dedicated, well-staffed unit to identify and manage key compliance risks and priorities of 
large taxpayers
 (OECD 2009; Kidd 2010). 
3. Strategic Management
ŠModern revenue administrations adopt a 
risk management approach for timely identification and 
mitigation of compliance risks. An integral 

part of this approach is a monitoring 

framework that aims to identify and prioritize 

compliance risk areas
Šsuch as, registration, filing on time, unpaid tax debts, profit shifting, 

VAT fraud (IMF 2015c; OECD 2014a). 
4. Human Resources
ŠTo operate effectively, 
revenue administrations require an adequate 

number of well-trained staff. Skills and 
capability needs are formally assessed, 

recruitment and training programs are in 

place, and a performance-based remuneration 

scheme is established to improve staff 

engagement and motivation, thereby 
contributing to staff retention
. Also the share of staff allocated to operational functions (as 

opposed to support functions) such as 

verification (including audit) 
and tax debt collection is key in achieving higher tax 
compliance (EC 2007). 
5. Operational Performance
ŠTax verification represents a major investment for tax 

administrations. As such, the contribution of the value of completed verification actions to 

revenue collection is key in assessing the effectiveness of these operations. Also given its 

significant contribution to tax revenues and 
the likely high volume of operations, VAT 
administration is crucial. Having systematic
 processes in place for granting timely 
VAT refunds to compliant taxpayers, as well as robu
st checks for detection of fraudulent

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND registrations and refund claims are critical. Finally, 
low tax debt levels can be associated with 
factors related to better operational performance, such as, extensive enforcement powers, 
use of tax withholding, well-staffed debt co
llection units, and investment in information 
technology (Harrison and Krelove 2005; OECD 2014b). 
6. IT/Online Services
ŠThe use of technology facilitates compliance with tax laws and provides 
higher service standards to taxpayers. Th
e replacement of routine manual work with automated systems has helped making the proce
sses faster and more efficient. One way of 
assessing the growing number of online services
 now being provided by revenue bodies, is 
by focusing on 
electronic filing 
which usually covers the VAT first, and is then extended to 
other taxes once IT capabilities are further developed (OECD 2013, 2014c).  
To arrive at a quantifiable framework, the indica
tors reflecting operational and organizational aspects of tax administration (described abov
e) were compiled for all CESEE and advanced 
European economies and scores were assigned to ea
ch of these indicators. The individual scores 
were subsequently aggregated into an overall 
index capturing the overall strength of tax 
administrationŠthe tax administration strength index
 (see Annex VII for details). 
Does better tax administration deliver higher tax efficiency?
 Figure 2.13 shows that there is 
indeed a strong association between the 

aggregate tax administration strength index
 and tax efficiency (shown in Figure 2.9) for the 

sample of CESEE and advanced European 

economies.
17 Furthermore, tax efficiency is also 
highly correlated with most of the indicators 

reflecting institutional strength of specific core 

areas of tax administration. In particular, 

correlations are very high for the areas of 

unified body, strategic risk management, and 

the extent and quality of online services. The 

high correlations seem to suggest that having 

a unified semi-autonomous body with a 
strategic risk management approach to 

compliance is key to ensuring higher tax 

efficiency. Also important is addressing tax 

debt in a comprehensive manner, with well-sta
ffed debt collection units. Correlations between 
electronic filing and tax efficiency are also high, suggesting that investment in technology likely 
plays an important role in supporting tax compliance and helping to make processes more cost-effective. 

                                                    
17 There is also a positive asso
ciation between VAT compliance and the tax administration strength index in the EU (Annex VI).

43 Given complementarities between different core areas of tax administration, improvement in its quality may require a comprehensive approach
. Cross-correlations between some of the 
indicators provide useful insights. For example,
 a strong commitment to and capacity for data 
analysis becomes essential both for effectively administering a larger number of taxes, and to 
support effective prioritization in addressing mu
ltiple compliance risks. Similarly, functional 
structure and the share of staff allocated to verification and debt collection are highly correlated. Possessing specialized units for large taxpayers, or debt collection can only improve efficiency if 
qualified staff is assigned to these functions. 

 
3. How to Improve Efficiency of Tax Administration in CESEE? 
 
The core operational and organizational elements of modern tax administrations are in 

place in CESEE, though some weaknesses remain. 
Aggregate scores for the main areas of tax 
administration in CESEE are relatively high (Figure 2.14). There are areas, however, where CESEE 
countries, on average, lag behind, particularly 
on investment in information technology and 
provision of online services. This reflects a more 
limited automation of processes, which results in a larger share of staff allocated to support functions (as opposed to more productive verification 
and debt collection functions). There is also some room to improve organi
zational structure and 
operational performance. There are also a numbe
r of specific weaknesses identified in IMF 
technical assistance programs that have supported 
reform modernization efforts in SEE countries.

on is above the expected level and comparable 
to advanced Europe. There are some exceptions
: given their per capita income levels tax 
administration quality could be better in some CEE countries.  
 
While there is scope for improvement in most countries, priorities vary. 
Figure 2.16 illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of each
 indicator in CESEE countries: red and green colors, respectively, represent scores that fall in 
the bottom and top quartile of the distribution of 
each score among all advanced and emerging economies in the sample, and yellow represents 

the middle two quartiles of the dist
ribution. Except in the Baltics, many countries in the region 
face significant challenges. In general, most countries face challenges with staff retention, and 
due to relatively low automation of processes, a relatively high share of staff is allocated to 
support functions. But there are many 
country-specific challenges as well:  
 
 Baltic countriesŠ
While tax administrations are already fa
irly efficientŠespecially in Estonia 
(Box 2.2)Šthere is room for improvement. Inst
itutional arrangements could be strengthened 
in Lithuania, while Latvia faces a relatively hi
gh level of tax debt which hinders operational 
performance. 
 CEE countriesŠ
Tax collection is generally not unified in
 a single body, except in Slovenia 
where all taxes and social security contributi
ons are collected by the same administration. 
Provision of online services is generally 
weak and the risk management approach to compliance could be strengthened. Also some co
untries, notably the Slovak Republic, face high levels of tax debt.18  SEE-EU countriesŠImproving the level of operational performance is particularly challenging. Croatia and Romania face high le
vels of tax debt and the value of completed verification actions is low. Bulgaria has manag
ed to improve its VAT compliance strategy with 
the establishment of a special risk management, an audit unit and IT capacity to extend e-

filing (see Box 2.2 for details). 
 SEE-non-EU countriesŠ
Except for Kosovo
19 and Macedonia, tax collection is generally not unified in a single body, and autonomy is part
icularly lacking in countries, where also a 
functional division of core activities has not 
been fully institutionalized. Provision of online 
services is generally weak (except for Kosovo and Serbia were improvements have been 

significant), hindering the full development of
 a risk management approach to compliance. 
                                                   
18 High levels of tax debt co
uld be related to limitations in the legal framework, affecting tax compliance beyond tax 
administration reform efforts. Some of the political economy constraints on reform are analyzed in Section C. 
19 The domestic tax authority in Kosovo collects both direct and indirect taxes, but two-thirds of VAT is collected by the 
customs administration. There are ongoing plans to merge the tax and customs administrations.

 4. What are the Payoffs from Improving Tax Administration?
 Tax administration reform could help impr
ove tax collection efficiency and generate 
sizable additional fiscal revenues in CESEE
. The potential revenue gain can be presented as a function of the estimated efficiency gap
20 and the tax rates prevailing in each of the countries 
(see Annex VI). Taking a measure of e
fficiency gap calculated against the 
average tax collection efficiency for each type of tax, for different income
 levels, the overall revenue gains for CESEE 
could be conservatively estimated to fall in the 
range of 0.5 percent of GDP in the BalticsŠwhere 
tax efficiency is the highestŠto 2 percent of GD
P among the CIS countries (Figure 2.17, panel 1, 
solid bars). It should be noted, however, that 
these estimates may not fully reflect the order of                                                    
20 If the efficiency gap is calculated against the 
highest tax collection efficiency
 for each type of tax, for different income levels, 
the estimated gains from closing these efficiency gains for 
CESEE countries could range from 2 to 5 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND magnitude of tax efficiency gaps in different CES
EE sub-regions, given the fact that tax rates are 
relatively low in some countriesŠparticularly
 in SEE-non-EUŠand higher in othersŠCEE and 
SEE-EU. This can be addressed by estimating the 
revenue potential at average tax rates, as shown 
by dashed bars in Figure 2.17, panel 1.  

 
By delivering additional fiscal revenues, more
 efficient tax administration could help reduce fiscal liabilities
. Indeed, countries with more efficien
t tax administration tend to have 
lower government debt (Figure 2.17, panel 2). 
 However, tax administrations reforms do not 
deliver fiscal savings overnight. This means that
 if countries aim to use potential revenue gains 
for fiscal consolidation, they need to speed up 
the adoption of reforms as it may take several 
years for tax administration reforms (once fully implemented) to translate into higher revenues.  Figure 2.17. Tax Administration Efficiency and Fiscal Outcomes 1. Potential Revenue Gain from Tax Efficiency

Besides additional revenues, tax administration reforms may have broader positive 
economic implications. Noncompliance with tax obligations
 may compromise equity because 
similar individuals or firms are subject to differe
nt levels of taxation due to differences in 
compliance or because some firms may find it easier to escape their tax obligations.
21 In addition, 
a more efficient and fair tax system may help reduce the shadow economy (see Box 2.3). This is 

relevant because negative externalities of a firm™s decision to operate in the shadow economy, 
such as the impact on governance, the legal syst
em, and infrastructure, entail significant losses to 
the economy at the macro level (Box 2.3). 
                                                   21 Crivelli and others (2016) 
find that about 1.3 percent of GD
P in tax revenue is lost due to 
profit shifting 
activities of 
multinational corporations in developing countries.

Box 2.2. Improving Tax Administration: Selected Country Experiences 1/ 
Estonia, Bulgaria, and Russia provide good examples 
of tax efficiency gains from recent tax administration 
reforms. Their experiences suggest that investment 
in information technology to support core tax 
administration activities, including risk analysis, ar
e key to improve tax compliance and reduce collection 
costs. 
Figure 2.2.1. Estonia: Tax Administration Core 
Performance Areas
             Sources: OECD; and IMF staff calculations.  
         IT = information technology. 
  Estonia  Outcomes: Tax efficiency in Es
tonia is very high: 
the VAT compliance gap is low, the PIT tax 
collection efficiency is high, and the cost of 
collecting taxes is among the lowest not only in 
CESEE but among all OECD countries.  
 Institutional changes:
 The Estonian Tax and 
Customs Board (ETCB) has developed into a full- 
service-oriented revenue body that allows 
maximum simplification in the fulfilment of tax 
liabilities, through extended use of information 
technology (e-filing now covers nearly 99 percent 
of total tax receipts). Risk analysis has been 
substantially upgraded, supported by the 
introduction of new methods for data analysis, 
and automated submission
 of routine reports. 
Improved information systems have also 
supported the administration of tax arrears, 
resulting in higher tax recovery (tax 
debt is below 5 percent of revenues).

.  Reform drivers: The Estonian tax administration overhaul star
ted with the adoption of a new tax system in 
the early 1990s. It got a new impetus in the context 
of a wider public administration reform in 1996, 
aimed at establishing an efficient and citizen-
oriented administration
 that would meet the 
demands of the EU membership. It strengthened 
further during the global financial crisis of 2008/09 
in order to secure reve
nues following a severe 
recession.  Bulgaria   Outcomes: The improvement in tax efficiency is 
mostly explained by a 
sharp reduction in the 
compliance gap (from about 35 percent to below 
the advanced European av
erage) in the past 10 
years. 
 Institutional changes:
 The Bulgarian National 
Revenue Agency (NRA) unifie
d tax, social security 
and health insurance contribution collections. It 
established functionally-based headquarters, large- 
and medium-size taxpayer offices, and a call center

to strengthening the service orientation of the NRA. 
A special Risk Management and Audi
t Unit responsible for general risk
 analysis and identification of 
special audit cases was established and a partially 
automated audit selection process was successfully 
introduced, particularly for VAT refunds. The IT capaci
ty at the central and terri
torial level was enhanced, 
and computer systems to support bu
siness processes were implemente
d, which has helped reduce tax 
frauds in excise taxes, and other tax receivables. The 
possibility of electronic filing was introduced for all 
major taxes and contributions. More 
recent measures have been laid ou
t in the ﬁSingle National Strategy 
for Improving the Tax Collection, Tackling the Sh
adow Economy and Reducing the Compliance Cost, 
2015Œ17),ﬂ including the introduction of a VAT reve
rse charge mechanism for supplies of grains and 
industrial crops. 
 Reform drivers: Bulgaria has been making concerted effort to improve the tax administration for nearly a 
decade as part of broader govern
ment-wide reforms initially directed
 at EU accession negotiations.  
 Russia 
 Outcomes: The improvement in tax efficiency is mostly expl
ained by a drastic reduction in the cost of tax 
collection. Tax collect
ion costs were reduced by almost one half
 in a five-year period, without affecting 
collection efficiency of the main taxes. 
Figure 2.2.3. Russia: E-filing (In percent) 
  Sources: OECD; and IMF staff calculations. 
 Institutional changes:
 The Russian Federal Tax 
Service (FTS) has been implementing a major 
downsizing program since 2001, which resulted in 
a drastic consolidation of 
tax officesŠreducing its 
network from more than 2,500 to fewer than 1,000 
offices todayŠand a 20 perc
ent reduction of staff. 
Automation rapidly follo
wed. Beginning in 2002, 
the FTS gradually expanded
 online services, it 
rolled out an IT platform to
 support core functions, 
enabled e-filing for federal taxes, and 
implemented a modern set of enquiry and 
payment facilities, including payment of taxes 
through self-service terminals in banks, as well as 
electronic state registration and remote access to 
registration data. The FTS stepped up the 
management of tax arrears, achieving a net 
reduction of 60 percent in tax debt during 2008Œ
13 (now at about 10 percent of tax collection). 
 Reform drivers: The FTS went through several reforms and modernization since its inception in 1990. It 
was not until the 1998 crisis, ho
wever, that remaining weaknesses 
in tax collection became evidentŠ
including low tax compliance and a very costly tax 
administrationŠproviding further impulse for reform.

49 Box 2.3. Government Effectiveness and the Shadow Economy in CESEE 1/ 
What is the shadow economy?
 The shadow economy is typically define
d as comprising all market-based legal 
production of goods and services that are deliberatel
y concealed from the authorities to avoid taxes and 
regulation (see for example, Feige (1994) and Schneider (
2005)). Because surveys tend to understate the size of 
the shadow economy, it is typically es
timated using econometric techniques.  
The informal sector is quite large in many CESEE countries
, with the estimates ranging from slightly higher 
than 14 percent of official GDP in the Slovak Republic
 to more than 50 percent in Moldova, according to 
Schneider (2015), which is the only dataset that provid
es overtime consistency and cross-country comparability 
for a large number of countries. Despite a wide margin of 
uncertainty around these estimates, the average size of 
the shadow economy in CESEE is esti
mated to be well above the averag
e size of the shadow economy in 
advanced Europe (see Figure 2.3.1). Ho
wever, the picture is different in co
mparison with other EMs that have 
similar income levels. The shadow economy is lower in
 many CESEE countries compared to their peers with 
similar income level. The CIS and some Baltic countr
ies stand out with higher level of shadow economy 
compared to peers with similar income levels. Zukauskas 
(2015) identified two import
ant factors contributing to 
the high levels of shadow economy in the Baltic countries: (1)
 certain shadow economy activities, particularly 
ﬁenvelope wages,ﬂ are considered soci
ally acceptable, and (2) despite a lo
w tax burden on income especially 
corporate income, the tax burden on labor is 
relatively high, exceeding the EU average.  
What drives CESEE firms to operate underground?
 Consistent with the literature, the relatively larger size of 
the shadow economy in CESEE compared
 to advanced Europe likely reflects
 a relatively less efficient tax 
administration and higher regula
tory burden on firms in CESEE 
compared with advanced Europe.  Most studies find that tax 
and social security burdens are the main 
root causes of the shadow economy (see 
for example, Johnson, Kaufmann, and Zoido-Lobatón (1998a, b), Giles and Tedds (2002), and Dell™Anno 
(2003) Therefore, it is not surprising that the tax admini
stration efficiency and the 
extent of disincentives to 
work created by the tax system are strongly correlated 
with the size of the shadow
 economy (Figure 2.3.1).  
 The regulatory burden on firms is another important factor identified in the literature. Johnson, Kaufmann, 
and Zoido-Lobatón (1998b) found empirical evidence 
of the influence of regulations on the shadow 
economy. They emphasized that it is
 the enforcement of regulation whic
h is the key factor for the burden 
levied on firms and individuals, which drives firms into the shadow economy. Not surprisingly, among 
advanced and emerging European ec
onomies, the shadow economy is hi
gher in countries
 with higher 
bureaucracy costs and the presence of extr
a payments and bribery (Figure 2.3.1).  
Why is the shadow economy a problem?
 The presence of the shadow econ
omy limits governments™ ability to 
collect taxes and to regulate economic relations betw
een economic agents, and it also hampers efficient 
allocation of resources. Although at the micro level, a firm
™s decision to operate inform
ally may not directly affect 
its efficiency, at the macro level, negative externalitie
s such as the impact on go
vernance, the legal system, 
infrastructure, and the tax system and rates, entail
 significant losses to th
e economy as a whole.  
– And what can be done about it?
 In all CESEE countries, the shadow 
economy has been shrinking since 2005 
(Figure 2.3.1). Particularly in Latvia, Lithuania, and Roma
nia, the decline in the shad
ow economy was the largest, 
ranging from 4 to 6 percentage points of GDP during 2
005Œ15. For example, in Latvia the authorities undertook 
comprehensive and large-scal
e efforts to reduce the size of the sh
adow economy between 2010 and 2013, while 
in Lithuania, illegal workers™ inspec
tions have doubled since 2011. The Czec
h and Slovak Republics also managed 
to reduce the shadow economy consid
erably from already low levels during the same period. In the Czech 
Republic, measures to tackle the shadow economy focused on reducing bureaucracy and making the tax 
submission process more user-friendly,
 while in the Slovak Republic, the government aimed to limit the use of 
cash in the economy and streamline th
e tax system (Goliaı 2013). Thus, improving tax administration efficiency 
and reducing regulatory burden on fi
rms in CESEE could help to further re
duce the shadow economy. This would 
in turn increase the tax ba
se, further improve economic structure and mi
tigate the negative externalities of the 
shadow economy on the formal sector.

51 C. Political Economy Aspects of Reforms 
Political institutions play a crucial role in shapi
ng economic institutions. Indeed, the strength of 
public investment management framework and 
tax administration appear to be linked to the 
quality of bureaucracy, contro
l of corruption in politics, and accountability. Furthermore,
 improvements in government effectiveness tend to
 be associated with improvements in political institutions. Therefore, taking into account political economy factors while developing reform 
strategies could increase the likelihood of their success. 

 
The strength of public investment management and tax administration appear to be linked 
to the quality of specific political institutions, 
whose relevance is well established in the 
literature (Persson and Tabellin 2000; Acemoglu
 and Robinson 2006). While some of these 
indicators may not be measured precisely, the anal
ysis presented here focuses on broad relations 
and trends rather than on assessing the strength of specific institutions in individual countries. 
Some of the main findings follow:  

 
 Political indicators tend to be more closely a
ssociated with the PIMA scores related to the implementation and allocation, and in the case of tax administration, with the scores related 
to the institutional arrangements and operational performance (Figure 2.18).22   
 Corruption in politics and quality 
of bureaucracy are strongly asso
ciated with most of PIMA and 
tax administration performance scores.
23 In the environment of excessive patronage and 
favoritism and lack of independence of the bu
reaucratic apparatus from political interference, 
the cost and likelihood of being caught in the ev
ent of a misconduct is lower, thus increasing 
incentives to engage in rent seeking. More generally, IMF (2016b) finds that corruption 
affects core government function
s, for example, by weakening the state™s capacity to tax, 
increasing the cost and reducing the efficiency of public investment. 
  Accountability appears to be relevant mostly 
for areas that require established rules and 
procedures. For example, accountability is strongly associated with scores in areas of fiscal 
rules, management of PPPs, protection of invest
ments, project selection, and transparency of 
budget execution. Higher accountability reduces rent-seeking incentives of politicians and 
encourages them to announce and pursue polic
ies that favor establishment of economic 
institutions that limit room for rent extraction.  
  Furthermore, improvements in government effectiveness tend to be associated with improvements in political institutions.
 Our analysis suggests that 
countries that experienced improvements in the tax efficiency have also recorded significant improvements in the 
                                                   
22 After controlling for the differences in income pe
r capita, the associations remain broadly similar. 
23 Corruption 
in politics main refers to incidence of excessive 
patronage, nepotism, job reservations, and ﬁfavor-
for-favors.. Quality of bureaucracy
 reflects the extent to which the bureaucratic apparatus is free from political 
interference and has an established 
mechanism for recruitment and training
. See Annex VIII for more details.

case of public investment efficiency: countries
 that improved public investment efficiency 
have also increased accountability compared wi
th those countries where public investment 
efficiency has not improved. These are the area
s that have strong correlations with PIMA and 
tax administration pe
rformances scores.

53 D. Key Takeaways and Policy Implications 
Public investment management and tax admi
nistration systems in CESEE are fairly 
efficient, but significant gaps remain. Many CESEE countries already possess the core 
elements of a modern tax administration and
 tend to have public investment management 
institutions and processes that are stronger t
han what might be expected given their income levels. However, there are large differences in e
fficiency and quality of institutions among CESEE 
countries, and compliance gaps are sizeable in some cases. 

 
There is scope for improvement in both area
s, though priorities vary across countries
:  On public investment management
, the focus should be on improving allocation and implementation frameworks and procedures. Project appraisal and management could be 
strengthened by publishing cost-benefit analyses of major projects, developing procedures 
for project adjustment, and conducting ex-pos
t evaluations. Countries with access to EU 
funds should extend the EU procedures on project appraisal to all projects. Also, open and 

transparent procurement processes should 
be extended, and in some cases, budget 
appropriation should be preserved. 
 On tax administration
, the focus should be on bringing institutional arrangements in line with 
best practices (in countries where tax collection is not unified in a single body or where a functional structure is lacking), upgrading IT
 systems, strengthening the risk management 
approach to compliance and improving operatio
nal performance. Countries should seek to 
extend automation of processes and introduce new methods for data analysis and identification of risks, which are important 
elements of a successful strategic management 
approach to tax compliance. Several countries
 need to focus on operational performanceŠ
particularly those with high tax debt. The benefits associated with efficiency im
provements go well beyond fiscal savings.
 Efficiency gains from improving public in
vestment management institutions and tax 
administration can help create fiscal space that can be used to boost public investment or reduce the still-elevated fiscal deficits. In addition, 
better public investment management raises the quality of public investments and can therefore, amplify its impact on economic growth through 
higher productivity. Also in countries with acce
ss to EU funds, improving PIM institutions has 
been associated with higher absorption of th
ese funds. Tax administration reform can help 
increase the fairness of the tax system, and reduce the size of the shadow economy. 

 
Finally, creating reform momentum requires ta
king into account political economy factors. 
Improvements in government effectiveness may be constrained by poor accountability, low 
quality of bureaucracy or by weak control of corru
ption in politics, which 
appear to be strongly 
correlated with the quality of public investment
 management institutions and tax administration. 
To overcome these constraints, the design of re
forms should include elements that help reduce 
resistance to reforms and build the suppor
t base for their successful completion.  CESEE REI FALL 2016

57 Annex IV. Measuring Public Investment Efficiency 
 The widely used methodology of Data Envelopm
ent Analysis (DEA) is used to estimate the 
efficiency of public investment. This framework 
is based on a production function approach in 
which inputs are combined to produce outputs subject to a given tec
hnology. The production function represents the technical efficiency fr
ontier and the distance between an individual 
observation and the frontier is a measure of ine
fficiency. Given a particular technology (constant, 
non-increasing or decreasing returns to scale) 
DEA method uses linear programming techniques 
to find a piecewise linear frontier comprising 
of the most efficient observations, which then 
ﬁenvelopﬂ the less efficient ones (Sutherland and others 2007).    
We follow an approach similar to IMF (2015a) to calc
ulate efficiency of public investment. In line with this approach, a 
hybrid of the following two different set 
of indicators is used to measure 
output of public investment: (1) a 
physical indicator. This indicator intends to capture the reach 
and access of public infrastructure, and combines 
pure infrastructure indicators (access to water, electricity production) and indicators of provision 
of social services (number of hospital beds and secondary school teachers). All variables except access to water are expre
ssed in per capita terms and standardized as they are expr
essed in different scales; (2) a 
survey based indicator of quality. This indicator is based on World Economic Foru
m pillar 2 subcomponents focusing on quality of 
key infrastructure services.  The output of public investment is measured as the hybrid indicator 
that combines the access and qua
lity indicators described above.  
 
The main input variable is the public capital stoc
k per capita. Estimates of public capital stock are 
taken from IMF™s Public Investment and Capita
l Dataset and are constructed using a perpetual 
inventory methodology described in IMF (2015). 
 As the inputs and their intensity are not 
necessarily homogenous among coun
tries, per capita GDP is used as the second input, following 
the practice in the literature. 

 
The efficiency scores calculated appear to be robu
st to a variety of specifications. The scores are 
calculated for 17 CESEE countries and 90 other emerging market and advanced economies, over 
2006-13. Different specifications of output variab
les are explored, including pure physical, only 
quality, and specifications including additional areas such as roads. All scores are highly 

correlated (0.6-0.9).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Annex VI. Measuring Tax Efficiency 
 The tax efficiency indicator is computed for each 
country using tax collection efficiency indicators 
(for VAT, CIT, and PIT taxes) for 20 CESEE 
countries, 15 advanced European countries, and 16 other emerging market economies. Tax collectio
n efficiency indicators compare the revenue 
actually raised (for a given tax) with that which 
would be raised if it were perfectly enforced and 
levied at a uniform rate on the full ta
x base. They take the following form: 
 
       (1) 
 Where n represents the given tax (
VAT, CIT, or PIT
); T is actual revenue collected (in euros); 
 is the uniform rate; and B is a proxy for the corresponding tax base (in Euro). For the VAT, the tax 
rate is the standard rate and the base is estima
ted using domestic consum
ption (the so-called C-efficiency indicator). For the PIT, the average tax rate on average income was used, and the base 

is estimated using data on compensation of empl
oyees from national accounts. For the CIT, the 
standard tax rate was used and the base is estimated using data on corporate profits. While 

measurement issues can arise in 
many different dimensions (Keen, 2013), one would expect that the higher the tax collection efficiency, the closer 
the indicators get to unity. Data on tax rates are taken from the IMF™s Fiscal Affairs Department 
Tax rates database, and OECD, whereas national 
accounts data are taken from IMF™s WEO database and OECD.  With this, the elements are in 

place to construct an index of tax 
efficiency which takes the form: 
 Tax Efficiency = 

     (2) 
 Assuming no measurement errors, the maximum va
lue for each of the tax collection efficiency 
indicators is one. The tax efficiency indicators fo
r each country have been rescaled to take values 
between 0-10. 
 
Tax revenue can be written as a function of tax co
llection efficiency indicators, the prevailing tax 
rates, and the tax base. When considering the three revenue sources (VAT, PIT, and CIT), tax 
revenue collection, relative 
to GDP, can be written as:   


      (3) 
 From equation (3), and assuming constant tax 
rates and constant tax base-to-GDP ratios, the 
change in tax revenue can be computed as a func
tion of the change in tax collection efficiency. 
 
Alternatively, the chapter has focused on availabl
e data for EU countries on VAT compliance gaps 
(CASE, 2016) to build a VAT compliance indicator which is computed as [1-(VAT Compliance 
GAP/100) x 10]. Figure VI.1 appe
ars to indicate that VAT compliance tends to be higher in EU 
countries with lower cost of tax co
llection. Figure VI.1 also suggests that as with the tax efficiency

positive association between the VAT compliance 
indicator and the tax administration strength index.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Annex VII. The Tax Admi
nistration Framework 
The six core areas and selected indicators to 
assess tax administration performance are taken 
from OECD (2015). In addition, information from 
IMF country desks and tax experts was used to fill the gaps.24 Following is a summary of the motivation 
for the focus on these six core areas and 
indicators. 

 
1. Institutional Arrangements. Given its complex and multi-
faceted responsibilities, a 
revenue body requires adequate powers and auton
omy to perform in an efficient manner. They 
need to ensure transparency in their operat
ions and proper accountability in the overall 
management of the tax system. Delegating tax co
llecting authority to a 
single dedicated and independent body is a vital step toward ensuring
 the autonomy and objectivity of the tax system.  
 Unified Body. It assesses the share of taxes (including social security contributions) collected by the tax administration. Through commonality of process, for example, with comprehensive 
and unified data collection, integration leads to efficiency gains, also through the elimination in duplication of core functions, resulting 
in lower collection cost. Compliance cost for employers can also be reduced, with less paperwork, and a common audit program. 
 Autonomy. 
It assesses whether the reve
nue body has the authority 
to make tax rulings, remit penalties, design internal structure, re-allocate
 budget, set service standards, influence staff recruitment, dismissal, and pay levels, independen
tly from the constraints of the civil service 
system and free of political interference.  
2. Organizational Structure. 
A functional structure in which there are special units with specific skills, offering operational economies of
 scale helps improve operational results while 
increasing transparency and accountability.  
 Functional Structure. 
It assesses whether the revenue body is organized following core functions, such as, assessment, collection, data
 processing, audit, taxpayer service, and claim investigation. Beyond this, it 
assesses whether there is segmentation to understand and meet 
the needs of special taxpayer groups (such as a large taxpayer™s unit).  
 Large Taxpayers Unit Staff. It assesses whether this dedicated unit is well staffed to deal with the special needs and risks of this group of taxpayers, which are typically a small group 
responsible for the bulk of tax revenue collected. 
3. Strategic Management. To maximize tax compliance with
 limited resources, revenue 
authorities identify major risks. The compliance 
risk management process provides a structured 
basis for strategic planning, a focus on the under
lying drivers of non-compliance, and promotion 
                                                   
24 For 44 out of 51 countries covered in this 
report, data on the several indicators ar
e available from OECD (2015). Data for the 
7 remaining countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo
, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, 
and Ukraine) was compiled from IMF country desks and tax experts.

63 of diversity in the treatment of major risk
s, and better outcomes in terms of program 
effectiveness. 
 Risk Management Approach. 
It assesses whether a formal risk management process is used, 
tax gap estimates are calculated (including
 research conducted and publicly announced 
results), random audits are conducted, coop
erative compliance model used or planned for 
large taxpayers, and whether computer-based sy
stems are used for matching income reports 
and VAT invoices. 
 Identified Compliance Risk Areas. 
It assesses whether a formal process is in place to identify and prioritize major compliance risks, such as from: (1) corporate profit shifting/transfer pricing; (2) VAT fraud; 
(3) economic activities in the hidden economy; 
(4) other tax avoidance 
schemes, and (5) unpaid tax debts. 
4. Human Resources. Adequate human resources are key to any organization. A comprehensive and flexible human resource
 management strategy supports the tax 
administration™s business strategy; has decision-m
aking abilities regarding recruitment, retention, 
performance management, promotion, career prog
ression, training and development, dismissal 
and retirement; motivates, supports, and protects employees. 
 Staff with a Degree.
 It assesses the skill level of staff to carry out the tax administration™s basic 
mandate, based on the share of staff with 
university or degree-level qualifications. 
 Staff Retention. It is defined as the inverse of staff attrition, which usually reflects an unusual 
volume of staff movements out of an organization 
resulting from a variety of factors, such as 
downsizing policies, lack of recruitment
, demographics, and staff dissatisfaction. 
 Verification and Debt Collection Function. It assesses how revenue bodies allocate their total 
staff resources across the range of tax administra
tion and support functions. Given its critical importance, the share of staff allocated to 
account management, audit and debt collection 
units provides an indication of the strength of tax administration core functions.  
5. Operational Performance. Refers to the effectiveness in
 revenue collection, including 
though verification activities and
 administration of tax arrears, and taxpayers™ services, including 
tax refunds, and dispute resolution.  VAT Refunds. 
It assesses whether revenue bodies to have systematic processes in place for granting timely refunds to compliant taxpayers,
 as well as robust compliance checks for the 
detection of fraudulent refund claims. Excess ta
x payments represent a cost to taxpayers, particularly critical to businesses operating with
 tight margins where cash flow is paramount.   Value of Completed Actions.  It assesses the share of revenue collected through verification 
and audit functions, which represent a 
major investment for revenue bodies. 
CESEE REI FALL 2016 
64    
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND  Low Tax Debt. Tax debt (or arrears) is an indicator 
of broad deficiencies, including lack of enforcement powers. Extensive use of tax withho
lding and various legislative initiatives (for 
example, powers to collect taxes from third pa
rties, obtain liens over assets, require tax 
clearance for the granting of government contracts, etc.) can improve the level of debt 

collection. 6. IT/Online Services. 
Electronic filing initiatives, make it 
easier for taxpayers to file returns, reduce the revenue bodies™ proce
ssing costs, and expedite refunds to taxpayers. The share of e-
filing is used as indicator for the level of inve
stment in information technology. E-filing (and online services more generally) can help reduce taxpayers™ information requirements, it facilitates 
and reduces the cost of tax payments, it facilit
ates the sharing of information and guidance to 
taxpayers, it reduces the volume of routine pr
ocesses (through automatic verification and pre-
filing of tax returns, etc.
 To arrive at a quantifiable framework, data for 
the different indicators of tax administration performance were compiled and scores were assigned to each of the indicators in a scale from 0-
10. Scores for each performance areas (and total) take averages of the respective indicators.
