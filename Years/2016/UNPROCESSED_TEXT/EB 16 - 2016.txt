Global activity 
has improved in the second half of this year and is expected 
to 
continue strengthening, although remaining below its pre
-crisis pace
. 
Global inflation 
is still dampened by the effects of past oil price declines and
 the abundant global 
spare capacity is expected to weigh on
 underlying inflation over the medium term.
 



























































































































































































































































































































































































Since the Governing Council monetary policy meeting in September, euro area 
sovereign 
yields have risen and the EONIA forward curve has steepened. The 
incr
ease in nominal yields has taken place mainly on account of higher inflation 
expectation
s. Corporate bond spreads increased slightly
, but remain
ed lower than in 
early March 2016, when the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) 
was 
announced. 
Broad equity prices rose marginally in the euro area, while
 bank equity 
prices 
outperformed
 the broad index
. 






























































































































































































































































































































The ongoing economic expansion continues to be moderate, but is firming. The 
pass
-through of the ECB
™s 
monetary policy measures to the real economy is 
supporting domestic demand and is facilitating deleveraging. Improvements in 
corporate profitability
 and very favourable credit conditions continue to promote 
a recovery in 
investment.
 Sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from 
past structural reforms
, and still relatively low oil prices
 should
 provide additional 
support for households™ real disposable income and private consumption.
 The 
December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee euro area real 

GDP growing by 1.7% in 2016 and 2017 and by 1.6% in 2018 and 2019.
 The risks 
surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside.
 



































































































































































































































































































































































































































































According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in November 
2016 was 0.6%, up from the recent low of 
-0.2% in April. Meanwhile, underlying price 
dynamics continue to show 
no clear signs of an upward trend. Looking ahead
, inflation rates are likely to pick up further at the turn of the year
 to above 1%
 owing
, to a large extent, to base effects in the annual rate of
 change in energy prices. 
Supported by the ECB™s monetary policy measures and the expected economic 
recovery, inflation rates should increase further in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This pattern 
is also reflected in the December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic
 projections 
for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 

2017, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019
 





































































































































































































































































































































































Broad money growth remained stable in the third quarter of
 2016 but declined
 somewhat
 in October
. 
At the same time, loan growth to the private sector increased 
in October. Low interest 
rates and
 the effects of the ECB™s 
non-standard monetary 
policy measures
 continue to support
 money and credit dynamics. The annual flow of 
total external financing to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have 
continued to strengthen in the third quarter of 2016
. 





























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Over the period 2016
-19, the 
general 
government budget deficit and debt ratios 
for 
the euro area 
are
 both projected to
 remain
 on a downward path
. 
The euro area fiscal 
stance is expected to be expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017
-19. 
Debt reduction 
will 
mainly
be supported by 
a 
favourable interest
 rate growth 
differential in 
the light 
of better cyclical conditions
 and low interest rates.
 Some 
countries have fiscal space, which could be used to
 support 
growth. In the case of 

high
-debt countries,
 additional consolidation efforts in line with the requirements of 
the Stability and Growth Pa
ct (SGP) are
 needed to set their public debt ratio
s firmly 
on a downward path.

Fluctuations in uncertainty can play an important role in shaping the economic 
conjuncture and outlook.
 This article discusses the various methods proposed in the 
literature to measure uncertainty and shows how these measures have evolved in 

the euro area. It describes the transmission channels of fluctuations in uncertainty to 

the economy and provides some model
-based evidence for the impact of uncertainty 
on euro area activity. The results suggest that uncertainty in the euro area rose 

substantially during the Great Recession and during the sovereign debt crisis, and 

that high uncertainty could significantly dampen activity in the euro area, and notably 

investment.

At the Pittsburgh summit in 2009, G20 leaders pledged to reform over
-the
-counter 
derivatives markets to improve their
 transparency, prevent market abuse and reduce 
systemic risks. Focusing on Europe, this article recalls the objectives of the 
Pittsburgh reforms, reviews the progress made since their adoption, in particular with 
regard to trade reporting and central clearing, and identifies remaining gaps and 

issues for policymakers. The latter relate mainly to
: (i) the resilience, recovery and 
resolution of central counterparties, given their growing systemic importance as a 
result of the reforms;
 (ii)
 the need to strengt
hen the stability of derivatives markets;
 and (iii) the still insufficient data quality and transparency of OTC derivative 

transactions, despite the considerable progress already made.
