developments
 Summary
 The financial market turbulence 
of early 2016 
has 
subsided and global economic 
activity is showing signs of stabilisation. World trade 
has been resilient
 at the start of 
the year, although it
s growth rate
 is expected to remain moderate. 
Risks to the 
outlook for global activity, most prominently for 
emergi
ng market economie
s, remain 
on the downside
 and relate
 in 
particular to policy uncertainty, financial turbulence 
and geopolitical risks.
 Global headline inflation has remained at low levels as past 
energy price declines continue to weigh on price
 increases
.  Euro area sovereign bond yields have declined along with their counterparts in the 
United States. Corporate bond spreads have tightened substantially amid a 
stabilisation in market volatility and following the announcement of the 
ECB
™s corporate sector 
purchase programme. Reduced volatility has provided further 
support for global equity prices, while the effective exchange rate of the euro has 
appreciated.
 The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing, driven by domestic demand
, while
 foreign dema
nd growth remains weak
. 
Domestic demand
 continues to be 
supported by monetary policy measures. Their favourable impact on financing 

conditions, together with improvements in corporate profitability, is benefiting 

investment. Moreover, the accommodative mon
etary policy stance, continued 
employment gains resulting from past structural reforms and the still relatively low 

price of oil should provide ongoing support for households™ real disposable income 

and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance i
n the euro area is slightly 
expansionary. At the same time, the economic recovery in the euro area is still 

dampened by the ongoing balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors, the 

insufficient pace of implementation of structural reforms 
in some coun
tries 
and subdued growth prospects in emerging markets. The risks to the euro area growth 
outlook remain tilted to the downside. 
 Euro area headline inflation 
has remained at levels around zero in recent months
. 
The low level of inflation continues to refl
ect mainly the impact of strongly negative 
annual rates of change in energy prices. 
At the same time, m
ost measures of 
underlying inflation do not show 
a clear upward trend. Domestic price pressures 
remain subdued. Market
-based measures of long
-term inflat
ion expectations have 
stabilised at low levels and remain substantially below 
readings from 
survey
-based 
expectation measures. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for 
energy, inflation rates are likely to 
be negative in the coming months 
before picking 
up during the second half of 2016
, owing in large part to base effects
. Thereafter, 
inflation rates are expected
 to recover further
 in 2017 and 2018
, supported by the 
ECB
™s monetary policy measures and the economic recovery.

Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 4 Following 
the
 comprehen
sive package of monetary policy measures adopted in
 early 
March, broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved. The pass
-through 
of the monetary policy stimulus to firms and households, notably through the banking 

system, is strengthe
ning. 
Money growth has remained solid, while loan growth is 

continuing its gradual recovery. Domestic sources of money creation are still the 
main driver of broad money growth. Low interest rates
, the targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations and the exp
anded asset purchase programme are supporting 
improvements in money and credit dynamics. Banks™ funding costs have declined 
further, with banks passing on their more favourable funding conditions 
to 
lower 
lending rates. 
Overall, the monetary policy measure
s in place since June 2014 have 
clearly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as well as credit 

flows across the euro area. The monetary policy measures adopted in March
 2016 underpin the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby supporting 
the recovery of the 
real economy.
 At 
its meeting on 21 
April
 2016,
 based on 
the
 regular economic and monetary 
analyses, 
the Governing Council
 decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged. 
The Governing Council
 continue
s to expect 
the
 key ECB 
interest rates
 to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the 
horizon of 
the
 net asset purchases. Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy 
measures, as decided on 10
 March 2016, 
the ECB
 has started to expand 
the
 monthl
y purchases under the asset purchase programme to •80 billion, from the 
previous amount of •60 billion. As stated before, these purchases are intended to 
run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the 
Governing Council 
sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent 
with its inflation aim. Moreover, in June 
the ECB
 will conduct the first operation of 
the
 new series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II) and will 
commence purchases under
 the
 corporate sector purchase programme. 
 Looking 
ahead, it is essential to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary 
accommodation as long as needed in order to underpin the momentum of the euro 
area™s economic recovery and in order to accelerate the re
turn of inflation to levels 

below, but close to, 2%. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely the 
evolution of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, 
will act by using all the instruments available within 
its mandate. In the current 
context, it is crucial to ensure that the very low inflation environment does not 

become entrenched in second
-round effects on wage and price setting.

 5 1 External environment
 Recent survey
-based indicators
 suggest
 that 
global eco
nomic 
activity 
stabilised
 during
 the first quarter of 
2016. The turbulence in f
inancial markets
 observed at the beginning of the year 
has 
now 
subsided
, as 
heightened concerns
 about 
the global economy have 
gradually 
diminished. 
Indeed, s
tock markets have 
recovered all 
of 
the losses 
suffered 
since the start of the year, volatility has 
declined
 and commodity prices have also rebounded somewhat. 
This
 has helped to ease 
financial conditions in many 
emerging market economies (
EMEs
), 
which
 have
 seen 
capital flows return amid
 an improved global 
appetite for 
risk.
 The global composite output P
urchasing 
Managers' 
Index
 (PMI) 
increased slightly in March relative to 
February, pointing to some improvement in global 
activity.
 This followed 
a number of 
rather weak 
readings 
during
 the previous months
 (see Chart 1) and 
reflects a modest pick
-up in activity 
in both 
the 
services 
and manufacturing sectors
. 
However, i
n quarterly terms 
the global output PMI 
for 
the first quarter 
of 2016 was 
still lower than that of
 the
 previous
 quarter, 
remaining 
below its 
long
-term average. 
This decline
 was 
largely 
due to
 developments in advanced economies, 
particularly in the
 United States
, while the composite 
output PMI improved somewhat among
 EMEs.
 Overall, 
the PMI 
data
 suggest some deceleration 
in growth 
among 
advanced 
economies
 and continued modest 
growth in 
EMEs
 in 
the first quarter of 
2016. Global trade 
has 
show
n resilience
. 
Global 
merchandise trade 
sustained its
 momentum in January, 
following a strong upward revision to
 the
 December data. In January the volume of 
wor
ld imports of goods grew by 1.2% in 
three
-month on three
-month
 terms, 
following 
growth of 
1.5% in December. Th
is upward revision was driven by more positive data 
for emerging Asia. In January 
the 
momentum in world imports remained resilient, 
supported by c
ontinued strong growth in emerging Asia and the euro area. By 
contrast, 
there was a further decline in 
trade in the 
United States
 and trade growth 
turned negative in central and 
eastern Europe. The global PMI for new export orders 
increased marginally from
 49.4 to 49.6 in March, but still point
ed to weak 
growth in 
global trade
.  Global headline inflation remained at low levels
. Annual 
consumer price index 
(CPI) inflation 
in the OECD area declined in February
, to 1.0% from 1.2% the 
previous month, 
owing
 to a more negative contribution from energy prices (
see 
Chart
 2). Excluding food and energy, OECD annual 
CPI 
inflation remained 
unchanged at 1.9% in February.

 6 Brent crude oil prices have continued to recover 
since mid
-March, reflecting a moderation in the 
global oil
 supply overhang 
and
 higher
 than 
expected 
global demand for
 oil
. Brent crude oil prices 
have traded in the range 
of USD 
38-47 per barrel since 
mid
-March 2016, trading at USD 4
7 per barrel on 
28 April. This equates to a 
67% increase compared 
with
 the 12
-yea
r lows 
recorded
 in mid
-January. The recent 
increase in the oil price was underpinned by a 

moderation in the global oil supply overhang. In 

particular, OPEC output decreased in March 2016, 
mainly on account of supply disruptions in Iraq, Nigeria 
and the Uni
ted Arab Emirates
. In addition, oil demand 
was higher than expected in 
the first quarter of
 2016, 
large
ly 
because of
 strong demand in India and other 
non-OECD Asian countries. Oil price volatility has 
decreased 
slightly
 since mid
-March, but remains high. 
A number of factors have contributed to the current 
volatility, including geopolitical tensions, 
issues
 surrounding
 the 
return of 
Iran to the global oil market, uncertainty 
surrounding
 the 
economic outlook for EMEs and 
doubts about 
a deal between OPEC and leading 
non-OPEC producers to freeze output. The prices of non
-oil commodities such as 
food and metals have remained stable in the period since mid
-March. Looking 
ahead, the volatile geopolitical situation in the Middle East (notabl
y Iraq) and in 
Nigeria 
continues to represent
 a short
-term risk, potentially leading to further supply
-side disruptions
. The 
soft patch 
in US activity 
appears to have 
continued into
 the first quarter
 of 
2016, although underlying fundamentals remain healthy
. Following a moderate 
expansion of real GDP by an annualised rate of 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015, 

economic activity showed signs of further deceleration in the first quarter of 
2016. In 
particular, high
-frequency indicators for business equipment s
pending 
suggested 
only
 modest growth in business investment. While real consumption growth 
remained moderate in February, recent manufacturing data indicate improving 
conditions in the sector. Non
-farm payrolls rose strongly in March and the labour 
force p
articipation rate increased further, suggesting that previously discouraged 
workers are returning to the labour market. This 
resulted in
 only 
a small uptick in the 
unemployment rate
, 
to 5.0%. Looking forward, the strengthening of the labour 
market is expec
ted to support real income and consumption.
 Headline inflation 
remain
ed low. Annual headline CPI inflation 
decreased slightly
 in March 
to 0.9%
, from 1.0% in February, weighed down by energy and food prices. Excluding food 

and energy, annual 
CPI 
inflation d
eclined to 2.2% in March, restrained by negative 
goods price inflation, but has been on a gradual upward trend since mid
-2015. In Japan, 
the growth 
momentum remains subdued
. Economic indicators at the 
start of 2016 continue to point to sluggish economic ac
tivity, following a 
quarter
-on-quarter 
decline 
in real GDP 
of 0.3% in the last quarter of 2015. Recent surveys 
indicate
 that 
private consumption
 was weak at the start of the year

 7 production also remain
ed subdued, although 
this was largely
 due t
o one
-off factors, 
while
 real exports staged a mild recovery. At the same time, survey indicators 
signal
led
 some deterioration in business sentiment. Annual CPI inflation picked up 
from 0% in January to 0.3% in February, while annual CPI inflation excludin
g food 
and energy rose slightly
, to 0.8%
. In the United Kingdom, GDP growth 
is
 expected to moderate
. 
In the fourth 
quarter of 2015 real GDP increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter, more than 
previously estimated and 
at a more rapid pace
 with respect to
 the previous quarter. 
As a result, annual GDP growth 
was
 2.3% in 2015
, compared with
 2.9% in 2014. In 
the last quarter of 2015 economic growth was driven by solid private consumption, 

while
 investment growth turned sharply negative on the back of uncertai
nty regarding 
the pace of global demand and net exports continued to exert a drag on growth. 
Short
-term indicators and surveys of business intentions suggest a moderate 
slowdown
 in the pace of GDP growth in the first 
half
 of 2016. The unemployment 
rate sta
bilised at 5.1% in the three months to January 2016, while earnings growth 

remained relatively subdued at 2.1%, 
despite
 improvements in 
labour market 
conditions. In February 2016 annual headline CPI inflation edged up to 0.3% owing 
to base effects stemming
 from energy prices, while inflation excluding food, energy
, alcoholic beverages and tobacco declined marginally to 1.1%
. In China, 
available 
data remain consistent with a gradual slowdown in activity 
growth,
 which has been
 underpinned by policy support an
d rapid credit 
expansion
. 
In the first quarter China recorded 
GDP growth
 of 6.7% year
 on year, 
which was 
marginally below that recorded in the previous quarter 
but in line with the 
new growth target range 
set 
by Chinese authorities for 2016 (6.5
-7.0
%). 
The
 latest 
short
-term indicators point to 
sustained 
economic momentum, with industrial 
production, fixed
-asset investment, credit growth and retail sales showing some 
improvement
s. There are also signs of stabilisation in the housing market, with a 
modest reb
ound in residential investment and 
strong increases in 
house prices in the 
large cities. 
Conversely
, trade data, which have shown a high 
degree of 
volatility in 
recent months, weakened in the first quarter of the year. Greater stability in financial 
market
s and the Renminbi exchange rate ha
s helped to alleviate some of the 
uncertainty which 
prevailed 
at the start of the year, while monetary accommodation 
and modest fiscal stimulus 
are
 expected to continue supporting demand
.  Growth momentum remains weak and
 heterogeneous across other EMEs
. Activity has remained resilient in commodity
-importing countries such as non
-euro 
area central and eastern European countries and, to a lesser extent
, India and 
Turkey, while growth continues to be very weak in commodity
-exporting countries. In 
particular, latest short
-term indicators suggest that the downturn in Brazil will 
continue
 into
 2016. Political uncertainty, deteriorating terms of trade and tightening 

financing conditions are weighing heavily on economic activity. 
In line with 
expectations, 
economic activity 
in Russia 
declined again in the last quarter of 
2015, following tentative signs of improvement in the third quarter of 
last year
. Uncertainty 
remains high and business confidence weak, while lower oil revenues continue to 
restrain 
public expenditure

 8 2 Financial developments
 Between 9 March and 20 April 2016 euro area sovereign yields declined along 
with their US counterparts.
 Follow
ing a slight pick
-up in early March, euro area 
government bond yields started to decrease shortly after the March meeting of the 
Governing Council, in line with similar developments in US yields. After reaching a 
new all
-time low of 0.75% on 1 April 2016, 
the GDP
-weighted ten
-year euro area 
sovereign bond yield rebounded somewhat towards the end of the review period, to 
stand at 0.86% on 20 April. Overall, the declines in long
-term yields were slightly 
more pronounced in higher
-rated euro area countries.
 In
 corporate bond markets, risk premia for non
-financial corporations (NFCs) 
declined substantially amid a stabilisation in market volatility and following the 

Governing Council™s announcement of a corporate sector purchase 
programme (CSPP).
 Spreads on NFC b
onds 
Œ like those on financial company 
bonds 
Œ declined in the second half of March after market volatility came down from 
its earlier peaks. Following the announcement of the CSPP, NFC bond spreads 

recorded a further considerable decrease, before continui
ng to decline more 
gradually in the course of April (see Chart 3).
 The stabilisation in volatility also provided support for global equity prices, 
which gained over the review period.
 The broad EURO STOXX index increased 
by more than 4% between 9 March and
 20 April 2016 (see Chart 4). In the United 
States, the S&P 500 index gained almost 6% over the same period. The prices of 
bank stocks were subject to somewhat more pronounced swings than the overall 
market in both jurisdictions and, in the euro area, also
 slightly underperformed the 
market, with an increase of about 2%.

 9 The effective exchange rate of the euro appreciated.
 In bilateral terms, the euro 
strengthened by 3.
7% agains
t the US dollar 
over the review period 
amid narrowing 
long
-term bond yield spreads between the United States and the euro area, largely 
reflecting 
revised 
market expectations concerning the future 
path
 of 
US policy rates. 
The euro also appreciated against the pound sterling, the Chinese renminbi
, 
the 
Japanese yen
 and the currencies of most emerging market economies. 
It 
depreciated against the Russian rouble, the Swedish krona, the Swiss franc and the 
currenci
es of
 most commodity
-exporting countries
, as well as the currencies of
 several central and eastern European countries.
 The 
euro overnight index average (EONIA)
 declined over the review period, 
reflecting the Governing Council™s decision to cut the deposit 
facility rate by 
10 basis points
 to 
-0.40% in March.
 Since the rate cut took effect at the start of the 
second 
reserve 
maintenance period, the EONIA has remained in a range 

between 
-33 and 
-35 basis points
, except at
 the
 end of the first quarter
, when it 
temporarily rose to 
-30 basis points. Excess liquidity increased by
 around
 •43 billion 
to •7
44 billion amid
 ongoing Eurosystem purchases 
under 
the expanded asset 
purchase programme.
 3 Economic activity
 The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing, 
dri
ven largely by 
developments in 
private consumption
, but more recently also by investment
 (see Chart 5). 
Although 
output has 
been rising
 since the beginning of 2013
, euro 
area real GDP 
still only remains close to its
 pre
-crisis peak in the first quarter of 
2008.  Private consumption 
continues to contribute 
positively to grow
th, following a temporary 
slowdown in the final quarter of 2015
. 
The 
slowdown in consumer spending in the fourth 
quarter of last year reflected in part lower sales 
of seasonal clothing and a decline in energy 
consumption, developments that can be 
attribute
d to the mild winter weather in parts of 
the euro area. Moreover, the terrorist attacks in 

Paris in November 2015 appear to have 
adversely affected consumption of services such 
as hotels and restaurants in France. More 

fundamentally, consumer spending has 
been benefiting from rising real disposable income 

among households, which in turn primarily 

reflects rising employment and lower oil prices. 
In addition, households™ balance sheets have 
become less constrained
, and consumer 

confidence remains elevated and
, 
despite recent 
declines
, 
above its long
-term average

Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 10 The accommodative monetary policy and the associated low interest rates 
should continue to support aggregate euro area consumption
. Since the third 
quarter of 2008, euro area households
' interest paym
ents relative to disposable 
income have 
decreased
 by about three percentage point
s, wh
ile interest earnings fell 
by roughly the same amount (see Chart 
6). 
Thus, 
aggregate euro area household 
disposable income has been hardly affected. However, lower intere
st rates typically 
redistribute resources from net savers with a low
er marginal propensity to consume 
to net borrowers with a high
er marginal propensity to consume, creating an overall 
positive impact on aggregate consumption in the euro area. As for the n
ear-term 
outlook, recent data on retail trade and new passenger car registrations signal a 
pick
-up in consumption growth in the first quarter of this year.
 Following an acceleration in investment growth at 
the 
end of 
2015, investment 
conditions have 
continued to improve 
somewhat 
in early 2016
, 
though downside risks 
prevail
. R
ising capacity 
utilisation and a 
combined 
increase in industrial 
production of capital goods in January 
and February 
suggest that euro area business investment is likely to 

have grown at a robust pace in 
the first quarter of 2016
. 
However, a weak
 external environment
, 
combined with 
weaker business confidence, fewer industrial orders of 

capital goods and subdued production expectations in 
the capital goods sector, will most likely weigh on the 

growth rate of non
-construction investment
 in the first
 half of 2016
. 
Construction investment is likely to have 

continued to grow in 
the first quarter,
 linked mainly to 
developments in the housing segment
, as evidenced by 
a strong rise in b
uilding production 
compared to the 
previous quarter
. 
Seeing through the
 usual 
volatility, 
building permits as well as construction confidence
, as 
measured by the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) and the Economic Sentiment 

Indicator (ESI), 
have been increasing, suggesting a bottoming
-out of the construction 
sector business cyc
le. Beyond the short
-term, recovering demand, accommodative monetary policy 
and improving financing conditions
 should boost investment
. Improving profit 
margins and diminishing spare capacity
 should also support investment decisions.
 However, investment ma
y be held back by deleveraging needs, low profit levels and 
institutional rigidities, particularly in some countries, as well as subdued potential 
growth prospects.
 Growth in e
uro area export
s continues to 
remain subdued overall
. According to 
monthly trade
 data
, 
goods exports
, after
 having 
declined significantly in January
, partially 
recovered 
in February
. G
oods exports in the first two months of the year
 stood below their 
average level in the 
fourth
 quarter of 2015. Export growth
 has 
probably
 been held bac
k by 
weak
 growth momentum in
 advanced economies, 
notably the United States, and in some emerging
 market 
economies
. Looking ahead,

s 11 the appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro since the end of last year 
is expected to continue to weigh on 
euro area exports.
 More timely indicators
, such 
as surveys
, signal 
continued subdued developments
 in foreign demand and 
relatively weak
 export orders outside the euro area in the near term. 
 The latest 
economic 
indicators are
 consistent with
 continued
 real
 GDP growth
 in the 
first 
quarter of 
2016. 
Industrial production (excluding construction)
 stood 
on average in January and February 1
.1% above its average level in
 the fourth quarter 
of 2015, when it rose by 0.
4%, quarter on quarter
. More timely survey data 
paint a 
somewhat less optimistic picture than hard data. While the ESI declined throughout 
the first quarter, the composite output PMI declined in January and February before 
remaining broadly stable in March (see Chart 
5). Developments in survey data
, however
, are currently more complex to interpret than normal
, as their slowdown 
point
s to weaker growth vis
-à-vis the fourth quarter of last year, wh
ereas
 their levels, 
which still remain above the long
-term averages, point to unchanged or even slightly 
accel
erating growth
. Euro area 
labour 
markets continue 
to 
improve 
gradually
. Employment increased 
further by 0.3%
, quarter on quarter
, in the 
fourth 
quarter of 2015
, having now risen 
for two and a half years
. As a result, employment stood 
1.2
% above the level 
recorded one year earlier
, the highest annual rise observed since the second quarter 
of 2008
. The unemployment rate for the euro area
, which
 started to decline in mid
-2013, 
fell further in 
February to stand at 10.3%. Although m
ore timely survey 
data
 point to 
some deceleration in employment growth, they are still consistent with 
further employment gains 
in the period ahead.
 Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to proceed
. Domestic 
demand, in particular, continues to be supported by the 
ECB
's 
monetary policy 
measures. Their favourable impact on financing conditions, together with 
improvements in corporate profitability, is benefiting investment. Moreover, the 
accommodative monetary policy stance, continued employment gains resulting from 
past structural reforms and the still relatively low price of oil should provide ongoing 
support for households™ real disposable income and private consumption. In addition, 
the fiscal stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. At the same time, the 
economic recovery in the euro area is still dampened by the ongoing balance sheet 
adjustments in a number of sectors, the insufficient pace of implementation of 

structural reforms and subdued growth prospects in emerging markets.
 The risks to 
the euro area g
rowth outlook still remain tilted to the downside. 
The results of the 
latest round of the ECB™s Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted in early 

April
, 
indicate a similar picture as the ECB staff projections published in March, of an 
ongoing economic
 recovery, with rising annual GDP growth rates 
(http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/index.en.html
). 4 Prices and costs

The

 12 annual rates of change in energy prices. At the same time, HICP inflation excluding 
food and energy continues to hover at r
ates around 1.0%
 (see Chart 7
). Most m
easures of underlying inflation do not show 
any clear upward trend.
 The annual rate of HICP
 inflation
 excluding food and energy continues to lie at or 
somewhat below 1
.0
%. This suggests that underlying 
inflation has not gathered upward momentum
 since last 
summer, 
as corroborated by the evidence from model
-based measures
1. Looking at the main components, 
services
 price
 inflation increased to 1.4% in March, up 
0.5 percentage point from a historical low of 0.9% in 
February. This acceleration partially reflect
s a temporary 
rebound in package holiday prices 
for the 
Easter 
period, which this year 
occurr
ed in March
 (see 
also 
the box entitled ﬁHarmonised index of consumer 
prices 
- Easter effects and improved seasonal 
adjustmentﬂ). 
Non
-energy industrial goods 
price 
inflation
 has been within the range of 0.5% to 0.7% in 
recent months.
 The recent ap
preciation of the euro has mitig
ated
 some of the upward price pressure stemming from 

its
 earlier strong depreciation.
 Import price inflation 
for non
-food consumer goods, which has 
thus
 far been the main source of upward 
pipeline pressures, decreased to 0.7% in February, from 1.6% in Janu
ary. This is a 

continuation of the decline from the record high of 5.6% in April 2015, 
and reflect
s some appreciation 
in the 
effective
 exchange rate
 of the euro
 as well as
 the impact of 
global disinflationary pressures stemming from lower oil prices.
  Prod
ucer price and wage
 pressures 
have 
remained subdued.
 Annual producer 
price inflation for domestic sales of non
-food consumer goods declined to 
-0.1% in 
February from 
+0.1% in January
, and
 survey data for input and output prices up 
until 
April point to a co
ntinuation of subdued price pressures at the producer level. 
Wage growth stabilised 
at 
low level
s. A
nnual growth in compensation per employee 
stood 
at 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015, unchanged from
 the
 previous
 quarter of 
that 
year
. Given that the rate
 of annual productivity growth declined by 0.2 percentage 
point over the same period, 
unit labour costs
 therefore
 increased by 0.2 percentage 
point.
 Factors 
which may be 
weighing on wage growth 
are described in the box 
entitled ﬁRecent wage trends in the e
uro areaﬂ.

Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 13 Market
-based measures of long
-term inflation 
expectations have stabilised at low levels and 
remain substantially below survey
-based measures
 of expectations
. After recovering f
rom an all
-time low 
in February, the five
-year forward 
inflation 
rate five 
years ahead continues to stand at very low levels. This 
in 
part reflects a 
relatively weak 
appetite 
in the market 
for holding financial instruments with inflation
-linked 
cash
 flows,
 indicating that market participants consider 
it relatively
 unlikely that inflation will pick
 up soon. In 
contrast to market
-based measures, survey
-based 
measures of long
-term inflation expectations, such as 
those included in the ECB Survey of Professional
 Forecasters (SPF) and in Consensus Economics 
surveys, have been more stable and resilient to the 
downward adjustment of shorter
-term expectations 
(see 
Chart 8
). According to 
the April 2016 
SPF 
results
, the 
average point forecast for inflation five years a
head was 
1.8%, unchanged from the previous 
survey, 
and the 
downside risk to this mean expectation appears to have 
decreased 
somewhat
. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for energy, inflation rates 

are likely to be negative in the coming 
months before picking up during the 
second half of 2016, in large part owing to base effects. 
Thereafter, inflation 
rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018, supported by the ECB's monetary 
policy measures and the expected economic recovery.
 Tur
ning t
o house price developments,
 annual growth in the ECB™s residential 
property price indicator 
for the euro area has 
continue
d to increase.
 In the 
fourth quarter of 2015, the annual rate of change in 
residential property 
prices was 
2.2%
, 
up from 1.5% in the t
hird quarter and 1.1% in the second quarter
 of that year
. 
The ongoing recovery in 
residential property price
 dynamics 
is relatively broad
ly 
based across 
the euro area 
countries
. 5 Money and credit
 Broad money growth remained 
robust
. The annual growth rate of M3 
stayed at 
around
 5.0%, the level maintained since March 2015
 (see Chart 
9). Money growth 
was once again 
supported by 
the most liquid components
. T
he annual growth rate of 
M1 continued to moderate from the peak reached in July 
2015, but was still 
at 
a high 
level. Overall, recent developments in narrow money 
remain 
consistent with a 
continuation of the economic recovery in the euro area.

Œ Update on economic and monetary developments
 14 Overnight deposits continued to 
provide 
considerable support
 to 
M3 growth
. The main factors 
behind this growth were the low opportunity costs of 
holding the most liquid 
components of money and the 
impact of the ECB™s expanded asset purchase 
programme (APP). By contrast, short
-term deposits 
other than overnight deposits
 contract
ed further
, 
though
 to a lesser extent than in previous months. 
The growth 
rate of marketable ins
truments (i.e. M3 minus M2), a 
small component of M3, was negative 
at the beginning 
of 2016
, despite the recovery in money market fund 
shares/units observed since mid
-2014. Broad money growth was again mainly driven by 
domestic sources of money creation. 
The ECB™s 
non-standard monetary policy measures
 partly account 
for this development
. 
From a counterpart perspective, 
the largest source
s of money creation in 
February
 were
 the bond purchases made by the Eurosystem in the 
context of the public sector purcha
se programme 
(PSPP)
 and shifts away from longer
-term financial liabilities. A 
large proportion 
of 
those 
instruments
 were purchased from 
monetary financial institutions (
MFIs
) (excluding the Eurosystem). The annual rate of change of MFIs™ longer
-term financ
ial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) remained strongly negative. This reflects 
the flatness of the yield curve, linked to the ECB's non
-standard monetary policy 
measures, which has 
made it less favourable
 for investors to hold longer
-term bank 
liabilities
. The attractiveness of the 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations
 as an 
alternative to longer
-term market
-based bank funding is a further explanatory factor.
 Furthermore
, money creation continued to be supported by credit from MFIs to the 
euro area private sector. 
The MFI sector's net external asset position was 
still 
weighing 
on annual M3 growth
, with this 
reflect
ing
 capital outflows from the euro 
area and ongoing portfolio rebalancing in favour of non
-euro area instruments (more 
specifica
lly, the euro area government bonds sold by non
-residents under the PSPP)
 (see Box 
4). Loan dynamics 
remained on a path of 
gradual
 recovery
, but loan growth
 was 
still weak
. The annual growth rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for 
sales and s
ecuritisation) 
increased 
in 
February
 (see Chart 
9) on the back of 
both 
loans to non
-financial corporations (NFCs) and households. 
Nonetheless, 
the annual 
growth rate of loans to NFCs 
remained weak, having not yet fully recovered 
from the 
trough of the firs
t quarter of 2014
. These trends were generally observed across the 
euro area, being supported by the
 significant 
decreases 
in bank lending rates 
witnessed 
since summer 2014 (notably owing to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary 
policy measures) and 
progress 
in 
the supply of and demand for bank loans. 
Despite 
these positive signs, the ongoing consolidation of bank balance sheets and 

persistently high levels of non
-performing loans in some jurisdictions 
remain a drag 
on loan growth.

 15 Bank lending rates for NFCs 
fell to a ne
w historic 
low in February
. Composite lending rates for NFCs 
and households have 
shown a greater decrease 
than 
market reference rates since the ECB's credit easing 
package was announced in June 2014
 (see Chart 10)
. 
Receding fragmentation in euro area finan
cial markets 
and the improvement in the pass
-through of monetary 
policy measures to bank lending rates
 help account for 
this development
. 
The decline in composite lending 
rates 
is also explained by 
a decrease in
 banks™ 
composite funding costs
, which is bei
ng passed on 
in 
the form of lower lending rates. 
Between May 2014 and 
February
 2016, the composite lending rate on loans to 
euro area NFCs fell by 
around 95
 basis points to 
1.9
8%. 
And, over the same period, the composite 
lending rate on loans to households
 for house purchase 
decreased by more than 
70 basis points to 2.2
0% in 
February 2016
. 
Furthermore
, the spread between 
interest rates charged on very small loans (loans of up 
to •0.25 million) and those charged on large loans 
(loans of above •1 million)
 in 
the euro area 
has been 
moving 
downward
s since 
June 2014, when
 credit easing
 was enhanced, and 
appears to have recently stabilised at low levels
. 
This indicat
or suggests
 that small 
and medium
-sized 
companies
 have
 benefit
ed to a 
greater
 extent than large 
companies
 from the recent lending rate developments.
 The April 2016 euro area bank lending survey suggests that 
the recovery in 
loan growth 
is still in progress
 (see survey at:
 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/lend/html/index.en.html
). In the first 
quarter of 2016 l
oan supply conditions for enterprises 
continued to 
improv
e and there was an 
increase 
in 
demand 
for all types of 
loan
s. Competition remained the 
mai
n factor driving the easing (in net terms) 
of 
credit standards 
for
 loans to 
enterprises. Banks 
further 
ease
d terms and conditions for new loans 
in general
, 
particularly 
those involving 
households. 
As regards 
the 
effects
 of the ECB™s 
expanded asset purchase
 programme, banks have 
mainly used 
the liquidity 
obtained 
from 
the APP
 to 
grant
 loans. 
Euro area banks 
also 
reported 
that the APP has had a 
negative impact on 
profitability. 
Furthermore
, the ECB™s negative deposit facility rate
 was said to be 
having a positive 
effect 
on lending volumes, 
but weighing 
on banks™ 
net interest income and loan margins.
  NFCs' net issuance of debt securities increased 
significantly
 in March 2016, 
after contracting in 
the previous two months
. The turnaround in net issu
ance 
corresponds to a decline 
in the cost of market
-based debt financing
: it dropped for 
the second consecutive time during 
March. 
The continued 
strong growth of retained 
earnings
, however,
 has most likely been a dampening factor in recent months. 
Retained
 earnings grew markedly in the fourth quarter of 2015

 16 Financing costs for euro area NFCs remain favourabl
e. 
The overall nominal cost 
of external financing for NFCs is estimated to have declined in March 2016, th
ereby 
reversing most of the increases observed around the turn of the year. This 
development
 is explained by the 
reduction 
in both the cost of equity 
financing and 
the cost of market

In March 2016 t

 17 Box 
1 Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices
 Œ Easter effects and improved 
seasonal
 adjustment
 This box explains the improvements that have been made to the ECB™s 
seasonal adjustment of euro area HICPs following a recent review and the 
introduction of a calendar adjustment.
 Because month
-on-month HIC
P inflation 
rates are affected by seasonality and calendar constellations, short
-term inflation 
analyses benefit from seasonal adjustment.
 Calendar constellations may also have 
an impact on annual inflation rates, especially in periods affected by moving 

holidays. The ECB estimates that the year
-on-year growth rate of the euro area 
HICP for services in March 2016 was elevated by 0.1 percentage point because 
Easter was in March, while it was in April in 2015. 
 Seasonal fluctuations are infra
-year movements w
hich appear in the same 
period of a calendar year and have a similar impact on a time series
; the size 
of such 
fluctuations 
may evolve over time.
 Seasonality can be 
caused by weather 
conditions
; events related to administrative measures
, such as the dating
 of school 
holidays; and habits 
and traditions
, such as Christmas shopping
. 
Conventions in the 
compilation of the HICP may also play a role, for example the coverage of prices for 
goods and services whose price changes exhibit a seasonal pattern. 
Calendar 
effects 
are related to calendar constellations which may change every year, such as 
the dating of Easter
. 
Examples of seasonal effects in HICPs include seasonality in 
price
 indice
s for 
fresh fruit and vegetables, winter and summer package holidays
, 
and clothing and footwear. 
Seasonal fluctuations 
in the euro area HICP 
have 
become more pronounced
 over time, 
in particular
 due to the 
gradual
 harmonisation 
of statistical 
concepts and methods related to prices that exhibit seasonality.
 For 
example, comprehensive
 cover
age of
 sales prices for clothing and footwear
 was 
introduced in 2001
. The ECB started compiling
 seasonally adjusted euro area HICPs in 2000
, with 
the aim of broadening the analytical toolbox beyond the data provided by 
statistical institutes
.1 The seasonally adjusted 
total
 HICP for the euro area 
is compiled 
indirectly
 by aggregating the seasonally adjusted 
sub
-indices
 for
 processed 
food, unprocessed food, 
and industrial goods excluding energy and 
for 
services
, and the unadjusted series 
for
 ener
gy. 
This procedure has now been reviewed and 
improvements to the seasonal adjustment of HICPs for services and 
for non
-energy 
                                                                    1  Traditionally, most statistical institutes do not calculate price indices in 
a seasonally adjusted format
. The 
ECB
™s approach to
 seasonal adjustment of the euro area HICP 
is described in
 the 
2000 
report 
entitled 
ﬁSeasonal adjustment of mon

 Estimation of Easter effects in the HICP for services
 Before the review
, 
the 
euro area HICP 
and its components were 
not 
adjusted 
for 
calendar effects.
 Whi
le the number of working or shop
-opening 
days typically 
causes pronounced calendar effect
s on GDP, industrial production and retail trade,
 different constellations of week and weekend days do not affect consumer prices. 
However, the 
dating
 of Easter may substantially affect the level of prices fo
r services 
in March and April, particular
ly for package holidays, accommodation services and 
airfares, since the prices of these services are recorded in HICPs when the service is 

provided, e.g. 
when 
the package holiday start
s. An 
examin
ation
 of 
Easter eff
ects for 
euro area 
countries
 shows 
that a reliable estimate of 
their
 impact is feasible.

 19 Improvements in the HICP for non
-energy industrial 
goods 
 The seasonal adjustment of non
-energy
 industrial goods 
has been improved 
through an explicit treatment of
 several statistical breaks
 (see Chart B)
. 
One of 
the
se breaks was caused by
 the introduction of a harmonised treatment
 of price 
reductions
4 in EU Member States in 2001.
5 As of 2001 s
ales prices 
for
 clothing and 
footwear
 have been covered comprehensively in the HICPs of euro area countries, 
typically resulting in drops during
 the traditional sales periods at the end of the winter 
and summer season
s. Another break 
was 
due to the introduction 
of the
 HICP

 20 Combined effect on total HICP 
 The review of the seasonal adjustment approach and the introduction of a
n Easter
 adjustment have resulted in seasonally adjusted
 euro area HICPs
 which 
are more useful for analytical and forecasting purposes
. Appropriately estimated 
seasonal and calendar effects are an important input into the monitoring of 
short

ing 
HICP inflation that is affected by such effects. The introduction of an

of the adjusted indices
. Nonetheless, the differences in month

 Recent wage trends in the euro area
 Wage growth
 has remained relatively low in the euro area despite 
an 
environme
nt of improving labour markets
. In the fourth quarter of 2015, g
rowth in 
compensation per employee stood at 1.
3% 
in year
-on-year terms
, being one of 
the 
lowest figures
 registered
 since the 
start
 of monetary union. The growth in negotiated 
wages is more rob
ust, but also registered historically low figures
 in 2015
. At the 
same time, 
the 
unemployment 
rate, while still high, 
has been declining since the 
second quarter of 2013, indicating a reduction in the amount of slack in the labour 
market. 
 Wage growth has 
not only been low, but also 
consis
tently over
-predicted
. Chart 
B depicts 
forecasts for growth in 
compensation per
 employee
 during different Eurosystem/ECB staff projection rounds 
since 2013.
 The forecasts for growth in compensation 
per employee (shown by the shaded grey lines) lie 

above the realised outcomes (shown by the black line). 

This pattern indicates that the 
actual growth in 
compensation per employee surprised on the 
downside.
 Negative 
forecast 
errors in the growth of 
compensation per employee have been 
accompanied by positive errors in employment 
growth
 (see Chart 
C). 
Indeed, employment growth has 
been strong
er than expected in recent quarters, and the 
unemployment rate has declined at a faster pace than 
projected. 
The positive surprises in employment growth 
and the 
higher
 than
 expected wage moderation
 could 
both be partly related to 
structural labour market r
eforms
 aimed at increasing labour 
market flexibility and reducing nominal rigidities
. 
 The 
large 
remaining 
amount of slack is 
a key 
factor pulling wage inflation 
down
. 
Even if the labour market in the euro area is improving, the high 
unemployment rate still points to ample labour supply. The measurement of the 

amount of slack in the labour market is surrounded by high uncertainty and 
the 
observed unemployment rate might 
understate the actual labour market slack in the 
economy
. 
For example, the share of underemployed people, i.e. those working on a 
part
-time basis but who would like to work more hours, and the share of discouraged

  Furthermore, labour market reforms introduced since the crisis might have 
altered the functioning of the labour market.
 The aim of these reforms has been 
to 
make wages more responsive to labour market conditions by abolishing wage 
indexation schemes and 
reducing
 labour protecti
on. Indeed, there is evidence that 
downward wage rigidities became weaker as the crisis became more protracted.
2 If 
the labour markets 
are still in an adjustment phase, the impact of 
labour market 
reforms would imply that
, for 
a certain
 period 
of time, 
shrinking slack would go hand 
in hand with low wage growth. 
Also, wages today might reflect nominal rigidities 
prevailing in the past: 
downward nominal rigidities could have prevented wages from 
adjusting sufficiently to the amount of slack during the downturn, thereby hindering a 

stronger wage increase in the upturn.

Œ Box 2
 Recent wage trends in the euro area
 23 The low inflation environment may have also 
contributed to containing wage growth. 
Low 
inflation
, which is very much driven by low oil prices,
 might affect the 
wage n
egotiation process, as 
workers 
might not push for higher wages 
when
 falling energy 
prices 
boost their real income.
 Low inflation could affect 
wage growth via formal and informal wage indexation 

mechanisms or via expectation formation.
 Disentangling between
 these two channels is 

challenging, also because of the lack of data on the 

expectations of households and firms
, which are the 
ones that matter in the wage negotiation process. Chart 

D shows 
the contributions of 
key wage drivers
 to 
growth in compensation 
per 
employee based on 
a standard Phillips curve model.
3 In this model, it is 
assumed that wage setting takes past inflation into 
account (but the model specification can overstate the 
importance of past inflation in wage setting). 
The 
results suggest that 
(i) labour market slack has been 
exerting a substantial negative drag on wage growth 

since the beginning of the financial crisis
, although this 
drag is diminishing; 
(ii) 
recent
 inflation
 readings are 
also negatively influencing wage growth; and (iii) weak 
productivity growth is weighing on wages
.  The structure of recent employment creation
 may
 have
 also
 contributed to low 
productivity and wage growth in the euro area
. Since 
the second quarter of 
2013, 
employment creation in the euro area has been 
relatively stronger in low
-productivity 
sectors, such as business services and trade and transportation services.
4 As low
-productivity sectors tend to be associated with relatively lower wage 
levels and wage 
growth
 rates
, this employment composition effect
 puts a drag on average wage 
growth.  
 As economic activity gains momentum and the labour market tightens, upward 
pressures on wages 
are
 expected to intensify.
 The recent 
ECB staff
 macroeconomic projections 
published in March 
ind
icate that compensation per 
employee is expected to grow moderately in 2016, picking up to 2.1% in 2018, 
following the gradual recovery in euro area real GDP.
                                                                    3  The slack measure is the unemployment rate, which can overstate the importance of labour market 
slack in wage formation if it is assumed that the natural rate of unemployment increased a
fter the crisis.

 The second series of targete

 24 Box 
3 The second series of targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II)
 On 10 March 201
6 the Governing Council announced a second series of 
targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTRO II), which 
will reinforce the 
ECB™s accommodative monetary policy stance and strengthen the 

transmission of monetary policy
. The 
new operations offer lo
ng-term funding 
at 
attractive 
conditions to banks
 to further ease private sector credit conditions and to 
stimulate bank lending to the real economy.
 In conjunction with the other non
-standard measures in place, TLTRO
 II will contribute to a return of infl
ation rates to 
levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term
. 
 TLTRO
 II will consist of a series of four operations which will be conducted 
once a quarter between June 2016 and March 2017
. Counterparties
1 will be able 
to borrow in the operations a total amount of up to 30% of a specific eligible part of 

their 
outstanding 
loans
2 as at 31 January 2016, less any amount which was 
previously borrowed under the first two TLTRO
 operations conducted in 2014
 and still outstanding 
at the time of the settlement of TLTRO II. The upper limit for the 
aggregated borrowing allowances is estimated to amount to around •1.6 trillion.
3 However, as illustrated by the take
-up in the first series of TLTROs (TLTRO I), this 
figure 
cannot be treated as a reflection of the expected take
-up in the operations. 
Take
-up of the total allowance would require that all banks with eligible loans apply 
for participation in TLTRO II (which requires optimal formation of TLTRO groups) and 

fully re
pay the amounts borrowed in the first two TLTRO I operations conducted in 
2014. More importantly, banks will assess the attractiveness of the new operations 
against market conditions, their issuance plans, their overall funding needs and their 
lending outl
ook.
 Targeted longer
-term refinancing operations
 have 
a track record of supporting
 the 
transmission of lower policy rates to 
better
 borrowing conditions for the 
non-financial private sector
. 
Such operations were
 first introduced as part of the 
June 2014 cr
edit
-easing package.
 Lending rates for euro area non
-financial 
enterprises and households declined markedly after the announcement of the credit
-easing package, and the associated reductions in bank funding costs have 
increasingly been passed on to bank bo
rrowers (
see Chart 1
1 in Section 5
). The 
observed reductions have been more pronounced in vulnerable countries, where 
lending rates had previously been elevated vis
-à-vis those prevailing elsewhere in 
                                                                    1 As in the first series of TLTROs, counterp
arties can participate in TLTRO
 II individually or, subject to 
certain conditions, on a group basis. 
 2  As in the first series of TLTROs, eligible loans are defined as those to euro area non
-financial 
corporations and households excluding loans to 
households for house purchase.
 3  Amount
s which w
ere
 previously borrowed under the first two TLTRO operations conducted in 2014
 and 
not repaid will reduce this borrowing allowance. Currently such borrowings amount to •212 billion.

Œ Box 3
 The second series of targeted longer

 25 the euro area. Moreover, in the former group of countri
es, there is evidence that 
counterparties that borrowed in the first series of TLTROs have lowered the rates 
charged to non
-financial enterprises by more than their non
-participating peers.
4 In 
line with these observations, the majority of banks surveyed i
n the euro area bank 
lending survey (in January 2015, July 2015 and January 2016) reported that they 

intended to use the funds obtained in the first series of TLTROs to grant loans, in 
particular loans to enterprises and consumer credit.
 The main gauge of 
the measure
™s effectiveness
 will be its
 performance in 
improving funding conditions for final borrowers in the real economy
. While 
widespread participation in TLTRO
 II is welcome, the amount of liquidity allotted is 
only one of the criteria by which 
to ass
ess the
 likely
 success of the measure
, as also 
seen by the experience with TLTRO I. In fact, the mere availability of long
-term 
funding at low rates for banks via TLTRO II (together with the other monetary policy 
measures in place) is expected to ease bank
 funding conditions in general and to 
lower the cost of market
-based bank funding. As was the case for TLTRO 
I, this cost 
advantage 
is in turn expected to be passed on to bank borrowers
. 
 All TLTRO II operations 
have a maturity of four years
 from the time of 
settlement, with the possibility of voluntary early repayment after two years
. 
The long maturity of the operations will provide 
counterparties
 with funding certainty 
and allow them to match the maturity of their funding with that of loans
 that finance 
real investment spending.
 At the same time, the measure provides flexibility as 
counterparties will be able to repay the amounts borrowed under TLTRO
 II at a 
quarterly frequency starting two years from the settlement of each operation. 
Counte
rparties will not be subject to mandatory early repayments
, as was possible 
under TLTRO I
. Moreover, 
an additional voluntary repayment possibility 
in 
June
 2016 for all currently outstanding TLTRO
 I operations has been introduced
, 
just 
ahead of
 the settleme
nt of the first TLTRO
 II operation. 
This will allow counterparties 
that participated in the previous series of TLTROs to transfer their funding to TLTRO 
II and thereby benefit from the more accommodative terms of the new series of 
operations.
 The pricing m
echanism of TLTRO II is intended to incentivise banks to pass on 
to ultimate borrowers the accommodative funding conditions it offers. 
The rate 
at which counterparties can borrow under TLTRO
 II depends on their lending 
pattern
 (see Chart A)
.5 The maximum 
interest rate applied 
under TLTRO
 II will be fixed for 
each operation at the rate applied in the main refinancing operation (MRO) prevailing 
at the time of allotment. 
However, counterparties 
whose eligible net lending in the 
period between 1 February 2016 a
nd 31 January 2018 exceeds 
a certain
 benchmark
 Œ which depends on each counterparty
™s past lending behaviour, as explained below 
Œ will 
benefit from a
 lower rate
 for the entire term of the operation
. In particular, t
he rate on TLTRO
 II borrowing can be as low as the rate on the deposit facility 
prevailing 
at the time of allotment for 
counterparties
 with 
a sufficiently strong lending 
                                                                    4  For more details, see

    Counterparties
™ benchmarks depend on their lending pattern over the 12 
months to 31 January 2016. 
For counterparties that exhibited positive eligible net 
lending in the 12
-month period to 31 January 2016, the benchmark net lending is set 
at zero. For counterparties that 
exhibited negative eligible net lending in the 12
-month period to 31 January 2016, the benchmark net lending is equal to the eligible 

net lending in that period.
 The benchmark lending concept is illustrated in Chart 
B. 
The chart gives a stylised example fo
r a counterparty with positive lending during the 

12 months up to 31 January 2016, as well as for a counterparty with negative lending 

during that period. For the counterparty with positive net lending
 (blue line), the 
benchmark net lending flow is zero, s
o that the benchmark stock is equal to the 
outstanding amount of eligible loans on 31 January 2016. By contrast, for the 
counterparty with negative net lending (yellow line), the benchmark net lending flow 
is equal to the negative net lending flow 
during 
that period. The benchmark stock 
that counterparties have to exceed is thus equal to the outstanding amount of eligible 
loans 
on 31 January 2016 plus the (negative) net lending flow recorded in the 
12 months to 31 January 2016.

-month period to 31 January 2016 
(counterparties A, B 
and C) and three with negative eligible net lending in that period (counterparties D, E 
and F). Counterparties A, B and C, as positive net lenders in the 12
-month period to 
31 January 2016, are assigned a zero net lending benchmark.
 For counterparties D, 
E and F, wh
ich had negative
 eligible net lending in the 12
 months to 31 January 
2016, the benchmark net lending is equal to the
ir net lending in that period, i.e. 
-•40 million in these examples.
 In Table B it is a
ssume
d that counterparty A achieves positive net lending of 
•30 million in the period 
from 
1 February 2016 to 31 January 2018. This counterparty 
therefore exceeds its benchmark outstanding amount
 (assumed to be •1,000 million)
 by 3.0% and as a result obtains the
 lowest possible rate of 
-0.40%, i.e. the current 
rate on the deposit facility
 (all examples
 are based on the current MRO and deposit 
facility rates
). Counterparty B registers negative net lending of 
-•10 million. This 
counterparty does not meet its benchm
ark
 net lending
 and, therefore, the maximum 
rate of 0.00%, i.e. the current 
MRO 
rate, will be applied to its borrowing 
under TLTRO
 II. Counterparty C exhibits positive net lending, thereby meeting its 
benchmark net lending. However, its positive net lendin
g of •10 million results in this 

counterparty exceeding its benchmark outstanding amount by only 1.0%, i.e. less 

than the 2.5% necessary to obtain the minimum rate. In this case a rate of 
-0.16% 
will be applied to counterparty C
™s borrowing 
under TLTRO
 II.
 This is 40% of the 
difference between the current deposit facility rate (
-0.40%) and the rate applied 
in 
the
 MRO (0.00%), reflecting the fact that this counterparty exceeded its benchmark 

by only 40% of the amount required to receive the minimum possible 
rate.
 Counterparty D exhibits net lending of 
-•10 million in the period 
from 
1 February
 2016 to 31 January 2018. This counterparty exceeds its benchmark 
outstanding amount
 (assumed to be •960 million)
 by 3.1%
 and as a result obtains 
the lowest possible rat
e of 
-0.40%. By contrast, counterparty E does not meet its 
benchmark net lending, as it registers eligible net lending of 
-•50 million in the period 
from 1
 February 2016 to 31 January 2018. In this case the MRO rate of 0.00% will 
be applied. Finally, count
erparty F exhibits net lending of 
-•35 million, thereby 
exceeding its benchmark outstanding amount by only 0.5%, i.e. 20% of what is 
required in order to achieve the minimum rate on TLTRO
 II borrowing. In this case 
                                                                    6  Please note that all calculations are rounded. The exact number of decimal places to apply is specified

 Rebalancing in euro area portfolio investment flows
 29 Box
 4 Rebalancing in euro area portfolio 
investment flows
 This box describes 
recent developments in the portfolio investment flows of 
the euro area financial account
. During 2015 the euro area™s current account 
surplus was mainly mirrored by net portfolio investment outflows 
in the financial 
account
 of the balance of payments.
  In 2015 the euro area recorded 
net outflows 
in 
portfolio investm
ent
 largely due to a rebalancing 
towards foreign debt securities 
(see Chart 
A). Euro 
area investors significantly stepped up their purchases 
of foreign debt securities from mid
-2014 Œ when the 
ECB
 embarked on comprehensive
 credit easing 
measures
 Œ to levels not seen since the outbreak of the 
global financial crisis. Since mid
-2014, e
uro area 
residents
 have been persistent net buyers
 of foreign 
debt securities
, largely in the form of long
-term bonds
. In the first quarter of 2015, when the ECB™s pu
blic 
sector purchase programme was launched,
 foreign 
investors partly offset these outflows with substantial 
net purchases of euro area debt securities. 

Subsequently, however, non
-residents have broadly 
disinvest
ed from euro area debt securities
. The 
rebal
ancing towards foreign debt securities is in line 
with
 the euro area™s persistently 
negative interest rate 
differentials vis
-à-vis other advanced economies
. 
Foreign investors™ net purchases of euro area equities 
Œ which have been substantial in recent year
s Œ peaked
 in 
the first quarter of 2015. Thereafter, foreign investment inflows to euro area equities 
abated, 
thereby 
contributing to the rebalancing towards 
net portfolio 
investment 
outflows
 from the euro area.
 Net purchases of foreign equities by euro ar
ea investors 
declined to low levels in 2015 and thus did not contribute significantly to overall 
developments in portfolio
 investment
 flows.
 Rising euro area portfolio debt investment abroad largely targeted other 
advanced economies in 2015 (see Chart B). 
Around 45% of euro area investors™ 
net purchases of foreign debt securities in 2015 were directed towards the United 
States, followed by the United Kingdom (11%), other EU Member States (10%), 
Canada (10%) and Japan (5%). Net purchases by euro area residen
ts of debt 
securities issued by Brazil, China, India and Russia largely dried up during 2015, 
concomitant with waning investor confidence in these markets. As information on the 
source countries of foreign inflows to the euro area is not available, indicat

 The s

 31 Article
 The slowdown in emerging market 
econ
omies and its implications for the 
global economy
 Emerging market
 economie
s (EMEs) have been a significant driver of global growth 
and euro area external demand in the 21st century. However, since 2010 growth in 
EMEs has been on a downward trend. Some of that moderation has been driven by 

structural factors such as diminishing cap
ital accumulation and productivity gains 
and waning global trade integration. Other headwinds include the sluggish 
recover
ies
 seen in
 advanced economies
, which have dampened external demand, 
sharp declines in commodity prices, which have particularly affec
ted growth in 
commodity
-exporting economies, and the gradual tightening of global 
financing 
conditions since 2013
. Moreover, following a period in which 
policies 
were highly 
accommodative and private sector debt increased, policy buffers have been eroded 
and macroeconomic vulnerabilities have increased. 
The slowdown 
in EMEs 
has 
already 
dampened
 global growth and 
had an adverse
, albeit moderate,
 impact on 
euro area 
exports. However, this has been partially offset by the boost to real 
disposable incomes resul
ting from declines in commodity prices. Looking ahead, 
risks to the outlook for EMEs remain on the downside. A
 further broad
-based and 
pronounced slowdown in 
EMEs
 could have 
a sizeable adverse impact on the outlook
 for the global economy
. 1 Introduction
 The 
weak
ening growth 
observed 
in 
EMEs 
in recent years has surprised many 
forecasters.
1 That slowdown has been pronounced and has affected a large 
number of countries.
 However,
 the 
underlying causes
 var
y from country to country.
 In some countries
, structural im
pediments to growth and macroeconomic imbalances 
are increasingly 
limiting
 potential
 growth,
 while 
other
 countrie
s are adjusting to lower 
commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions.
 EMEs
 are 
play
ing
 an increasingly important role in the global economy
. EMEs 
account for 
almost
 two
-thirds of 
global GDP in 
purchasing power parity 
(PPP) 
terms
. 
A broad slowdown 
in EMEs
 could 
therefore 
act as a 
significant
 drag on global 
growth.
                                                                     1  This article focuses mainly on a group of large EMEs comprising 
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Egypt, Hong Kong
 SAR, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, T
urkey and Venezuela
. In some cases, 
however, data availability issues have necessitated the analysis of smaller groups. Moreover, 
definitions of EMEs 
vary across statistical providers, and the countries included in broader aggregates 
compiled by other inst
itutions can vary.

 The slowdown in emerging market economies and its implications for the global economy
 32 This article analyses the 
causes of 
the 
slowdown in EMEs and assesses the 
economic 
outlook 
and 
the implications for the global economy
 and the euro 
area
. The next section outlines the headwinds that have been impeding EMEs in 
recent years.
 Section 3 then assesses the risks to the ec
onomic outlook, focusing on 
EMEs™ potential vulnerability to an abrupt tightening of
 external financing conditions
 against the backdrop of rising indebtedness
. The final section discusses the role of 
EMEs in the global economy and considers the transmissio
n channels to the euro 

area in the event of a more pronounced slowdown in EMEs.
 2 The factors contributing to the slowdown in EMEs
 Since 2010 growth in EMEs has been on a downward trend
. EMEs weathered 
the global financial crisis rather better than advanced 
economies and recovered 
strongly afterwards, recording aggregate GDP growth of 7.5% in 2010. However, last 
year was
 the 
fifth consecutive year of slowing economic 
growth
 in EMEs, with 
aggregate GDP growth standing at just 4.0
% in 2015 
Œ markedly lower than
 the 
levels observed
 in the years before the financial crisis. The slowdown has been 

broad
ly 
based
: growth
 has been 
weaker
 in the 
last three years than 
it was 
before the 
financial crisis 
in most large EMEs 
(see

  One 
factor
 underlying
 that deceleration 
has been 
a structural
 moderation in 
EMEs
™ growth
. Looking at developments from a longer
-term perspective, t
he period 
from 2000 to 2010 
was 
exceptional
, with EMEs averaging 
aggregate 
GDP growth of 
almost 
6%, compared 
with
 less than 
4% in the previous two decades
 (see Chart 2).

was

In this 
environment, robust capital accumulation and strong productivity growth helped to 
boost trend growth rates. A
s those 
factors 
have ebbed since the global financial 
crisis, so too has 
potential growth. 
In addition, previously fa
vourable demographic 
trends have gradually waned in some countries, as growth in the working age 

population has moderated. 
ECB 
staff 
estimates
 based on a Cobb
-Douglas 
production
 function attribute 
around one
-third of the moderation in growth 
seen 
in the 
seven largest EMEs 
since 2010 to 
falling potential growth (
see 
Chart 
3). Changes in 
potential growth
 have varied a
cross 
the 
largest EMEs,
 as have the factors underlying 
those 
developments
. In China, 
years of credit
-driven 
investment have resulted in excess capacity
 in some 
sectors
, 
as well as the
 misallocation 
of resources 
and a build
-up of
 debt, while the benefits of accession to the 
World Trade Organization and increase
d trade 
integration have gradually waned
. 
Moreover, 
although 
there remains scope for productivity gains through 
the 
reallocation of workers from rural to urban areas and 
integration into 
more advanced
 sectors with higher 
levels of 
productivity
, the labour 
force has been in 
decline since 2011
. 
In Russia, unfavourable 

demographic trends are also weighing on potential
 growth
. 
Declines in
 energy prices and international 
sanctions imposed 
as a result of the conflict in 
Ukraine 
have also exacerbated
 long
-standing
 obstacles to 
investment and growth, such as infrastructure 
bottlenecks and a poor business climate 
(which were
 encourag
ing
 capital outflows 
even before the sharp 
recession began in 2014)
. In Brazil, potential growth 
has deteriorated as 
reduced
 commodity p
rices have hit 
investment activity in the 
country™s 
key export
 sector
s. 
Weak infrastructure investment and an 
onerous 
regulatory environment have exacerbated poor 
productivity.
 In India, by contrast, 
potential growth has remained robust as favourable demog
raphics and structural 
reforms aimed at enhancing the country™s business environment have boosted 
growth dynamics.
2 External factors have also 
contributed
 to the

 The slowdown in emerging market economies and its implications for the global economy
 34 12 large 
EMEs 
confirm that view, suggesting
 that 
external factors have accounted for 
around half of 
all
 variation
s in growth dynamics 
in the last two decades. Looking at 
the most recent period, external factors were important in the initial downturn 
observed as of 2010. Since 2014, however, domestic factors have played a larger 
role in dampening growth (see Chart 4).
 Among the external factors, sluggish external 
demand and global trade have both had an adverse 
effect on EMEs in recent years. 
Global trade volumes 
have 
grown 
at rates well below historical norms in the 
past five years. 
After
 growing
 at 
almost
 twice the rate of 
GDP 
on average 
in the 
two 
decades before the 
financial crisis, trade has barely kept pace with 

economic 
activity since 2011. Some of th
at weakness 
stems from inter
-EME trade developments, 
perhaps 
reflecting the 
dwindling benefits 
of EMEs
™ integration 
into global markets. In particular, the moderation seen 
in trade with 
China has affected 
that country™s 
trading 
partners, 
including other 
Asian 
EMEs 
and commodity
-export
ing economies
. 
However, the slow recoveries 
observed in 
advanced economie
s, where both private 
and public sectors have sought to repair balance sheets
 in the wake of the global financial crisis
, have also 
weighed on trade
-intensive components of demand 
such as investment. Moreover, 
the persisten
t weakness 
of global trade volume
s since 2011 may also 
point to a 
structural shift, 
perhaps related to the weakening
 of 
global supply chain expansion.
5  Declines in
 commodity prices have also affected 
some EMEs
. Oil prices have 
declined sharply over the last 18 months, with prices at the 
end of March 2016 
around two
-thirds of the mid
-2014 peaks. Other commodity prices have also been on 
a downward trend, with the IMF non
-fuel primary commodities index standing 40% 
below its 2011 peak. The moderation seen in commodity prices 
Œ particularly o
il prices 
Œ has reflected both supply and demand
-side factors. Much of the initial 
decline in oil prices during 2014 was attributable to supply
-side factors,
 as 
oil 
production increased more strongly than expected against the backdrop of high 
levels of 
past investment and technological innovations. 
OPEC™s
 decision in 
November 2014 
to keep production quotas unchanged exacerbated the decline in oil 
prices, as did
 the resilience of shale oil production. 
However, weaker demand 
played 
                                                                                                                                                          4  The

-export
ing economie
s with flexible exchange rates
 have also seen their monetary 
policies constrained, a
s their currencies have depreciated in 
line
 with 
the falling 
commodity prices and
 inflationary pressures have risen
. 
At the same time, although 

commodity
-import
ing economie
s have benefited from rising rea
l disposable incomes, 
the effects on economic activity have been fairly slow to materialise. In some 
countries, 
fall
ing
 energy prices have
 enabled governments to reduce fuel subsidies 
and increase fiscal sustainability, while in others, private savings hav
e increased.
 In addition, after being broadly favourable in the 

years following the global financial crisis, the 
exte
rnal financing environment has gradually 
tightened. 
In the early stages of the post
-crisis 
recovery, EMEs benefited from a supportive external 
financing environment.
 Global funding conditions 
were 
favourable 
to EMEs, with
 central banks in advanced 
economie
s pursu
ing
 accommodative policies, keeping 
interest rates low and engaging in large
-scale asset 
purchases. 
Capital flows to EMEs 
generally remained 
buoyant
. Over the last three years, however, financing 
conditions have tightened. The ﬁtaper tantrumﬂ 
observ
ed in the summer of 2013, when speculation 
mounted about the Federal Reserve System™s intention 
to tighten US monetary policy, sparked a sharp 
correction in financial markets. External funding 
conditions tightened again in anticipation of an increase 

in US
 interest rates (which eventually came in 
December 2015). Meanwhile, the 
unwinding of 
excessive stock market valuations 
amid 
changes in 
China™s 
exchange rate policy framework 
has added to 
uncertainty and financial market volatility in recent 

months
. 
Balance of payments data show net capital 
outflows from the largest EMEs during the first three 
quarters of 2015 (see Chart 6). More timely indicators 
point to a strengthening of capital outflows towards the end of 2015, particularly in 
China. Several EMEs
 have seen their currencies depreciate (see Chart 7). The 
impact of tighter financing conditions can be seen in higher 
bond yields
, widening 
credit spreads 
and substantial 
corrections in equity prices.

  At the same time, 
the support provided by accommodative polici
es in the 
aftermath of the financial crisis, which helped to sustain demand (particularly 
through strong credit growth), has weakened. 
Although f
avourable 
external 
funding conditions 
supported EME growth in the years after the global recession, 
they also p
osed
 challenges for EMEs
. Faced
 with 
a choice between
 restraining 
domestic demand 
and deterring unwelcome capital inflows 
in order to alleviate 
appreciation pressures
, 
many
 EMEs chose to maintain relatively accommodative 
policies
. On aggregate, s
hort
-term 
(ex post) 
real interest rates were close to zero 
from 2008 to 2012 (see Chart 8
). Long-term interest rat
es also fell during this period.
 The s
ubstantial fiscal stimulus
 provided in 2009 and 2010 
contributed to the 
supportive macro
economic
 environment
. In t
he presence of loose 
financial 
conditions
, 
credit expanded rapidly in s
everal countries (see Chart 9
). 
The analysis 
in the box suggests that domestic and global financial cycles have had a major 
influence on EMEs™ business cycles. The 
combination of rising
 domestic credit and 
capital inflows
 initially helped to sustain EME growth during a period of external 
weakness, but in the last three years financial conditions have tightened and that 
support has begun to wane.

 The implications of global and domestic credit cycles for EMEs: measures of 
ﬁfinance
-adjusted
ﬂ output gaps
 The b
uoyant credit growth 
observed 
in many EMEs has 
increased
 concerns about 
grow
ing 
imbalances and 
the potential 
risks to the 
economic 
outlook 
if
 the credit cycle 
were to 
turn.
 In 
order t
o gauge 
the impact of global and domestic credit developments on the business cycle, 
this 
box describes estimates of 
ﬁfinance
-adjusted
ﬂ output gaps 
for a selection of EMEs.
 Measures of finance
-adjusted output gap
s provide 
a way
 of understanding the role 
that
 financial factors 
have played 
in shaping recent EME business cycle dynamics.
 The 
theory
 is that traditional measures of potential output may be too restrictive
, as
 inflation may not be the only 
symptom of an u
nsustainable expansion. Indeed, 
the 
pre
-crisis experience
s of a number of
 advanced economies 
suggest 
that 
it is possible for 
output 
to
 be on an unsustainable path even if 
inflation remain
s low and stable. Recent literature has explored 
the 
concept of finan
ce-adjusted 
gaps 
(which use simple filtering techniques to estimate the impact 
that
 the financial cycle 
has 
on economic activity
), finding that financial cycle information can explain 
some
 of the cyclical 
movements in output in some advanced economies.

 The slowdown in emerging mark

 38 Finance
-adjusted output gaps 
have been 
estimated for a sample of 12 large 
EMEs
, 
incorporating
 measures of global and 
domestic credit cycles.
7 The model augments 
a Hodrick
-Prescott filter within a simple state
-space framework, allowing financial variables to 
influence the output gap. 
Domestic 
credit gaps 
are 
estimated
 as 
the 
deviation of real 
private 
sector 
credit from long
-term trends, using an 
asymmetric 
band-pass filter.
8 The global 
financial cycle is estimated as the deviation of 
aggregate
 net capital flows 
to 
EMEs
 from long
-term trends
.9 The model suggests that financial cycle 
information 
Œ as captured by the behaviour 
of domestic and global credit aggregates 
Œ explains 
part of the 
cyclical movements in 
output for most EMEs.
 For most countries, 
global and domestic credit variables 
explain
 a large amount
 of the variation 
seen 
in output 
gaps. Since the global financial crisis, the 
finance
-adjusted output gap has diverged from 
a measure based on the Hodrick
-Prescott filter. 
Several countries 
have seen
 strong
 increases in domestic credit during 
th
is period
, which 
have 
raised growth above trend
 levels
. Strong capital inflows also helped to boost economic activity in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis
, but in 2013 and 2014 (the last 
two 
year
s for which output 
gaps have been
 estimat
ed) thi
s contribution moderated. With global financi
ng conditions having 
tightened further 
in 2015
, this contribution is likely to have 
declined
 further.
 The finance
-adjusted model 
comes with some important caveats, but it provides
 an 
interesting 
alternative pers
pective o
n recent developments in EMEs
, differing from other 
models of the business cycle
. The production function approach 
suggest
s that 
EME
s™ potential
 growth
 rose in the mid
-2000s and has since fallen
 (see Chart 3 in the article). By contrast,
 estimates
 of 
finance
-adjusted gaps offer an alternative 
view
, suggesting that
, in part,
 EME
s™ strong 
growth reflected some overheating
, with economic growth 
reliant on strong credit growth, 
particularly after the financial crisis. 
There are clear limitations to this approach. The model is 
mostly statistical and does not allow for a structural interpretation
. It does not model the process of 
                                                                    7  The sample comprises 
Brazil, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, S
outh
 Africa, 
South 
Korea, Thailand
 and
 Turkey.
 The model is estimated separately for each country using annual 
GDP da
ta between 1980 (or the earliest available data) and 2014, which are aggregated using PPP 
weights.
 8  Reflecting the common view in the literature that financial cycles last longer than traditional business 

cycles, we measure credit gaps 
using 
a filter 
tha
t isolat
es cycles with 
a duration of between 8
 and
 20 years.

 The slowdown in emerging market economies and its implications for the global economy
 39 the financial cycle, and the link with the business cycle is simplistic. Moreover, it provide
s no insight 
into the possible distortions generated by financial imbalances.
10 However, even bearing these 
caveats in mind, the 
model 
could suggest
 that a further tightening of financing and credit conditions 
could remove a quantitatively important compone
nt of support for 
economic 
activity in some EMEs.
  3 Risks and vulnerabilities in the outlook for EMEs
 As economic activity in EMEs has slowed, concerns have increased about the 

outlook for economic growth and the possible vulnerabilities of some 
countries. 
As discussed in 
Section 2, 
some of 
the 
factors 
that helped to sustain 
activity 
in the short term have meant that
 Œ in some countries
, at least 
Œ vulnerabilities 
have 
increased
. The nature of that fragility varies from country to 
country, ranging from exter
nal vulnerabilities to domestic imbalances such as high 
levels of credit growth. This section 
assesses risks to the outlook
 for EMEs
, focusing 
on EME
s™ potential vulnerabilit
y to an abrupt 
deterioration in global risk sentiment
. Many EMEs 
appear better pla
ced to withstand external shocks than they were 
prior to previous crises. 
Most of the large EMEs 
have 
better external positions 
than they did prior to previous crises. Many countries have either current account 
surpluses or small deficits (see Chart 10). E
MEs also typically have 
stronger 
macroeconomic frameworks, 
with 
more flexible exchange rate regimes. 
Moreover, 
many EMEs hold 
substantial foreign exchange reserves, 
considerably in excess of 
their short
-term external liabilities, 
which 
should increase resi
lience in the event of 
external shocks
. A large proportion of EMEs have also adopted inflation
-targeting 
monetary policy frameworks, which can help to anchor inflation expectations and 
stabilise business cycles.
11 Nonetheless, the rising external debt obser
ved
 in recent years (particularly as 
a result of US dollar
-denominated 
financing
) may have 
left EMEs vulnerable to 
a sustained deterioration 
in global f
inanc
ing conditions.
 EMEs™ stock of external 
debt 
has risen since the global financial crisis, increasing from 
USD 
3 trillio
n to 
USD 
5 trillio
n between 2010 and 2014. 
The
 appreciation 
of the US dollar 
has 
helped
 to 
increase the
 external debt servicing burden in domestic currency terms
 for 
borrowers 
in som
e of these countries. Banks remain the primary 
recipients of cross
-border 
lending,
 but 
non-financial corporations are increasingly 
financing 
themselves by 
issuing
 debt securit
ies
, often through overseas subsidiaries.
12 Allowing companies to 
increase wholesa
le bank deposits may also have fuelled the expansion of bank 
                                                                    10  For a more comprehensive discussion regarding the possible drawbacks, s

 40 balance sheets and domestic credit boom
s in some EMEs. 
Although a
ggregate data 
suggest that 
EMEs™
 net foreign currency position 
has improved in recent years, there 
may be 
currency and maturity mi
smatches at sector or firm level.
13 In these 
circumstances, rather than acting as a shock absorber, the depreciation of EMEs™ 
currencies could exacerbate 
balance
 sheet weaknesses
, posing a risk to their 
economic outlook
. Moreover, 
while growing issuance of 
debt denominated in 
local
 currency has helped to reduce currency mismatches for EME borrowers, sizeable 

non-resident holdings of such bonds may nonetheless 
leave those countries 
expose
d in the event of
 a swift reversal of global sentiment.
14 Moreover, 
domes
tic imbalances have increased and policy space has become 
more limited
 in some countries
. 
As foreign currency
-denominated financing has 
risen, domestic 
credit has increased significantly
. 
Aggregate EME debt across the 
government, household and corporate sectors has risen by 
around 
50 percentage 
points
 as a 
percentage
 of GDP
 since end
-2007, 
with credit to the non
-financial 
corporate sector accounting for the majority of that increase. While 
the sharpest rise 
in debt has been observed in China, several other countries have also seen marked 

increases in private sector credit as a percentage of GDP (see Chart 9).
 Moreover, in 
some countries, growing imbalances have been combined with diminishing
 policy 
buffers (see Chart 10). 
Most of the largest EMEs are currently running fiscal deficits
. In particular, although falling commodity prices have alleviated fiscal pressures in 
commodity
-importing economies, the fiscal positions of commodity
-exporting 
economies have deteriorated considerably as commodity
-driven revenues have 
shrunk. At the same time, there has been a divergence in terms of the scope for 

monetary accommodation in the event of further shocks. Some commodity
-importing 
economies have alread
y benefited from interest rate cuts as inflation has fallen. In 
some cases, however, the scope for further monetary easing may be tempered by 
concerns about excessive credit growth, given the strong build
-up of credit in recent 
years. In commodity
-exportin
g economies, monetary policy™s ability to cushion a 
further downturn is limited by either fixed exchange rate regimes or high levels of 
inflation (associated, in part, with sharp declines in the value of those countries™ 
currencies).

economic
 outlook
. The 
ﬁtaper
 tantrum
ﬂ of 2013 provided a
n indication of
 the 
turbulence that could arise in the event of a
 sharp reversal of global risk sentiment. 
In May of that year, speculation about the pace of monetary policy tightening in the

ten

Treasur
y bonds,
 which rose by 
almost
 100 basis 
points
 between
 then and
 the end of the year. 
EME asset prices fell and 
some countries™ currencies
 depreciated rapidly
. Economies with external fragilities
, such as large current account deficits or 
heavy
 reliance on external funding
, experienc
ed particularly severe fina
ncial turmoil. 
The Federal Reserve™s decision to raise 
interest rates 
in December 2015
 was met with
 a relatively muted response 
in financial markets
. 
Federal funds futures suggest that

premia remain compressed.
 However, a
 deteriorati
on in global funding conditions 
could present policymakers in the worst
-affected EMEs with 
new 
challenges
. Indeed, 
central banks 
could
 be forced to tighten monetary policy substantially to preven
t 
large
-scale capital outflows and 
currency
 depreciation.
 Moreover, other risks are also weighing on the outlook for EMEs
. The 
protracted downturn over the last five years has raised concerns that the effect of 
cyclical and structural headwinds in some EME
s could
 be stronger
 than 
expected
. 
For instance, 
the impact of 
weak investment, infrastructure bottlenecks and capacity 
constraints could 
be stronger than expected
. 
In more 
vulnerable
 economies,
 the 
limited policy space 
could also prevent
 monetary 
or fisca
l easing 
from cushioning the 
effects of weaker demand. Finally, g
eopolitical risks 
are 
also continu
ing
 to weigh on 
the 
economic 
outlook
, 
and increase
s in
 tensions could have adverse implications for 
EMEs.
 4 The implications of the downturn in EMEs for the 
global 
economy and the euro area
 EMEs play a
 prominent 
role in the global economy. 
On average, 
EMEs 
have 
accounted for
 three
-quarters of global growth
 since 2000
 (see Chart 11)
. 
In 2014
 they accounted for 
more than
 one-third of global 
stocks of 
inward 
fore
ign direct 
investment
.15 EMEs are 
also a significant source of demand in commodity markets
. 
Looking ahead, therefore, developments in EMEs could affect other economies 
(including the euro area) through a variety of channels, including trade and financial 
links, their impact on commodity prices and confidence effects.

 EMEs

 After a

.16 The slowdown 
in EMEs 
has 
already affected economic 
activity in the 
euro area
 through the trade channel
. Since the beginning of 2012 the 
contribution 
made by
 EMEs to euro area 
external
 demand has been below the long

 (see Chart 13).
 In particular, s
luggish demand from China, Brazil and 
Russia 
has had a 
negative impact
 on the 
euro area
™s export growth
 Œ offset, in part, 
by more resilient growth in 
other EMEs.
17 A further moderation in EMEs™ economic 
activity would weigh on euro area external demand and output.
18                                                                     16  For further insight into the various trade relationships between the euro area and its trading partners,

 17  While reduced domestic spending in 
EMEs
 has contributed to declining external demand for euro area 
exports, some EMEs also play an important role in global supply chains. For example, weaker exports 
by
 China and other economies that are central t
o global supply chains may also
, in part
, be
 a symptom 
of the broader moderation in global trade discussed in 
Section 2.

 18  There could, for 
example, be an impact through the exchange rate channel. If EMEs
™ currencies were 
to depreciate in response to the slowdown in activity, the associated rise in the euro

exchange rate would weigh on exports.

 On the other hand, the commodity channel would tend to dampen

weigh on commodity prices, 
boosting real 
disposable incomes in

 of 
weaker ext

. In general, direct

 EME

weak
. 
EMEs™ share of total portfolio investment is below 10% in most euro area countries, 
with limited exposure to Brazil, China, India and Russia (see Chart 14).

 The slowdown in emerging market economies and its implications for the global economy
 45 outlook were to trigger volatility in financial markets and adversely affect 
global confidence.
 With 
financial turbulence 
in 2015 
confined to a few of the more 
fragile EMEs
, spillover effects for the euro area 
were fairly well
 contained. 
However
, 
given
 the
 sustained 
build
-up of
 debt 
seen 
in 
EMEs
 in recent years, 
there is potential 
for fresh turbulence to
 materialise
. In these circumstances, an increase in risk 
aversion and uncertainty
 could have a strong impact on the global economy
. 
Indeed, 
in the second half of 2015 and early 2016, sharp stock market declines in China 
led 
to
 significant 
volatility across 
global equity markets.
21 That lends some support to the 
view that EMEs have the p
otential to trigger confidence and financial shocks 
affecting the global economy.
 5 Conclusions
 Looking ahead, h
eightened uncertainties about the outlook for 
EMEs
 are likely 
to remain a key risk for the global economy.
 Potential 
growth has weakened in 
the co
ntext of dwindling capital accumulation, 
waning 
productivity growth and 
unfavourable demographic trends
. Other 
factors have 
caused
 further headwinds in 
the form of sluggish external demand
, weaker commodity prices
 (which have 
particularly affected commodit
y-exporting economies) and the tightening of global 
financing conditions
. Many EMEs are 
adjusting to a new reality. In several 
economies, the slowdown has revealed structural impediments which are 
increasingly 
limiting
 growth potential. In others
, it has e
xacerbated existing 
macroeconomic imbalances. Some of these challenges are unlikely to be 
overcome 
quickly.
 The rebalancing process that is under
 way is necessary to 
ensure
 sustainable growth over the medium term
, but
 the transition path is likely to be 
bumpy and risks 
will tend to be
 on the downside.
 The slowdown 
in 
EME
s has already 
had
 a substantial 
dampening effect
 on global growth and an adverse impact 
Œ albeit 
a moderate 
one 
Œ on euro area 
activity.
 The weakening of demand in
 EMEs has weighed on euro area exports. 
However, the adverse effects of the slowdown in EMEs 
have, in
 part
, been
 offset by 
the boost to real disposable incomes 
resulting 
from 
the declines in
 commodity prices. 
Looking ahead, risks to the 
economic 
outlook for EMEs remain 
on the downside. A 
further broad
-based and pronounced slowdown in 
EMEs
 could have 
a sizeable 
adverse impact on the outlook
 for the global economy
.                                                                    21  See the box entitled ﬁ

 Government debt reduction strategies

 the euro area
  This article 
analyses
 the economic and 
institutional 
factors 
supporting the 
reduction of 
government debt
-to-GDP
 ratios 
from high levels 
in the euro area.
 To this end, it reviews 
past 
debt reduction episodes and assesses 
Œ as an example 
of an operationalised 
government 
debt red
uction strategy 
Œ the debt rule enshrined 
in the reformed Stability and Growth Pact
 (SGP)
. 1 Introduction 
 Many euro area countries 
did
 not take advantage of the favourable economic 
conditions 
prior to 
the crisis
 to 
build 
up 
fiscal buffers for future downtur
ns. 
This contributed to a rapid increase of government debt to high levels after the 
outbreak of the crisis. There is widespread recognition that high government debt 
renders countries vulnerable to economic shocks and may hamper growth in a 
number of ways
. Reducing persistently high levels of government debt thus remains 
one of the main economic policy objectives. As a major lesson from the crisis, in 
2011 the EU
™s fiscal governance framework was therefore strengthened, including by 
the introduction of a d
ebt rule. This rule operationalises the Maastricht Treaty
™s debt 
criterion under the SGP, which had effectively not been implemented until then. 
 The 
SGP
™s debt rule 
is a constraining factor mostly for
 countries with 
very 
high levels of 
government 
debt.
 In the light of low growth and inflation, some of 
these countries have recently faced difficulties in delivering the fiscal adjustment 
required to put debt on the appropriate downward path, despite the declining burden 
of interest payments. Against this b
ackground, this article 
reviews 
the experience 
with past 
debt reduction episodes
 and assesses the SGP
™s debt rule as an example 
of an operationalised 
government 
debt reduction strategy
. The article is structured as follows
. Section 2 reflects on the merits
 of reducing 
high government debt ratios and considers the main factors underlying recent 
successful debt reduction episodes. Section 3 first reviews the rise in government 
debt ratios to high levels during the crisis, before turning to the SGP
™s debt rule
 and its enforcement as an example of an operationalised debt reduction strategy. 
Section
 4 provides some conclusions.

 Government debt reduction strategies in the euro area
 47 2 Government debt and long
-term fiscal sustainability
 2.1
 The economic consequences of high government debt 
 High 
government 
debt poses signif
icant economic challenges and makes the 
economy less resilient to shocks.
 It 
can exert adverse pressure on the economy 
through multiple channels. 
 First, a high 
government 
debt burden makes the economy more vulnerable to 
macroeconomic shocks and 
limit
s the
 room for counter
-cyclical fiscal policy.
 High government borrowing requirements can make a country more prone to liquidity 
shocks and sovereign default risks. 
Lower real growth or inflation shocks increase 
the real burden of debt, with larger fiscal costs
 if the initial level of debt is high. 
Investors may thus more easily question the sustainability of fiscal policies of a 

sovereign with a high debt burden, particularly when its fiscal track
 record and 
growth prospects are poor.
 This can 
increase
 volatility
 and restrain economic activity 
as p
erceived sovereign vulnerability can spill over to other sectors or jurisdictions, 

especially in integrated economic and monetary unions.
1 A high debt burden limits 
the room for fiscal policy to counteract a n
egative demand shock or may hurt the 

recovery if 
pro
-cyclical fiscal policies need to be implemented in recessions
. Second, a high 
government 
debt burden entails the need to sustain high 
primary surpluses over long periods
2, which may be difficult under fr
agile 
political or economic circumstances
. As explained above, high primary surpluses 
are difficult to maintain under adverse economic conditions. Banking crises in 
particular are associated with large contingent liabilities, which can quickly lead to a 

deterioration in fiscal positions, often with lasting effects, stemming from the process 
of balance sheet repair. In addition, though the ability of a sovereign to sustain large 
primary surpluses depends, inter alia, on the quality of its institutions and po
litical 

factors, fiscal fatigue is more likely to set in at very high debt ratios, where the 
required adjustment needs to be large over a long period. Finally, the 
proximity of 
elections
 tends to reduce the responsiveness
 of fiscal policy to larger debt bu
rdens
. 
 Third, and related to the 
points 
above, the theoretical and empirical literature 
suggests that high 
government 
debt burdens can ultimately impede long
-term 
growth.
3 This is particularly the case when debt is contracted to finance 
unproductive expen
ses or 
to build up 
public capital stock
s that exceed
 optimal 
                                                                    1  For

-maximising) levels
.4 While government debt
 can 
help to 
smooth 
consumption and 
finance 
lumpy investment, such 
financing
 is constrained 
above 
certain debt thresholds.
 A long body of research
5 finds that h
igh public debt can 
affect growth through the channels of sovereign spreads (confidence effects), 
crowding
-out of private investment, reduced capacity to finance future public 
investment, expansion of precautionary sav
ings (in anticipation of future tax hikes) 
and increased uncertainty. 
While country heterogeneity plays an important role, 
several 
studies reveal
 that, on average for a panel of advanced economies, 
detrimental growth effects may appear at levels of around 
80-100% of GDP.
6 Similar 
debt levels are found in the literature on early signals of sovereign distress. For 

instance, 
the debt sustainability analysis framework of the International Monetary 
Fund adopts a debt ratio of 85% of GDP to flag fiscal risks
 in a
dvanced economies, 
with a similar approach being followed in the European Commission
™s methodology.
7  The objective of k
eeping debt ratios at prudent levels, such as below the 
SGP
™s 60% threshold, 
makes it all the more important 
to create sufficient fiscal
 buffers to withstand adverse macroeconomic shocks and cope with the 
projected 
costs of ageing. 
Several studies in the literature distinguish between 
optimal or steady
-state debt ratios and risky debt levels or debt limits beyond 
which 
governments 
may 
defa
ult. In many of these studies, steady
-state debt ratios are 
estimated or calibrated at around (or below) 60% of GDP.
8 Arguably, such debt 
ratios are country
-specific and depend on a wide 
range
 of factors, such as the 
structural features of the economy and 
institutional factors. The amount of assets, 
especially liquid assets
, that governments hold as well as the maturity and ownership 

structure of government debt
 are also important determinants of the propensity of 
investors to hold or shun the debt of a giv
en sovereign. At the same time, d
ebt limits 
based on past data estimation do not usually take into account various sources of 

government contingent liabilities. 
Though 
the 
latest projections of age
-related public 
spending
 in the euro area indicate 
more fav
ourable 
developments compared with the 
past, the burden on public spending is still expected to be significant.

 Government debt reduction strategies in the euro area
 49 during episodes of financial stress, sufficient fiscal buffers are critical to underpin 
confidence in the sovereign
™s ability to safe
guard financial stability.
10 Overall, 
from a general policy perspective, existing evidence 
points to
 the 
importance of reducing 
high 
public debt to restore fiscal sustainability and 
support stronger fundamentals.
 While the empirical 
evidence suggests that 
the 
relationship between debt and growth is bi
-directional, with economic, financial and 
sovereign debt cris
es reinforcing each other
™s detrimental impact on output and 
welfare
, keeping debt ratios at prudent levels is essential to avoid further sovereign 

debt crises. 
 2.2
 Lessons from government debt reduction episodes 
 Various academic work
s have investigated large past debt reductions and 
found that a combination of debt
-reducing factors was needed
.11 In particular, 
these include 
fiscal adjustment, growth
-enhancing measures (
such as 
complementary 
structural reforms), 
a monetary policy stance
 that supports the 
recovery
 and typically also 
sizeable 
privatisation
 programmes.
  Sustained fiscal adjustment 
requires several elements.
 More
 specifically, 
debt 
consolidat
ions seem to be most successful when they are based on permanent cuts 
in current (non
-productive) expenditure
. Other important f
actors are a strengthening 
of institutions, 
including 
well
-designed
 rules
-based
 fiscal frameworks
, effective public 
administrati
on, as well as support from other policy areas, in particular a 
monetary 
policy
 oriented towards price stability and structural reforms which reinforce the 
potential of the economy to grow out of debt. In this context, Box 1 shows some 
stylised debt scenar
ios for the euro area which highlight how various factors 
Œ such 
as variations in potential growth and interest rates 
Œ impact on the accumulation of 
government debt.
 Past experience shows that many EU Member States have achieved significant 

primary surplu
ses over extended periods.
12 This holds true in particular for 
countries that 
were
 confronted with a 
high
 and rising government debt
-to
-GDP ratio

 Government debt reduction strategies in t
he euro area
 50 Stabilising and reducing 
government debt typically 
require
d a sustained upfront 
consolidation effort that allow
ed the achievement of large primary surpluses, which 
were 
maintained over an extended period of time.
 While the achievement of high 
primary surpluses may be more difficult in the current 
weak economic env
ironment, 
the 
benign 
interest rate conditions create fiscal savings, which should be used for 
debt reduction, especially in the case of high
-debt countries
. 
 Box 
1 Stylised debt scenarios for the euro area
 Public debt dynamics are det
ermined by three main factors, namely the 
ﬁsnowball
ﬂ effect, 
the government primary balance and the deficit
-debt adjustment
 (DDA)
. The standard debt 
accumulation equation summarises this as follows:
13  =1++
 The change 
in the government debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 ) in each period is expressed as the sum of 
the current primary balance
14 (), the snowball effect (first term on the right
-hand side
15), which 
captures the joint impact of interest payments on the accumulated 
stock of debt and of real GDP 
growth and inflation
 on the debt ratio (through the denominator). Finally, the deficit
-debt adjustment 
() relates to that part of the change in the debt
-to
-GDP ratio which is not reflected in the deficit. 
Such stock
-fl
ow adjustments may derive, 
for example
, from government financial transactions or 
privatisation receipts. 
DDAs played an important role during the financial crisis.
16  Deterministic
17 debt projections are commonly used to analyse fiscal policy scenarios and 
their impact on the accumulation of debt.
 In its 2015 Fiscal Sustainability Report
18, the European 
Commission presents medium
-term debt projections for EU Member 
States 
together with 
the 
aggregates for the EU and the euro area up to the year 2026. Among oth
ers, the report refers to a 
baseline scenario assuming no
 fiscal
 policy change as well as a scenario assuming compliance 
with the requirements of the preventive arm of the SGP. Building on the core assumptions 
underlying the Commission
™s 2015 Fiscal Sustai
nability Report, Chart 
A shows a number of debt 
scenarios for the euro area aggregate.
 The baseline scenario for the euro area assumes potential 
growth of 1.1% on average over the period 2016
-26, while GDP deflator growth would gradually 
increase from 1.2%
 in 2016 to 2% by 2020 and remain constant thereafter. The output gap would 
close by 2020. The implicit interest rate
19 is assumed to increase from 2.5% to 3.7% over the 
                                                                    13  For more details, see the article entitled ﬁEnsuring fiscal

 51 projection horizon. The baseline projections take into account the ageing
-related expen
diture 
increases as projected in the 
European
 Commission
™s 2015 Ageing Report.
 Under a no policy change assumption
, aggregate euro area debt as a 
percentage of 
GDP would decline from 
around 
94% in 2015 
to around 8
4% in the coming decade (see 
the 
blue line in C
hart
 A).20 This decline 
corresponds to an average annual decline of the 
debt ratio of around 1% of GDP between 2
016 and 2026. Around two
-thirds of the nominal 
adjustment would result from primary surpluses
, while the remainder would be related to an 
(on average
) debt-reducing
 snowball effect. The 
latter is
, however
, projected to 
become debt
-increasing
 towards the en
d of the projection 

horizon 
in 
relat
ion
 to the assumed increase in 
interest spending. At the same time, higher 
ageing
-related fiscal costs would gradually 
reduce primary surpluses. Both effects explain 

the flattening of the debt path in the second half 

of 
the projection horizon. The debt adjustment 
under the no
 policy change scenario for the euro area aggregate falls short of the 
requirement of 
the SGP
™s debt rule
 (see Section 3.2 for a description)
. 
 A 0.5 percentage point 
higher 
interest rate would put de
bt on an increasing path towards the 
end of the scenario horizon
 (see 
the yellow
 line in 
the c
hart).
 In this scenario
, the 
implicit 
interest rate on government debt is assumed to be 0.5 percentage point
 higher 
as of 201
7. 
Compared with the baseline 
scenario (see the blue line), the average debt adjustment over the 
period 2016
-26 would decline from around 1% to 0.5% of GDP. The less favourable debt dynamics 
would mainly relate to the fact that the snowball effect becomes debt
-increasing earlier than i
n the 
baseline, given that increases in the interest burden outweigh the debt
-reducing impact of nominal 
GDP growth.
 Structural adjustment in 
keeping
 with the requirements of the SGP
™s preventive arm would 
put the aggregate euro area debt ratio on a steepe
r declining path in line with the 
ﬁsufficiently diminishing
ﬂ requirements of the debt rule (see 
the red
 line in 
Chart
 A). According to the matrix of adjustment requirements under
 the
 preventive arm of the SGP
,21 the 
scenario assumes an annual improvement in
 the structural balance of 0.6% of GDP (as of 201
7) until a structural deficit target of 0.5% of GDP is reached. Such an adjustment would reduce the 
                                                                    20  The no policy change baseline scenario for the euro area builds on the assumptions from the European 
Commission
™s Fiscal Sustainability Report 2015. Up to 2017, t
he debt projections build on the 
European Commission
™s winter 2016 f
orec
ast
. As of 2018 (and up to 2026), potential growth is 
assumed to develop in line with the country
-specific paths agreed in the Economic Policy Committee
™s Output Gaps Working Group. Long
-term real interest rates are assumed to converge to 3%. Moreover, 
inf
lation
, as measured by the change in the GDP deflator, is assumed to converge to 2% by 2020 in 
parallel to the closing of the output gap
. The structural balance is assumed to be only affected by the 
cost of ageing 
Œ as projected in the 2015 Ageing Report 
Œ and assumed changes in interest spending.

meet
 the 
requirement of the SG
P™s debt rule. The larger debt adjustment compared 
with
 the no
 policy change 
baseline would result from a significantly larger average primary surplus of around 1
.5
% of GDP 
over the projection horizon.
 Assuming higher 
potential 
GDP growth results in a more
 favourable debt path (see 
the green 
line in 
the c

 In this scenario, the structural adjustment is combined with an increase in the 
growth rate of 
potential
 GDP 
by 0.5 percentage point
 as of 2016. 
Such an increase in potential GDP 
growth could be rela
ted, for example, to the implementation of structural reforms. 
As a result, the 
snowball effect becomes more negative, i.e. debt
-reducing, which results in an average annual 
decline in the debt of more than 2% of GDP per annum 
over 
the period 
2016-26. The 
related debt 
adjustment would be in line with the 
ﬁsufficiently diminishing
ﬂ requirement of the debt rule.
   3 The debt rule in the Stability and Growth Pact 
 3.1
 Developments in euro area government debt ahead of the crisis 
 In the years prior to the sovereign debt crisis, many euro area countries 
did
 not take advantage of the favourable economic 
and financial 
environment 
to 
build 
up 
fiscal buffers 
against
 adverse shocks.
 Strong but only transitory revenue 
growth, buoyed by an
 unsustainable rise in domestic demand, 
was perceived 
to be 
permanent
, 
trigger
ing
 increases in structural 
government expenditure. 
At the same 
time, in many countries sizeable falls in interest burdens in the run
-up to and in the 
early years of Economic and
 Monetary Union (EMU) were used largely for higher 
government expenditure rather than for reducing general government deficits and 
debt.
22 Hence, many euro area countries either made very little or no progress 
towards stronger underlying budgetary positions
. In a number of member countries, 
the structural balance actually deteriorated during this period of strong economic 
growth.
23 Consequently, while general government debt
-to
-GDP ratios declined in 
many euro area countries in the years ahead of the crisis, 
this decline fell 
significantly short of what would have been desirable under the favourable economic 

circumstances at that time. In fact, with the notable exception of Belgium, where the 

high government debt ratio declined by about twenty percentage point
s, several of 
the countries which posted the highest government debt ratios within the euro area 

at the start of the last decade recorded further increases (e.g. Portugal) or only very 

small declines (e.g. Greece and Italy) in government debt ratios over t
he period 
2000-07 (see Chart 1). Thus, even the boom period before the crisis did not trigger a 
trend decline in high government debt
-to
-GDP ratios. In 2007 a number of countries 
                                                                    22  See also

 54 When the EU
™s Stability and Growth Pact was implemented in 1997, it
s intenti
on was also to limit 
the deficit bias 
prevalent in many EU countries 
since 
the 1970s
. The tendency of governments to conduct fiscal policies 
in a 
short
-sighted 
manner with an insufficient focus on medium
-term spending pressures and long
-term 
fiscal sustain
ability
 induces
 pro
-cyclical
ity and 
rising government debt ratios.
24 The 
SGP therefore anchors the EU countries
™ decentralised fiscal policies based on the 
Maastricht Treaty
™s reference values for the government deficit and debt
-to
-GDP 
ratios of 3% and 60% 
of GDP, respectively. Furthermore, the 2005 reform of the 
SGP introduced, under its preventive arm, medium
-term budgetary objectives 
(MTO
s), which set country
-specific structural balance targets over the medium term. 
They are
 designed, inter alia, to 
ensure sustainable debt ratios by also taking 
account of the budgetary costs of ageing.
25  The Pact
™s debt criterion has effectively not been implemented since the start 
of EMU.
 First, monitoring the SGP
™s deficit criterion had been deemed sufficient by 
the
 European Commission and the European Council to steer countries
™ fiscal 
policies towards sustainable government debt positions.
26 This was one of the 
reasons why significant breaches of the 60% of GDP reference value over a 
prolonged period of time did not
 lead the Council to take procedural steps to ensure 
a return towards the Treaty
™s debt threshold. Second, the 
ﬁsufficiently diminishing
ﬂ requirement of the Treaty
27 had not been operationalised prior to the introduction of 
the debt reduction benchmark in 2
011. Third, large deviations from the benchmark 
structural effort requirement under the Pact
™s preventive arm to ensure sufficient 
progress towards sound fiscal positions were not penalised. In the absence of a 
correction mechanism for past fiscal slippage
s, all of this contributed to a piling
-up of 
government debt.
 Fiscal rules that target the level of government debt directly 
have the 
advantage 
of keep
ing
 track of past fiscal developments
. More specifically, 
developments reflected in changes in the primar
y budget balance, the evolution of 
interest spending as well as stock
-flow adjustments (such as government support to 
the financial sector) cumulate into changes in the level of government debt. 
Effectively enforced debt rules are therefore less prone to a
 ratcheting
-up of 
                                                                    24  See e.g. Hagen, 
J. von and Harden, I.
, ﬁBudget processes and commitment to fiscal discipline
ﬂ, European Economic Review
, Vol. 39, 1995. 
 25  MTOs are set by Member States according to country
-spec
ific circumstances. They must respect 
minimum values and are designed to serve three goals: (i) Member States maintain a safety margin 
that prevents them from breaching the 3% deficit reference value during cyclical downturns; 
(ii) Member States™ debts are
 sustainable taking into consideration the economic and budgetary impact 
of ageing populations
 (i.e. by in part frontloading projected ageing
-related increases in government 
spending, while ensuring long
-run convergence of the debt ratio to 60%)
; and (iii)
 Member States have 
room for budgetary manoeuvre, in particular when it comes to preserving public investment.

 The features of the SGP
™s debt rule 
 As a major lesson from the sovereign debt crisis, the EU Treaty
™s debt 
criterion was operationalised a
s part of the 
ﬁsix
-pack
ﬂ reforms which came 
into force in November 2011
. Article 126(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union foresees that compliance with budgetary discipline in the EU shall 
be monitored based on 
ﬁwhether the ratio of 
government debt to gross domestic 
product exceeds a reference
 value, unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and 
approaching the reference value at a
 satisfactory pace
ﬂ. In this vein, the debt rule 
operationalises the appropriate pace of convergence t
owards this level over the long 
term. According to Regulation (EU) No 1467/97, as amended by Regulation (EU) 

No 1177/2011, the debt
-to
-GDP ratio is regarded as diminishing sufficiently and 
approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace if the diffe
rential of the 
government debt
-to
-GDP ratio with respect to the 60% of GDP reference value 
declines by 1/20th on average over a period of three years as a benchmark for debt 
reduction. With this specification, the debt rule aims to ensure that countries wi
th 
larger fiscal imbalances, as reflected in higher government debt ratios, make greater 
efforts to ensure a return to safe debt positions. 
 The SGP
™s debt rule is assessed in three configurations
. One configuration is 
backward
-looking over the past three 
years, one is 
forward
-looking 
over the coming 
two years and one is 
adjusted
 for the impact of the economic cycle
. 
In principle, only 
if a country breaches the rule in all three configurations can a debt
-based excessive 
deficit procedure (EDP) be opened. 
For countries subject to an EDP on 8 November 
2011, when the debt rule entered into force
, transitional provisions apply for 
the 
three 
years following 
the
 correction of the excessive deficit. During this
 transition
al period
, the
se countries
 must progress suf
ficiently towards meeting the debt 
reduction 
benchmark 
(i.e. the 1/20th rule) 
at the end of that period
, to ensure it is fulfilled 
thereafter
. Progress 
within this transitional period 
is measured by the adjustment in 
the structural budget balance, 
which ha
s to be in line with 
the 
so-called 
minimum 
linear structural adjustment (MLSA).

ﬁfiscal compact
ﬂ as part of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic 
and Monetary Union, which was signed by most EU Heads of State or Government on 2 March 2012, 
entails
 a balanced budget rule including, in principle, an automatic correction m
echanism to be 
implemented in national law. 
Germany and Austria have legislated so
-called debt rules, which consist 
of a
 balanced budget rule
 with an 
automatic correction mechanism
 of past deviations from 
requirements under the rule

 56 The SGP
™s debt rule entails flexibility by 
taking into 
account relevant factors
. With regard to the preparation of reports under Article 126(3) of the Treaty on 
compliance with the debt criterion, the SGP foresees a number of relevant mitigating 
or aggravating factors that can be taken into account in case of non
-compliance with 
the d
ebt reduction benchmark. These factors include developments in the country
™s medium
-term economic position (including cyclical developments), developments in 
the medium
-term budgetary position (including 
the
 past track
 record of adjustment 
towards the 
MTO)
 as well as 
any other
 factors which, in the opinion of the Member 
State 
for which compliance with the debt criterion is being assessed
, are
 relevant to 

evaluate 
compliance 
(e.g. 
debt incurred in
 the form of bilateral and multilateral 
support between Member
 States
). 3.3
 Compliance with the SGP
™s debt rule so far 
 The 
SGP
™s debt rule 
has 
so far 
only 
been 
a binding constraint 
for a limited 
number of euro area countries
. Among the 14 countries that have recorded debt 
ratios above the 60% of GDP threshold since the 
debt rule entered into force, 
i.e.
 during the years 2012
-15, seven countries were in an EDP. These countries had 
to comply with the Council
™s recommendations to correct their excessive deficits. The 
remaining countries should conduct fiscal policies that e
nsure both sufficient 
progress towards the MTO under the SGP
™s preventive arm and comply with the 
debt rule to converge towards the Maastricht Treaty
™s government debt threshold.
32  For most euro area countries with elevated debt ratios, the debt rule has b
een 
less demanding than the Pact
™s preventive arm. 
In fact, since it entered into 
force, only for Belgium and Italy has the debt rule been a binding constraint for fiscal 
policies. As indicated by Table 1, for these two countries, the structural efforts 
required to comply with the debt rule (as reflected in the MLSA) were consistently 
above the 0.5% of GDP adjustment benchmark of the SGP
™s preventive arm. In line 
with the logic of the debt rule, the structural effort requirements were larger than for 
countr
ies with government debt ratios much closer to the 60% of GDP threshold. 
 Gaps 
in relation 
to the fulfilment of the debt rule have been 
growing, 
especially 
in countries with 
very 
high debt
. For both Belgium and Italy, the minimum linear 
structural adjustment increased gradually over the period under consideration. This 
reflects the debt rule
™s inherent mechanism to correct for past slippages in meeting 
debt rule requirements during the trans
itional period. At the same time, the other

  32  Countries that were subject to an EDP on 8 November 2011 are required to deliver a structural eff
ort 
over a transitional period of three years (i.e. the MLSA). Germany exited its EDP in 2011, Italy in 2012 
and Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria in 2013. Malta

2014, was issued after the six

 Notes: The table 
reviews compliance with the SGP
™s debt rule for the euro area countries. For example, Belgium
™s excessive deficit was corrected in 2013 and it entered the 
transitional period towards full compliance with the debt reduction benchmark in 2014. The three
-year
 transitional period thus started in 2014 and ends in 2016. Belgium
™s requirement under the debt rule is equal to an MLSA of an improvement in the structural balance of 0.7% of GDP in each year o
f the transitional period 2014
-16. In 2014, however, 
Belgium
™s structural balance deteriorated by 0.1% of GDP. The gap relative to the MLSA requirement thus rose to 0.8% of GDP in 2014. 
This gap was distributed evenly across the 
two remaining years of the transitional period, i.e. 2015 and 2016; consequently, the ML
SA rises from an original adjustment requirement of 0.7% of GDP, by 0.4 percentage point, to 
1.1% of GDP in 2015. In 2015 Belgium
™s structural balance is expected to have improved by 0.2% of GDP. The gap in relation to the MLSA of 1.1% of GDP in 2015 thus
 amounts to 
0.9% of GDP (i.e. 1.1% of GDP minus the effort of 0.2% of GDP delivered in 2015). 
 Shortfalls in structural efforts under the SGP
™s preventive arm
, combined with 
lower adjustment requirements due to the recent flexibility provisions, 
contributed
 to gaps in relation to compliance with the debt reduction 
benchmark (see also Box 2).
 In 2013 the 
Commission put forward ﬁcalendars of 
convergenceﬂ, i.e.
 country
-specific time frames for achieving MTOs by a specified 
year as a follow
-up to the 
Treaty on 
Stability, Coordination and Governance in the 
Economic and Monetary Union
, also known as the 
ﬁfiscal compact
ﬂ.33 The correction 
mechanism enshrined
 in the 
fiscal compact
, which should be triggered automatically 
at the national level in the event of a ﬁsigni
ficant deviationﬂ from the MTO or the 
adjustment path towards it, was 
supposed
 to ensure rapid convergence of countries 
towards 
their 
respective MTOs. However, 
as Chart 3 shows, progress towards 
the 
MTOs 
has not materialised as recommended at that time. In
 the case of Belgium, 
these shortfalls explain the gaps vis
-à-vis full compliance with the debt rule. In the 
same vein, had Italy improved its structural balance by about 1.5 percentage points 
from its level in 2012 to achieve its MTO of a balanced structu
ral budget in 2014 (as 
put forward in the calendar of convergence), the gap in relation to compliance with 
the debt rule would have almost closed. Instead, the achievement of MTOs was 
frequently postponed. This was also associated with the lower adjustment
 requirements deriving from increased 
flexibility 
under the SGP that was granted
 in 
                                                                    33  The deadlines for achieving the MTOs were set on the basis of the medium
-term budgetary plans 
presented in the 2013 update of the stability and convergence programmes and in line with the SGP.

2 The consistency of the SGP
™s preventive arm with the debt rule
 By construction, the requirements under the SGP
™s preventive arm are not necessarily 
consistent with those of the debt rule. 
The former aims at achieving 
and maintaining country
-specific MTOs
, which constitute the anchor of the preventive arm. The speed of convergence 
towards the MTO is determined by the matrix of adjustment requirements. The anchor of the SGP™s 
debt rule, on the other hand, is the 60% Trea
ty debt limit. Convergence towards this anchor should 

follow the 1/20th rule
, which requires that
 the differential with respect to the reference value be 
reduced at
 an average rate of one
-twentieth per year as a benchmark. As a result, the speed of 
adjustm
ent under the preventive arm and the debt rule can deviate. It is also not necessarily the 
case that the achievement of the country
-specific MTO ensures compliance with the debt rule.
35 In Belgium and Italy, sizeable deviations from the requirements of the 
(transitional) debt 
reduction benchmark
 emerged
. At the same time,
 both countries 
were 
considered broadly 
compliant with the preventive arm. 
In February 2015 the European Commission issued 
Article
 126(3) reports for Belgium and Italy which came to the conc
lusion that prima facie, i.e. 
                                                                    34  For further details, see the box entitled ﬁFlexibility within the Stability and Growth Pactﬂ,

 59 before considering all relevant factors, the debt criterion of the Treaty was not fulfilled in both cases 
given that the winter
 2015 forecast showed sizeable shortfalls vis
-à-vis the required structural 
adjustment. At the same
 time, both Belgium and Italy were expected to broadly comply with the 

required adjustment path towards the MTO
, which was considered a relevant factor for not opening 
debt-based EDPs in the two cases. The discrepancies between the assessment under the 
pre
ventive arm and the assessment of
 compliance with the SGP™s debt rule were related
 to a 
number of factors: (i) the adjustment requirements under the preventive arm were lower than the 

benchmark adjustment of 0.5% of GDP (owing to the use of the flexibility
 provisions in the case of 
Italy); (ii) the methodology to assess compliance under the preventive arm differs from the one used 

under the debt rule; and (iii)
 deviations from the debt reduction
 benchmark cumulate over time, 
while this is not the case for t
he preventive arm. 
 Illustrative d
ebt scenarios suggest that full compliance with the requirements of the 
preventive arm would enable Belgium and Italy to comply with the debt 
reduction 
benchmark as of 2019 (see 
the yellow
 lines in 
chart
s A and 
B). 
The ful
l compliance scenarios 
assume structural adjustment in line with the preventive arm matrix as of 2017 until the country
-specific MTO is reached.
 Belgium would accordingly improve the structural balance by 0.6% of 
GDP in the period
 2017-19 and comply with t
he forward
-looking debt reduction
 benchmark as of 
2019. As a result, government debt would be reduced by around 2
.5%
 of GDP on average per 
annum to around 80% of GDP in 2026. In the case of Italy, structural adjustments of 0.6% of GDP 
in 2017 and 2018 and 
0.5% of GDP in 2019 would be sufficient to comply with the forward
-looking 
debt reduction
 benchmark and the MTO by 2019. 
 Broad compliance with the requirements of the preventive arm would
, however,
 unduly 
postpone compliance with the 
forward
-looking 
debt 
reduction benchmark
 by one and 
four
 years in Italy and Belgium, respectively (see 
the 
red lines in 
chart
s A and 
B). 
The broad 
compliance scenarios incorporate the 0.25% of GDP deviation margin preventing procedural steps 
under the significant deviation pro
cedure of the preventive arm, i.e. structural adjustment 
requirements and the MTO are lowered by that amount.
36 In the case of Belgium, the
 0.25% of GDP
 lower adjustment would result in a postponement of the achievement of the MTO by three years to 
2025. Ac
cordingly, the debt path is
 flatter. For Italy, the 0.25% of GDP lower annual adjustment 
would postpone the achievement of the MTO by one year to 2020. 
 A structural adjustment of 1% of GDP towards the MTO would ensure compliance with the
 forward
-looking d
ebt 
reduction 
benchmark as of 2018 in Italy and Belgium, respectively (see 
the green 
lines in 
chart
s A and 
B). 
Under such a scenario
, Belgium would reach its MTO in 2020 
and reduce its debt to around 75% of GDP in 2026. In Italy
, a balanced budget position
 would be 
reached in 2018. Debt would decline to around 100% of GDP by 2026.
                                                                     36  The recent experience with the implementation of the SGP shows a tendency of Member States to 
internalise the 
deviation margin in their budgetary planning so as to avoid procedural steps. For 
example, in the 2016 round of draft budgetary plans
 (DBPs), only five out of twelve Member States 
subject to the preventive arm submitted a plan 
that was found to be complian
t with the requirements
, while the remaining countries were assessed to be b
roadl
y compliant or at risk of non
-compliance. 
However, 
no DBP 
was
 found 
to be in particularly serious non
-compliance and therefore rejected

 Typically, the debt rule is not a binding constraint for countries with lower debt ratios that 
have reached their MTO. 
Charts C and D show a number of debt scenarios for Germa
ny and 
Austria. The former currently over
-achieves its MTO so
 that the no policy change baseline scenario 
implies a decline in the debt ratio which is larger than what would occur under preventive arm 

compliance.
37 The average decline in the debt ratio in t
he period 2016
-26 is also larger than the
 1/20th debt reduction benchmark (see the
 red line in Chart C).
38 In the case of Austria, maintaining 
the MTO over the 2016
-26 horizon would require some structural adjustment (relative to the 
baseline). The debt path under the preventive arm compliance scenario therefore shows a larger 

average decline in the debt ratio
 (see Chart D).

rio for Germany assumes a gradual loosening of the structural 
balance until the MTO is reached and maintained as of 2018.

the difference between debt i
n the previous year and 60% of GDP.

 Procedural enforcement of the SGP
™s debt rule
 So far
, one EDP 
has been
 based on the debt criterion
. 
In May 2013 the Council 
issued an EDP for Malta and recommended an annual structural adjustment effort of 
0.7% of GDP in 2013 and 2014
 to ensure the deficit was brought to 2.7% of GDP in 
2014, in line with the debt rule. The EDP was abrogated in a timely manner by the 
2014 EDP deadline, which necessitated as a procedural prerequisite compliance 

with the forward
-looking debt rule.
 The con
sideration of 
relevant 
mitigating factors
 has so far prevented the 
opening of an EDP for Italy and Belgium despite significant (cumulative) gaps 

vis
-à-vis the requirements of the transitional debt rule.
 The Commission
™s Article
 126(3) 
reports 
for 
Belgium and 
Italy
, which were prepared in the light of 
significant gaps vis
-à-vis the requirements, concluded that the countries were 
at that 
time 
compliant with the debt criterion. T
he Commission
, in its assessment,
 found 
three 
factors
 which were deemed t
o account for the shortfalls vis
-à-vis the MLSA 
requirements.
39 First, both countries were assessed to be in (broad) 
compliance with 
the preventive arm™s structural effort requirements
 (see also Box 2). Second, the 
reports considered 
unfavourable economic c
onditions 
related, in particular, to low 
inflation and real negative growth (in the case of Italy). As Box 3 shows, low growth 
and inflation do indeed affect debt dynamics adversely and thus render compliance 
with the debt reduction benchmark more difficul
t. Third, the reports considered the 
                                                                    39  Relevant factors can be taken into account in the debt rule irrespective of the magnitude of the 
deviation from the benchmark. 
By 
contrast, for countries with debt ratios above 60% of GDP
, relevant 
factors cannot be 
taken into account for a deficit
-based EDP, unless the breach of the reference value 
is temporary and small

 62 expected implementation of 
growth
-enhancing 
structural reforms. 
However, the 
reports did not quantify how they expected the structural reforms to ease the debt 
burden over time.
 To 
account for
 mitigating factors 
transpa
rently 
when assessing compliance 
with 
the debt criterion
, these factors need to be quantified based on commonly 
agreed methodologies
. The above
-mentioned 
relevant 
mitigating factors taken into 
account in the cases of Italy and Belgium indeed appear to have
 been of particular 

relevance for the assessment of compliance with the debt criterion as they 
made 
these countries
™ delivery of
 the structural effort required to comply with the debt 
reduction benchmark more difficult
. However, the Article 126(3) reports 
do not 
attribute the entire gap in relation to the debt reduction benchmark to the individual 
mitigating factors that have been taken into account. 
The related lack of 
transparency risks undermining the consistent implementation of the debt rule and 
thereb
y its effectiveness and credibility. Thus, relevant factors should be quantified in 
the analysis and should explain the gap vis
-à-vis the requirements under the debt 
rule in full. To this end, t
he assessment of compliance with the debt criterion 
should 
be based on 
a method that 
quantifies the individual impacts of relevant factors such 
as low growth and inflation as well as the implementation of structural reforms and 
their contribution to the occurrence of shortfalls vis
-à-vis the requirements of the debt 
reduction benchmark in a transparent manner.
40 A sound methodological framework 
to do so should be 
agreed 
upon ex ante and 
applied 
consistent
ly over time.
 In the 
absence of such a transparent and coherent implementation, there is a risk that the 
debt rule w
ill be side
-lined.
  Box 
3 The impact of low inflation and growth on the requirements of the debt rule
 Negative inflation surprises tend to make compliance with the requirements of the debt rule 
more demanding in the short
 term
. 
Government revenues 
typically adjust faster to price changes 
than primary expenditure
. The former tend to 
evolve broadly in line with
 inflation developments
 depending on the speed of adjustment of the respective tax bases, whereas,
 for government 
expenditure, ceilings 
are 
typ
ically 
set ahead of actual
 implementation
 so that inflation surprises 
would not immediately lead to an adjustment.
 Fiscal balances therefore
 tend to be adversely 
affected by unanticipated declines in inflation. At the same time, to the extent that interest
 payments 
are sensitive to short
-term inflation developments, e.g. in the case of inflation
-indexed bonds or 
variable rate debt, a 
negative
 inflation surprise may drive down interest spending, counteracting the 
adverse impact on the primary b
alance. In its
 Report on Public Finances in EMU 2015
41, the 
European Commission analysed the impact of the negative inflation surprise of 2014 in EU Member 
States. The analysis suggests that
 the
 impact on fiscal balances was rather low on average.
42 At 
                                                                    40  See also the article entitled 
ﬁThe short
-term fiscal implications of structural reforms
ﬂ, Economic Bulletin
, Issue 7, ECB, 2015, which stresses
 the importance of quantifying the short
-term costs of structural 
reforms in the context of the SGP
™s structural reform clause. This is to ensure that this clause, which 
was broadened by the Commission communication on SGP flexibility in January 2015, is a
pplied in a 
way that preserves fiscal sustainability and the credible application of the SGP provisions.

 42  According to th
e analysis, the semi
-elasticity of government deficits to a 1
 percentage 
point
 deflationary 
surprise 
amounts to 
around 0.1% of GDP in the first year and 
less than
 that in the second year.

 63 the same time,
 and more importantly,
 unanticipated declines in inflation accelerate the 
accumulation of government debt through a denominator effect, thereby making compliance with 
the debt 
reduction 
benchmark more demanding. 
If low inflation is accompanied by weak real grow
th 
(or a contraction of real GDP) compliance with the debt rule is rendered more difficult. Weak or 
negative real growth will adversely affect debt dynamics through a larger snowball effect and the 
negative cyclical impact on the primary balance.
 Both in 
Belgium and Italy
, structural adjustment in 2014 and 2015 
Œ according to the 
European Commission
™s winter 2016 forecast
 Œ fell significantly short of the requirements 
of the (transitional) debt rule
. 
In Belgium, the structural fiscal position loosened in 2
014, while an 
adjustment of 0.7% of GDP was required. Despite some adjustment in 2015, the shortfall compared 

with the debt rule requirement was significant in that year (i.e. larger than 0.25% of GDP) (see 
Chart A). In the case of Italy (see Chart B), the
 structural adjustment of 0.4% of GDP in 2013 fell 
somewhat short of the MLSA when considering the 0.25% of GDP deviation margin. However, large 
deviations have occurred in 2014 and 2015.

 Shortf
alls vis

remain
 significant 
both 
in Belgium and Italy 
when netting out the impact of low inflation and negative growth. 
Mechanical simulations 
suggest that the adjustment requirements under the transitional debt rule react 
sensitively to 
changes in inflation and growth.
43 In the case of Belgium, assuming GDP deflator growth of 2% as 
of 2014 would reduce the debt rule requirements in 2014 and 2015 by around 0.2% of GDP per 
annum (see Chart A). The average structural adjustment of 0.1% of GDP in the period 2014
-15, however
, falls significantly short of debt rule requirements adjusted for the impact of low inflation (of 
                                                                    43  The simulations were conducted on
 the basis of the methodological framework for computing the 
MLSA 
for the application of the debt criterion in the transition
al
 period
, as laid out in the 
ﬁVade mecum 
on the Stability and Growth Pact
ﬂ (see 
http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2013/pdf/ocp151_en.pdf
). Only 
the denominator effect of higher GDP deflator growth is taken into account given the small size of direct
 effects on headline deficits.

 64 0.7% of GDP on average in the period 2014
-15). For Italy, in addition to the assumption of higher 
GDP deflator growth as of 2014, the simulations assume real G
DP growth of zero in 2014 (while 
real GDP actually contracted in that year). This reduces the adjustment requirements under the 
debt rule by around half between 2013 and 2015 (see Chart B). The actual adjustment in 2013 is 

broadly in line with the requirem
ent under the debt rule adjusted for negative growth and low 
inflation. However, the structural adjustment in the period 2014
-15 falls significantly short of the 
average adjusted requirement under the debt rule (of around 0.7% of GDP).
  4 Conclusions 
 The r
eduction of 
the government debt overhang in the euro area re
mains a key 
policy priority. 
The aggregate debt level continues to exceed
 90% of GDP
 Œ well 
above the 60% of GDP 
reference value
 of the Treaty. 
The 
stylised debt scenarios 
presented in this article
 show that fiscal adjustment in line with the requirements of 

the Stability and Growth Pact 
would 
within a decade contribute to a sizeable 
reduction of the euro area government debt ratio, bringing it closer to the reference 
level. In the absence of such f
iscal action, the downward debt adjustment would be 
much more limited, owing mainly to mounting ageing
-related spending pressures 
and rising interest spending.
 At the Member State level, convergence towards sound fiscal positions and 

sustainable debt level
s will be crucial to regain fiscal buffers and increase 
economic resilience. 
The SGP
™s debt reduction benchmark 
Œ introduced in the 
context of the 2011 six
-pack of reforms to operationalise the debt criterion 
Œ constitutes an appropriate framework to guide
 the reduction of still very high debt 
ratios in many Member States
. While providing a numerical benchmark for the pace 
of debt reduction, it explicitly takes into account cyclical conditions and provides 
additional flexibility through the consideration of
 relevant 
mitigating factors which 
hinder the required adjustment.
 The 
SGP
™s debt rule 
was introduced as 
a major lesson from the 
European 
sovereign 
debt crisis and should be applied 
rigorous
ly.
 Siz
eable deviations from 
the requirements of the transitional 
debt rule have so far not led to the opening of 
debt-based EDP
s owing
 to the consideration of relevant mitigating factors.
 Looking 
ahead, it should be ensured that compliance with the requirements of the debt 
reduction benchmark is not unduly delayed.
 The 
application 
of the debt rule 
needs to
 be based 
on a well
-defined
 and 
transparent 
methodological framework 
in order 
to ensure a consistent 
implementation across countries and over time.
 In particular, only quantifiable 
relevant factors should be taken into 
account when assessing compliance with the 
debt criterion. A proper quantification 
of the 
impact of relevant 
mitigating 
factors and 
their contribution to the occurrence of shortfalls vis
-à-vis the requirements of the debt 
reduction 
benchmark 
will increase 
the transparency of the underlying analysis. As a 
result, the scope for discretion in the application of the debt rule would be reduced, 
which would support a more effective implementation
. ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 3 / 2016 
Œ Article
 Government debt reduction strategies in the euro area
 65 The 
experience with 
past 
debt reduction
 episodes suggests that bri
nging 
down high levels of government debt requires complementary policy action. 
The price stability
-oriented m
onetary policy 
already 
supports economic activity
. It 
should be complemented by further effective structural reforms to increase the euro 
area
™s g
rowth potential. Moreover, fiscal adjustment can contribute decisively to 
helping countries grow out of government debt. To this end, f
iscal policies
 should 
remain in compliance with the fiscal rules of the
 SGP
. At the same time, all countries 
should striv
e for a more growth
-friendly composition of 
their budgetary 
policies.
 By 
converging towards lower levels of government debt and regaining fiscal buffers, the 

euro area will increase its resilience and fiscal space to cope with potentially adverse 
economic 
shocks in the future.
