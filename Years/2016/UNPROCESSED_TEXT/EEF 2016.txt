FOREWORD
While growth is continuing at a moderate rate in Europe, significant parts of the world economy are
grappling with major challenges. Growth in the euro area in 2016 is expected to continue, but the
recovery is slow, both in historical perspective and compared to other advanced economies. While the
renewed drop in energy prices should continue to boost households’ real incomes and consumption,
public consumption has surprised on the upside due to the arrival of unprecedented numbers of migrants
fleeing war and insecurity in Syria and elsewhere. Fiscal policy more generally is expected to support the
recovery this year, and monetary conditions are set to remain highly accommodative. However, despite
the continued confluence of supporting factors, the acceleration of economic activity expected this year is
minor: GDP in the euro area is forecast to expand by 1.7% compared to 1.6% last year. Growth should
pick-up further to 1.9% in 2017 but this will depend crucially on a rebound in investment, which has so
far remained elusive and is sensitive to the materialisation of the risks surrounding the central scenario.
The world economy has been slowing down. Its growth in 2015 is estimated at only 3%, and the expected
recovery is rather shallow and surrounded by risks. While the largest advanced economies are
experiencing continuing recoveries or maturing cycles, many emerging market economies are facing a
very difficult outlook. For China, this forecast projects a gradual slowing of GDP growth and a smooth
‘rebalancing’ towards a more sustainable and consumption-driven growth model. Even so, the drop in
China’s external trade has left its mark on world trade growth, affecting mostly other emerging and
developing economies. The central scenario of a ‘soft landing’ in China is subject to substantial risks.
Concerns about the Chinese economy have sparked two bouts of global financial market volatility in the
past half-year. Other emerging markets are exposed - to varying degrees - to financial vulnerability,
heightened by the turn of the interest-rate cycle in the US and the dollar’s appreciation; to structural
weaknesses; geopolitical tensions; and the sharp drop in a wide range of commodity prices.
The European economy has so far been able to weather the less supportive external environment.
Nonetheless, downside risks stemming from the world economy and global financial markets are large
and numerous. On the domestic side, the extension of favourable conditions has created upside risks to
growth in the near term, but policy-related challenges and downside risks have also increased. They
include policy reactions to migration and security threats, which could put further pressure on the
Schengen system as well as uncertainty surrounding further implementation of much-needed reforms.
Uncertainty about the outlook for external and domestic demand is the biggest impediment to the pick-up
in investment that is needed to sustain the recovery and reverse the downward trend in potential growth.
Prudent policy at this stage requires a steady hand reducing uncertainty and stepping up the much needed
structural reforms as well as a readiness to respond to any materialisation of the sizeable downside risks.
The weak external environment reinforces the need for a more resolute rebalancing towards domestic
demand, particularly investment. But the main risks both externally and domestically are ‘political’.
Leadership at the global and European level showing that common actions are agreed and swiftly
implemented would be the most effective answer to the present economic woes.

OVERVIEW:

WEATHERING NEW CHALLENGES

Moderate recovery
continues amid
heightened risks

The European economy remains supported by a number of positive factors
such as oil prices, euro’s exchange rate and financing costs which have
stimulated exports and private consumption. Investment, however, remains
hampered by economic and policy uncertainty and in some countries,
excessive debt. Now, as it enters its fourth year of recovery, the European
economy is facing headwinds and substantial risks from the slowdown in
emerging economies. Economic growth strong enough to reduce
unemployment substantially has so far failed to materialise and evidence of a
reinvigoration of investment, which is crucial for the sustainability of the
recovery, remains limited.

Tailwinds should
support economic
activity for longer…

The euro area’s economic recovery remains moderate despite the substantial
support from these positive factors that are now likely to be somewhat
stronger and longer lasting than previously expected. In particular, driven
mainly by abundant supply, the oil price has slipped again and is now
assumed to remain markedly lower and to rebound later than in the autumn
forecast. While this should support a further increase in the purchasing power
of euro area households, it is also likely to delay the rebound of inflation
from its current very low level and to put additional financial pressure on
commodity-exporting countries. Fiscal policy in the euro area is becoming
slightly more supportive to growth, largely due to government expenditures
associated with the inflow of asylum seekers in some Member States. The

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

external value of the euro has somewhat fallen over the last months,
especially against the US dollar, which should be helpful for euro area
exporters. Additionaly, measures taken by the European Central Bank in
December mean that financing costs in the euro area should remain low for a
longer period of time than earlier expected. Meanwhile, the boost from these
factors is increasingly being offset by a worsening global environment, and
some legacy issues from the crisis (mainly high levels of policy uncertainty,
debt and unemployment) continue to weigh on growth.
…but growth is
expected to increase
only gradually amid
headwinds and
legacies of the crisis.

GDP in the euro area is forecast to accelerate slightly from 1.6% in 2015 to
1.7% this year, which is a notch lower than forecast in the autumn. Once
global economic activity starts to rebound, positive effects should be felt later
in 2016 and 2017. Also, some of the structural reforms implemented in
Member States should continue to have a positive impact on growth. As
legacies of the crisis recede, consumption and investment should benefit.
Although debt levels remain high in some parts of the economy, easy
financing conditions should limit acute deleveraging pressures. Overall, euro
area GDP growth should pick up further to 1.9% in 2017.

Global GDP growth in
2015 is set to have
been at its weakest
since 2009…

The outlook for global GDP growth has again deteriorated and risks have
increased considerably, mainly due to the intensified downturn in emerging
markets. Global economic growth outside the EU is expected to have slowed
from 3.7% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2015. It is now forecast to recover gradually to
3.6% in 2016 and 3.8% in 2017; lower than expected in the autumn.
Developments in China have so far been broadly consistent with a
‘rebalancing’ scenario, since policy stimulus, combined with buoyant private
consumption and services, have so far counterbalanced the recessionary
developments in sectors where unsustainable expansion had led to the buildup of major imbalances. Turmoil in China’s still relatively under-developed
financial markets should in principle trigger only limited spillovers to the real
economy, but as an accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to
remain in place, pressure on capital flows and the renminbi will persist. The
relatively smooth structural adjustment assumed over the forecast horizon is
consistent with a gradual recovery of trade and a slowing in Chinese GDP
growth from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.2% in 2017, as forecast in the autumn, but
this is subject to major and increasing risks.

…and prospects for
emerging economies
have worsened…

2

Growth prospects for most commodity-exporting regions have worsened as
prices of a wide range of commodities remain depressed. In many regions,
this negative terms-of-trade shock has interacted with net capital outflows
and considerably tighter financial conditions. This is due partly to the US
Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates but also to a combination of
looming fiscal and political problems, geopolitical instability, and
supply-side constraints. Even though a gradual normalisation of US monetary
policy without any serious upheavals is assumed, the financial environment
in most emerging and developing economies looks likely to become more
challenging. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply for Russia and
Brazil as well as for countries in the Middle East, Northern Africa and
Sub-Saharan Africa. All in all, the downturn in emerging markets is still
expected to have bottomed out in 2015, but the forthcoming recovery is set to
be more subdued and drawn-out than forecast in the autumn and surrounded
by heightened risks.

Overview

…while advanced
economies are
relatively resilient…

The outlook for advanced economies has only marginally weakened since the
autumn. Throughout the forecast horizon, advanced economies appear
relatively immune and are likely to benefit from the gradual recovery of trade
in China, though many commodity exporters remain vulnerable to the
renewed wave of commodity price declines. Economic momentum in the US
has remained robust and GDP growth is expected to be around 2.5% over the
forecast horizon amid a maturing cycle, with more support from fiscal policy,
but continued headwinds from the strong dollar and the gradual normalisation
of monetary policy. In Japan, as expected, growth should pick up again this
year before slowing in 2017, mainly as a result of a planned consumption tax
hike.

…and world trade is
expected to gradually
recover.

Available data for 2015 suggest that global trade volumes, and in particular
non-EU trade, grew at their slowest pace since 2009, as the slowdown in
Chinese trade and commodity-exporting regions (e.g. CIS, MENA) quickly
spilled over to other emerging markets. Imports globally (excluding the EU)
are expected to recover somewhat more slowly than in the autumn from 0.8%
in 2015 to 2.9% and 3.7% in 2016 and 2017, as global activity picks up and
China’s demand for services imports remains strong amid its rebalancing
towards consumption. Further support should also come from the continued
recovery in advanced economies including the EU. These developments
should in turn underpin an acceleration of euro area export markets.

Volatility has
increased in financial
markets ….

Increasing concerns about growth prospects in emerging economies have
triggered bouts of volatility in global financial markets in recent months. In
Europe, asset prices declined substantially at the start of the year given the
uncertainty about how the growth outlook would be impacted by a further
weakening of economic activity in China and other emerging markets.

…as well as monetary
policy divergence…

Monetary policy divergence between central banks increased at the end of
2015. On one side, the ECB and the Bank of Japan decided to further ease
their monetary policy given subdued inflationary pressures, while on the
other side, the US Federal Reserve raised its target range for the federal funds
rate for the first time since June 2006. This divergence of monetary policy
stances has contributed to a weakening of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar
since the autumn. Signals from the Fed point to a faster tightening pace over
2016 and 2017 than financial markets had expected, while the ECB has
signalled its intention to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary
accommodation and its readiness to loosen policy further, if needed, over the
course of the year.

…while financial
conditions are set to
remain favourable for
longer.

The combination of quantitative easing and credit easing by the ECB has
successfully kept financing costs and yields at low levels and thereby helped
to reduce financial fragmentation and differences among Member States. The
euro area lending cycle to both households and non-financial corporates
(NFCs) is now in positive territory, suggesting that transmission of
accommodative monetary policies to the real economy has improved.
Surveys point to further improvements in the availability of bank lending and
a loosening of funding constraints to euro area SMEs. As funding on capital
markets has continued to increase, the cycle of external corporate funding is
picking up, although it remains weak compared with previous cycles,
mirroring low investment demand and the still-intensive use of internal funds
by NFCs. This suggests that the corporate deleveraging process is still
ongoing. Since bank lending and market funding cycles are expected to
accelerate this year, both external and internal funds should be more easily
accessible to finance a rise in investment.

The recovery is
widespread across
Member States…

2015 is expected to go down as the first year since the crisis in which no
Member State reported a decrease in output. But substantial growth
differences persist, reflecting both structural features and different cyclical
positions. For example, differences in terms of openness to trade and the
geographical orientation of trading relationships, as well as the pass-through
of lower oil prices, could make a significant difference under current
conditions. In 2016, Member States should continue moving along a recovery
path, including Greece, where growth is set to pick up again in the course of
the year. In 2017 economic activity should be on the rise in all Member
States.

…mainly driven by
steady consumption
growth…

As expected, private consumption was supported last year by the rise in real
gross disposable incomes attributable to the fall in headline inflation and
improved labour market conditions. A further acceleration is foreseen this
year, and private consumption should continue to be the main growth driver,
supported by the expected acceleration in real disposable income driven by
low oil prices. Rising wages and salaries, thanks to higher employment,
somewhat stronger increases in profit and property-related incomes, as well
as higher transfers to households, should further support this steady growth of
consumption, although households are also expected to increase their saving
rate slightly this year. In 2017, however, private consumption growth will
likely slow down since household real disposable income growth is expected
to lose some momentum due to the forecast rise in inflation.

…and some positive
surprises from public
consumption…

Government consumption in 2015 now looks likely to have been more
supportive to growth than expected in the autumn, since security measures
and refugee-related expenditures in some countries are set to have led to
additional fiscal expenditures. Public consumption growth is projected to
slow marginally in 2016 and 2017 but spending projections associated with
the arrival of large numbers of migrants fleeing insecurity remain difficult to
ascertain.

…although investment
has so far failed to
rebound…

Investment has so far failed to emerge as a strong driver of the ongoing
recovery as it has been held back by the slowdown in growth momentum
outside the EU and the high level of economic and policy uncertainty.
Investment levels at the moment also appear to be not very sensitive to
changes in financing conditions. But, investment is expected to gradually
pick up in the near term as demand increases, capacity utilisation rates rise
and profit margins improve thanks to lower energy prices and funding costs.
Investment in equipment should rise on the back of higher demand and
modernisation needs and should also gradually benefit from the expected
rebound in global growth and the fading of deleveraging pressures. The
Investment Plan for Europe should also start to have a positive impact on
public and private investment. Construction investment, meanwhile, is
expected to benefit from rising real disposable incomes and very low
mortgage rates. High levels of household debt in some Member States,
however, will continue to prevent a stronger increase in construction
investment in 2016 but this should be a softer constraint in 2017.

…and net exports are
not expected to
support growth in the
short term…

The deterioration in the external environment started to have a visible impact
on euro area exports in the second half of 2015, offsetting the positive impact
of the euro’s depreciation. But thanks to improved price competitiveness,
which is largely the result of the euro’s past depreciation and the decline in
relative unit labour costs, and because foreign demand is expected to
strengthen; export growth should accelerate over the course of 2016 in line
with growth in export markets. However, the annual rate of growth of euro

Overview

area exports of goods and services looks set to be less than it was last year,
largely as a result of the low carry-over from the second half of 2015.
Imports, meanwhile, are expected to mirror developments in exports due to
the high import content of many export goods and because of the growth in
domestic demand. As a result, net exports are expected to have a negative
impact on GDP growth in 2016 that should turn neutral in 2017.
…while the external
surplus of the euro
area is set to remain
elevated…

In 2015, the strong increase in the current account surplus of the euro area
reflected a combination of falling import prices, a depreciation of the
exchange rate and subdued domestic demand. While remaining at historically
high levels, the euro area’s current account surplus, measured as a percentage
of GDP, is expected to slightly recede in 2016 and 2017, as domestic demand
is forecast to continue expanding and external demand is expected to rebound
more slowly. Additionally, the assumed increase in oil prices should lead to a
small deterioration in the terms of trade in 2017. The rebalancing within the
euro area that has been observable over the last few years is likely to slow,
mainly due to a weakening export performance in some of the former deficit
countries.

…and lower oil prices
drive inflation down
this year.

With energy prices falling sharply, inflation in the euro area struggled to rise
much above zero towards the end of 2015. Core inflation also remained
below expectations and is now forecast to take longer to pick-up in tandem
with increased domestic demand. This persistent weakness reflects the fact
that the euro area continues to operate at below potential and that wage
developments remain subdued. Even though the output gap is projected to
continue closing over the forecast horizon and wages are expected to grow
stronger, the remaining output gap will continue to dampen the
responsiveness of inflation to increases in domestic demand. The forecast for
inflation in 2016 has therefore been revised lower to 0.5%. With the assumed
path of commodity prices, inflation should remain very low in the first half of
the year before stepping up in the second half when positive base effects
come to dominate. In 2017, inflation is expected to reach 1.5% as a result of
the impact of higher real wages and domestic demand, and a moderate
assumed increase in oil prices.

The fiscal stance is
expected to become
more supportive to
the recovery in the
euro area...

The general government deficit is expected to continue declining over the
forecast horizon, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in recent years due to
the fiscal expenditures associated with the arrival of asylum-seekers in a few
countries and to fiscal policy measures adopted by some Member States to
lower the tax wedge on labour. The operation of automatic stabilisers and, to
a lesser extent, the lower interest expenditure, underpin the projected deficit
reduction. In 2015, the general government deficit in the euro area is
expected to have declined to 2.2% of GDP and is set to decrease further to
1.9% and 1.6% in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The estimated structural
balance has remained broadly stable in 2015, while the euro area's fiscal
stance is expected to be slightly expansionary in 2016. Next year, under a nopolicy-change assumption, the structural balance is projected to remain
broadly stable in both the euro area and the EU. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the
euro area is forecast to decline from its peak of 94.5% in 2014 to 91.3% in
2017.

…and labour markets
continue to recover…

The improvement in labour market conditions continues with the moderate
economic recovery underpinning a modest rise in employment growth.
Overall, employment is expected to have risen by 1.1% in the euro area in
2015 and is projected to continue at about the same speed this year and next
on the back of strengthening economic activity, improved business

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

confidence and higher capital accumulation. Higher labour market flexibility
and moderate wage increases are also expected to contribute to employment
growth. The labour force is forecast to pick up more strongly than previously
expected in the euro area, largely driven by higher participation rates as a
result of improved economic and labour market conditions, the fading of
discouragement effects, and net migration flows. Unemployment rates are
then set to continue their gradual decline over the next two years but at a
slower pace than last year. The unemployment rate in the euro area is
projected to fall from 11% in 2015 to 10.5% in 2016 and 10.2% in 2017.
Unemployment is expected to decrease in almost all euro area countries this
year and next, especially in countries that have benefitted from recentlyimplemented labour market reforms (e.g. Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Ireland).
…but the outlook is
subject to increased
external and domestic
risks.

The economic outlook for the euro area remains highly uncertain and overall
risks are clearly tilted to the downside. Risks to the growth outlook from the
global economy and global financial markets have clearly increased, in
particular due to the slowing growth in China and other emerging markets,
which could trigger stronger spillovers than envisaged or which could
become worse than forecast. Combined with the uncertainty regarding the
adjustment in China, the continuation of monetary policy normalisation in the
US could have a more negative impact on vulnerable emerging market
economies, especially those with high levels of foreign currencydenominated debt, and could also affect the stability of financial markets.
The materialisation of any of these downside risks would result in negative
spillovers to the Member States via various transmission channels.
Uncertainty around the technical projection for the oil price remains high due
to geopolitical tensions, the removal of sanctions against Iran and the
response of oil producers with break-even costs above current spot prices.
While a faster-than-assumed rebound in energy prices would hurt economic
activity in Europe, a further sharp fall in commodity prices could also impact
negatively on its growth outlook as it could affect the financial stability of
oil-exporting countries. This would not only lower European exports but
could also trigger turmoil in financial markets. Geopolitical tensions are also
keeping uncertainty at high levels and could become a larger impediment to
investment spending than currently expected.
In Europe, domestic risks have also increased lately. Any unexpected relapse
into crisis in Greece could weigh more heavily on investment decisions and
thus on economic growth. Moreover, if major political challenges were not
successfully coped with at the EU level (e.g. handling of migration flows),
that could trigger developments that become impediments to growth.
Still, the combination of tailwinds from low commodity prices, low financing
costs, and the euro’s depreciation could be stronger than expected or translate
into stronger economic growth momentum than currently envisaged.

WEATHERING NEW CHALLENGES

A mild recovery in the euro area surrounded by risks
Amid increased concerns about the global outlook, the economic recovery in the euro area has entered
its fourth year and prospects for a continuation remain overall favourable. The good news is that the
economy appears to have so far weathered the recent deterioration in external conditions. Forces of
acceleration and deceleration have evolved fairly evenly since the autumn forecast and the growth
outlook looks on balance little different.
Factors which supported the strengthening of growth in 2015, such as oil prices, financing costs and the
euro’s exchange rate, look likely to remain supportive for longer than previously assumed. At the same
time, however, negative factors including slower growth in China and other emerging market
economies, the softness of global trade and high geopolitical tensions, are having an increasingly
negative effect on growth. Domestically, the fiscal stance has become slightly more growth-supportive,
partly as a result of higher fiscal expenditures linked to unprecedented levels of migration. But legacy
issues from the crisis, including high levels of public and private debt and deleveraging by households
and companies in some Member States, still weigh on growth, although less so and with diminishing
strength. Overall, the euro area economy is expected to have grown by 1.6% in 2015 (1.9% in the EU)
and is forecast to grow by 1.7% in 2016 (1.9% in the EU) and by 1.9% in 2017 (2.0% in the EU).
Labour market conditions continue to improve and the strengthening recovery in the euro area should
provide the basis for further net job creation and a lower unemployment rate, which is expected to
decline from 11.0% in 2015 to 10.5% in 2016 and 10.2% in 2017. Inflation, which again turned out
lower than expected due to falling oil prices, is expected to pick up very gradually. Domestic price
pressures remain limited and base effects from energy prices are now set to occur later than expected in
the autumn last year. This suggests a longer period of low inflation (0.0% in 2015, 0.5% in 2016, and
1.5% in 2017).
While the central scenario remains one of moderate recovery, risks to the growth outlook have risen and
remain predominantly to the downside. Externally, on top of risks to the smooth ‘rebalancing’ of the
Chinese economy, the normalisation of US monetary policy also carries downside risks for emerging
markets, especially those with high dollar-denominated debts. The sharp fall in oil prices has intensified
risks for some oil-exporting economies. At home, the search for yield amid very low interest rates has
increased risks to financial stability. Several recent developments (e.g. public security measures and
expenditures linked to asylum seekers) imply upside risks to short-term growth as they may raise public
expenditure more than currently envisaged. However, economic and political uncertainty has risen and
could more negatively impact on confidence, thereby negatively affecting domestic demand, notably
investment. Risks to the inflation outlook are considered broadly balanced.

PUTTING THE WINTER FORECAST INTO
PERSPECTIVE: GLOBAL FACTORS AND THE
EURO AREA

Domestic demand remains the main driver of the
euro area recovery, but its strength has come
increasingly under the influence of global factors.
This section complements the regular analysis of
the external environment (see Section I.2) by
looking at the impact of global factors on the
economic outlook in the euro area, including the
renewed decline in oil prices; the further slowing
of growth in China, the broad-based downturn on
other emerging market economies; and the gradual
normalisation of monetary policy in the US.
The renewed fall in oil prices...

...slowing growth in China and less dynamic
global trade...

Since mid-August 2015, market attention on
slowing economic growth in China appears to have
increased, as changes in the currency regime were
introduced, the Chinese currency depreciated visà-vis the US dollar (2) (see Graph I.4), and sharp
losses in the Chinese equity market were observed
(see Section I.2). However, the latter is expected to
have had only limited effects on China's real
economy so far because equities make up only a
small proportion of household assets and play only
a small role in corporate finance.

renminbi and euro/USD

Since mid-2014, oil prices have been on a
downward trajectory, interrupted only by a brief
rebound in the first half of last year. In January
2016, oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels in
more than ten years. The decline results from an
oversupplied market, partly reflecting new
extraction methods (e.g. fracking), but also
producers’ determination to defend their market
shares instead of adjusting supply. The long period
of decline is exceptional by historical standards
(see Graph I.3), but follows a rather long period
with upward movements. (1)

China’s GDP growth had already been slowing
down for some time as the economy had started a
‘rebalancing’ from a credit- and investment-led
growth pattern towards consumption and services.
In the second half of 2015, it continued slowing
slightly further. Meanwhile China has recorded a
sharp fall in the growth of merchandise imports
and a less marked decline in export growth, which
have been among the factors of lower world trade
momentum in the first half of last year. (3)

outlook in successive Commission forecasts
(Graph I.5).

...the first Fed rate hike in nine years...

In December 2015, the US Federal Reserve
decided to raise the target range for the federal
funds rate (see Section I.3). This decision marked
the end of a long period during which rates had
been left unchanged. While the US central bank
emphasised in its communication that the federal
funds rate would be only gradually increased, the
FOMC members' forecasts of the appropriate
federal funds rate over the 2016 and 2017 signalled
more tightening than financial markets had
expected before the December meeting. This
underlines the possibility of more pronounced
monetary policy divergence between the US and
the euro area, which remains one of the
determinants of the external value of the euro.
...and increased geopolitical tensions…

Geopolitical tensions have weighed on the euro
area outlook for some time, notably as regards the
continued conflict over Ukraine. While the trade
impact of sanctions against Russia and
countersanctions by Russia remained overall very
limited, it is felt in Member States with strong
economic ties with Russia. Compared to the
situation in the autumn, the war in Syria and Iraq
has escalated with more countries, including
Member States, involved. The impact of recent
terrorist attacks and terror alerts on demand, trade
and economic sentiment is still hard to quantify.
Increased geopolitical tensions have also
contributed to an unprecedented inflow of refugees
and asylum seekers into the EU. (5)
...and a deteriorating global outlook.

The euro area recovery is benefitting from
lower oil prices…

Overall, lower oil prices are expected to be a boon
to global economic growth as they initiate a
redistribution of wealth from oil exporting
economies to oil importing economies such as the
euro area. In the euro area they have benefited the
real disposable incomes of consumers via lower
energy costs and lower consumer price inflation.
Both effects were identified in 2015, but the
impact was not as strong as historical experiences
would have suggested. One prominent reason is
the inability of central banks to respond to lower
inflation by lowering policy interest rates, because
advanced economies were already close to the
nominal zero lower bound when the shock hit.
However, the ECB has since cut the deposit rate
further and started implementing quantitative
easing. The exceptional size of the oil price
decline, and the successive downward revision of
oil price assumptions (Graph I.6), now also raises
the question as to whether the stimulus to be
expected from a price decline from already low
levels may be smaller than that of the initial
decrease.

associated with credit to the energy sector (e.g.
high-yield borrowing in the US), and they affect
public finances and thus sovereign risk of oilexporting countries with possible spillovers to
yields in other countries. For instance, sovereign
wealth funds of some oil-exporting countries may
sell assets, which would lower prices and push
yields.

One impact of the oil price decline has been the
downward pressure on HICP inflation, which has
led to a sequence of downward revisions to the
inflation outlook for the euro area, as for instance
visible in the evolution of consensus forecast
means (see Graph I.7). The latest oil price decline
also results in a further downward revision of the
forecast for euro area HICP inflation.

The broad-based decline in commodity prices has
affected economic growth in commodity-exporting
countries, among them the G20 members
Australia, Canada, Brazil and Russia. The
economic outlook for commodity-exporting
countries has been successively revised down since
autumn 2014, which weighs on the euro area's
export market growth. In addition, indirect effects
via financial markets, capital flows, and
confidence could hurt the euro area outlook
offsetting to some extent the direct positive impact.
As seen in early 2016, a decline in commodity
prices can trigger a deterioration of sentiment in
financial markets, which could be detrimental to
growth prospects.
The outlook for the oil price depends on near-term
developments in demand (e.g. a more pronounced
slowing in emerging market economies) and
supply (e.g. the addition of substantial oil exports
from Iran after the recent removal of sanctions). A
stronger US dollar could also weigh on commodity
prices, which are usually settled in dollars and
would thereby increase the local currency cost for
importers.

...but the impact of a continued decline is less
clear-cut.

Given the size of the decline, the question arises if
there is a threshold level below which the negative
effects of a decline in oil prices outweigh the
positive effects, i.e. whether there are nonlinearities. (6) Very low oil prices also have an
impact on the economic health of the energy sector
in advanced economies, lowering its investment
and activity. They affect market segments that are

(2015). ‘Revisiting the macroeconomic effects of oil price
changes’. Quarterly Report on the Euro Area 14(2), pp.
19–27.

While the central scenario of the forecast captures
the impact of the changes in oil price assumptions,
recent developments also increase risks from other
oil price scenarios such as financial stress and
defaults among commodity exporters(7) that would
also affect commodity importers such as the euro
area.
The direct trade effects from slowing growth in
China are only limited…

Given the relatively small share of Chinese trade in
the total foreign trade of the euro area, the impact
of weak import demand from China is expected to
be rather limited, (8) with some differences across

Member States, depending on their exposure.
Overall, empirical studies suggest an only small
direct trade effect. (9) But assessing the impact that
comes via trade channels is complicated. The
integration of other countries into production
chains implies that (gross) exports to China may
have high import content, so such data may give
little insight into the response of trade flows to
slowing growth in China. Moreover, many foreign
companies have affiliates in China with sales that
have a volume much higher than direct exports, (10)
which suggests that the focus on trade linkages
understates the links between China and the euro
area.
Changes in investor sentiment could lead to a repricing of assets in emerging markets, which
would widen their risk spreads and raise financing
costs. These would weaken the debt-servicing
capacity of firms and weigh on investment and
economic growth. A more wide-spread reversal of
investor sentiment and risk aversion could trigger a
flight to quality, which would tend to lower
benchmark yields in the US and the euro area.
There are other channels of play which tend to
enhance the impact. For instance, the transition to
a more service-oriented economy lowers the
demand for commodities which impacts on
commodity prices and commodity-exporting
economies and thereby their trade relations with
the euro area.
…and intra-euro area trade shields exporters
somewhat against a deteriorating global
outlook…

To assess the impact of a deteriorating global
outlook, it is important to acknowledge the share
of foreign trade of euro area Member States that
takes place inside the euro area. This is reflected in
growth rates of EU Member States' export markets
that have increased whereas extra-EU export
growth and world trade growth fell or almost
stagnated in 2015. Further out, EU export markets
growth is expected to decouple further from non-

EU developments (see Graph I.8). This would also
lower the exchange rate sensitivity of euro area
companies' exports and contribute to the changing
role of exchange rates in adjustment. (11)

However, a broad-based decline in emerging

effects on external demand and a real appreciation
of the euro, which would worsen price
competitiveness on global markets. (12)

The growth slowdown in China is expected to
remain gradual, but risks associated with the
authorities’ ability to cope with the challenges

instance, attempts to use monetary policy to reach

unconventional monetary policy measures in the
euro area, the euro had closely followed
developments in long-term interest rates (see

Unconventional monetary policy in advanced
economies has spilled over to emerging market
economies. (17) Capital flows to emerging markets
raised asset prices there and led to an appreciation
of their currencies. These effects made the
tradeables and financial sectors of emerging
market economies more vulnerable. The associated
risks had become visible in 2013 when the Federal
Reserve had started to ‘taper’ its programme of
quantitative easing. Later, in anticipation of the
Fed’s first hike, the rebalancing of global
portfolios lowered capital inflows to and raised
capital outflows from emerging market economies.

Such flows are associated with the risk of a
disorderly unwinding, especially where a
substantial expansion of domestic credit had been
observed and where high levels of foreigncurrency denominated and short-term debt are
held, or exchange rates move abruptly. In recent
years, private debt in some emerging market
economies has substantially increased, most
notably in emerging Asia, where private debt is
estimated to have risen to more than 80% of GDP

…that increases downside risks to the global
and euro area growth outlook.

The extent of disruptions to these countries
depends on country-specific vulnerabilities and the
policy tools available to the authorities, such as
foreign reserves, fiscal room for manoeuvre and
prudential policies. Elevated current account
deficits, weak growth prospects and relatively low
reserves have been found to exacerbate the
response to tapering-related news (21) and argue in
favour of markedly increased downside risks for
the global economy and thus for the euro area.
With monetary policies being already very
accommodative in many advanced economies, the
policy options to cope with such an event would be
limited.
Overall, changes in global factors dampen the
growth outlook in the euro area...

In this forecast, the further deterioration in the
outlook for the external environment (see Section
I.2) is one of the reasons for the downward
revision of the export outlook and the GDP
forecast for this year. The revisions to the
commodity assumptions are a main reason for the
downward revision in the inflation outlook for
2016, as a prolonged period of negative price
pressures on energy and energy-intensive products
had to be pencilled in (see Section I.7).
…and increase downside risks...

Moreover, the downside risks to the outlook for
the external environment have markedly increased
in recent months, almost entirely reflecting
developments in emerging market economies and
in particular commodity-exporting countries. This
has increased downside risks to the growth outlook
in 2016 (see Graph I.45 in Section I.9) shifted the
balance of risks to the euro area outlook further
into negative territory.
The comparison with the development in the risk
assessment for the outlook in 2015 shows that
downside risks for 2016 have not followed the
normal pattern of falling over time as more
information becomes available. More generally,
the narrowing of risk intervals is proceeding much
slower over time as the comparison between the
development of risks assessments for 2015 and
2016 indicates (see Graph I.11).

THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

The outlook for global GDP growth and world
trade has deteriorated in recent months. Across
advanced economies a gradual recovery remains
intact, but the downturn in emerging markets has
intensified as a result of renewed commodity price
declines, tightening financial conditions and a host
of home-grown vulnerabilities.

…making it essential to weather new external
challenges.

This analysis of the role of global factors for the
euro area outlook in winter 2016 shows the
unusually strong impact also on the domestic
growth components, which are the main drivers of
the ongoing recovery. Moreover, the increased
downside risks to the euro area outlook are to a
substantial extent related to possible future
developments in global factors that are not
captured in the central scenario. This makes the
outlook dependent on the euro area economy's
ability to successfully weather new challenges.

Developments in China have so far been broadly
consistent with a ‘rebalancing’ scenario. However,
an exceptionally steep decline in Chinese imports
has left its mark on global trade flows, with recent
financial market volatility exposing the fragility of
sentiment and highlighting risks to the outlook.
Growth prospects for most commodity exporting
regions have worsened as commodity prices
slipped further and are now assumed to remain
considerably lower over the forecast horizon. (22)
In many regions, this negative terms-of-trade
shock has interacted with considerably tighter
financial conditions, partly related to the Federal
Reserve’s December decision to raise interest
rates, but also to a combination of looming fiscal
and political problems, geopolitical instability and
supply-side constraints (e.g. in Latin America, the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and
Sub-Saharan Africa). Aside from tighter financial
conditions, adverse spillovers from the Fed’s
decision appear limited so far as financial markets
across many emerging markets, in anticipation of
this decision, had already undergone significant
adjustments prior to this point. Nonetheless, risks
of a disorderly normalisation process have
increased.
Widespread weakness continues in emerging
market economies...

Most short-term indicators released since the
autumn have come in weak, particularly in
emerging markets. Preliminary estimates put
global growth at around 0.8% quarter-on-quarter
(q-o-q) in the third quarter, (23) a modest pick-up
from the second quarter, which largely reflects
stronger outcomes in advanced economies (e.g. in
Japan, Canada and Australia) and some emerging
markets (e.g. in India and Korea), while also

So far, policy stimulus, combined with buoyant
private consumption and services, seems to have
prevented a more disruptive adjustment. However,
the capacity of Chinese authorities to steer an
increasingly complex macro-financial adjustment
process and to avoid a disorderly correction of
economic imbalances will be crucial. Disruptions
in China’s still relatively under-developed
financial markets should in principle trigger only
limited spillovers to the real economy.
Nevertheless, financial market volatility could feed
into wider uncertainty elsewhere in the real
economy, or vice-versa, creating a headwind to
economic growth. The task of managing all these
processes simultaneously appears challenging.

Renewed concerns about the outlook for the
Chinese economy have triggered another decline in
Chinese stock markets early this year. Further to
the rebalancing of the Chinese economy and its
associated risks, recent high frequency indicators
confirm recessionary developments in construction
and industry, where unsustainable expansion had
led to the built-up of major imbalances. This is
mirrored by the severe contraction of goods
exports and imports. Wider shifts in domestic
demand are currently taking place, but GDP

Recent months have seen a renewed, gradual
weakening of the renminbi, reflecting the
economy’s slowing growth, accelerating (and
broadening) capital outflows, and monetary policy
divergence with the US. In an effort to support
economic growth and the rebalancing, Chinese
authorities eased monetary policy considerably
throughout 2015 – lowering the benchmark interest
rate from 5.6% to 4.35% – despite the acceleration
in capital outflows. An accommodative stance is
expected to remain in place, maintaining the
pressure on capital flows and the renminbi.

has prompted investors to withdraw from equity
and bond markets and also depressed exchange
rates. Capital flows, in particular portfolio and
short-term debt flows, fell to their lowest levels
since the economic and financial crisis, adding to
pressures on currency and equity markets while
mounting risks to the growth outlook have
contributed to a rise in market interest rates,
adding new bouts of financial pressure on highly
leveraged emerging market economies.
The outlook for world growth has deteriorated
again…

Global economic growth (excluding the EU) is
expected to have slowed from 3.7% in 2014 to
3.2% in 2015. A gradually faster expansion is
expected with annual rates of 3.6% in 2016 and
3.8% in 2017 (see Graph I.13), although the
forecast for both years has been revised
downwards by about 0.2 pps. since the autumn
forecast, largely because of the weaker outlook for
emerging markets.
The forecast’s central scenario assumes a gradual
normalisation of US monetary policy without any
serious upheavals. But the financial environment
in most emerging markets is set to become more
challenging and surrounded by heightened risks. A
further decline in capital inflows is expected to
contribute to pressures on exchange and interest
rates, and related tensions in corporate and
household balance sheets. The rapid build-up of
foreign-currency denominated debt in major
emerging market economies (24) is a source of
concern in this regard.
In China, the relatively smooth structural
adjustment assumed in the central scenario over
the forecast horizon is consistent with a gradual
slowing in the country's officially reported GDP
growth from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.2% in 2017,
however, it is surrounded by major risks. The
outlook for the rest of emerging Asia remains
broadly stable as compared to the autumn forecast.
India is consolidating its position as the world's
fastest growing large economy, with the rest of the
region remaining closely tied to China.

…with recessions in Brazil and Russia and a
weaker outlook for commodity exporters…

Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply for
Russia and Brazil, where a vicious circle of
domestic political instability, falling commodity
prices and structural bottlenecks is expected to
extend recessions into 2016 before growth resumes
in 2017. In Russia, the extension of sanctions
(currently assumed to be effective until the end of
July 2016) is expected to weigh on the growth
outlook. The prospects for countries in the Middle
East and North Africa and in Sub-Saharan Africa
have deteriorated sharply, reflecting the deepening
negative terms of trade shock and headwinds
arising from inevitable fiscal tightening, domestic
political tensions, looming structural bottlenecks
and also, in some cases, regional military conflicts.
All in all, the downturn in emerging markets is still
expected to have bottomed out in 2015, but the
forthcoming recovery now looks likely to be more
subdued, drawn-out and surrounded by downside
risks than expected in the autumn.
…and

resilient

advanced

The outlook for advanced economies has only
slightly weakened since the autumn. Economic
momentum in the US has remained robust despite
slightly weaker-than-expected GDP growth in the
third quarter of 2015. The agreement on fiscal
policies has removed much of the policy
uncertainty, while also providing for slight
increases in federal discretionary spending. A
robust labour market and clearer signs of wage and
price pressures led the Fed to hike rates in
December for the first time in nine years. US
growth is expected to stabilise at around 2.5% over

EA and EU outlook

the forecast horizon amid a maturing cycle, with
more support provided by fiscal policy but
continued headwinds from the strong dollar and
the gradual normalisation of monetary policy.
Japan’s growth profile was volatile throughout
2015 and data were subject to large revisions. The
growth outlook also includes some volatility, with
growth picking up from 0.7% in 2015 to 1.1% in
2016 before slowing again to 0.5% in 2017, mainly
as a result of a planned hike in consumption taxes.
In the third quarter of 2015, a number of advanced
economies including Canada, Australia and
Norway posted robust data, though more recent
indicators suggest a weakening at the end of the
year. Throughout the forecast horizon, advanced
economies appear relatively immune and are
expected to benefit from the gradual recovery of
trade in China, though many commodity exporters
(e.g. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and
Norway) remain vulnerable to the renewed wave
of falling commodity prices.
Global trade flows in 2015 exceptionally weak
despite some rebound since June

Following a sharp contraction in the first five
months of 2015, global trade (CPB world trade
volumes) rebounded strongly in June, and
continued to rise modestly until November.
Despite the rebound, the level of world import
growth remains subdued and far below the level of
recent years. For the first eleven months of 2015,
global import volumes rose 1.9% (y-o-y),
reflecting solid growth in advanced economies
(4.0%) and a contraction in emerging markets
(-0.8%). The weakness had originated in China
and commodity exporting regions (e.g. CIS,
MENA) in late 2014, but quickly spilled over to
other regions.
Developments in Chinese trade flows during the
course of 2015 are consistent with a ‘rebalancing’
scenario. The move away from investment, which
tends to be merchandise trade intensive, is
reflected in a contraction in imports of goods and
is partly offset by the particularly sharp increase in
the import of services.(25) Outside of China, trade
weakened most for commodity exporters (both
advanced and emerging) and those countries most
(25)

Goods imports increased in 2015 at an annual rate of 14%
(values, based on the merchandise trade statistics), while
imports of services were up by 19% in the first three
quarters (values, based on the balance of payments
statistics).

exposed to China. A sharp terms-of-trade
adjustment triggered by the collapse in commodity
prices depressed export values in many commodity
exporting regions throughout 2015. This weighed
heavily on domestic demand and squeezed import
volumes more sharply than in other parts of the
world (see Graph I.14). In some cases, the collapse
in import demand was exacerbated by home-grown
vulnerabilities and regional conflicts, capital
outflows and currency depreciation, and
compounded by the sharp drop in demand from
China (Russia, Brazil, MENA, and Sub-Saharan
Africa).

These factors combined are expected to have
pulled import growth outside the EU to 0.8% in
2015, its slowest pace since 2009 (see Graph I.15)
with Russia and Brazil jointly subtracting as much
as 0.7 pps. from growth and China contributing
almost nothing. Import growth in the rest of the
world (outside the EU) is expected to recover to
2.9% and 3.7% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, as
it follows the expected pick-up in global activity
and China's imports. Importantly, overall import
demand in China has been revised up from the
autumn, in view of the strong imports of services
throughout 2015 and the expectation of a sustained
robust pace throughout the forecast horizon
(confirming the ongoing rebalancing towards
consumption).
Stronger import demand in China should in turn
lead to a pick-up of demand in emerging Asia
(Hong Kong, Korea, Indonesia) and other
emerging markets tightly connected to China
through global supply chains. Moreover, Russia
and Brazil – real GDP in both is expected to have

19

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

bottomed out in 2015 – will likely cease to be a
drag on global trade in 2016 and start contributing
positively to growth from 2017 onwards. Further
support to world imports in 2016-2017 should
come from the continued recovery in advanced
economies, including the EU and US, and the
assumed bottoming-out of commodity prices
following the sharp collapse since mid-2014. The
global elasticity of imports is expected to remain
very low over the forecast horizon, (26) at 0.8 in
2015 and 1.1 and 1.2 in 2016 and 2017,
respectively.

Given the further decline of oil prices in January
2016, the assumptions for Brent oil prices have
been revised down (to USD 35.8/bbl. in 2016 and
to USD 42.5/bbl. in 2017). Uncertainty around this
technical projection for the oil price remains high
in the short and medium run, due to geopolitical
tensions, the outlook for an increase in the oil
supply that is expected to come from Iran
following the removal of sanctions in mid-January,
and the response of oil producers with break-even
costs above current spot prices.

…and even lower commodity prices.

Spot prices for Brent crude slipped below USD
30/bbl. in mid-January (Graph I.16). This
development was mainly driven by abundant
supply, particularly OPEC’s decision in December
2015 to maintain production levels so as to defend
its market share, high levels of stocks, and
concerns over economic growth in emerging
markets. Despite decelerating output growth in
non-OPEC producers, global oil supply continued
to increase due to record production from OPEC
countries in the third quarter of 2015. The
International Energy Agency expects the oil
market to remain oversupplied throughout 2016.
Its estimate for global oil demand growth has been
revised upwards to 2% in 2015, its fastest pace
since 2011, as consumers in developed and
developing economies increased demand in
response to lower oil prices. However, with
China's economy slowing and its energy intensity
decreasing, growth in oil demand is set to be
moderate in the coming years.

Most other commodity markets registered sharply
declining prices throughout 2015. Prices of
minerals and metal prices fell substantially in
2015, owing to ample supply and less dynamic
industrial activity in China, the world’s largest
metals consumer. In 2016, metal prices are
assumed to fall for a fifth consecutive year,
followed by a stabilisation in 2017 due to declining
investment and the pass-through from recovering
energy prices.
The prices of most agricultural commodities also
decreased in 2015. Owing to a good harvest and
comfortable stock levels, the index of food prices
declined markedly. Food prices are expected to
continue falling in 2016 and 2017, but this outlook
is subject to upside risks that adverse weather
conditions associated with El Niño could damage
agricultural production.
Global downside risks have widened

The already negative balance of risks to output
growth outside the EU has further moved to the
downside in recent months. Developments in
China remain at the forefront of concerns.
Domestic spillovers emerging from financial
market volatility still look contained, but due to the

EA and EU outlook

role of the Chinese economy, the implications for
commodity prices, world trade and potential
spillovers to other regions constitute substantial
downside risks. Volatility originating in Chinese
foreign exchange and equity markets could spread
to other emerging markets. Moreover, uncertainty
due to wider structural shifts among sectors of the
Chinese economy (e.g. manufacturing and
construction) could enhance volatility further.
There are also significant risks associated with the
pace of normalisation of US monetary policy.
Combined with the uncertainty regarding
developments in China, monetary policy measures
in the US could have a more negative impact on
emerging market economies than envisaged in the
central scenario, in particular in countries with
high foreign-currency denominated corporate debt.
Lower economic growth in emerging market
economies would not only endanger the expected
rebound in global activity and world trade; it could
also affect the stability of financial markets.
Additional downside risks are related to
commodity price assumptions, where for instance
a further slump could aggravate the downturn in
emerging markets in general and commodity
exporting regions in particular. Moreover,
stronger-than-expected second-round effects from
already observed commodity price declines could
result in a more severe tightening of the fiscal
stance and lower domestic demand, which would
accentuate the downturn and limit the scope of the
rebound in 2016 and 2017. Finally, geopolitical
risks remain high particularly with respect to the
conflicts in parts of Ukraine and in the MENA
region.
3.

FINANCIAL MARKETS

Global financial markets have experienced bouts
of volatility in recent months. They were triggered
by increasing concerns about the growth prospects
in emerging economies. At the start of the year,
asset prices in the EU declined substantially amid
the ongoing correction to Chinese stock markets,
the significant weakening of the renminbi and the
renewed fall in oil prices. There is also uncertainty
about how the EU’s growth outlook would be
impacted by a further weakening of economic
activity in China and other emerging markets.

More divergent monetary policy
among major central banks…

stances

The monetary policy stance of major central banks
diverged further in the last weeks of 2015. At their
December meetings, the ECB and the Bank of
Japan decided to further ease their monetary policy
stances, whereas the US Federal Reserve decided
to raise its target range for the federal funds rate
for the first time since June 2006.
The ECB announced a number of new monetary
policy easing measures which aim to secure a
return of inflation rates towards the ECB's
definition of price stability and at anchoring
medium-term inflation expectations. It lowered the
deposit facility rate by 10 bps. to a new historically
low level of -0.30%. In addition, the ECB
announced a number of non-standard monetary
policy measures: extension of the on-going asset
purchase programme (APP) until at least March
2017; broadening of the range of securities to be
purchased under the APP to include eurodenominated regional and local government bonds;
reinvestment of the principal payments on the
securities purchased under the APP for as long as
necessary; and the extension of the fixed rate
tender procedures with full allotment for the ECB's
refinancing operations until at least the end of
2017.
The US Fed's decision to raise the target range for
the federal funds rate by 25 bps. (to 0.25-0.50%)
marked the end of a period of seven years during
which rates had been left unchanged. While the US
central bank emphasised in its communication that
the federal funds rate would be only gradually
increased, the FOMC members' forecasts of the
appropriate federal funds rate over the 2016-17
horizon signalled more tightening than financial
markets had expected before the December
meeting. This underlines the possibility of an
increasing monetary policy divergence between
the US and the euro area. This was confirmed after
the ECB's meeting in January by signalling the
intention to maintain an appropriate degree of
monetary accommodation and to enhance actions
if needed over the course of the year.

(e.g. in 2015 the annual growth rates of M1 and
M3 were above or in line with their long-term
averages), very low euro area government bond
yields, and declining lending rates. The diverging
monetary policy stance between the US Federal
Reserve and the ECB contributed to a weakening
of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar since the
autumn. In nominal effective terms, the euro has
depreciated more moderately given the persistent
weakness of several emerging markets' and/or
commodity exporters' currencies. In particular, at
the beginning of January 2016, the renminbi hit its
weakest level against the US dollar since 2011.
Compared to end-November 2015, it has lost
almost 6% against the euro.

The monetary policy divergence between the euro
area and the US has also been quite visible in
money markets and short-term benchmark
sovereign bond markets. The US Libor has
diverged sharply from the European equivalent,
the Euribor, as the 3-month US Libor moved up
from 0.32% in early November to 0.62% (January
22) while the Euribor dropped from -0.07% to
-0.14%. A similar development occurred between
US Treasuries and German Bunds, but more in the
short maturities than in the longer maturities. The
spreads of most euro area sovereign bond yields
have remained broadly stable over the past couple
of months (Graph I.17). Greek spreads have
narrowed significantly since the signing of the
third adjustment programme with its creditors over
the summer, the passing of the first sets of policy
measures and the subsequent disbursements of
programme payments. However, they have
widened again recently, in response to weak
macroeconomic data and market concerns about
political commitment to the programme in Greece.
Portuguese spreads have also widened more

22

Most other central banks in the EU maintained
their accommodative monetary policy stances or
took additional easing measures (e.g. the Swedish
Riksbank) amid subdued inflationary pressures and
additional monetary easing in the euro area. Only
the Danish Nationalbank raised the interest rate on
certificates of deposit by 10 bps. to -0.65% at the
beginning of January 2016, thus narrowing the
monetary policy rate spread to the euro area to 0.35 bps. The interest rate increase followed a
sharp fall worth about DKK 50 billion in foreign
exchange reserves as a result of net sales in the
foreign exchange market.
Global stock markets have turned sour since

recently on the back of concerns about the banking
sector and the budget.

Following the ECB's December decision, stock
markets corrected downwards having expected a
stronger easing response from the ECB. In
January, negative sentiment continued to
dominate, with concerns about the global outlook.
Markets were battered amid renewed risk aversion
stemming from concerns about China's growth
prospects, the devaluation of its currency and its
broader impact internationally. Meanwhile, EU
corporate bond spreads, at least in the investment
grades, widened somewhat further after a
significant rise earlier in 2015. In the speculative
grades, upward pressure on spreads was stronger.
…while bank lending continued to recover…

The cycle of lending to both households and nonfinancial corporates (NFCs) has picked up further
along with the economic cycle and is now
entrenched in positive territory. Net lending flows
continued to be positive over the last few months,
suggesting improved transmission of the
accommodative monetary policy of the ECB
through the euro area banking system. Banks have
lowered interest rates over the last year on new
lending transactions to NFCs especially in
Portugal, Spain and Italy. Hence, discrepancies in
lending rates between vulnerable and other euro
area countries have narrowed further. However,
the responsiveness of business to these changes in
financing costs has varied, with no clear sign that
business volumes are increasing more strongly in
those countries where lending costs have fallen the
most (see Graph I.18). This may be due to several
factors: lingering cross-country differences in the

level of interest rates, still large and rising levels of
non-performing loans in some countries such as

supply side, and differences in the level of
demand.

The recovery in bank lending can also be seen in
surveys which point to further improvements in the
availability of external sources of finance
particularly bank lending. The ECB Bank Lending
Survey(27) for the fourth quarter of 2015 shows that
changes in credit standards and loan demand
continue to support a recovery in loan growth,
particularly for enterprises. Meanwhile, the ECB's
Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises
(SAFE) has provided further evidence of loosening
funding constraints to SMEs in the euro area. (28)

…signalling a pick-up in the credit cycle.

With bank lending recovering and market funding
still expanding, the cycle of external corporate
funding appears to be picking up. However, it
remains weak compared to previous cycles,
mirroring low investment demand and the still
intensive use of internal funds by NFCs. This
suggests that the deleveraging process that has
taken place in most of the euro area corporate
sector since the crisis is still ongoing. The net
funding position of NFCs displays an anti-cyclical
behaviour, rising in a downturn and vice versa (see
Graph I.19). However, the trend in the corporate
funding position lags GDP growth by four to six
quarters. Therefore, against the background of the
economic cyclical upturn in 2015, the currently
high level of corporate surpluses in Europe is
expected to decline further in 2016, while bank
lending and market funding cycles are expected to
accelerate. Overall, both external and internal
funds should be easily accessible to finance a rise
in investment over the next two years.

…and market funding expanded further...

Fund raising on markets continued to increase in
the euro area with positive net volumes of
corporate bonds and equity. While corporate bonds
were used intensively between 2012 and 2014, net
equity issuance only began to rise in 2014. This
upturn is beneficial not only for investment but
also because higher equity lowers the debt-toequity ratio and hence strengthens the corporate
financial structure. At present, all funding sources
are growing, with capital market issuance still
contributing most to overall external funding.

Financial conditions in the euro area are expected
to remain favourable for longer than expected in

significant. They relate mainly to external factors
and could, if they materialise, trigger abrupt
adjustments in international capital flows and
potentially cause new tensions in global financial
markets.

GDP AND ITS COMPONENTS

The economic recovery in the euro area remains
moderate despite substantial support from several
factors including low oil prices, the relatively weak
exchange rate of the euro and the very
accommodative stance of monetary policy. This
support is now expected to be somewhat stronger
and longer lasting than previously thought.
However, the overall impact on economic activity
will likely be rather limited due to increased
headwinds from the external environment and in
some cases, because of lingering legacies from the
crisis. These include high levels of public and
private debt, gaps in the euro area’s architecture
and a high degree of economic and policy
uncertainty. Overall, stronger economic growth
has so far failed to materialise (29) and evidence in
favour of the sustainability of the recovery remains
fragile.
Moderate recovery continued…

In the third quarter of 2015, euro area GDP growth
slowed to 0.3% (q-o-q), the slowest quarterly gain
in a year. In annual terms, however, GDP grew by
1.6% in the third quarter, as in the second quarter,
which was the highest rate since the second quarter
of 2011. Domestic demand remained the main
contributor to GDP growth, mainly thanks to
private consumption. Higher real gross disposable
income and some improvements in the labour
market continued to support private consumption
growth. By contrast, after a solid rise in the first
quarter, euro area investment stagnated in the
second and third quarters. Meanwhile, net trade
became a drag on GDP growth. While the weak
euro was supportive for euro area exports, the
slowdown in emerging market economies was not.
As a result, euro area export growth fell sharply in
the third quarter of 2015.

growth continued, but hard data and soft (survey)
data send mixed results.
On the one hand, hard data suggest broadly similar
or slightly lower growth than in the previous
quarter. In October and November, industrial
production in the euro area was on average only
0.1% higher than the average in the third quarter
(0.2% in the EU). The breakdown by industrial
groupings shows that energy production declined
substantially. But some weakness can also be
attributed to exports. After three months of
decline, industrial new orders in the euro area
rebounded in October, but remained below the
level registered in the third quarter. Retail sales in
October and November were on average lower
than in the third quarter.
On the other hand, survey data give a somewhat
brighter picture. Both the Commission's Economic
Sentiment Indicator (ESI) for the euro area and the
composite output Purchasing Managers' Index
(PMI) improved between the third and fourth
quarters of 2015 (Graph I.20). Both indicators
reached their highest level in more than four years,
which is consistent with a slight acceleration in
growth in the fourth quarter.

…and is expected to go on in the short term.

GDP growth in the last quarter of 2015 likely
benefited from the continued support of tailwinds
but was also confronted by the offsetting effect of
the slowdown of growth in China and other
emerging market economies. Data released since
autumn suggest that the modest pace of economic

The euro area is expected to need eight years (up to 2016Q1) to recover its pre-crisis level of real GDP in 2008-Q1.
This would be much longer than in previous recoveries and
is one of the reasons for reduced forecast accuracy in the
post-crisis years (see Box I.2).

Overall, in 2015, the euro area economy should
have remained on track for its strongest economic
performance since 2011 with an annual rate of
GDP growth of 1.6% (1.9% in the EU). The
unchanged GDP growth rate compared to the
autumn forecast is based on a slightly different
composition with a slightly higher contribution
from domestic demand and a somewhat lower
contribution from net exports.

EA and EU outlook

Tailwinds supporting growth for longer…

Since the autumn, oil prices have fallen further, the
euro has depreciated more, funding costs have
continued to decline and the overall fiscal stance is
becoming slightly more supportive. These factors
are now expected to provide the economic
recovery in 2016 and 2017 with greater and more
long-lasting support than previously assumed.
• The decline in oil prices continued in
December 2015 and early January 2016 and led
to lower oil price assumptions for the whole
forecast horizon. Very low energy prices
should continue providing a boost to the
purchasing power of households and
companies.
• The external value of the euro has fallen
slightly since the autumn. This is mirrored in
downward revisions to the assumptions for the
exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar in 2016
and 2017. It is also, but to a lesser extent
reflected this year in the nominal effective
exchange rate vis-à-vis a group of
industrialised countries. The boost to price
competitiveness and the support for foreign
non euro-denominated export earnings of
companies is indeed partly offset by the
depreciation of the currencies of some
emerging market economies, most notably
Russia and China.

• Monetary conditions have eased further
compared to the autumn forecast. The ECB
measures on 3 December have further extended
the period of lower financing costs. The
accommodative monetary policy stance is
being increasingly transmitted into the real
economy via lower costs and better availability
of credit. This can also be seen from some
further easing of credit supply conditions and
the turnaround in the credit cycle (see Section
I.3).
• Fiscal policy is becoming slightly more
supportive than expected in the autumn. In
some Member States, increased government
expenditure reflects greater-than-expected
spending associated with the arrival of large
number of migrants. (30) Moreover, several
recent developments (e.g. public security
measures) are expected to result in higher
expenditures than projected in the autumn
forecast.
…but headwinds and some legacies from the
crisis should limit their impact…

The extended period of support from tailwinds is
expected to be somewhat tempered by the impact
of the deterioration in the external environment on

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

European exports in the near term, while the
expected rebound in global economic activity
should exert positive effects later in 2016 and
2017. The economic recovery in 2016 and 2017
should also benefit from improving labour market
conditions that support private consumption. In
some countries, the integration of refugees into
labour markets could start to have a positive
impact on economic activity, though the impact on
growth is difficult to quantify. (31) Also, some of
the structural reforms that have been implemented
in euro area Member States should continue to
have a positive impact on economic growth.
Heading into 2016, several Member States will
continue to face challenges such as relatively high
unemployment rates and the continuing
deleveraging processes of households and
companies. The unemployment rate is expected to
have slightly fallen to 11.0% in the euro area in
2015 but remains well above pre-crisis levels (see
Section I.6). In some Member States, the high
unemployment rate is to some extent the result of
the simultaneous deleveraging pressures in all
economic sectors that have been weighing on
domestic demand, but remaining structural
rigidities also play a role. (32) High indebtedness

continued to exert a negative effect on private
households and the corporate sector in 2015. Over
the forecast horizon, further progress in
overcoming this legacy of the crisis, should
support private and public consumption, as well as
investment. Even though deleveraging needs can
be identified for a number of countries and sectors,
acute deleveraging pressures appear to be low over
the forecast horizon due to very low financing
costs and easing credit standards.
…leaving overall GDP growth forecasts broadly
unchanged.

The outlook for the euro area in 2016 and 2017 has
not changed fundamentally since the autumn. The
combination of the boost from tailwinds and other
growth drivers is expected to lead to a slight
strengthening of the recovery over the forecast
horizon, rather than a substantial acceleration. The
outlook is for a longer period of growth, which,
though low by historical standards, still exceeds
actual potential growth. Real GDP is expected to
grow by 1.7% in 2016 in the euro area (1.9% in the
EU (Graph I.21)) and by 1.9% in 2017 (2.0%)
while potential growth is estimated at only around
1% in 2016-2017. The negative output gap is
therefore expected to narrow over the forecast
horizon. Potential growth remains well below its
pre-crisis level. (33) This is mainly the result of the

2015 – a unique year in terms of joint
expansion across Member States

At the Member State level, GDP growth appears to
have been fairly balanced across the euro area in
2015. 2015 looks set to turn out as the first year
since the crisis in which no Member State reported
shrinking output. Growth rates are expected to
have varied from a low of 0.0% in Greece to a high
of 6.9% in Ireland. Structural differences (e.g.
balance-sheet adjustment, catching-up) and
cyclical differences help to explain both the
variation in growth rates and the wide range in
unemployment rates despite a common trend of
increasing employment.(34)
In 2016, all Member States are expected to see an
improvement in their growth rates, except for
Greece, where the economy is forecast to register
negative growth amid the negative carry-over from
2015 before strengthening in 2017. Against the
background of a slightly worse global outlook and
lower oil price assumptions, differences in the
openness of economies to trade and their energy
intensities will contribute to growth differences
(see Graph I.22).
(34)

For the role of cross-country differences in real interest
rates see Box I.1.

Private consumption remains the main growth
driver…

Consumer spending appears to be holding up well.
The ongoing recovery remains driven by domestic
demand and in particular, by private consumption.
In the third quarter of 2015, household
consumption was again the main contributor to
euro area GDP growth, increasing by 0.4% q-o-q,
after 0.3% in the previous quarter. After two and a
half years of expansion, household consumption is
expected to have passed its pre-crisis peak in the
last quarter of 2015. The positive developments in
household consumption have been supported by
rising real gross disposable incomes (see
Graph I.23) thanks to the fall in headline inflation
(driven by falling energy prices) as well as
moderate improvements in labour market
conditions.

accelerating, though slightly more moderately than
expected in the autumn forecast.
Although retail sales growth in October and
November was on average 0.4% below the sevenyear record highs they recorded in the third
quarter, new passenger car registrations in the euro
area rose on average by 0.6% (q-o-q) over those
two months compared to the third quarter,
indicating that household consumption continued
to grow in the fourth quarter. In line with this, the
annual growth rate of loans to households
continued to increase in October and November.
Survey data also show mixed results. The
Commission's Consumer Confidence indicator
increased during the fourth quarter compared to
the previous quarter in both the EU and the euro
area. While consumers were more upbeat on
questions relating to their personal finances
(expected financial situation, future savings), their
views on future unemployment became more
pessimistic. Consumers also appeared more
confident about making major purchases in early
2016. The Retail Confidence indicator rose in the
fourth quarter, but the monthly index fell towards
the end of 2015. In France, there was a sharp drop
in retail confidence in December after the terrorist
attacks of 13 November. Overall, the recovery in
the retail sector seems to have faded in the last
quarter of 2015.

Consumer confidence (rhs)

In 2015, private consumption benefitted from the
very low prices for energy and from improved
labour market conditions. It is expected to have
accelerated to 1.7% in the euro area (2.0% in the
EU). These forecasts are broadly unchanged from
the autumn 2015 forecast, pointing to a limited
impact of the lower-than-assumed oil prices in the
second half of 2015.

28

…and should then slow down in 2017.

Over the forecast horizon, private consumption
should continue growing strongly in 2016 before
decelerating somewhat in 2017 mainly on the back
of rising consumer prices. It is expected to grow by
1.8% in the euro area (2.2% in the EU) and slow
down to 1.5% in 2017 (1.8%) in 2017 (Graph
I.24). As a result, the mild expansion in the euro
area should be substantially driven by private
consumption (see Graph I.25).

Support should come from higher wages and
salaries but also from an increase in non-labour
incomes (profit and property-related incomes) and
from higher transfers to households. Real
disposable income growth is, however, expected to
lose some momentum towards the end of the
forecast horizon as consumer price inflation moves
gradually up. Higher financial wealth, helped in
part by the impact of unconventional monetary
policy on asset prices, should also support private
consumption. (35)
The household saving rate, which has moved in a
narrow range between 12.6% and 12.8% of gross
disposable income in the euro area since the
beginning of the recovery in 2013, is expected to
be gradually higher over the forecast horizon.
Opposite forces are seen to be at play here. On the
one hand, the expected improvement in the labour
market should lead to lower precautionary savings
and very low interest rates could discourage
savings through the inter-temporal substitution
effect. On the other hand, the fact that

according to which consolidation measures are
only factored in once they have been adopted and
presented to national parliaments or are known in
sufficient detail to be taken into consideration.

While deleveraging needs of households remain
elevated in some Member States, progress during
the economic recovery has been made and acute
deleveraging pressures continue to ease. Moreover,
very low financing costs and easing credit
conditions allow debtors to roll over debt relatively
easily, reducing immediate deleveraging pressures.
A reduced pace of deleveraging is expected to
support private consumption in 2016 and 2017.

Investment has remained relatively weak…

Public consumption surprised on the upside

Public consumption increased by 0.6% (q-o-q) in
the euro area (0.7% in the EU) in the third quarter
of 2015, rising by significantly more than expected
in the autumn. The overall picture for the euro area
masks some differences among countries, with
expansionary fiscal policy measures having been
taken in some cases to deal with the influx of
asylum seekers (e.g. Germany). Since the last
quarter of 2015, several recent developments (e.g.
public security measures, asylum-seeker related
expenditures) are expected to result in additional
fiscal expenditures as compared to those taken into
account in the autumn.
As a result, for the year 2015, government
consumption growth has been revised up compared
to the autumn forecast. It is now projected to have
grown by 1.4% in the euro area (1.5% in the EU).
Government consumption is expected to have
decreased in only two euro area Member States
(Cyprus and Greece).
Looking further ahead, public consumption growth
is projected to slow marginally in the euro area
over the forecast horizon and somewhat more
strongly in the EU. Measures to contain and
manage the inflow of asylum seekers are in the
process of implementation and the pace of arrivals
in 2016, and thus of related public consumption,
will depend on the effectiveness of these measures.
Overall, public consumption is expected to grow
by 1.3% and 1.2% in the euro area in 2016 and
2017 respectively (1.3% and 1.1% respectively in
the EU). It is expected to contract in two euro area
Member States in 2016 (Greece and Cyprus) and
in 2017 (Greece and Finland). However, the
forecast for 2017 should be seen against the
background of a no-policy-change assumption,

Still missing from the recovery picture is a clear
rebound in investment. After surprising on the
upside in the first quarter of 2015, investment has
failed to become a substantial driver of the
ongoing recovery, which raises questions about the
sustainability of the recovery. Despite support
from very favourable financing conditions and the
improved demand outlook, the expansion of
investment has considerably slowed, grinding to a
halt in the euro area (0.1% in the second quarter
and 0.0% in the third), and falling back to low
rates in the EU as well (0.4% and 0.3%,
respectively). These developments support the
view that total investment is currently not very
sensitive to changes in financing conditions. (36) At
the current juncture, in addition to remaining
deleveraging forces, economic and policy
uncertainty can be presumed to have exerted a
substantial negative impact on investment
decisions.
…but is expected to pick up in the near term…

Total investment is expected to resume growth in
the near term, on the back of a pick-up in demand,
an increase in capacity utilisation, and improved
profit margins, the latter being the result of lower
energy prices and lower funding costs. However,
investment is expected to be held back somewhat
by the lower growth momentum outside the EU,
which is expected to reduce export growth and
hence equipment investment. Also, high
uncertainty is expected to remain a drag on
investment growth in the near term.
Hard data for equipment investment show that the
production of capital goods decreased slightly in
the euro area in October and November compared
to the third quarter. In the EU, it increased by
0.3%. The rate of capacity utilisation in the fourth
quarter of 2015 (data collected in October 2015)
(36)

An ECB survey on the investment weakness showed that
financial constraints related to costs of, or access to,
funding were seldom seen as important constraints by
firms. Investment decisions, however, remained sensitive
to the economic outlook and the policy uncertainty. See
ECB (2015). ‘What is behind the low investment in the
euro area? Responses from a survey of large euro area
firms’. ECB Economic Bulletin Issue 8, Box 2, pp. 35-37.

Hard data on the construction sector points to
positive growth in construction investment in the
near term. The sector's output in November
increased by 0.5% (3m-o-3m) in the euro area and
the number of permits increased in the third
quarter by 2.8% (q-o-q). Another positive signal
comes from the increase in loans for house
purchases at an annual rate of about 2% in October
and November in the euro area. In the third
quarter, house prices in the euro area were 2.3%
higher than they were one year before. However,
the aggregate hides substantial differences among
countries with house prices moving up quickly in
Germany (5.6%), Spain (4.5%) and the
Netherlands (4.1%), but falling in France (-1.2%)
and Italy (-2.3%). The extent to which positive
signals can be expected to show up in construction
investment depends on the usual time lags, but also
on the remaining excess capacity in the
construction sector and, in some Member States,
the rather weak real estate price dynamics
observed in the past (see Box I.4).
According to the Commission's surveys,
confidence in the euro area brightened in all
business sectors in the last quarter of 2015
compared to the third quarter. In the construction
sector, confidence rose above its long-term
average for the first time since the onset of the
financial crisis. The Commission’s latest
investment survey indicates that business sector
investments, mainly machinery and R&D
investment, are increasing. In line with these
developments, both the manufacturing and services
PMIs increased in the fourth quarter, before falling
slightly in January 2016.

30

Overall, hard data and survey results point to a
pick-up in investment in the last quarter of 2015.
In 2015 as a whole, total investment is expected to
have grown by 2.3% in the euro area (3.0% in the
EU), up from 1.3% in 2014 (2.7%). Further
investment growth, however, may be tempered by
the slowdown in growth outside the EU.

Looking further ahead, the outlook for investment
is supported by strengthening domestic demand
and improved profit margins, on the back of lower
energy prices and lower funding costs. Accelerator
effects and modernisation needs are also expected
to push up equipment investment. Investment
should also gradually benefit from the rebound in
global growth over the forecast horizon and the
expected lightening of the deleveraging pressures
which weigh on investment in several Member
States. As a result, corporate indebtedness should
gradually cease to act as a brake on investment.
The Investment Plan for Europe is expected to
exert a positive impact on both public and private
investment. It is already financing infrastructure
and innovation projects in the real economy as
well as providing access to finance for start-ups
and SMEs. The Commission's EUR 315 billion
Investment Plan is thus on track and by January
2016, financing had been agreed that was expected
to mobilise around EUR 50 billion of investment
in Europe.
Construction investment should also benefit from
rising real disposable incomes and very low
mortgage rates. Increased demand for housing
should also stem from the inflow of asylum
seekers. However, the high levels of household
debt in some Member States will continue to
prevent a stronger increase in construction
investment in 2016 but should be a softer
constraint in 2017.
All in all, total investment in the euro area is
expected to rise by 2.8% in 2016 (3.2% in the EU),
before accelerating to 4.2% in 2017 (4.3%).

global

In the first half of last year, export growth had

EA and EU outlook

economies had more than offset the weakness in
emerging market economies and world trade. In
the third quarter, the deterioration in the external
environment started to be felt with exports strongly
decelerating in the euro area. The positive impact
of the euro’s depreciation, which had also helped
to offset the slowing growth of world trade and
economic activity, was no longer strong enough.
Volumes of exports of goods and services
decelerated to 0.3% (q-o-q) after having grown by
a quarterly average of 1.2% since 2014. In nominal
terms, exports of goods to non-euro area countries
shrank by 1.3% (q-o-q) while intra euro area
exports decreased by 0.3% in the third quarter of
2015. For the EU as a whole, exports of goods
outside the EU shrank by 2.2% (q-o-q) while intraEU exports remained stable. In terms of trading
partners, exports of EU goods to Russia, Brazil and
China contracted strongly in the third quarter. In
parallel and in line with the gradual recovery of
domestic demand, imports of goods and services to
the euro area continued to grow at a steady pace of
0.9% (q-o-q) in the third quarter of 2015. As a
result, the contribution of net trade to GDP growth
turned negative.
The headwinds stemming from the slowdown in
emerging markets are expected to continue
blowing in the near term. This can be discerned in
survey data. For instance, the assessment of export
order books in the Commission's manufacturing
survey for the fourth quarter of 2015 remained
broadly at the same level as in the previous quarter
in the euro area, when they had dropped
significantly (in the EU it continued to worsen).
Moreover, countries with close links to Russia are
expected to continue feeling the trade impact from
the current Russian recession as well as from the
extended sanctions against Russia (and countersanctions against the EU). The technical
assumptions presume that these sanctions will, as
decided in December 2015, remain effective until
the end of July 2016. The depreciation of the euro
and the firming of growth in advanced economies
should continue to boost the euro area’s export
growth.
All in all, despite the deceleration in the second
half of the year, exports of goods and services are
expected to have grown by 5.1% in the euro area
and the EU, on the back of the strong first half of
the year. Imports are expected to have continued
increasing broadly in line with domestic demand
and goods exports, some of which have high
import content. They should have increased by

5.7% in the euro area and by 5.6% in the EU (see
Graph I.27). Net trade is expected to have made a
neutral contribution to GDP growth in 2015 in the
euro area (and a slight negative one in the EU).

…but should rebound as global activity picks
up.

Thanks to improvements in competitiveness and
the gradual strengthening of global demand, export
growth should accelerate over the course of 2016.
Economic activity is expected to rebound in most
emerging market economies, but although import
growth in these countries is expected to recover, it
is expected to remain below that of previous years.
Moreover, the global elasticity of imports is
expected to remain very low during the forecast
horizon. As a result, euro area exports are forecast
to grow more slowly in 2016 than in 2015,
although this also reflects the low carryover from
the second half of 2015. Import volumes are set to
mirror the development of exports given the high
import content of many export goods. Against this
background, exports are projected to grow by 4.2%
in the euro area and the EU in 2016 and are
expected to accelerate to 5.0% in both areas in
2017. Imports are forecast to grow by 5.0% in the
euro area in 2016 (5.1% in the EU). They are then
set to accelerate to 5.6% in 2017 (5.5% in the EU).
Overall, net trade should have a slight negative
impact on GDP growth in 2016 and become
neutral in 2017.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

THE CURRENT ACCOUNT

In 2015, the increase in the adjusted currentaccount surplus of the euro area was driven by the
decline in commodity prices, which largely offset
the volume effect of a greater propensity to import,
as well as weak domestic demand and gains in
price competitiveness due to the depreciation of
the euro. Over the forecast horizon, both trade and
current account surpluses as a percentage of GDP
are expected to recede as economic activity is set
to continue expanding more quickly in Europe
than in the external environment.
Lower oil prices and improved price
competitiveness pushed surpluses higher…

In 2015, the increase in trade surpluses in the euro
area reflected a combination of lower import
prices, improved price competitiveness and
subdued domestic demand. As regards import
prices, the sharp decline in oil prices has narrowed
significantly the deficit in the oil balance (see
Graph I.28).

Customs basis trade balance data differ from those presented
elsewhere in the forecast document.

As import prices fell more than export prices
(driven by commodities), the terms of trade
improved. Improvements in price competitiveness
on the back of decreasing relative unit labour costs
and the depreciation of the real effective exchange
rate also had strong effects. The impact of these
effects on the trade balance and current account
balance was only partially mitigated by higher
import volumes. Overall, the euro area's adjusted
merchandise trade surplus is expected to have
increased from 2.5% of GDP in 2014 to 3.3% in
2015, whereas the adjusted current account surplus
is expected to have increased from 2.4% of GDP to
3.1%.

32

…with stronger domestic demand and
rebounding commodity prices becoming
mitigating factors…

In 2016 and 2017, European exporters are
expected to continue benefitting from gains in
price competitiveness. Imports are set to move in
tandem with domestic demand, and to increase
more strongly. The renewed fall in oil prices early
this year and the depreciation of the euro’s
exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar are expected
to remain key determinants of both export and
import prices in 2016. European exporters should
benefit from gains in price competitiveness as
relative unit labour costs and real exchange rates
vis-à-vis major trading partners are expected to
continue decreasing.
Overall, the euro area's adjusted trade surplus is
expected to be stable in 2016 and to slightly
narrow to 3.1% of GDP in 2017. The adjusted
current account surplus should recede to 3.0% and
2.8% of GDP in the euro area.
…and intra-euro area rebalancing remaining
somewhat asymmetric.

Intra-euro area current account rebalancing over
the last few years has been driven by vulnerable
countries which have turned large deficits into
surpluses. While the initial adjustments were
supported by the weakness of domestic demand,
the improved export performance in these
countries has made a substantial contribution, as
export growth outpaced import growth. In
countries with high current account surpluses, no
or very little adjustment had been observed, as
domestic demand was relatively weak and price
competitiveness remained high. These surpluses
recorded in the euro area over the past few years,
have stabilised the total Net International
Investment Positions (NIIPs, see Graph I.29), but
not significantly changed in highly-indebted
countries that remain well above the -35% of GDP
threshold underlying the alert mechanism of the
Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP). (37)
And the Net International Investment Position of
surplus countries (e.g. Germany and the
Netherlands) has continued to grow.

LABOUR MARKET

2000

Labour market conditions continue to improve at a
moderate pace, with employment growing and
unemployment falling slightly. However, key
labour market fundamentals have not yet fully
recovered from the crisis. Unemployment remains
at high levels with substantial differences across
Member States. The unprecedented inflow of
asylum seekers is set to impact only gradually on
the labour force in the EU and on unemployment
rates in some Member States.

However, current account rebalancing is expected
to slow due to the worsening performance of
exports in some countries (see Graph I.30). Some
of the reasons for the asymmetric adjustment, such
as weak domestic demand momentum and
sustained price competitiveness are expected to
remain in place over the forecast horizon.
Particularly in Germany and in the Netherlands,
surpluses are expected to remain at high levels in
2016 and 2017.

During the current recovery, employment seems to
have responded more strongly to output
developments than historical employment-tooutput elasticities would have suggested. (38) But
economic growth has been too weak to quickly
recoup the preceding job losses (see Graph I.31).
In 2015, headcount employment remained about
2.0% below its pre-crisis level. In the third quarter
of 2015, employment rose by 0.3% (q-o-q) in the
euro area and by 0.4% in the EU. Employment
gains have been broad-based across almost all
Member States, especially in those mostly affected
by the recent crisis, such as Spain, Italy and
Portugal.

Overall, in 2017, the assumed rebound of oil prices

has continued to support the pace of job creation in

recent labour market reforms, such as flexible

bargaining, have contributed to higher labour
market flexibility, increased part-time employment
and moderate wage growth; factors which are
underpinning labour demand.

…but unemployment is declining only slowly.

The unemployment rate in the euro area has been
declining since mid-2013 as the economic
recovery has taken hold and employment growth
gradually gained pace. The decline also reflects
resilient activity rates amid increases in the
participation rate, mainly of women and older
workers (added-worker effect). While activity rates
of men in the euro area have declined since
(39)

34

See, also ECB (2015). ‘What is behind the recent rebound
in euro area employment?’. Economic Bulletin Issue 8; and

Economic Policy 26(68), pp. 697–765.

pre-crisis peaks (by 0.8 pps. between 2008 and
2014), activity rates of women have been on a
continuous upward trend (+2.2 pps.).
However, the decline in the unemployment rate
has been only gradual and unemployment remains
persistently high in many Member States and well
above the pre-crisis levels for the euro area and the
EU on average. In November 2015, the
unemployment rate decreased slightly to 10.5% in
the euro area and 9.1% in the EU. The impact of
persistently high unemployment rates could
become more acute as populations age in many
European countries, as an older population implies
lower participation rates in the medium term.
As regards the composition of unemployment,
youth
unemployment
and
long-term
unemployment remain very high by historical
standards. This implies a greater risk of lower
potential
output
and
higher
structural
unemployment. In the short run, they should also
put upward pressure on budgetary costs, hold back
a stronger rebound in productivity growth and
increase welfare dependency.
The ongoing improvement in labour market
conditions is only slowly driving down long-term
unemployment (see Graph I.33). Also, the share of
unemployed in the cohorts of young people has
fallen at a slow pace (see Graph I.34). While in
2014 youth unemployment in the euro area fell at a
faster rate than overall unemployment, it remained
broadly unchanged throughout 2015. In November
2015, the youth unemployment rate decreased to
22.5% in the euro area (from 22.7% in early 2015)
and 20.0% in the EU (from 21.0%). Moreover, the
share of youth unemployment to total
unemployment in the euro area has been increasing
since mid-2015. At the same time, the proportion
of people unemployed for 24 months or more
remains high, albeit declining more steeply.

While high rates of youth and long-term
unemployment carry the risk of skill erosion and
scarring effects, the ageing of the population in
Europe should partly blunt these effects by
increasing demand for labour in some countries.
Still, the persistence of long-term unemployment
can be expected to continue weighing on the
efficiency of labour market matching in Europe
and increase the risk that high levels of
unemployment could become entrenched.

2016. Employment expectations in industry and
services remained strong in December both in the
euro area and the EU (see Graph I.35). Following a
slight deterioration in the third quarter of 2015,
employment expectations in industry in the euro
area increased in the final quarter, while
employment expectations in services have been
broadly increasing throughout 2015. By contrast,
employment expectations in retail trade slightly
moderated in December in both areas. Still, the
hiring intentions of firms remain above their longterm averages in all sectors. The composite PMI
employment index for the euro area increased
further in December, indicating further net job
creation in the manufacturing and services sectors.
The sharp increase in consumers’ unemployment
expectations in the fourth quarter of last year could
be related to the inflow of asylum seekers. This
was particularly the case in the countries most
affected, such as Germany and Austria.

Employment is set to expand further…

Labour market conditions should continue to
improve in the near term, although cyclical factors
are set to lead to only a slow absorption of excess
capacities in the labour market. The relatively slow
adjustment of the hours worked to pre-crisis levels
should also somewhat hold back stronger
improvements in the labour market in the near
term.

Overall, in 2015, employment is expected to have
gained further momentum reaching 1.1% in both
the euro area and the EU. The unemployment rate
in the euro area in 2015 is expected to have
declined to 11.0% (9.5% in the EU).
…but labour force developments should drive
unemployment…

Employment growth is expected to continue at
about its current speed in 2016 and 2017. Annual
rates of 1.0% in the euro area, slightly less in the
EU in 2017, reflect the support of strengthening
economic activity, improved business confidence
and higher capital accumulation. Higher labour
market flexibility and moderate wage increases
amid recent labour market reforms are also
expected to contribute to employment growth over
the forecast period.

35

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

The labour force is projected to grow more
strongly than previously expected in the euro area,
largely driven by higher participation rates as a
result of improved economic and labour market
conditions, the fading of discouragement effects,
and net migration flows. In some countries, the
integration of refugees into the labour market
could boost the labour force in 2016 and 2017.
However, as the processing of asylum applications
varies significantly across countries, the absorption
of accepted refugees into the labour market will
likely remain gradual. (40) Upward pressures on
unemployment should therefore be contained. The
activity rate is set to increase modestly over the
forecast horizon on the back of increases in the
labour force but also a decline of the working age
population in some countries (e.g. Baltic countries,
Poland). Labour productivity growth (output per
person employed), is forecast to increase
moderately over the forecast period as the recovery
continues and in line with the pro-cyclicality of
labour productivity. It is set to reach 0.8% in the
euro area in 2017 (1.1% in the EU).
Unemployment rates in both the euro area and the
EU are set to decline very slowly as the recovery
remains
moderate
and
high
structural
unemployment continues to decline only gradually.
According to Commission estimates, the NAWRU
(Non-Accelerating Wage Rate of Unemployment)
remains high but is set to continue declining from
its recent peak in 2014 and 2013 in the euro area
and the EU respectively. The NAWRU is expected
to broadly stabilise over the forecast period in the
euro area (to 9.9% of the labour force in 2014) and
to decline in the EU (by 0.4 pps. from 8.9% of the
labour force in 2014). Overall, in 2016, the
unemployment rate is projected to decline by 0.5
pps. in both the euro area (to 10.5%) and the EU
(to 9.0%). Next year, it should decline further to
10.2% and 8.7% in the two areas respectively.
…and labour market heterogeneity is set to
decrease only gradually.

Given different adjustment mechanisms in the
Member States, such as wage-setting and
collective-bargaining structures, cross-country
heterogeneity in labour market developments is set

Note SDN/16/02.

to persist and to decline only marginally over the
forecast period. (41)
Changes in the minimum wage setting in some
countries, such as Germany, are set to have only a
moderate impact on the employment outlook. (42)
Although the minimum wage can apply to a small
proportion of workers, changes in the minimum
wage may affect a larger proportion of employees,
mainly at the lower pay end and thereby affect the
wage distribution. Minimum wage developments
in some countries (e.g. Estonia, Latvia) are
expected to have an impact on overall wage
growth over the forecast horizon and in turn affect
labour demand. Apart from labour market
institutions, differences in labour market
conditions among Member States can also be
explained by other factors, such as differences in
the pass through of monetary policy and real
interest rates, which could affect capital
accumulation and in turn, the unemployment
gap. (43) Intra-EU labour mobility has somewhat
helped regional labour markets to adjust faster,
although its contribution to smoothing labour
market fluctuations remains low. (44)
Overall, the unemployment rate is expected to
decrease in almost all euro area countries this year
and next, especially in countries that have
benefitted from recent labour market reforms (e.g.
Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, and Greece).

The deviation of projected unemployment rates of euro

INFLATION

Graph I.36: Inflation breakdown, euro area
y-o-y %

With energy prices falling sharply, inflation in the
euro area struggled to rise substantially above zero
towards the end of 2015 (see Graph I.2). Although
there was a small increase from September's
negative rate, the increase in the fourth quarter was
substantially lower than forecast in the autumn,
when base effects had been expected to kick-in due
to the 'atypical' month-on-month movements in the
price index twelve months earlier. (45) But the
renewed decline in commodity prices has extended
the period during which the energy index detracts
strongly from the overall index. Even core
inflation (all items excluding energy and
unprocessed food) softened gradually and
undershot expectations of a further mild pick-up
amid strengthening domestic demand. This
includes some indirect effects, such as the fall in
prices of energy-intensive goods like transport.
With energy prices sliding further in January, it
looks as though inflation will remain at very low
levels for longer than previously anticipated. This
has led to a downward revision in inflation
projections, not only due to the much lower oil
price assumption, but also because core inflation is
now expected to take longer to pick-up in tandem
with increased domestic demand.
Inflation remained stubbornly low…

HICP inflation in the euro area averaged 0.2% in
the fourth quarter of 2015, up slightly from 0.1%
in the third quarter. For the year as a whole,
inflation averaged zero. Headline inflation was
subject to strong variations in the energy index,
which closely reflects movements in oil prices, and
which, as a result, was consistently negative
throughout the year. On the other hand,
unprocessed food price inflation averaged 2.6% in
the final quarter, up from 2.1% in the third. Core
inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food)
in the euro area averaged 0.9% in both the third
and fourth quarters (Graph I.36). It unexpectedly
fell in November and December to 0.9%. The
recent decline in core inflation was basically due to
the slight drop in services, while non-energy
industrial goods inflation increased in the fourth
quarter to average 0.5%, up from 0.4% in the third.
(45)

e.g. Vilmi, L. (2015). ‘Inflation developments in the euro
area – an update’. Quarterly Report on the Euro Area

The persistent weakness of core inflation in the
euro area largely reflects the still negative output
gap and subdued developments in wages,
especially in those countries needing adjustment to
regain competitiveness. The output gap is
projected to close further but to remain negative
over the forecast horizon. The remaining output
gap is expected to dampen the responsiveness of
inflation to increases in domestic demand. At the
same time, recent empirical estimates of the
responsiveness of inflation to measures of spare
capacity in the economy vary substantially,
whereas other variables like the price of oil and
global factors seem to be having more impact.
… with oil prices and global factors weighing
on inflation…

The impact of oil price changes on inflation rates
is usually rather volatile and the pass-through takes
several quarters. Yet the sharp decline since mid2014 and the assumption that oil prices will now
stay low for longer have affected not only the
energy index but also other oil-sensitive
components such as transport and a number of
food and industrial products. Although this effect
on other components might be more pronounced
than before, the responsiveness of overall inflation
to oil should not be over-stated since the oilintensity of most euro area economies is declining
with improvements in the energy efficiency of
buildings and industries and the growing
importance of services in the economy. If
anything, oil prices are currently already close to
multi-year lows and the impact of the oil price
decline on inflation will be almost completely
passed-through in the coming quarters. From
there, any pick-up in oil prices will quickly feed
into price increases.

International price movements and their
transmission have gained more importance for
national inflation rates as economies have become
more integrated in global supply chains. (46) This
also applies to inflation in the euro area. At the
current juncture, a major factor is the overcapacity
in several emerging market economies, particularly
China.

There, the fast build-up of debt amid weakening
growth could put further pressure on indebted
companies to off-load their inventories at cheaper
prices, resulting in downward price pressures on
traded goods. For example, in December, producer
prices fell in China at an annual rate of 6%. In line
with this, the latest data (for November) show that
industrial import prices fell 4.2% in the euro area
(Graph I.37). This decline in industrial import
prices is also contributing to subdued
developments in producer prices in the euro area,
which fell at annual rates of 3.2% in October and
November, more than in the second quarter. This
continuing fall in imported and domestic industrial
prices is expected to exert further downward
pressure on retail prices in 2016.
The annual rate of change in the euro area import
deflator is expected to have fallen to -3.3% in
2015. For 2016, the rate is expected to be negative
again before turning positive in 2017 to 1.7%.
Since import prices are deducted when calculating
the GDP deflator – a broad indicator of
domestically-generated inflationary pressures – the
negative growth rate of the import deflator
increases mechanically the GDP deflator, whose
change in 2015 is expected to have reached 1.2%,
substantially above the 0% rate registered for
HICP inflation. The GDP deflator is projected at

...but also the wage and unemployment gap
nexus.

Domestically, inflationary pressures are also low
because wage growth remains subdued in the euro
area. Wages and salaries grew at an average annual
rate of 2% in the first half of 2015, but only at an
annual rate of 1.4% in the third quarter.
Nonetheless, there are considerable differences
across the euro area. Wages in the third quarter
grew by 2.3% in Germany and by 2.1% in the
Netherlands, whereas in Italy, Spain and Portugal,
wage growth was 0.0%, 0.4% and -2.5%,
respectively. Analysing these wage developments,
there are two factors influencing the weak inflation
outlook. First, downward wage rigidities in
vulnerable countries seem to have softened,
leading to a dampening, if not negative effect on
wage growth given the presence of large, wellestablished unemployment gaps. On the other
hand, in those countries where the unemployment
gap is almost closed or even positive, like
Germany, inflation has failed to increase more
strongly despite the recent robust growth in
nominal wages (see Graph I.38).

Growth in nominal compensation per employee is
projected to have come in only marginally lower in
the euro area in 2015 (1.2%, down from 1.4% in
2014), which is markedly above consumer price
inflation. It is expected to increase to 1.5% in
2016, still above the projected inflation rate, thus
raising the real wage further. Nominal
compensation growth per head is then expected to
grow stronger at 2.1% in 2017 as the output gap
closes further.
Inflation expectations have fallen…

Market-based measures of inflation expectations
staged a recovery after the ECB announced its
expanded Asset Purchase Programme (APP) in
January 2015, but continue to be affected to a great
extent by the sharp drop in oil prices. Short and
longer-term inflation expectations implied by
financial markets dropped again towards the end of
the fourth quarter as the slide in energy prices
accelerated. In January 2016, they declined again
and stood marginally above the lowest-levels seen
in January 2015, signalling low but positive
inflation in the next few years. For the short term,
inflation-linked swap rates at the one yearforward-one-year-ahead horizon stood at 0.7% on
22 January, the cut-off date for this forecast. Swap
rates at the three-year-forward-three-year-ahead
horizon imply an average inflation rate of 1.1%.
On a longer horizon, the widely watched five-yearforward-five-year-ahead
indicator
suggests
inflation of 1.6% (see Graph I.39).
Survey-based measures of inflation expectations,
such as Consensus Economics' forecast means of
HICP inflation in the euro area in 2016 have been
revised down again in January 2016 to 0.8% (from
1.0% in December 2015). For 2017, the forecast
mean is for 1.5%. The ECB's Survey of

…and the inflation forecast for 2016 has been
revised down...

The forecast for inflation in 2016 has been revised
lower since the autumn on account of the renewed
decline in oil prices and because core inflation has
failed to pick-up. The profile for inflation will
again be dominated by base effects related to
recent movements in oil prices. With the assumed
path of commodity prices, inflation is expected to
remain very low in the first half of the year,
especially in the second quarter, but then to step up
higher in the second half of the year when positive
base effects will be dominant. Inflation in the euro
area in 2016 is projected to come in at 0.5% as the
drag from lower energy prices will have run its
course. The upshot is that such low energy prices
should support household disposable incomes and
corporate profit margins in the euro area further
and thus help to lift domestic price pressures.
In 2017, the impact of higher real wages and
domestic demand, together with a moderate
assumed increase in oil prices, should feed into
increasing underlying price pressures. In the fourth
quarter of 2017, inflation is then expected to rise to
an annual rate of 1.6% in the euro area.

…with inflation differentials expected to remain

Aggregate HICP inflation rates mask substantial
differences between euro area Member States. In
2015, HICP inflation rates in the Member States
ranged from -1.6% in Cyprus to 1.2% in Malta. In
2016, inflation rates are expected to range from
-0.3% in Slovenia to 1.7% in Malta; and in 2017
from 0.8% in Greece to 2.5% in Estonia. The
difference in rates reflect several factors including
GDP growth, wage growth pressures, convergence
in price levels, and the different impact of
exchange rate and commodity price movements,
which depend on the composition of consumption
and industrial structures. Another factor behind
recent inflation differences are relative price
adjustments within the euro area, where in several
stressed countries, external re-balancing required
increases in price competitiveness.

PUBLIC FINANCES

The reduction in the general government
deficit continues…

The general government deficit is expected to
continue declining over the forecast horizon in the
euro area and the EU, albeit at a slightly slower
pace than in recent years (Graph I.41). The
ongoing economic recovery and, to a lower extent,
the decline in interest expenditure resulting from
the non-standard monetary policy measures carried
out by the ECB are set to underpin the projected
reduction in the general government deficit. In
some Member States, the unwinding of one-off
budgetary impacts, notably associated with
financial sector support, is also forecast to yield a
visible deficit-reducing effect. These effects,

General goverment balance (lhs)
Change in the structural balance (rhs)

In 2015, the aggregate general government deficit
is expected to have declined to 2.2% of GDP in the
euro area and 2.5% in the EU. In 2016, the general
government deficit is projected to decline further
to 1.9% in the euro area and to 2.2% of GDP in the
EU. Looking ahead into 2017, under a no-policychange assumption, the general government deficit
is set to narrow further to 1.6% and 1.8% of GDP
in the euro area and the EU, respectively.
…while the past improvement in structural
balances peters out.

As the envisaged reduction in the general
government deficit is set to be mostly driven by
the cyclical recovery in both the euro area and the
EU, the estimated structural balance is expected to
have remained broadly stable in 2015. In effect,
the fiscal policy stance, as measured by the change
in the structural balance (i.e. the general
government budget balance corrected for cyclical
factors, one-offs and other temporary measures) is
expected to have been broadly neutral in both areas
last year. In 2016, a slightly expansionary fiscal
stance is expected in the euro area, while the
structural balance is set to remain roughly
unchanged in the EU. The difference between both
areas is due to the improvement in the structural
balance forecast in some non-euro area Member
States, particularly the United Kingdom, Czech
Republic and Denmark. Next year, under a nopolicy-change assumption, the structural balance is
projected to remain broadly stable in both the euro
area and the EU.

EA and EU outlook

Cyclical developments and lower interest
expenditure are set to contribute about 0.4% and
0.1% of GDP respectively to the 0.3% (year-onyear) reduction in the euro area’s overall general
government deficit in both 2016 and 2017
(Graph I.42). However, notably due to fiscal policy
action, these deficit-reducing effects are expected
to be partially offset by a deterioration in the
primary structural balance of 0.3% of GDP in 2016
and of 0.2% of GDP in 2017, under a no-policychange assumption.

fiscal restraint is envisaged in the other four

Overall, the fiscal policy stance in the euro area as
a whole is expected to become slightly supportive
to the economic recovery in the short term.
However, there are considerable differences
among countries. Among the euro area Member
States where output gaps are projected to remain in
negative territory in 2016, a looser fiscal policy
stance is expected in seven countries, while
additional fiscal tightening is projected in the
remaining seven. In turn, among the Member
States where real GDP is expected to be above
potential in 2016, an accommodative fiscal policy
stance is expected in one country, while some

The “snow-ball effect” captures the impact of interest expenditure on accumulated debt, as well as the impact of real GDP
growth and inflation on the debt ratio (through the denominator). The stock-flow adjustment includes differences in cash and
accrual accounting, accumulation of financial assets and valuation and other residual effects.
Note: A positive sign (+) implies an increase in the general government gross debt ratio, a negative sign (-) a reduction.

and

revenue

The expected reduction in the aggregate general
government deficit over the forecast horizon is set
to be mostly driven by lower government
expenditure in both the euro area and the EU,
which should come from the operation of
automatic stabilisers as the economic recovery
progresses. The decline in government expenditure
should, however, be partly offset by the budgetary
impact of the inflow of asylum seekers in the most
affected countries. Based on the information
provided by Member States, the overall impact is
expected to amount to between 0.1% and 0.3% of
GDP in both 2015 and 2016 in the majority of the
Member States concerned.
The expenditure-to-GDP ratio in the euro area is
expected to decline over the forecast horizon from
48.7% in 2015 to 47.8% in 2017. The decline
reflects decreasing social transfers, lower interest
expenditure, cost-containment in public wages and
the phasing-out of one-off factors, such as
spending related to financial sector support in
some Member States. By contrast, public
investment is expected to increase slightly in some
Member States as disbursements under the new
programming period of EU funding resume,
providing an additional stimulus to economic
growth. However, public investment should
decrease markedly in those Member States where
disbursements are expected to decrease following
the expiration of the previous EU funding period
(2007-2013). Overall, the public investment-toGDP ratio for the euro area as a whole is projected
to decline, with decreases foreseen in most
Member States (Graph I.44).

The reduction in aggregate government
expenditure is accompanied by a decline in
government revenue, mainly stemming from the
fiscal stimulus packages adopted by some Member
States to boost growth momentum and net job
creation. These fiscal policy measures are targeted
at lowering the tax wedge on labour and are
expected to bring a positive economic effect in the
short term and contribute to a gradual shift towards
more growth-friendly public finances.
Overall, the revenue-to-GDP ratio in the euro area
is set to gradually decrease to 46.2% in 2017,
under a no-policy-change assumption, down from
its peak at 46.8% in 2014. The projected decrease
reflects a declining weight of social contributions
and taxes on labour income, as a result of the
above-mentioned fiscal policy measures.

…and public debt is set on a declining path.

The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decrease steadily in the euro area and
the EU over the forecast horizon, thanks to higher
primary surpluses and a more favourable growthinterest rate differential (i.e. the combined debtreducing effects of higher real GDP growth and
inflation should offset the still sizeable, yet
gradually diminishing, interest burden on the
outstanding debt load (Table I.9)). In 2015,
specifically, the reduction in the debt ratio is
estimated to have been reinforced by a stock-flow
adjustment stemming from privatisation receipts
and the use of cash reserves in a few Member
States.
The aggregate general government debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to decline from the peaks reached
in 2014 of 94.5% in the euro area and 88.6% in the
EU. The decrease in the public debt ratio over the
forecast horizon is projected to be slightly stronger
in the euro area than in the EU, with the general
government debt-to-GDP ratio falling to 93.5% in
2015 and, under a no-policy-change assumption, to
91.3% in 2017. In the EU, the general government
debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline to 87.2%
in 2015 and, under a no-policy-change assumption,
to 85.7% in 2017.

RISKS

The economic outlook for the euro area remains
highly uncertain. Since the autumn forecast, some
upside risks (e.g. lower oil prices, the weaker euro)
and downside risks (additional slowing of global
growth) have materialised, but new risks have
emerged and some previous downside risks have
increased. In particular, risks to the euro area
growth outlook from the global economy have
clearly increased in recent months. As a result, the
probability distribution surrounding the central
scenario of the forecast has changed such that the
chances of things turning out worse than forecast
are now greater than the chances that they might
turn out better.
The most significant downside risks come
mainly from the external environment…

On the downside, the risk that slowing growth in
China and other emerging markets could trigger
stronger spillovers or turn out worse than currently
forecast, are particularly significant. A ‘hard
landing’ in China would create substantial risks for

the continuation of the global recovery and the
dynamics of global trade. Combined with the
uncertainty regarding the adjustment in China, the
continuation of monetary policy normalisation in
the US could have a more negative impact on
vulnerable emerging market economies than
envisaged in the central scenario and also affect
the stability of financial markets. The
materialisation of any of these downside risks
could negatively spillover to Europe via various
transmission channels (including trade, financial
markets and confidence).
Risks of fading tailwind support for the recovery
have been somewhat reduced by recent
developments in oil prices and the probability of
further policy support, but downside risks remain
in place. A faster-than-assumed rebound of energy
prices would hurt spending plans of households
and companies in the euro area and weigh on
economic activity. But also the opposite, a further
sharp fall in commodity prices, could impact
negatively on the euro area’s growth outlook, as it
would endanger the financial stability of oilexporting countries and could thereby not only
lower European exports but also trigger turmoil in
financial markets.
Geopolitical tensions are keeping uncertainty at
high levels and could become a larger impediment
to investment spending than currently expected.
On the domestic side, risks have also increased.
Legacies of the crisis may continue to weigh more
heavily on investment activity than expected, for
example, through persistent deleveraging needs in
the corporate sector and non-performing loans on
bank balance sheets, which inhibit credit supply in
some Member States.
Moreover, if major political challenges were not
successfully coped with at the EU level (e.g.
handling of migration flows), that could trigger
developments that become impediments to
economic growth. The public perception of the
increased number of refugees could impact
negatively on economic confidence and thereby
lower the growth momentum of private
consumption. A long-term reintroduction of internal
border controls and measures that endanger the
achievements of the internal market could potentially
have a disruptive impact on economic growth. Any
unexpected relapse into crisis in Greece could
weigh more heavily on investment decisions and
thus on economic growth.

…whereas upside risks relate more
assumptions and domestic developments.

to

But there are also risks to the upside — for
example, a faster rebound in global growth and/or
world trade, or larger-than-expected benefits from
low oil prices or monetary policy.
It is assumed that crude oil prices will rise only
slightly over the forecast period and that exchange
rates will remain constant. If the euro were to
depreciate markedly, this could provide a stronger
spur to exports than projected. A further fall in oil
prices, due, for example, to a faster or more
substantial rebound of supply from Iran following
the removal of sanctions, could have a more
positive effect on activity in the euro area,
although it would most likely result in a further
decline of exports to oil producing economies.
Economic growth could exceed the forecast if the
combination of tailwinds from low oil/commodity
prices, low financing costs, and depreciations visà-vis the US dollar translates into stronger
momentum than currently envisaged.
A more favourable impact from past or future
structural reforms, or from the Investment Plan for
Europe, could also provide an additional push to
economic growth.
A smoother-than-expected transition of refugees to
employment, or higher spending on refugees than
currently budgeted, are additional upside risks to
the short-term outlook for aggregate GDP.
The balance of risks to growth has moved
further to the downside…

In the short term, the persistence of tailwinds has
somewhat lowered downside risks since the
autumn. However, overall, the risks around the
central projection for economic growth appear to
have further tilted to the downside.
The balance of risks is visible in the asymmetric
confidence intervals in the fan chart (see Graph
I.45), which depicts the probabilities associated
with various outcomes for euro area economic
growth over the forecast horizon and shows the
most likely development in the darkest area.

…whereas risks to the inflation outlook remain
broadly balanced.

The extent and speed at which the assumed
rebound in commodity prices will feed through to
inflation remains highly uncertain and there are
risks in both directions. Moreover, commodity
prices could be higher if adverse geopolitical
developments or a stronger rebound of global
economic activity push up the price of oil, or lower
if abundant supply or weaker commodity demand
prove persistent and depress prices.
HICP inflation will also continue to be affected by
the pass-through from the euro’s past depreciation.
Any further movements in the exchange rate
would imply deviations from the assumed
exchange rate path.
Further downside risks relate to lower wage and
price setting. Wage growth could remain subdued
if slack remains larger than forecast or if inflation
expectations fall further. And persistent downside
misses to price stability threaten a downward
ratcheting of inflation expectations, which could
slow the return of inflation to levels compatible
with price stability or make is at least more
difficult than expected in the central scenario.
Overall, there are significant risks to the inflation
outlook in both directions but they appear to be
broadly balanced.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.1: The real interest rate mechanism and adjustment in EMU
This box aims to shed new light on the ways in
which differences in real interest rates across the
euro area affect the ability of its Member States to
adjust to shocks. The pro-cyclicality of real interest
rates is a well-documented problem in Europe’s
Economic and Monetary Union: comparatively
better cyclical conditions in some Member States
drive their inflation rates up compared with the
euro area average, and in turn their real interest rate
down, which further aggravate the original cyclical
differences. Before the global financial crisis,
differences in real interest rates were driven mainly
by persistent inflation differentials. Since the crisis,
real interest rate differentials have been further
magnified by the fragmentation of borrowing costs
for sovereigns and banks as well as of bank lending
rates. This last factor in particular was until
recently a major impediment to the recovery given
the dominant role of bank loans in financing the
euro area economy. Nevertheless, recent
convergence of lending rates and conditions
combined with the projection of a gradual increase
in inflation across Member States implies a further
decrease of the pro-cyclical dispersion of real
interest rates over the forecast horizon.
This box presents results of an econometric
analysis of the drivers of lending rates for nonfinancial
corporations
and
households
(2007-14). The results suggest that, in addition to
the effect of temporary fears of redenomination
(i.e. the risk that a Member State could leave the
euro area and that all its assets and liabilities would
be redenominated in a new currency), a significant
part of the divergence in bank lending rates since
the crisis can be ascribed to country-specific factors
including divergences in sovereign spreads, in the
quality of bank balance sheets and in business
cycles. The effect of some of these factors should
be mitigated or even eliminated by governance
changes in the EMU but others are likely to persist.

demand shock would also face lower inflation than
the rest of the euro area and thereby higher real
interest rates. (1) This real interest rate mechanism
would further dampen demand, reinforcing
divergence vis-a-vis other Member States. Model
simulations generally showed that the real interest
rate mechanism would slow adjustment to
asymmetric shocks but would ultimately not
prevent them.
These assumptions held up quite well before the
crisis as bond yields and bank lending rates
gradually converged across the euro area while
inflation differentials persisted. Graph 1 compares
the mean nominal and real lending rate (for nonfinancial corporation and households) for 12 euroarea countries before and after the global financial
crisis. In the pre-crisis period (upper panel of
Graph 1), it is apparent that while nominal lending
rates were broadly similar across Member States,
some countries faced substantially lower real
interest rates as a result of their positive inflation
differentials. (2) For example, whereas nominal
rates were similar in Spain and Germany,
persistently higher inflation in Spain pushed real
interest rates close to zero, to around 2 pps. below
German ones. Therefore, the Spanish economy
enjoyed an overall much more favourable cyclical
position at that time (average output gap in period
2003-2007 was 2.5% for Spain and -1% for
Germany) and substantially easier monetary
conditions. (3)

(2)

The real interest rate mechanism before and
after the crisis

At the launch of the EMU, it was largely assumed
that currency unification would lead to
convergence in a broad range of macroeconomic
variables. It was also assumed that if some Member
State was hit by an asymmetric shock, appropriate
policies and market-based adjustment would
ultimately allow it to be absorbed. However, there
was also a concern that, with a common nominal
interest rate, inflation differentials could have a
destabilising effect that could slow the adjustment
process. A Member State experiencing a negative

economic activity differentials. This investment
channel can be simply illustrated by comparing the
changes in the ratios of real investment to GDP
between pre-crisis period (2003-2007) and postcrisis (2008-2014) and the corresponding changes
in real interest rates for 12 euro area countries
(Graph 2). There is a clear negative correlation
across euro area Member States suggesting that the
higher the increase in real interest rates relative to
the pre-crisis period, the more severe the decline in
investment activity. (5)

Change in average real investment-to-GDP ratio

By contrast, the global financial crisis and, above
all, the euro area debt crisis unleashed powerful
fragmentation forces on financial markets that
partly reversed the pre-crisis convergence trend in
nominal borrowing costs. (4) As shown in the lower
panel of Graph 1, the real interest rate dispersion
between Member States has increased since the
global financial crisis, and this increase is mainly a
reflection of an increase in nominal interest rate
differentials. As the largest rate increases have also
taken place in the most cyclically depressed
countries (Greece, Portugal), the nominal
differentials have tended to amplify the traditional
real interest divergences caused by inflation
differentials.

consequently real interest rate dispersions in the
euro area since then. Given the dominant role of
bank loans in financing the euro area economy, the
analysis focuses on bank lending rates for nonfinancial corporations and households.
An econometric analysis of the determinants of
lending rates in the euro area

The econometric analysis uses a set of vector
autoregressive (VAR) models that link the lending
rates both for non-financial corporations and
households to their possible determinants. In line
with the recent literature on the interest rate passthrough, (6) these variables include: (i) monetary
policy (as proxied by money market rates), (ii) real
economic activity, (iii) sovereign credit risk, (iv)
banking-sector credit risk, (v) banking-sector
funding costs, and (vi) borrower credit risk.
The VAR analysis is carried out for the euro area as
a whole and for individual Member States. The
analysis uses monthly data from September 2007 to
June 2014. (7) It therefore covers almost the entire
period since the global financial crisis and includes
phases of greater and lesser financial turmoil in the
euro area. Data availability allows for the inclusion
of nine euro area countries: Austria, Germany,
Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands and Portugal.
The euro area-wide VAR model suggests that only
around half of overall developments in bank
lending rates since the beginning of the global
financial crisis can be linked to monetary policy,
the rest is a reflection of redenomination fears and

sovereign credit risk and reinforced the overall
nominal interest rate divergences across Member
States mainly between 2010 and 2012. (8)
The country VAR models confirm that a major part
of the divergences in bank lending rates from the
euro area-wide developments (pronounced mainly
in the periphery) can be explained by three factors:
(i) sovereign credit risk differences (while the
divergence of sovereign spreads reached extreme
values during the period of perceived
redenomination risk, some degree of divergence
had been present since the onset of the global
financial crisis in 2008 and persists at moderate
levels to the present day), (ii) banking-sector credit
risk differences and (iii), real economic activity
differences. In particular, bank lending rates
increase following an increase in sovereign and
banking risk and a decline in real economic
activity. The increase of sovereign and banking risk
make bank funding more costly, which makes the
banking sector raise lending rates to the private
sector as well. When real activity declines,
borrower risk increases, which again implies higher
lending rates for the private sector as banks
increase their mark ups to reflect this higher
borrower risks. Consequently, all three factors
affect bank lending rates in a pro-cyclical way,
increasing it when financial markets are stressed
and the economy is in downturn. It is important to
note that the effect of these risk factors that hinder
the transmission of common monetary policy, is
not only related to the most acute phases of the
euro area debt crisis, but the whole period since the
global financial crisis.
Conclusions

Since the beginning of the EMU, the convergence
of nominal interest rates in a context of persistent
inflation differentials led to pro-cyclical real
interest rate differentials. Since the global financial
crisis, the euro area has seen a significant
fragmentation of its financial markets, including
renewed divergences of borrowing costs that have
added to inflation differentials in driving this real
interest rate dispersion. Therefore, the real interest
rate mechanism has contributed to the intra-euro
area imbalances and consequently hindered the
rebalancing.

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

Box (continued)

Given the importance of bank loans for the
financing of the euro area economy, this box has
presented some new econometric evidence on the
drivers of nominal bank lending rate for nonfinancial corporations and households. The results
suggest that since the global financial crisis bank
lending rates in the euro area countries have been
driven to some degree by factors unrelated to the
single monetary policy, and that these factors have
a significant country-level dimension.
Pro-cyclical real interest rate differentials have
reduced over the last few years as most of the
country-specific risk factors have dissipated.
Following the gradual re-convergence of sovereign
yields and bank funding cost across the euro area,
bank lending rates continued decreasing in 2015,
particularly in the periphery. In line with the
current forecast, inflation rates are expected to turn
positive in 2016 in most Member States, helping to
decrease further the real interest rates, which in
some countries were still being driven up by
deflationary developments in 2015. The euro area’s
negative output gap is expected to close gradually
over the next few years suggesting that most
Member States should start seeing inflationary
pressures again that could help to further reduce the
pro-cyclical dispersion of real interest rates.

48

However, the nominal and real interest rate
differences across Member States might reappear in
the future cycles. High public (and private)
indebtedness together with high levels of
non-performing loans in some countries cast doubts
on the sustainability of current funding costs. Still,
the role of sovereign risk and banking risk as
drivers of nominal interest rate differences should
be permanently mitigated by policy and governance
changes such as the completion of the Banking
Union. (9) Nevertheless, some dispersion of nominal
borrowing costs will remain as long as there are
cyclical differences across Member States.
Countries experiencing idiosyncratic downturns
can expect higher interest rates as a consequence of
higher borrower risk. Thus, interest rate differences
are unavoidable and might represent a natural part
of adjustment to shocks in a currency union.
Nevertheless large and persistent real interest rate
differentials reinforcing the cyclical divergences
among the Member States represent a major drag to
the effective functioning of the EMU and need to
be avoided in the future.

The European Economic Forecasts prepared by the

Continuing a tradition of regular assessments ,

Accuracy of Commission forecasts

The forecast accuracy test can be performed using
different summary statistics, such as the Mean
Error, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the
Root Mean Square Error. Only the frequently-used
MAE, which measures the average forecast error, is
discussed here. (5)

The study, which compares the Commission’s track
record to that of the IMF, OECD and the consensus
of market forecasters, finds that the Commission’s
GDP growth forecast accuracy over the whole time
period and for all forecast horizons tends to be
more accurate than the market and very similar to
both the IMF and the OECD.

at the whole sample up to 2014. This is done for all
EU Member States as well as for the euro area and

comparison between the forecasting performance
before (2000-2007) and after the Great Recession
(2008-2014). Second, it examines to what extent
forecast errors can be explained by external or
technical assumptions whose realisations turned out
to be different. Finally, it updates the comparison

The forecast error of current-year GDP growth (6),
- as measured by the MAE over the whole sample
(1969-2014) - is 0.4 pps. for the euro area
(Graph 1) and 0.5 pps. for the EU. This means that
the Commission’s current-year forecast (forecasts
in spring for that same year) for euro-area real GDP
growth has, on average, proven to be 0.4 pps. off
target. The extension of the observation period to
include 2012-2014 leaves unchanged the forecast
errors of the current year GDP growth for the euro
area and EU aggregates compared to the previous
study. At the Member State level, similar
conclusions are reached for a majority of ‘old’
(5)

(6)

The mean absolute error (MAE) is the absolute
difference between the average forecast and the
average outturn. Negative errors are treated as
positive ones so that errors cannot cancel each other
out. The MAE is thus a more accurate measure of the
average forecast error than a simple mean error.
Current-year forecasts refer to the spring forecasts
carried out for the current year, whereas year-ahead
forecasts come from the autumn forecasts carried out
for the following year. Current-year forecasts are
assessed against the so-called ‘first available
estimates’ of the actual outcome presented in the
spring forecast of the subsequent year. Year-ahead
forecasts are assessed against the so-called ‘first
settled estimates’ of the actual outcome presented in
the autumn forecast following the year to be forecast.

Member States (15 EU members before 2004). For
the ‘new’ Member States that acceded in 2004 and
2007, however, an improvement in the current-year
forecast accuracy of GDP growth was found in all
but one Member State; Cyprus where the economic
downturn was very sharp and the uncertainty very
large.
For year-ahead forecasts (forecasts in autumn for
the next year), the MAE is significantly larger
compared to current-year forecasts, as less
information is available at the time of forecasting.
It stands at 1.0 pp. for the euro area and 0.9 pps. for
the EU. The extension of the dataset to 2014 shows
no change in the accuracy of the forecast for both
the euro area and EU aggregates compared to the
previous study. At the Member State level, an
improvement in accuracy is found for a majority of
countries (including all ‘new’ Member States,
except Cyprus). However, the MAE for some ‘old’
Member States (Greece, Spain and Italy) did
increase.
Focussing on more recent years, GDP growth
forecast errors appear to be larger in the crisis and
post-crisis period (2008-2014) than in the pre-crisis
period (2000-2007) for a large majority of Member
States (7) and for both current and year-ahead
forecasts, with a sharper deterioration in the latter
(see Graph 2). This mainly results from an
anomalously large forecast error in the year 2009,
which was on annual terms the dip of the recession.
There are, however, some exceptions where
forecast accuracy improved in recent years for the
current year (euro area, France, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Slovakia and Czech Republic) and for the
year ahead (Malta and Slovakia). Poland is the only
country for which forecast accuracy improved in
recent years for both horizons. In the crisis and
post-crisis time periods, programme countries
generally exhibit among the largest increases in the
MAE, compared to the pre-crisis period for both
the current and year-ahead forecasts. (8)
Based on standard statistical tests, Commission
forecasts are found to be largely unbiased meaning
that there is no measurable systematic over- or
underestimation of GDP growth. A panel data

approach is also used, which pools the data for all
EU Member States in order to circumvent the small
size of the shorter observation samples. For the
whole sample, it also confirms that there is no
evidence of bias for current-year GDP forecasts
across EU Member States. According to this test,
however, year-ahead forecasts appear to have been
slightly overestimating GDP growth. For the
shorter samples, this analysis shows that GDP
growth tended to be underestimated in the precrisis years 2000-2007 while GDP growth was
overestimated in the crisis and post-crisis years
2008-2014.

If forecasters repeat the same mistakes, forecast
errors will be auto-correlated. No evidence was
found of such persistence of errors in the
Commission forecast for the EU and euro area
aggregates, either for the current year or for the
year-ahead projections, and this for the whole
sample and the shorter period (2000-2014). At the
Member State level, only a few cases of autocorrelation in forecast errors were found.
Additional statistical tests that shed more light on
forecasting performance show that Commission
forecasts generally beat a naïve forecast which only

reproduces the latest GDP growth realisation.
Commission forecasts are directionally accurate
meaning that a pick-up or a slowdown in GDP
growth has been predicted accurately. However,
they are not always ‘efficient’ in using all available
information at the time of the forecast.
Influence of external assumptions on forecast
errors

Macroeconomic forecasts are conditioned by
ex-ante technical or external assumptions about the
future development of exogenous factors linked to
the global economy, financial markets, commodity
prices or fiscal policy. The ex-post accuracy of
these assumptions is likely to influence forecasting
performance. (9) A panel regression is run to
analyse the influence of the difference between the
assumed value of these exogenous factors at the
time of forecasting and their realisation. The
forecast error for GDP growth is regressed on the
unexpected change in: (i) the structural fiscal
balance (SB); (ii) GDP growth outside the EU
(RoW); (iii) the nominal effective exchange rate of
the euro (NEER); (iv) the oil price (OIL) and; (v)
long-term interest rates (LTIR). The sample ranges
from 2007 to 2014 and includes all EU Member
States except Croatia. Table 1 shows the regression
results.

errors seem to be explained by external
assumptions that proved to be incorrect ex post.
For current-year forecasts, higher-than-anticipated
fiscal consolidation improves the structural balance
and leads to lower-than-forecast GDP growth in the
short-run for programme countries. By contrast,
unanticipated higher fiscal consolidation appears to
lead to higher-than-forecast GDP growth in
non-programme countries as well as across all EU
Member States. (10) For year-ahead GDP forecasts,
higher-than-expected fiscal consolidation has a
large significant impact on the GDP forecast error
and has the expected sign for all groups of
countries.
Unexpected changes in long-term interest rates play
an important role in explaining forecast errors for
both current and year-ahead forecasts. As expected,
when growth in the rest of the world turns out to be
higher than initially projected, GDP growth across
EU Member States tends to be underestimated, but
the size and significance of the impact varies across
different time horizons. Deviations from the
technical assumption on the exchange rate are not
found to be a systematic driver of forecast errors.
Finally, the impact of unexpected changes in the oil
price on GDP forecast errors appears to be small.
Comparison with other forecasters

The decomposition of forecast errors shows a
limited impact of mistakes in external assumptions
on GDP growth forecast errors for the current year.

The use of these technical assumptions is common

are compared for similar observation periods. As
already observed in the previous study, the
Commission’s forecast accuracy over the whole
sample is found to be very similar to that of the
OECD and IMF for all forecast horizons. The
projections,
however,

continued to score better than the average of private
sector forecasts (compiled by Consensus
Economics).
In the short and more recent sample period
(2000-2014), however, the accuracy of market
forecasters for current-year forecasts appears to
have improved and become more similar to those
of the Commission, OECD and IMF. For the yearahead, Commission forecasts come out as more
accurate than the IMF or Consensus in the shorter
sample but less accurate than the OECD’s (see
Graph 3). Informational advantages linked to the
different cut-off dates of the institutions’ forecast
as well as the assumptions that institutions make (11)
clearly play a role in the difference of forecasting
performance across institutions.

The forecast accuracy, however, seems to have

EA and EU outlook

Box I.3: Intangible investment and the macroeconomic outlook
The importance of intangible investment, such as,
for example, R&D or software, for understanding
productivity, competitiveness and economic growth
has been recognised for a long time by the
economic literature and statisticians. (1) The
consideration of investment in intangibles
contributes to a better understanding of differences
in (trend) productivity developments across
countries. As intangible investment is less prone to
boom and bust cycles than ‘traditional’ capital
formation and has held up rather well in the crisis,
its inclusion also matters for gauging the depth of
the post-2008 investment shortfall. This matters for
economic forecasting and the derivation of
economic policy advice.
The asset boundary in official national accounts has
been continuously expanded in recent decades in
order to better account for the role of intangibles.
Current national accounts according to the 2008
SNA/ESA 2010 standard record a range of specific
intangibles under the asset category ‘intellectual
property products’, namely R&D, mineral
exploration, computer software and databases,
entertainment, literary and artistic originals. Similar
to investments in tangible assets, expenditures by
businesses or government on these intangibles are
treated as gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and
make for a sizable and rising share in overall
investment.
Investments in intellectual property products
currently account for close to 4% of GDP and 19%
of total annual fixed investment in the EU28. The
share of intangibles in non-residential investment
currently stands at 25%. Over half of investments
in intangibles currently recorded by national
accounts consist of R&D. By comparison, the GDP
share of intellectual property products in the US
currently stands at somewhat over 5% of GDP (and
31% of non-residential investment).
Intangible investment, as a significant and growing
component of overall investment, are increasingly
relevant for analysing current economic trends and
forecasting future growth. As shown in Graph 1,
intangibles have been growing more dynamically
than investments in (non-residential) tangible
assets. In fact, over the past two decades, the
volume of annual GFCF in intellectual property
products increased by 130% in the US and 87% in

System of National Accounts for the New Economy:
what should change?”. Review of Income and Wealth

the EU-28. By comparison, the annual volume of
tangible non-residential investment in the US
stands at 70% above the level of 1995 and
increased by only 30% in the EU.
Investments in intangibles have been, in general,
less cyclical than tangible investment. Their
relative resilience to the economic crisis that started
in 2008 is remarkable, compared to investments in
tangibles.

The rising importance of intangibles is also
reflected in their contribution to GDP growth. As
shown in Graph 2, GFCF in intangible assets (acc.
to the ESA 2010 definition) accounts on average
for more than a third of the overall contribution of
investment to real GDP growth. Graph 2 also helps
to illustrate the effect of the change of the national
accounts asset boundary between the recently
implemented 2008 SNA/ESA 2010 and the
previous SNA1993/ESA95 (2); mainly due to the
capitalisation of R&D (which was previously not
treated as investment but as intermediate
consumption), the average contribution of
intangible GFCF to GDP growth has approximately
doubled.
Conceptual considerations and the increased
quantitative relevance of intangible investment
have led some researchers to call for a further
expansion of the asset boundary in national
accounts beyond those intangibles which are
currently treated as GFCF. Based on the broad
notion that any use of resources that reduces
current consumption in order to increase it in the
future should qualify as an investment, this line of
research suggests that a number of additional types

Box (continued)

of intangibles should be capitalised and treated as
GFCF (3) Since the notion is broad, the possible
coverage of intangibles is extremely diverse,
potentially representing a large proportion of
current expenditure (see below).

6%, (6) both in the EU and the US (Graph 3). They
would on average also exceed the value of those
intangibles which are already treated as GFCF in
national accounts.

One widely used conceptualisation of an extended
set of intangible assets proposes to add to the
existing intangibles in national accounts (“NA
intangibles”) certain previously unmeasured asset
types (“non-NA intangibles”), namely investments
in new product developments in financial services,
advertising and market research, firm specific
human capital, and organizational know-how. (4)
Academic estimates for the non-NA intangibles
have been developed, notably, in the context of the
INTAN-Invest project. (5) A look at the INTANInvest data gives an indication of the potential
impact on the composition of overall investment
and the level of gross value added (GVA) if the
asset boundary was expanded to include these nonNA intangibles. Calculations for the non-residential
business sector (i.e. excluding dwellings and public
sector GFCF which are not covered by the INTANInvest data) suggest that including the non-NA
intangibles would, on average, increase the level of
non-residential business sector GVA by around

Note that for some countries, such an extended
definition of intangible assets would imply that
close to or even more than half of all nonresidential business sector investments would
consist of intangibles (NL, FI, US, FR, UK, SE)
(Graph 4).
As with the NA intangibles, the non-NA
intangibles also show a clear positive upward
dynamic (although on average not necessarily
stronger than the traditional NA intangibles)
compared to tangible investment. Therefore, and in
addition to further increasing the level of overall
investment, GVA and GDP, any inclusion of
additional (sub-) categories of intangibles could be
expected to further increase the already significant

(6)
(3)

EU15 non-NA intangibles

The reason why treating additional intangibles as
GFCF would increase the level of business sector
GVA and consequently overall GDP is essentially the
same which led to an upward shift in GDP due to the
capitalisation of R&D in the context of the recent
implementation of the 2008 SNA/ESA 2010:
Business expenditures on these (additional)
intangibles are reclassified from intermediate
consumption (which are used up in the current
production process and do not add to GVA) to gross
fixed capital formation (which does add to GVA).

measurement and its impact on national accounts

Moreover, expanding the asset boundary for
additional relevant intangible asset types might
help to better explain innovation and productivity
differentials among countries and across different
sectors of the economy. Conceptually, the omission
of relevant intangibles in productivity and growth
accounting would tend to overstate multifactor
productivity (MFP) growth (7) and the contribution
of tangible capital and labour (composition) to
GDP growth. In fact, adding further intangible
assets (e.g. in growth accounting) usually decreases
the contribution of MFP growth because the
contribution of such intangible assets is no longer
hidden in the MFP residual. (8) Accordingly,
controlling for intangible capital in growth
accounting frameworks affects the observed
patterns of economic growth and productivity. For
instance, based on a panel data analysis of a sample
of EU countries, Roth and Thum (2013) confirmed
a positive and significant relationship between
(7)

(8)

Given all relevant inputs were correctly accounted
for, multifactor productivity (MFP), measured as a
residual which accounts for effects in total output not
caused by changes in the measured inputs, represents
an economy’s long-term technological change or
technological dynamism. By omitting a relevant
factor (e.g. new intangibles as part of 'capital input'),
the residual (i.e. MFP) tends to be overestimated.
See e.g. van Ark, B.(2015). “From Mind the Gap to
Closing the Gap: Avenues to Reverse Stagnation in
Europe through Investment and Productivity
Growth”. European Commission (DG ECFIN),
European Economy Discussion Paper 006/2015; for
empirical evidence, see also Corrado et al. (2009), p.
680.

intangible capital investment and labour
productivity growth (9)(10).The empirical analysis
thus confirms previous findings of Corrado et al.
(2009) that the (further) inclusion of business
intangible capital investment in the asset boundary
of the national accounting framework results in a
more rapidly increasing rate of change of output
per hour worked.
If all relevant types of intangibles were
incorporated into the national accounting
framework, tangible and intangible capital
deepening
would
together
become
the
unambiguously dominant source of growth. In fact,
evidence suggests that intangible and tangible
capital can jointly explain about 90 percent of
labour productivity growth (11) and that a significant
portion of the unexplained variance in labour
productivity growth is due to unobserved
intangibles. Hence, adding further types of
categories of intangibles into analyses of national
income, wealth and growth accounting, both as an
input and possibly as well as an output, may help to
better understand the dynamics of productivity and
economic growth. Corrado et al. (2009) outlined in
this regard that ‘non-traditional’ types of
intangibles, such as non-scientific R&D, brand
equity and firm-specific resources, together account
for nearly 60 percent of total intangible capital
deepening since 1995 and that therefore growth
accountants should not lose sight of these other
forms of intangible capital. Furthermore, it is worth
noting that the fraction of output growth per hour
(9)

(10)

(11)

The results also proved to be robust to a range of
alterations and hold when controlled e.g. for
endogeneity.
This is consistent with the possibility of total factor
productivity spillovers from intangible investment
beyond GDP (as suggested e.g. by van Ark, 2015)
and corresponding empirical evidence (Corrado et al.,
2013).
See Roth, F. and A.-E. Thum (2013). “Intangible
Capital and Labor Productivity Growth: Panel
Evidence for the EU from 1998–2005”. Review of
Income and Wealth 59(3), pp. 489-508. The authors
found that intangible capital could explain around 50

arrived to similar orders of magnitude, e.g. van Ark,

“Measuring intangible capital and its contribution to
economic growth in Europe”. European Investment
Bank (EIB) Papers 14(1), pp. 62-93. Corrado et al.
(2009), based on analysis of US data, have found
that the inclusion of intangible investment in the real
output of the non-farm business sector increases the
estimated growth rate of output per hour by 10–20
percent relative to the baseline case which completely
ignores intangibles. Roth and Thum (2013) suggest
that, once including intangible capital, the impact of
tangible capital diminishes to 40 percent and MFP
changes from 35 to 10 percent.

attributable to the old ‘bricks and mortar’ forms of
capital investment is comparably small. (12) While it
is arguably inappropriate to automatically attribute
the remaining just to ‘knowledge capital’ or ‘the
knowledge economy’, it appears equally
inappropriate to ignore the association between
innovation, human capital, and knowledge
acquisition on the one hand, and investments in
intangibles, IT capital, labour quality change, and
multifactor productivity on the other.
In conclusion, taking into account a broader set of
intangible capital could therefore help to better
capture the ongoing shift from tangible to
intangible investment, thereby improving our
understanding of the transition of developed
economies into knowledge societies and drawing
the attention towards policies for strengthening
investments in intangible assets.

boundary for additional intangible assets and
eventually producing official and internationally

harmonised data of high quality would depend on
solving a range of significant existing conceptual
and measurement challenges, e.g. related to the
correct definition and valuation of such assets,
identifying appropriate price deflators and
measuring their depreciation. (13) It is clear that
existing academic estimates range in quality and
conceptual soundness depending on the type of
intangible under consideration. The forthcoming
multi-annual revision process of the current
national accounts systems 2008 SNA/ESA 2010 is
expected to consider the conceptual and practical
issues for capitalising further intangibles, whether
in the core accounts or in related accounts.

Box I.4: Assessment of the housing markets outlook:
new insights from house prices in levels

Signals from standard valuation indicators

Excessive valuations are an important risk factor
for adverse house price adjustments. These, in turn,
may affect economic activity through direct
channels (construction activity) or indirect ones
(household wealth effects, financial accelerator). (1)
House price valuations are usually monitored
through various indicators in order to identify
possible misalignments. These indicators include
the price-to-income and the price-to-rent ratios.
Likewise, residuals from a fundamental model of
house prices, based on variables such as the
population, incomes or interest rates, can be used as
estimates of price misalignment. (2) Valuation ratios
usually use indexes of house prices. To obtain an
assessment of valuation misalignments, for
individual country analysis or cross-country
comparison, a reference value has to be estimated
for the ratio. It is usually done by using the longterm average value of the ratio. (3)

All the above mentioned valuation indicators have
some methodological limitations. (4) It is thus useful
to aggregate information contained in each of them
to see whether signals from alternative indicators
concur or diverge. The aggregate price
misalignment indicator is obtained as the simple
average of (i) the price-to-income gap (deviation
from its long-term average), (ii) the price-to-rent
gap and (iii) valuation gaps from the housing
fundamental model.
The resulting aggregate valuation gap is plotted
against the most recent house price developments
in Graph 1, which suggests that house prices are
increasing from very high valuation levels in
several countries (e.g. Sweden, the United
Kingdom and Luxembourg). On the other hand,
strong price increases in Ireland, Hungary and
Estonia occur from below-equilibrium levels.
Although prices in these countries are assessed to
be undervalued, the recovery pace should be
carefully monitored.

House price y-o-y real growth, 2015-Q2

This box provides an assessment of housing
markets in EU Member States. It first presents
traditional housing valuation indicators, based on
house price indexes and used by Commission staff
to assess house price developments and risks. This
is complemented with findings from new data of
house prices in levels, more suited for crosscountry comparisons. The current outlook for
house prices, lending and construction activity are
then discussed, before concluding with the
expected macroeconomic implications over the
forecast horizon.

Insights from a new dataset of house prices in
levels

Most valuation analyses are based on price indexes
and use estimated long-term reference values for
valuation ratios to assess price misalignments, due
to the absence of historical house price and rent
data in levels (values per m2). A price index
approach is most useful to assess developments
over time in a given country. When it comes to
judgments about the absolute level of valuations
and to cross-country comparisons, the estimate of
long-term reference values becomes crucial.
Moreover, differences in available data length

detailed discussion for each indicator.

reduce the comparability of valuation gaps across
countries.
To complement the previous analysis based on
standard valuation indicators, this section uses a
unique, newly constructed database for residential
real estate prices per m2 for 19 European Union
countries selected based on data availability. (5) (6)
House prices in levels can be used to construct
valuation ratios similar to those mentioned above.
A price-to-income ratio can, for instance, be
obtained by multiplying the price per m2 by an
assumed size of a dwelling and dividing it by
households’ disposable income per capita. It
reflects households’ house-purchasing capacity,
though it disregards other factors, such as interest
rates or loan maturities.
Table 1 presents the evolution of price-to-income
ratios for an assumed 100 m2 dwelling. Firstly, it
confirms the previous findings that current
valuation levels are rather moderate compared to
latest peaks. Yet, valuations in Poland,
Luxembourg, and Slovakia appear rather elevated
in 2014 relative to other countries. Germany and
Denmark have the lowest 2014 price-to-income
ratios in levels in the sample.
A comparison of these levels-based ratios with the
usual index-based valuation gaps presented above
reveals a positive relationship between the two
indicators, as expected. However, there are many
“outliers” from this positive relationship. In
particular, many new Member States (Poland,
Slovakia, Estonia and Slovenia) appear to have
higher level-based valuations than what their indexbased counterpart would suggest. Similarly,

This work was directly inspired by Dujardin, M., A.
Kelber and A. Lalliard, (2015). “Overvaluation in the
housing market and returns on residential real estate
in the euro area: insights from data in euro per square
metre”. Banque de France, Quarterly Selection of
Articles 37, Spring.
House prices per m2 were estimated as the ratio of
aggregate dwelling assets (including land) held by
households, divided by the estimated total surface of
dwellings. The findings were cross-checked, when
possible, with other sources, namely the aggregated
price offers per m2 by housing dealers (including data
provided by Dujardin et al., 2015). Alternative
sources were also used, when available, such as
surveys performed by the central bank, the national
statistical institute or private banks. The estimate of
the average price of houses per m2 was then extended
over time using the Eurostat house price index,
backward-extended by Commission staff using other
data sources (ECB, BIS and OECD).

levels-based valuations in Ireland and Spain seem
to be much closer to those in France and the United
Kingdom than what the index-based valuation gaps
would suggest.

An important caveat applies to this analysis, related
to the distributions of dwelling prices and incomes
within a country. While average national prices
take into account all dwellings in the country, just
as income per capita reflects the average income
generation of the country, the distribution of the
two over the territory may not be matching, leading
to possible regional vulnerabilities.
Housing market outlook

The latest house price projection consistent with
the Commission economic forecast points to
increases in house prices in real terms over the
forecast horizon in a majority of EU Member States
(see Graph 2). The compound annual growth rate in
the 2015-17 period exceeds 4% in seven countries,
including Ireland, Hungary or Sweden. This
development is related to different combinations of
i. improving fundamentals (recovering disposable
incomes, reducing real interest rates), ii. an upward
push from low valuations, and iii. the positive
house price momentum from early 2015 (see
above). Still, four countries show a negative
average growth rate over this period. Among them,
Greece pursues its fundamentals-driven house price
correction, while French and Belgian house prices
are slowly adjusting their positive valuation gaps.

House price developments may further reinforce
the recent trends in financing conditions for the
housing sector. This may occur through the
collateral effect: if asset prices rise, existing loans
and related housing assets appear as more secure
and banks may be more willing to lend.
Throughout 2014 and early 2015, surveys among
construction companies suggested financing
constraints in a number of countries, including
Bulgaria, Poland, Greece, and Portugal (see
Graph 3). In most of them, the situation tended to
improve over the course of 2015 (except in
Greece), and this trend could be supported by a
positive house price momentum. Among other
countries, Croatian, Lithuanian and Italian
financing conditions noticeably improved towards
the end of 2015.

Upward price developments are also generally
accompanied by a rise in residential investment.
Construction activity, via its effect on the business
cycle, affects expectations and may feed back into
house price dynamics. Looking at building permits,
current developments confirm to some extent this
pro-cyclicality of housing supply (see Graph 5,
with the bars representing the pace of construction
permit issuance in 2014, compared to the pre-crisis
average over 2000-2007, whereas the diamonds
represent the most recent changes of the pace).
Latest growth rates can be used to distinguish three
categories. Most correcting countries are already
strongly below the average levels of the period
2000-2007, and may be close to bottoming out. By
contrast, in Belgium building starts are correcting
from above this average level. Among expanding
countries, Ireland and the Netherlands are enjoying
strong recoveries from depressed levels, while
buoyant house prices in Sweden seem to have
triggered also some supply response.

Dynamic housing credit usually goes hand in hand
with prices evolutions and is thus an important
variable to be followed. Although the euro area as a
whole registered limited growth of loans for house
purchase over 2014 and 2015, several EU countries
display quite strong growth rates, including
Belgium, Slovakia and Romania (see Graph 4).
Some other countries where loan growth for house
purchases was flat in 2014 have experienced an

Box (continued)

Conclusions and implications for the economic
forecast

The analysis based on standard valuation indicators
revealed a continuing mixed picture in EU housing
markets. On one side, several countries are
currently recovering from negative valuation gaps
(e.g. Ireland, Estonia, Hungary), and in some cases,
the pace of this recovery seems to be rather high.
On the other side, some countries (mostly Sweden,
the United Kingdom and Luxembourg) show rather
strong house price dynamics despite possible
overvaluation signalled by several indicators.
Preliminary results using valuation indicators based
on house price data in levels refine this analysis.
They show in particular that some countries with
currently signalled negative valuation gaps may be
in absolute terms not that undervalued.

60

The recovery in house prices in most EU countries
that previously underwent sharp corrections is
consistent with historical experience. (7) Recovering
asset prices are per se good news for economic
activity and for the general economic outlook. They
will likely have positive direct and indirect effects
(mostly through construction and lending).
Nevertheless, these developments deserve close
monitoring as regards the sustainability of current
trends. In particular, some new Member States’
house price levels are unlikely to return to precrisis valuations in the coming years, given that
house price data in levels suggest already quite
high absolute valuations.
(7)

An interesting comparison of the current housing
market recovery with historical episodes is provided
by ECB (2015). “The state of the house price cycle
in the euro area”, ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 6 /
2015. It actually suggests that the current recovery in
house prices and lending has been more muted than
in previous episodes.

EA and EU outlook

Box I.5: Some technical elements behind the forecast
The cut-off date for taking new information into
account in this European Economic Forecast was
22 January. The forecast incorporates validated
public finance data as published in Eurostat’s News
Release 186/2015 of 21 October 2015.
External assumptions

This forecast is based on a set of external
assumptions, reflecting market expectations at the
time of the forecast. To shield the assumptions
from possible volatility during any given trading
day, averages from a 10-day reference period
(between 5 and 18 January) were used for exchange
and interest rates, and for oil prices.
Exchange and interest rates

The technical assumption regarding exchange rates
was standardised using fixed nominal exchange
rates for all currencies. This technical assumption
leads to an implied average USD/EUR rate of 1.11
in 2015, and 1.08 in 2016 and 2017. The average
JPY/EUR is 134.31 in 2015, 127.91 in 2016, and
127.90 in 2017.
Interest-rate assumptions are market-based. Shortterm interest rates for the euro area are derived
from futures contracts. Long-term interest rates for
the euro area, as well as short- and long-term
interest rates for other Member States are
calculated using implicit forward swap rates,
corrected for the current spread between the
interest rate and swap rate. In cases where no
market instrument is available, the fixed spread
vis-à-vis the euro area interest rate is taken for both
short- and long-term rates. As a result, short-term
interest rates are assumed to be -0.2% in 2016 and
2017 in the euro area. Long-term euro area interest
rates are assumed to be 0.6% in 2016, and 0.9% in
2017.
Commodity prices

Commodity price assumptions are also, as far as
possible, based on market conditions. According to
futures markets, prices for Brent oil are projected to
be on average 35.80 USD/bbl in 2016 and
42.50 USD/bbl in 2017. This would correspond to
an oil price of 33.01 EUR/bbl in 2016 and
39.19 EUR/bbl in 2017.

Budgetary data and forecasts

Data up to 2014 are based on data notified by
Member States to the European Commission on
1 October and validated by Eurostat on 21 October
2015.
Eurostat expressed a reservation on the quality of
the data reported by Austria in relation to an
insufficient adherence to the accrual rules of
recording of expenditure and revenue, as required
in ESA2010, notably at the budgetary central
government level (“Bund”). Currently, a significant
number of transactions are recorded on a cash basis
in national accounts. This situation creates
uncertainty on the quality of the figures and the risk
that data will be revised in the April 2016 EDP
exercise.
Eurostat withdrew its earlier reservation on the
quality of the data reported by Bulgaria expressed
in Eurostat’s News Release of 21 April 2015 in
relation to the sector classification of the Deposit
Insurance Fund and to the impact on the
government deficit of the fund’s repayment of the
guaranteed deposits in the Corporate Commercial
Bank. Following an analysis by Eurostat in
cooperation with the Bulgarian statistical
authorities, the Deposit Insurance Fund was
reclassified inside general government, leading to
an increase in the deficit of BGN 2.6 bn and a
decrease in the debt by BGN 0.13 bn in 2014.
Eurostat withdrew its earlier reservation on the
quality of the government deficit data reported by
Portugal for 2014 expressed in Eurostat’s News
Release of 21 April 2015, due to uncertainties of
the statistical impact of the capitalisation of Novo
Banco in 2014 for an amount of EUR 4.9 bn. The
deficit of Portugal for 2014 was increased by that
amount, as the sale of Novo Banco did not occur
within one year after the capitalisation.
Eurostat made no amendments to the data reported
by Member States.
The public finance forecast is made under the ‘nopolicy-change’ assumption, which extrapolates past
revenue and expenditure trends and relationships in
a way that is consistent with past policy
orientations. This may also include the adoption of
a limited number of working assumptions,
especially to deal with possible structural breaks.
The forecast reflects all fiscal policy measures that
imply a change to these past policy orientations on

the condition that they are sufficiently detailed as
well as adopted or at least credibly announced. For
2016 in particular, this implies that the annual
budgets adopted or presented to national
parliaments are taken into consideration.
EU and euro area aggregates for general
government debt in the forecast years 2015-17 are
published on a non-consolidated basis (i.e. not
corrected for intergovernmental loans, including
those made through the European Financial
Stability Facility). To ensure consistency in the
time series, historical data are also published on the
same basis. For 2014, this implies an aggregate
debt-to-GDP ratio which is somewhat higher than
the consolidated general government debt ratio
published by Eurostat in its news release 186/2015
of 21 October 2015 (by 2.4 pps. in the euro area
EA19 and by 1.8 pps. in the EU).
ESA 2010

The current forecast is based on the ESA 2010
system of national accounts for all Member States,
the EU and the euro area aggregates.

62

Calendar effects on GDP growth and output
gaps

The number of working days may differ from one
year to another. The Commission’s annual GDP
forecasts are not adjusted for the number of
working days, but quarterly forecasts are.
However, the working-day effect in the EU and the
euro area is estimated to be limited over the
forecast horizon, implying that adjusted and
unadjusted annual growth rates differ only
marginally (by up to ±0.1 pps.). The calculation of
potential growth and the output gap does not adjust
for working days. Since the working-day effect is
considered as temporary, it should not affect the
cyclically-adjusted balances.

PART II
Prospects by individual economy

Member States

1. BELGIUM

Growing steadily

The Belgian economy is experiencing what is expected to be a temporary setback to its slow recovery.
Economic growth is projected to remain stable at 1.3% in 2016 but should rise to 1.7% in 2017 as the
outlook for household spending brightens and competitiveness-enhancing reforms bear fruit. The budget
deficit is expected to remain close to, but below, 3% of GDP.
Economic growth has decelerated somewhat in the
second half of 2015, mainly on the back of weaker
private consumption and partly because of
temporary factors. In 2016 the economy is forecast
to grow by 1.3% while more robust domestic
demand is projected to result in an increase by
1.7% next year.

Falling oil prices no longer compensate for low
wage growth

Household purchasing power is under the
influence of opposing forces. Falling oil prices and
personal income tax cuts, which underpinned
purchasing power last year, are increasingly being
outweighed by low wage growth and rises in
indirect taxation and electricity prices, which are
also pushing up inflation. In addition, security
measures and mild weather are assumed to have
undercut consumer spending in 2015-Q4, with
some catching-up anticipated in 2016-Q1.
Household consumption is forecast to grow by
0.9% in 2016 and to gain strength in 2017 as
wages should begin rising again in the second half
of 2016 given the reactivation of wage indexation
schemes and real wage increases. Steady job
creation should also support consumption. Job
growth has become more vigorous recently and is
expected to strengthen further over the forecast
horizon as measures to reduce labour costs and
enhance competitiveness gradually lead to more

66

hiring by companies. The unemployment rate is
projected to decline from 8.3% in 2015 to 7.4% in
2017.
Investment outlook underpinned by improving
competitiveness position

Adopted measures include substantial reductions
to social security contributions for employers in
2016 as well as tax incentives for investments.
These come on top of earlier reductions and the
ongoing wage moderation, which have kept unit
labour cost growth flat. Together with favourable
commodity prices, this has been improving profit
margins. Equipment investment is therefore
expected to rise in line with external demand in
2017. Enhanced cost competitiveness is reflected
in the positive growth contribution by net
exports. (47) In combination with strong terms of
trade gains for goods, this is estimated to have
pushed the trade balance into surplus in 2015,
thereby strengthening the current account position.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced

On the one hand, consumption might be more
resilient despite low wage growth. On the other
hand, the possibility of less supportive external
demand could delay the transmission of improving
competitiveness into export, investment and job
growth.
Inflation on the rise

Inflation is forecast to accelerate from 0.6% in
2015 to 1.4% in 2016, in spite of a further decline
of oil prices throughout 2016. As a result, the
inflation differential with neighbouring countries
and the euro area is projected to widen again.
Aforementioned government measures are the
main driver behind the increase in inflation.
(47)

Note: large but one-off and imported investment
transactions distort numbers for business investment and
imports. For 2015 numbers are inflated for both series,
while the opposite holds for 2016. When correcting for
this, net exports account for a smaller, though still positive,
growth contribution in 2016.

Member States, Belgium

Limited improvement of public finances

The general government deficit is estimated to
have reached 2.9% of GDP in 2015. On the
revenue side, wage moderation constrained the
growth of personal income taxes and social
contributions. A smaller dividend from the
National Bank of Belgium contributed to a
substantial drop in property income. On the other
hand, one-off revenues such as the processing of
the 2013 tax regularisation and the anticipative
taxation of pension savings had a positive impact
of 0.3% of GDP in 2015. At the same time, current
expenditure is estimated to have grown only
modestly due to the non-indexation of public
wages and social benefits, and sizeable
consolidation measures. Furthermore, the decline
in market interest rates reduced interest
expenditure by 0.2% of GDP. As a result, the
structural balance is estimated to have improved
by around ¼ pps. of GDP in 2015.
In 2016, the headline deficit is projected to reach
2.8% of GDP. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is
expected to decline due to the drop in one-off
revenues and cuts in personal income taxation and
social contributions, which are not fully offset by
hikes in other taxes. Also the expenditure-to-GDP
ratio is expect to fall, due to the additional impact

of consolidation measures and the projected
decline in interest expenditure (-0.2% of GDP).
Public wages and social benefits are expected to be
indexed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The
projection includes additional security spending
(assumed temporary) and expenditure related to
asylum-seekers of 0.1% of GDP each, as well as a
one-off contribution to the EU budget with a
temporary negative impact of 0.1% of GDP on the
government balance. The recovery of 0.2% of
GDP of illegally granted corporate income tax
advantages under the excess profit scheme has not
been included in this forecast. All in all, the
structural balance is expected to improve by ¼ pps.
of GDP in 2016. Under the usual no-policy-change
assumption, the deficit should decline to 2.4% of
GDP in 2017 thanks to better cyclical conditions,
lower interest expenditure and the disappearance
of the above-mentioned temporary expenditure
increases. Large regional construction plans and
the investment cycle of local governments are set
to boost public investment in 2017.
The reimbursement of a loan (0.7% of GDP) by
KBC bank prevented a further increase in the
public debt ratio in 2015. While rising again in
2016, it should head back down in 2017 when
projected nominal GDP growth strengthens.

2. BULGARIA

Gradual rebalancing amid moderate growth

Real GDP is expected to have grown 2.2% in 2015, driven mainly by exports and falling oil prices,
before dropping to 1.5% in 2016, as the boost from factors including EU funds absorption weakens.
GDP growth, however, is set to recover to 2.0% in 2017 as domestic demand strengthens. Inflation is
projected to remain negative well into 2016 but to turn positive towards the end of the year. The general
government deficit is expected to gradually decrease from 2.5% in 2015 to 2.0% of GDP in 2017.
Exports supporting growth

Bulgaria’s economy is expected to have grown
2.2% in 2015, supported by net exports. Public
investment also buoyed the economy while private
consumption was relatively subdued. Bulgaria’s
real GDP growth has been revised upwards for
2015 due to a strong rise in net exports over the
first three quarters, despite less dynamic industrial
production and retail trade. Growth is forecast to
moderate to 1.5% in 2016, before picking up to
2.0% in 2017.
Domestic demand to contribute positively

Stronger growth in 2015 has been primarily the
result of higher net exports, but domestic demand
is expected to increase and gradually replace net
exports as the main growth driver by 2017. While
benefitting from low inflation and fuel prices,
limited wage growth and a less expansionary fiscal
stance suppressed private consumption in 2015.
Private consumption growth is expected to
strengthen from 0.7% in 2015 to 1.4% in 2016 and
1.7% in 2017. However, risk aversion, an
unsupportive business environment and restrained
foreign capital inflows are set to curb investment
growth in 2016-17, despite favourable financing
conditions and the rise of capacity utilisation in the
manufacturing sector back to its historic average.
Public investment is expected to drop in 2016 with
the slowdown of the implementation of projects
co-financed by the EU, before resuming growth in
2017.

68

gathers pace in 2017, the contribution of net
exports to growth is projected to decline. As a
result, Bulgaria’s current account surplus is
forecast to decrease from 2.1% of GDP in 2015 to
1.6% by 2017.

Overall, risks to the growth outlook appear
balanced. On the positive side, further
strengthening of exports and stronger employment
growth could fuel investment and private
consumption more than expected. Some economic
sectors could receive stronger-than-projected
support from low interest rates and oil prices.
Geopolitical uncertainties and stagnation in main
trading partners could, however, pose a downside
risk to exports and output growth because of the
economy’s high degree of openness.

Net exports to grow over the forecast horizon

Labour market conditions to improve, inflation
to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016

Exports are projected to outpace imports over the
forecast horizon, supported by higher demand
from the EU, resulting in positive contributions of
net exports to economic growth. Exporting
industries are also expected to continue benefitting
from the depreciated euro, to which the national
currency is pegged, given that a substantial portion
of Bulgarian exports go to non-euro area countries.
However, as the recovery in domestic demand

Employment further increased in the first three
quarters of 2015, mainly in the manufacturing, ICT
and construction sectors. Employment growth is
projected to marginally increase from 0.3% in
2015 to 0.4% in 2016 and 0.5% in 2017, supported
mainly by export-oriented industries. Together
with the expected decrease in the labour force due
to population aging and emigration, this is likely to

Member States, Bulgaria

further reduce the unemployment rate to 9.4% in
2016 and 8.8% in 2017.
Inflation is expected to rise gradually as the effect
from the decline in commodity prices slowly
diminishes, however it looks set to remain negative
throughout 2016. In the meanwhile, the
depreciated euro and tight labour market
conditions are expected to exert some upward
price pressure. Annual HICP inflation turned out at
-1.1% in 2015 and is expected to remain just below
zero in 2016 at -0.1%. Inflation, however, looks set
to turn positive in 2017 but will remain low given
that the output gap is expected to be negative.
Public finances set to improve

The general government deficit is estimated to fall
to 2.5% of GDP in 2015, following a temporary
jump to 5.8% of GDP in 2014 as a result of one-off
support to the financial sector. Compared to the
original budget deficit target of 2.8% of GDP in
2015, the better outcome reflects mainly higher
tax-revenues, mostly attributable to improved tax
administration. Those additional revenues more
than offset various expenditure slippages, such as
the incomplete implementation of the planned
reduction of the public wage bill.

In the future the headline deficit is forecast to
recede to 2.3% of GDP in 2016 and to 2.0% of
GDP in 2017. The improvement reflects measures
on the revenue side, such as an increase in excise
duties and in social security contributions in 2017
as well as limited rise in expenditures. No
significant further increase of tax compliance is
assumed. The impact of the likely temporary fall in
the absorption of EU-funds on public investment
in 2016-17 is expected to be partly offset by higher
investments from domestic resources.
Regarding risks, a positive surprise could come
from further improvements in tax compliance. At
the same time, any further support for the financial
sector could have a deficit increasing effect.
After slightly improving in 2015, Bulgaria’s
structural deficit is projected to temporarily
deteriorate in 2016 to 2¾% of GDP due to elevated
public investments backed by one-off licence
revenues. In 2017, it is estimated to fall below 2%
of GDP in light of consolidation measures. Given
the still-sizable budget deficit and the limited
growth of the economy, the public-debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to increase from 27% in 2014 to
above 30% by 2017.

3. THE CZECH REPUBLIC

Strong domestic demand continues to support growth

Economic growth in the Czech Republic is expected to have risen to 4.5% in 2015 on the back of strong
domestic demand. As an exceptional boost to growth from EU co-financed investment fades, growth is
expected to slow to 2.3% in 2016 before picking up again to 2.7% in 2017. The headline government
deficit is expected to fall to 1.1% of GDP in 2016 and then to 1% in 2017.
Lower but still strong
domestic demand

growth

by

All domestic demand components contributed to a
strengthening of economic growth in 2015, with
real GDP growth forecast to have reached 4.5%,
more than double the rate of the previous year.
Household consumption is expected to have risen
by 2.9% in real terms, amid rising wages, rising
employment and low inflation. Investment
contributed strongly to real GDP growth,
particularly due to a strong increase in public
investment, which was driven by a greater use of
EU funding. Public investment is forecast to fall in
2016, however, as the exceptional level of drawing
of EU funds declines. As a result, real GDP growth
is expected to slow to 2.3%, although domestic
demand will otherwise remain strong. With
investment recovering and household consumption
remaining strong, real GDP growth should pick up
again in 2017 to 2.7%. The main risk to the
forecast stems from external demand, which could
negatively impact on the highly-open Czech
economy if it were to be weaker than expected.
Low inflation despite low spare capacity

Inflation remained stable in 2015 (0.3%) compared
to 2014 (0.4%), despite strong real GDP growth
and increasingly tight labour market conditions.
The unemployment rate is expected to average
5.1% in 2015 and is forecast to fall slightly further
to 4.7% by 2017. Employment is expected to have
grown by 1.1% in 2015 but further growth will be
limited by demographic constraints. While labour
market conditions are expected to contribute to
domestic inflationary pressures, particularly in the
services sector, inflation is forecast to average only
0.4% in 2016. This is mainly due to further
declines in commodity prices, particularly oil,
which are expected to lead to declining import
prices. Inflation is forecast to start moving back
towards the Czech National Bank's target of 2% in
2017 but is not expected to reach that target over
the forecast horizon.

Wage growth to accelerate

Compensation per employee is expected to have
grown by 2.4% in 2015 and the overall wage bill
by 4.1%, due to strong employment growth. The
growth rate of compensation per employee is
forecast to accelerate to 3.6% in 2016 and 2017,
amid increasingly tight labour market conditions.
However, the growth rate of the wage bill is
projected to fall, due to the expected decline in the
working age population in both 2016 and 2017.
Lower growth of total wages is expected to
contribute to a gradual decline in the growth of
household consumption over the forecast horizon.
Positive contribution from net exports in 2016

Net exports are likely to have contributed
negatively to real GDP growth in 2015, reflecting
the high import intensity of rising consumption,
investment and exports. As investment is set to
stagnate in 2016, however, import growth should
slow, leading to a positive contribution of net
exports. Rising investment in 2017 is expected to
reduce this contribution, although it is forecast to
remain positive. With imports growing less than
exports and the price of imports also falling, the
Czech Republic’s trade surplus should rise to an
estimated 5.5% in 2017 from 5.0% in 2015. While
the current account deficit is also expected to

Member States, The Czech Republic

recede, this could be affected by volatility in
primary income flows.
Structural deficit to decline after 2015

The general government deficit is expected to have
improved to 1.6% of GDP in 2015, down from
1.9% in the previous year. Monthly data, which are
not available on an accrual basis, point to an
overachievement of the state budget due betterthan-expected tax
collection. Specifically,
corporate income tax grew at a faster pace than
expected. Indirect taxes were boosted by higher
revenues from excise duties on tobacco, although
VAT grew sluggishly after the introduction of a
lower tax bracket. Interest expenditure on debt
service also declined somewhat. The main driver
on the expenditure side was higher public
investment, which rose significantly towards the
end of the programming period for EU funds at the
end of 2015.
The projected decline in the headline deficit to
1.1% of GDP in 2016 is largely due to an expected

sharp decrease in investment spending co-financed
by EU funds, related to the likely slowdown of EU
funding at the beginning of the new programming
period. This is expected to be partially offset by
higher government consumption, driven mainly by
the wage bill and intermediate consumption. On
the revenue side, the newly implemented VAT
control statement aimed at combating tax evasion
should lead to improved tax collection. Revenue
flows from yet-to-be-adopted measures, such as
the proposed introduction of electronic sales
records, are not included in the forecast. Assuming
no changes in policy, the deficit in 2017 is
projected to decline further to 1.0% of GDP,
reflecting the acceleration in economic activity.
In 2015 the structural deficit deteriorated
substantially (by around ¾ pps.). In 2016, the
structural balance should improve as the headline
deficit declines and the positive output gap slightly
widens. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall
to 40.1% of GDP in 2017, largely due to
favourable stock-flow adjustment owing to better
liquidity management.

4. DENMARK

The moderate recovery continues

The moderate recovery of the Danish economy continues but at a somewhat slower pace than previously
expected. GDP growth has been driven by domestic demand, while both imports and exports have
dropped in line with developments in world trade. The improvement on the labour market has
continued, with unemployment gradually declining.
The recovery has slowed

Denmark’s real GDP likely grew an estimated
1.2% in 2015. Thus, the recovery of the Danish
economy continues, but more slowly than
previously expected. After eight consecutive
quarters of positive growth, GDP dropped by 0.4%
in the third quarter of 2015. In 2015, positive
growth contributions came both from domestic
demand and net exports, as imports are expected to
have declined more than exports.
In 2015, private consumption became an important
driver of GDP growth, growing by an estimated
2.2%. Private consumption has been supported by
rising real disposable income, due to the increase
in employment, wage growth and low inflation,
while an improvement on the housing market has
had a positive effect on Danish households' asset
position. Consumer confidence has declined
somewhat, after reaching a historic high level last
spring. However, the current level is still high by
historical standards and consistent with continued
growth in private consumption. Private
consumption is expected to continue growing over
the forecast period at annual rates of close to 2.0%
in both 2016-2017.

exports of services were, on average and in real
terms, 4.1% and 4.8% below their 2014 levels
respectively. Despite more positive developments
in goods trade, growth in total exports and imports
are both expected to have been in negative territory
in 2015. Exports are projected to pick-up over the
next two years, supported by increased growth in
Danish
export
markets
and
improved
competitiveness, as measured by relative unit
labour costs.

Employment growth driven by private sector

After a strong 2014, investment growth was weak
in 2015. There is still considerable idle capacity in
the economy, which holds back business
investments. Over the forecast horizon, business
investment is expected to pick up as the overall
recovery becomes more firmly established and
capacity utilisation improves. The saving rate in
the corporate sector is high by historical standards,
which suggests the potential for a strong pick-up in
business investment over the coming years. Based
on the budget for 2016, public investment is
expected to decline significantly after reaching a
historically high level in 2014.
Denmark’s national accounts show that foreign
trade developments have been much weaker than
expected, due in particular to a sharp decline in
service trade on both the export and import side. In
the first three quarters of 2015, imports and

72

The unemployment rate has been gradually
declining since spring 2012 and stood at 6% of the
labour force in November 2015. As the recovery
progresses, unemployment is expected to continue
decreasing to 5.6% in 2017. At 0.9% in 2016 and
2017, annual employment growth is expected to
remain high, driven by growth in private sector
employment.
Inflation pulled down by energy prices

HICP inflation, which stood at 0.3% in December
2015, has been dragged down by a drop in energy
prices. Core inflation, on the other hand, has
remained stable at close to 1% for most of 2015.
As the recovery matures, capacity utilisation
increases and the effect from the decline in energy

Member States, Denmark

prices tapers off, HICP inflation is expected to
pick-up, reaching 0.9% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017.
Revenue volatility affects public finances

The general government surplus of 1.5% of GDP
in 2014 is expected to have turned into a deficit of
2.0% of GDP in 2015. The deterioration comes
mainly from lower one-off revenues from the
restructuring of capital pension taxation and lower
revenues from the pension yield tax. Revenues
from oil and gas activities in the North Sea have
also decreased, due to the sharp drop in oil prices.
In 2016, the headline balance is expected to
deteriorate further, reaching a deficit of 2.7% of
GDP. The main drivers of the deterioration are
again to be found on the revenue side, as one-off
revenues from the restructuring of capital pension
taxation will come to a complete halt. The one-off
revenues from the restructuring have boosted the
headline balance in 2013-15. Moreover, revenues
from the pension yield tax are expected to continue
declining.

In 2017, the general government budget balance is
expected to improve to a deficit of 1.9% of GDP,
as the economic situation improves. The estimate
is based on a no-policy-change assumption.
The deterioration of the structural balance from
¼% of GDP in 2014, to -1¾% of GDP in 2015 is
also to a large extent a reflection of lower revenues
from volatile revenue items and in particular from
the pension yield tax. The structural balance is
expected to improve in 2016-17, by about ¼ and ½
pps. of GDP respectively.
The general government gross debt level is
expected to decrease from 44.6% of GDP in 2014
to 38.8% of GDP in 2017. The sharp reduction in
gross debt in 2015, of close to 5 pps. of GDP, is
due to a stock-flow adjustment, reflecting the
temporary suspension of government bond
issuance from January to October 2015 resulting in
a decrease in the government's financial assets.

5. GERMANY

Growth continues to be driven by domestic demand

Economic growth in Germany continues to be driven by domestic demand, supported by favourable
labour market and financing conditions. Public spending for asylum seekers provides an additional
stimulus, which leads to a decreasing general government budget surplus. The current account surplus
is expected to moderate while remaining at historically high levels.
Steady growth with slight acceleration

Germany’s economy grew steadily in the first
three quarters of 2015. In 2015-Q3, real GDP
expanded by 0.3% (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally
and working-day adjusted), after 0.4% in 2015-Q2.
According to provisional official data, GDP rose
by 1.7% in 2015. Growth was largely driven by
domestic demand, particularly consumption, while
investment growth remained sluggish. Net external
trade made a small positive contribution to growth.

projected to grow markedly, also reflecting high
employment, high net immigration, and low
interest rates.

Available indicators suggest that the expansion of
economic activity continued at a similar pace in
the fourth quarter and is likely to pick up
somewhat thereafter. Survey indicators for the
services sector, which had already driven the
expansion in 2015-Q3, continued to be very
favourable. By contrast, industrial production saw
a slight decline in October/November. The
continued optimism of firms and the pick-up in
industrial orders after a noticeable decline in 2015Q3 point to a slight acceleration of growth in early
2016. The robust labour market, favourable
financing conditions, low oil prices and additional
public spending to host and integrate unusually
large numbers of asylum seekers will all contribute
to growth over the forecast horizon. Overall, real
GDP is expected to increase by 1.8% in 2016 and
2017. Changes to the external environment entail
risks for this growth forecast, as does the potential
fallout from Volkswagen’s regulatory problems.
Also, uncertainty surrounding the strong inflow of
asylum seekers and its economic impact remains
high.
Consumption to remain a key growth driver

Robust employment growth is set to continue. The
slight rise in unemployment expected reflects the
relatively gradual labour market integration
prospects of asylum seekers over the forecast
horizon. As in 2015, real wages and household
purchasing power should get a boost from low
inflation in 2016. Nominal wage growth is
expected to reaccelerate in 2017 after easing
slightly in 2016. Overall, private consumption is

Moderate recovery in business investment

Private investment saw another slight decline in
the third quarter of 2015. Investment in machinery
and equipment has been weak, which partly
reflects only average levels of capacity utilisation
in industry and sluggish external demand. A
moderate recovery in corporate investment,
however, is expected, as domestic capital goods
orders are increasing and sales expectations are
improving in line with the gradual strengthening of
the external environment forecast. Housing
investment growth is projected to moderate only
slowly, also due to the additional boost from very
high net immigration. Public investment that
declined in 2015 is set to pick up, but remain at a
relatively low level.
Current account surplus to remain at high level

Strong exports in the first half of the year and
markedly improved terms of trade likely led to a
further widening of the current account surplus in
2015. The boost from the euro’s depreciation may
be fading but export expectations have nonetheless
recently improved. Buoyant domestic demand
including the moderate recovery in business

Member States, Germany

investment, however, mean that imports should
also rise. As a result, small negative growth
contributions from net external trade are expected.
Energy prices dampening inflation

to boost government consumption and spending on
cash benefits. Additional funds earmarked for
infrastructure investment and social housing
should increase public sector investment. Strong
pension increases announced for 2016 will also
contribute to the expenditure growth.

On the back of the sharp decline in oil prices,
consumer prices broadly stagnated, with HICP
inflation at 0.1% in 2015. By contrast, core
inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food)
slowed only slightly to 1.0% and is set to
reaccelerate somewhat in 2016-17 despite some
spillover effects from low energy prices. With the
dampening effect of oil prices on energy prices
expected to last until late 2016, headline HICP
inflation is projected to pick up only slightly in
2016 (0.5%) before accelerating to 1.5% in 2017.

Moderate growth ahead

Following an estimated growth of only 0.9% in 2015, Estonia’s income level is expected to converge
again to the EU average in 2016 and in 2017 with growth rates above 2.0%, as external demand
recovers and domestic investment becomes the main growth driver. Unemployment, however, is set to
increase from late-2016, as work ability reform induces pensioners to re-enter the labour market. The
fiscal position is projected to remain close to balance in 2016-17.
Graph II.6.1: Estonia - Real GDP growth and
contributions, export market growth

Slow growth in 2015

After growing by 2.9% in 2014, Estonia's real
GDP is expected to have expanded by just 0.9% in
2015, much slower than expected in the autumn
forecast. This relatively weak outcome reflects
negative base effects in the electronics sector, a
sharply reduced demand from neighbouring Russia
and falling international oil prices which have
made Estonia's shale oil sector less competitive.
Private
consumption
performed
strongly,
supported by high wage increases, income tax cuts
and low consumer price inflation. Investment
activity fell substantially, reflecting the completion
of major investment projects in the energy sector
in 2013 and 2014. After building up in 2014,
inventories contracted. Net exports are set to have
made a positive contribution to growth in 2015, as
low investment levels depressed import demand.
Convergence is set to resume in 2016

Real GDP growth is forecast to rise to 2.1% in
2016 and to accelerate to 2.3% in 2017 as the
global outlook gradually improves. Private
consumption growth is set to decelerate over the
forecast horizon as real income growth slows
down. However, investment is expected to become
a stronger growth driver.
Financing conditions remain supportive

Financing conditions remain broadly favourable
and bank lending to enterprises resumed in the
second half of 2015. Investment, especially in
equipment, is forecast to rebound in 2016 and
2017 supported by growing demand from the euro
area and the substitution of increasingly expensive
workers with equipment. In addition, public
investment is set to gradually start growing again
over the course of 2016 and 2017, after
disbursements of EU funding under the new
programming period resume. High incomes,

Net trade remains in surplus

Exports declined in 2015, amid volatility in the
electronics sector and lower demand from Russia
since the rouble's depreciation. However, imports
declined even more, widening further the nominal
trade surplus in 2015. A reorientation of Estonia's
goods exports towards EU trading partners is
expected to ensure the country a positive external
balance of goods and services throughout the
forecast period, despite the growth of imports
expected as domestic investment recovers.
Downside risks to the forecast could stem from a
delayed recovery in neighbouring Finland and
Russia and, in turn, lower external demand. In
parallel, persistently low international oil prices
could further impair Estonia's shale-oil industry
and exports.
Labour market developments mainly reflect
legislative changes

As the obligation for entrepreneurs to register their
workforce was tightened in mid-2014, official
employment growth is estimated at 2.3% in 2015
(up from 0.8% in 2014). At the same time,
Estonia's working age population is shrinking as a
result of its low birth rate and because of
emigration, although this last factor is abating.

Member States, Estonia

Overall, this trend, together with the tight labour
market, is expected to keep the unemployment rate
relatively low at around 6.3% in 2015 and 2016.
Wage growth has exceeded productivity growth
over the last two years, resulting in rising unit
labour costs, especially in the non-tradable sectors.
Wage growth is expected to slow down, as public
sector wage policy foresees wage moderation at
central government level. The work ability reform,
which will enter into force in mid-2016, is
expected to entice incapacity-for-work pensioners
back to the labour market, pulling the
unemployment rate back to 7.5% in 2017. At that
time, participation in the labour force, which is
already high, is expected to rise above 70%.
Inflation is expected to rise

Annual inflation stayed slightly above zero in 2015
reflecting a steep fall in energy prices, which
outweighed the impact of the euro’s depreciation
and core inflation of 1.3%. Inflation is expected to
increase to 1.0% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017, pushed
up by several factors including excise tax
increases, strong wage growth, supported by
sizeable annual minimum wage increases, and the
slow recovery of commodity prices.

Towards fiscal surpluses in both 2016 and 2017

In 2015, the headline surplus is estimated to have
amounted to 0.3% of GDP, down from 0.7% in
2014. General government expenditure growth was
rapid, driven by social spending, wages and
current expenditure. However, it was matched by
exceptionally strong revenue, boosted by
consumption-led GDP growth, a strong labour
market, measures to improve tax compliance and
extraordinary government revenue from corporate
income tax. Public investment declined in 2015
due to the lower intake of EU funds at the start of
the new programming period. Tax revenues are set
to slow in 2016 as private consumption growth
decelerates, but so is expenditure growth as a
result of efforts to limit government personnel
costs. Lower labour taxation and increased excise
taxes will enter into force in 2016-2017, with a net
positive effect on revenue. Overall, public finances
are projected to remain in slight surplus over the
forecast horizon. In structural terms, surpluses of
½% of GDP are expected for 2015 and about ¼%
of GDP for 2016, which are projected to decrease
to close to balance in 2017. Estonia’s public debt is
expected to fall to about 9% of GDP in 2017.

7. IRELAND

High growth and improving public finances

Ireland’s record GDP growth in 2015 was broad-based and coupled with strong job creation. Economic
fundamentals are robust and point to more sustainable but still strong GDP growth rates in 2016 and
2017. Government finances are improving as strong revenue growth more than offsets increases in
expenditure. The government debt ratio is declining but remains very high.
Sustained GDP and employment growth boosts
expectations

The Irish economy grew again strongly in the third
quarter of 2015 although more moderately than
earlier in the year. National statistics, which are
affected by considerable volatility, suggest that
real GDP was up by 6.8% compared to the same
period in 2014. Estimates for the fourth quarter
will be published in March 2016. However, survey
indicators point to sustained activity levels in the
three months to December, which are expected to
bring GDP growth for 2015 as a whole to 6.9%. In
2016 and 2017, the moderation in GDP growth is
expected to continue towards more sustainable
rates of about 4% and 3% respectively.

lead to more company profits being booked in
Ireland. Conversely, the purchase of airplanes by
international leasing companies based in Ireland
collapsed in the third quarter of 2015, leading to a
large fall in equipment investment. Excluding
intangibles and aircraft, core investment was
strong, growing by over 11% (y-o-y) in the first
three quarters of 2015, despite the delayed
recovery in construction activity. The growth in
core investment is forecast to continue more
moderately in 2016 and 2017.

Job creation accelerated from the second quarter of
2015 to 3% (y-o-y), bringing the unemployment
rate down to 8.8% in December 2015, compared to
10.2% a year earlier. In line with the projected
moderation in GDP growth in 2016-17, the
unemployment rate is also expected to decline
more slowly to 7.5% at the end of 2017, with job
creation remaining broad-based across sectors and
regions.
Company and sector-specific developments
impact the composition of growth

While the recovery started in the external sector,
domestic demand is now driving GDP growth. It
expanded by more than 8% (y-o-y) in the first nine
months of 2015, with household consumption
growing by 3.5% and investment by over 25%.
Conversely, net exports contracted by 3.2%. These
headline figures need to be read with caution as
developments in some companies and sectors are
boosting investment and imports in the economy.
Multinationals have been transferring a number of
patents to Ireland. In the first nine months of 2015,
these transfers generated a growth in investment in
intellectual property of over 100% (y-o-y) and an
equivalent increase in services imports. In 2016
and 2017, the fees for the use of these patents are
expected to benefit the current account balance and

Rising wages, inflation and house prices

The very subdued rate of consumer price inflation
in 2015 is expected to gradually increase over the
forecast horizon, driven primarily by the projected
recovery in wages. House prices and rents are
forecast to grow at moderate rates, contained by
the macro-prudential policies of the central bank
and government plans to address supply shortages.
The risks to the growth forecast are balanced.
Ireland is particularly exposed to a possible
deterioration in the external environment which
could dampen exports, whereas domestic demand
could surprise on the upside if government policies
to boost construction are successful. The economy
remains vulnerable to shocks in interest rates and
changes in the operations of multinationals.

Member States, Ireland

Public finances benefit from high tax receipts

In 2015, the general government deficit is expected
to drop to 1.8% of GDP, down from 3.9% in 2014.
The improvement compared to the Commission's
2015 autumn forecast (+0.4 pps.) reflects a higher
than expected tax intake in the last quarter of 2015.
On the back of the exceptional economic rebound,
tax receipts increased by 10.5% in 2015 or 1.6% of
GDP above the target set in the 2015 budget.
While all taxes exceeded expectations, two-thirds
of the better-than-expected tax intake came from
corporate tax receipts. These volatile receipts
increased by 49% from 2014. Large improvements
in terms of trade supported company profits
whereas other factors underlying this upsurge
remain uncertain.
At the same time, government spending increased
sharply in the last quarter of 2015. Given the
sizeable revenue windfalls, the government passed
a supplementary budget in October with extra
spending of about 0.7% of GDP, mainly on health
and social protection. Debt servicing costs were
lower in 2015 thanks to favourable market
conditions and the early repayment of IMF credits.

Deficit and debt-to-GDP appear to trend firmly
downwards though risks remain

Despite further tax cuts and expenditure increases
of about EUR 1.5 billion (0.7% of GDP) in the
2016 budget, the general government deficit is
expected to improve further this year to about
1.3% of GDP, again benefitting from strong and
sustained economic growth. Based on a no-policychange assumption, the deficit expected to narrow
to 0.8% of GDP in 2017. The risks surrounding
this fiscal forecast are balanced, mainly reflecting
the balance of risks from the growth forecast.
The structural deficit is expected to improve over
the forecast horizon reaching close to 2% and 1%
of GDP in 2016 and 2017 respectively, down from
about 3% of GDP in 2014.
Gross general government debt is projected to
continue falling. In 2015, it is expected to drop by
9.1 pps. of GDP to 98.4% of GDP, down from
107.5% in 2014 largely due to the surge in nominal
GDP growth, coupled with low interest rates and
the primary surpluses. By 2017, government debt
is projected to fall to 91.5% of GDP, contingent on
still robust GDP growth and the realisation of
primary budget surpluses of more than 1.7% and
2.1% of GDP in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

8. GREECE

Economy shows some resilience in face of capital controls

The recession in Greece in 2015 now appears to have been less severe than expected. Resilient
consumption, the successful recapitalisation of banks, steady implementation of structural reforms
under the new ESM programme and progress with privatisation should support the rebound in
confidence and bring positive growth and stronger fiscal results by the second half of 2016.
Surprisingly improved expectations

In the first three quarters of 2015, Greece’s
economy proved resilient despite the introduction
of the emergency bank holiday, capital controls,
and heightened uncertainty related to prolonged
programme negotiations. Private consumption was
stronger-than-expected, with households preferring
to spend their bank deposits to avoid potential
haircuts. However, fiscal drag is expected to weigh
on disposable income and private consumption up
to the first half of 2016. The tourism sector
continued to perform exceptionally well during the
autumn. Imports are projected to continue
declining faster than exports, resulting to net trade
contributing positively to growth. Business
confidence, reflected in the Economic Sentiment
Indicator and the Purchasing Managers Index, has
also recovered relatively quickly from the sharp
falls in the summer. Economic sentiment stabilised
in October and improved further in December.
Overall, our estimate for economic growth in 2015
has been revised upwards to 0.0%.
Real GDP is expected to contract by 0.7% in 2016,
amid the negative carryover from 2015 and the
faltering domestic demand in the first half of the
year. In the second half of 2016, economic activity
is set to strengthen supported by a rebound in
confidence, the expected easing of capital controls,
and compliance with the conditionality of the new
ESM assistance programme. Investment should
also benefit from the successful recapitalisation of
the banks and the re-launch of privatisations.
Steady implementation of structural reforms
should
gradually
strengthen
economic
fundamentals, investment and other components of
aggregate demand, leading to a projection of 2.7%
for real GDP growth for 2017.
Greece’s current account deficit is expected to
have declined in 2015 as a whole, partly owing to
imports' sharp contraction. The current account is
expected to improve further as past and ongoing
structural
reforms
improve
external
competitiveness. The unemployment rate is
estimated to have fallen in 2015 and should

80

continue to do so in 2016 due to the lagged effects
of previous improvements in labour market
flexibility. Following large decreases in recent
years, compensation per employee is expected to
start increasing in 2017. The HICP inflation turned
out negative in 2015, since the impact of lower oil
prices and weak demand have outweighed the
increase in the VAT rate for many items. However,
consumer prices are expected to increase as of
2016 in line with the projected economic recovery.
Upside risks to the growth outlook are related to
stronger confidence following progress with
programme reform implementation and a swifter
lifting of capital controls. On the downside, failure
to fully deliver on the reform programme and
policy uncertainty would undermine growth
prospects.

Public finances stabilise yet need for key
reforms remain

The fiscal policy measures agreed with the
authorities in the third quarter of 2015 as part of
the adjustment programme are expected to deliver
savings of up to 2% of GDP through 2017 and
result in a primary deficit according to the
programme definition (48) close to the target of
-0.25% of GDP in 2015.

Excludes the one-off cost of bank recapitalisation.

Member States, Greece

One-off factors related to the recapitalisation of the
banking sector completed in late 2015 are assumed
to deteriorate the fiscal balance by 3.3 pps. of
GDP (49), pushing the headline deficit to 7.6% of
GDP in 2015.

forecast stem mainly from revenue administration
reforms (whose impact is not included currently in
the forecast), and revenue buoyancy in light of the
overall resilience of the macroeconomy and tax
collection in the second half of 2015.

The 2016 budget envisages additional savings of
1.1% of GDP from structural reforms in the
pension system and income tax, and through a
rationalisation of spending that still needs to be
specified and implemented. However, further
measures will be needed in 2016 and 2017 in order
to reach the programme’s primary surplus targets
of 0.5% of GDP in 2016 and 1.75% of GDP in
2017. As part of the first review of the ESM
programme, the Greek government has committed
to legislate to ensure that the primary surplus
targets throughout the programme are met. Based
upon the primary balance targets, the headline
deficit is projected to fall to 3.4% of GDP in 2016
and 2.1% of GDP in 2017. Downside risks include
higher spending to deal with asylum-seekers
inflows and possible delays in the specification
and implementation of the additional fiscal
consolidation package. The upside risks to the

9. SPAIN

Growth easing slightly but remains robust

Economic growth is set to ease but remain robust, underpinned by sustained job creation, better
financing conditions, high confidence and low oil prices. Inflation is expected to return to positive
though low values, while unemployment continues declining. The general government deficit is expected
to narrow further thanks to the economic recovery.
Smooth deceleration to continue

Economic growth in Spain eased slightly in the
third quarter of 2015, to 0.8% quarter-on-quarter,
and is projected to have maintained the same pace
in the last quarter. Although growth is forecast to
moderate thereafter, it is projected to remain robust
over the forecast horizon, backed by positive
labour market developments, improved access to
credit for firms and households, high confidence
and low oil prices. The drag on domestic demand
from private sector deleveraging is expected to
fade out. Accordingly, Spain’s economy is
expected to have expanded by 3.2% in 2015 and is
forecast to grow by 2.8% and 2.5% in 2016 and
2017, respectively, driven by domestic demand.
According to hard and soft data on economic
activity, private consumption growth remained
robust in the last quarter of 2015. Despite
moderating in 2016, it is expected to remain the
main driver of growth throughout the forecast
horizon, supported by low inflation and steadily
improving labour market conditions. However, the
increase in gross disposable income is also
foreseen to allow households to increase their
savings slightly in 2017.
Equipment investment is also forecast to decelerate
over the forecast horizon, albeit still growing at
healthy rates, underpinned by positive demand
prospects, supportive financing conditions and the
projected rebound in exports. After picking-up in
2015, construction investment is forecast to
moderate slightly in 2016 but to regain momentum
thereafter, mainly driven by non-residential
construction
dynamics,
especially
public
investment. Residential investment also looks set
to gather strength.

As a result, net exports are set to prove negative
for growth in 2015 and 2016 and broadly neutral in
2017. The current account surplus is set to widen
to 1.5% of GDP in 2015 but to narrow thereafter,
due to the decline in terms of trade. Net external
lending is expected to narrow from 2.0% of GDP
in 2015 to 1.7% in 2017.
In 2015, inflation averaged -0.6%, driven by the
fall in oil prices. It is expected to turn slightly
positive again in the short term, but to remain low
over the forecast horizon, due to low external price
pressures and remaining slack in the economy.
Employment growth to moderate

Despite decelerating slightly, job creation
remained very robust in the second half of 2015,
while the labour force registered a small
expansion, limiting the decline in the
unemployment rate to 21.2% in the third quarter of
2015, with a further expected decrease in the
fourth. Ongoing wage moderation keeps a lid on
nominal unit labour cost growth, supporting robust
though decelerating job creation. In turn,
unemployment is expected to continue falling over
the forecast horizon, falling below 19% by 2017.

Exports are expected to remain resilient, with
exports of goods progressively gathering steam,
fuelled
by
continued
improvements
in
competitiveness and recovering growth in Spain’s
main export markets. However, while imports are
forecast to decelerate in line with final demand,
they are expected to continue to outpace exports.

Member States, Spain

Deficit reduction driven by the recovery

Driven by strong economic growth and the
positive effect of improved financing conditions,
Spain’s public finances continued to improve in
2015. After reaching 5.9% of GDP in 2014, the
general government deficit ratio narrowed by a
further 0.5 pps. in the first three quarters of 2015
compared to the same period the year before. The
pace of deficit reduction is, however, waning,
despite rapid GDP growth. In the third quarter, the
deficit fell by just 0.1% of GDP, and monthly data
for October for all government levels (except local
government) indicate no further reduction. Despite
cuts in personal income taxes, total tax revenues
have held up well, helped by a strong recovery in
domestic demand and corporate tax revenues.
Government expenditure is however expected to
have grown faster in the second half of the year
than in the first half, with notable increases in
intermediate consumption and public investment.
The reduction of the general government deficit is
expected to continue to rely to a large extent on the

positive macroeconomic outlook, which will
continue supporting tax revenues and keeping
social transfers in check. In particular, while
pension expenditure is expected to continue rising,
falling unemployment limits the growth of social
transfers in the near future. Previous improvements
in financing conditions and the decelerating public
debt ratio imply that interest expenditure will
continue to fall. Overall, Spain’s general
government deficit is expected to have fallen to
4.8% of GDP in 2015 and to narrow to 3.6% in
2016 and, under a no-policy-change assumption,
by a further percentage point in 2017. Risks to this
deficit forecast stem from uncertainty about the
degree of expenditure restraint, primarily at
regional government level.
Spain’s structural balance is expected to have
deteriorated significantly in 2015 and is set to
remain broadly stable at 2½% of GDP over the
forecast period. Thanks to a narrowing deficit and
stronger nominal GDP growth, the public debt
ratio is expected to peak in 2016 at 101.2% of
GDP before falling back to 100.1% in 2017.

10. FRANCE

A slow recovery amid still large fiscal imbalances

The recovery of the French economy has begun to take hold, driven by resilient private consumption.
But growth is expected to remain moderate, as investment is projected to pick up only gradually and net
exports to remain a drag on growth. The government's headline budget deficit is expected to fall slightly
while public debt continues to rise.
Moderate growth ahead

After three years of sluggish activity, the rebound
in GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2015,
driven by private consumption, is expected to
bring France’s growth rate for the whole year to
1.1%. Based on previous events, the November
terrorist attacks are expected to have a short-lived
and limited dampening impact on confidence and
growth in 2016. Tumbling energy prices are
expected to further stimulate private consumption
and, with a delay, investment. As external trade is
not expected to contribute positively, GDP growth
is set to gain traction only slowly, reaching 1.3%
in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017.

credit conditions supported by the ECB, should
foster investment. However, the slow acceleration
in aggregate demand indicates that it may take
time before businesses feel confident enough to
invest. As a result, investment is only expected to
start growing significantly from 2017.
External trade to detract from growth

The depreciation of the euro helped to bolster
French exports in 2015 and enabled French
exporters to achieve short-term gains in market
shares. Exports are expected to remain strong,
sustained by external demand from France's major
trading partners. However, net exports will
continue to weigh on GDP growth, as the rise in
domestic demand leads to more imports.

Domestic demand gains momentum

The gradual economic recovery is set to be mainly
driven by private consumption, the traditional
driver of the French economy. While consumer
sentiment remains positive, resilient wage growth
combined with subdued inflation and lower energy
costs should support household revenues in real
terms and boost consumer spending throughout the
forecast period.
The recent improvement in corporate balance
sheets, which reflects the fall in oil prices and ongoing policy measures to reduce labour costs,
namely the ‘Tax Credit for Competitiveness and
Employment’ (CICE) and the ‘Responsibility and
Solidarity Pact’ (RSP), together with favourable

84

With the slow recovery, the labour cost reductions
associated with the CICE and the RSP are likely to
have only a limited impact on employment over
the forecast horizon and are unlikely to outweigh
the growth of the labour force. Therefore, the
unemployment rate is expected to remain stable at
10.5% in 2016, before falling slightly in 2017.
Assumptions on labour market developments do
not take into account the package of measures to
reduce unemployment announced in January.
Falling energy prices reduced inflation close to
zero in 2015. Prices are projected to accelerate
very moderately and reach an annual rate of
increase of 0.7% and 1.3% in 2016 and 2017
respectively, as the output gap of the French
economy is forecast to dwindle and inflationary
pressures generated by the euro depreciation are
felt.
Risks broadly tilted to the downside

The sustainability of the recovery strongly relies
on the assumed improvement in business
confidence, following the acceleration in aggregate
demand. A weaker demand - external or domestic could jeopardise the recovery.

Member States, France

Deficit set to decline only gradually

The headline deficit in 2015 is expected to stand at
3.7% of GDP, 0.2 pps. below the level of 2014.
Current public revenue is estimated to have grown
by 1.8% in 2015, compared to 1.9% in 2014
despite the slight increase in GDP growth. Indeed,
the revenue-increasing measures have declined
from 0.5% of GDP in 2014 when VAT rates rose,
to 0.1% of GDP in 2015. Total public expenditure
(net of one-offs) is expected to increase by 1.6%
compared to 1.7% in 2014. In particular, public
investment is expected to contract further by 2.3%,
at a slower pace than in 2014 (-7.3%), as a result
of the cut in government transfers to local
authorities.
In 2016, France’s headline deficit is set to decrease
to 3.4% of GDP. Revenue growth is projected to
accelerate to 1.9% despite the subdued inflation
outlook, tax cuts for households and further
reductions in social security contributions for
employers. Total public expenditure (net of oneoffs) is expected to grow at 1.2% in 2016 as the
government
pursues
its
spending-based
consolidation strategy. The additional spending

included in the adopted budget compared to the
draft budget, notably on security and defence,
increases government spending by over 0.05% of
GDP and has only partly been offset. The new
employment plan has not been included in the
forecast due to a lack of specification of the
underlying measures. Overall, the structural
balance is expected to improve by ⅓ pps. in 2016.
The headline deficit in 2017 is forecast to decline
to 3.2% of GDP. Under a no-policy-change
assumption, only measures that are sufficiently
specified have been incorporated in the forecast.
Revenue growth is expected to only accelerate to
2.3% as the tax cuts for firms planned under the
RSP would not be fully offset. Central government
and healthcare expenditure norms should evolve in
line with recent trends. Further expenditurereducing measures of 0.2% of GDP related to local
authorities and pension reforms have also been
taken into account.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to further
increase, albeit at a slower pace, to 97.1% of GDP
in 2017.

11. CROATIA

The recovery gains ground, but weaknesses remain

Growth picked up over the course of 2015, marking it the first year of positive growth since 2008. The
positive momentum is expected to be maintained throughout the forecast horizon, pushing the
unemployment rate down. However, the pace of the recovery remains constrained by the still high stock
of debt in both the private and public sectors. The public deficit is expected to have decreased to 4.2%
of GDP in 2015 and, on a no-policy-change basis, to continue declining going forward.
A strong third quarter confirms that a sustained
recovery is underway

account surplus to a comfortable 3% of GDP over
the next two years.

At 1.3% (q-o-q), GDP growth in the third quarter
was higher than expected. All components of
domestic demand contributed to this strong
performance, while exports of goods suffered a
temporary setback. Growth likely decelerated in
the fourth quarter, but all in all, Croatia’s economy
is expected to have expanded by 1.8% in 2015.

Risks to these growth projections are skewed to the
downside, and are mainly related to the still high
debt burden in both the public and private sectors
and the limited capacity of the financial sector to
support the recovery.

Benefitting from the strong momentum gathered in
the second half of 2015, the recovery is forecast to
gain ground in 2016. Domestic demand is
projected to remain the main driver of expansion.
Improving labour market conditions are set to
support household spending, while investment
should gain speed in 2016 and 2017 as the
absorption of EU funds improves. The contribution
of government consumption to growth is projected
to remain positive throughout the forecast horizon.
Overall, real GDP is expected to grow by 2.1% in
2016 and 2017.
The current account is set to remain in surplus
despite a projected slowdown in exports

In 2015, the current account is expected to have
registered a record surplus of 4.2% of GDP on the
back of strong exports of goods and a generous
tourism season. A temporary improvement was
registered also in the balance of primary income as
a result of losses accrued by foreign owned banks
following the new legislation on the conversion of
CHF mortgage loans.
After two years of robust expansion, exports of
both goods and services are expected to moderate
in 2016 and in 2017, on the back of more subdued
competitiveness gains and a slow-down in global
trade. Growth in import volumes is also expected
to slow down, broadly in line with the evolution of
external demand. These dynamics, combined with
a further delayed recovery in energy prices, are set
to bring about the stabilisation of the current

Unemployment is set to contract but wage and

Unemployment is expected to have decreased to
16.2% in 2015, due to the continued shrinking of
the labour force but also increasing employment.
By 2017, the unemployment rate is projected to
contract further, on the back of sustained
employment creation. However, as unemployment
remains high, the average compensation of
employees is expected to increase only
moderately.
With the fall in energy prices expected to continue
in the first half of 2016, price dynamics are set to
be subdued. The expected turnaround in oil prices
thereafter, coupled with resuming core inflation, is
set to drive inflation back to 1.6% by the end of the
forecast horizon.

Public finances benefit from stronger growth
but the deficit remains high

Revenue windfalls due to higher-than-expected
growth and some containment of expenditure
growth are expected to have improved the general
government deficit in 2015 to 4.2% of GDP, down
from 5.6% of GDP in 2014. Fiscal policy measures
are expected to have had a broadly neutral impact
on revenue as the additional revenue – in particular
from higher health contributions and indirect taxes
– was largely offset by higher deductions in
personal income taxation. Growth in primary
expenditures in 2015 is expected to have remained
below nominal GDP growth, although the increase
in investment expenditure and subsidies in the
second half of the year suggest an easing of the
consolidation effort.
The 2015 deficit outturn remains highly uncertain.
While further restructuring of corporations
classified in the general government sector may
have reduced their net borrowing, the potential
accumulation of liabilities in the health care sector
may have weighed on the budget balance.
The budget for 2016 has not been adopted before
the cut-off date of the forecast. Under the

no-policy-change
assumption,
the
general
government deficit is projected to decrease to 3.9%
of GDP in 2016. Growth in general government
revenue is likely to be supported by the dynamics
in private consumption and wages, and deficitimproving changes to the taxation of companies’
reinvested earnings. The yield from the corporate
income tax in 2016 is likely to be affected also by
the conversion of CHF loans (by reducing
corporate profits in the banking sector), with an
estimated impact of around 0.2% of GDP. In the
absence of the budget, the forecast is consistent
with the easing of expenditure restraint. The
general government deficit is projected to decline
further to 3.2% of GDP in 2017.
Overall, the structural balance is estimated to have
improved by about ¾ pps. of GDP in 2015, to
about -2¾% of GDP, and to deteriorate by ½ pps.
in 2016 (on a no-policy-change basis).
The debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to have
increased only moderately, from 85.1% in 2014 to
86.0% in 2015, reflecting stronger nominal GDP
growth and drawing on government deposits. The
debt ratio is expected to continue rising in 2016
and 2017, reaching 87.4% of GDP in 2017.

12. ITALY

Consumption supports recovery while the structural deficit worsens

After growing moderately in 2015, Italy’s economy is set to gain momentum in 2016 and 2017 as
domestic demand strengthens. Inflation is projected to remain low in 2016 also due to falling energy
prices, still high unemployment and limited labour cost pressures. In 2016 the debt-to-GDP ratio
declines only slightly also because the government structural balance is expected to deteriorate.
The recovery becomes more self-sustaining

Economic activity expanded by 0.5% (y-o-y) in the
first three quarters of 2015, although lower exports
dragged down growth in the third quarter.
Improving confidence and hard indicators suggest
that economic activity expanded further in the final
quarter, so annual growth is expected to turn out at
0.8% in 2015. Italy’s economy is set to grow at a
faster pace in 2016, but still below the euro-area
average. The continued fall in oil prices and an
expansionary fiscal stance are expected to support
domestic demand and to compensate for the
slowdown in exports. Although non-performing
loans still burden bank balance sheets, credit
conditions are set to improve in 2016 as monetary
policy remains accommodative. More favourable
credit conditions are set to support the
long-awaited recovery in investment, especially
machinery and equipment and non-residential
construction. Overall, real GDP is expected to
increase by 1.4% in 2016. Economic expansion is
set to continue in 2017 at 1.3% as higher imports
neutralise stronger external demand and
investment, and private consumption is assumed to
be constrained by the legislated increase in VAT
rates. The current-account surplus is set to stabilise
at 2.1% of GDP in 2016-17 as higher investment
offset the expected increase in savings. A further
slowdown in external demand, a possible
depreciation of emerging market currencies and
financial market turmoil pose downside risks.
The unemployment rate is forecast to decline
gradually and inflation to remain low in 2016

A three-year social contribution exemption on new
permanent hires supported the increase in
headcount employment seen over the course of
2015. This, together with a broadly stable labour
force, brought down the unemployment rate from
12.7% in 2014 to 11.9% in 2015. The 2016
Stability Law extends the scheme to new
permanent hires made in 2016, but only with
partial exemption (40%). As the recovery gathers
strength, employment is projected to continue
increasing in 2016 and 2017. Nevertheless, the

88

unemployment rate is forecast to decline gradually
over the forecast horizon, as previously
discouraged people are set to join the labour force.
Upward pressure on labour costs is projected to
remain limited partly due to cuts to the labour tax
wedge. In addition, increases in real wages realised
over recent years on the back of lower-thanexpected inflation are expected to be taken into
account in future bargaining rounds. Moderate
wage dynamics, reduction in the tax wedge and
improving labour productivity are projected to lead
to increases in nominal unit labour costs below the
euro-area average in 2016 and 2017.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

In 2015, HICP inflation was only 0.1%, as falling
imported energy prices offset the mildly positive
core inflation (0.7%). Falling energy prices and
limited wage pressures are set to curb inflation
dynamics also in 2016. HICP inflation is expected
to average 0.3% (y-o-y) in 2016 and to rise to
1.8% in 2017. A similar pattern is anticipated for
core inflation (0.8% in 2016 and 1.2% in 2017).
Part of the projected increase in 2017 comes from
a rise in VAT rates (standard rate by 2 pps. and
reduced rate by 3 pps.) included in the 2016
Stability Law to achieve the budgetary targets in
that year, unless alternative compensatory
measures are found. In the latter case, the 2017
HICP inflation could be significantly lower than
currently forecast.

Member States, Italy

An expansionary fiscal stance in 2016

In 2015, the deficit is anticipated to have fallen to
2.6% of GDP (from 3.0% in 2014), aided by a
further drop in interest expenditure and a slightly
higher primary surplus stemming from positive
economic growth. Current primary expenditure is
set to have increased by around 1% year-on-year in
nominal terms, mainly driven by the impact of the
tax credit to low-wage employees, the extension of
unemployment benefits, and new hiring in the
education system. Outlays related to the migrant
influx are estimated by the government at around
0.2% of GDP in 2015, only 0.05 pps. higher than
in 2014 but more than twice those recorded over
2011-2013. Public investment bottomed out after
five years of contraction, while one-off outlays
related to a Constitutional Court ruling about the
full de-indexation of higher pensions over 2012
and 2013 affected capital transfer dynamics. On
the revenue side, the improving economic outlook
implied positive developments for personal and
corporate income tax revenues, while VAT
revenues benefited from discretionary measures to
increase tax compliance. The reduction in the
labour tax wedge affected intakes from the
regional tax on economic activities (IRAP) and
social contributions. Overall, the annual increase in
revenue is set to have been broadly in line with

nominal GDP growth. The structural balance is set
to have marginally improved in 2015 relative to
2014. In 2016, despite the positive growth outlook,
the headline deficit is projected to decline
marginally to 2.5% of GDP. This reflects the
expansionary impact of the 2016 Stability Law,
including EUR 3.2 bn of additional expenditure on
security and culture that increased the deficit target
to 2.4% of GDP from the 2.2% planned in the
Draft Budgetary Plan. As a result, the structural
balance is expected to worsen by around ¾ pps. of
GDP in 2016. Primary expenditure is expected to
continue increasing at a moderate pace (0.9%
y-o-y in nominal terms). On the other hand, tax
revenues are forecast to increase less than nominal
GDP growth, mainly due to further cuts to the
labour tax wedge and the abolition of property
taxation on first residences. As a result, the tax
burden is set to fall by nearly ¾ pps. of GDP
compared to 2015. Based on a no-policy-change
assumption, the headline deficit is projected to
decline to 1.5% of GDP in 2017, including the
legislated increase in VAT rates. After the peak
reached in 2015 (just below 133% of GDP) the
government debt ratio is set to decrease only
slightly in 2016, also due to the worsening
structural balance, and more in 2017 thanks to
higher nominal growth and primary surplus.

13. CYPRUS

Growth turns positive as domestic demand rebounds

Cyprus’ economy is expected to have grown by 1.4% in 2015, driven by both domestic and external
demand with the support of low inflation and the euro’s depreciation. Growth is forecast to gather
further strength and reach 2.0% in 2017 which should support the labour market and set unemployment
on a downward trajectory. Public finances are also expected to continue improving.
Economic activity picked up in 2015

Real GDP growth strengthened in the first three
quarters of 2015 after spending three years in
negative territory. In light of improving short-term
indicators, such as economic sentiment and tourist
arrivals, real GDP is expected to have grown by
1.4% in 2015 as a whole, driven by both domestic
and external demand, with additional support from
low inflation and the depreciation of the euro.
However, export growth was not sufficiently
strong to counterbalance the growth of imports,
which rose on the back of stronger domestic
demand and the higher number of ship
registrations. Therefore, net exports contributed
negatively to GDP growth.
Growth in 2015 was also supported by the slower
pace of public spending cuts and the slight increase
in investment. However, investment growth was
mainly driven by new registrations of ships in
Cyprus, which have a corresponding positive
impact on imports and, therefore, no net impact on
GDP growth. The labour market improved with
employment slowly picking up and unemployment
starting to decline.
Growth is forecast to gradually gain further
strength

In 2016, domestic demand is forecast to shape
growth, as the support to private consumption from
low inflation is set to continue. Investment growth,
however, should slow, due to a negative base
effect from the high number of ship registrations
observed in 2015. Nevertheless, the underlying
momentum of investment is gathering strength,
alongside the easing of credit supply conditions.
The drag from falling inventories and public
spending cuts will ease and thus provide some
additional support to growth. Net exports are
expected to be broadly neutral to GDP growth, as
export growth is forecast to slow reflecting that the
positive impact from the depreciation of the euro
looks set to weaken.

Increasing economic growth over the forecast
horizon should lead to further labour market
improvements. While GDP growth is forecast to
reach 1.5% in 2016 and 2.0% in 2017,
unemployment is expected to decline to around
13% by 2017. With unemployment still high and
inflation expectations still subdued, wage growth
should remain muted, in 2016 and 2017. High
profit margins, reflecting weakened pass-through
of lower unit labour costs on domestic prices, are
set to result in only limited upward pressure on
prices.
Risks to the outlook remain broadly balanced

On the upside, the renewed weakness in energy
prices and the effects of the past euro’s
depreciation could support consumption and
exports more than expected. On the downside, the
weakening of external demand and the sanctions
against Russia could weigh more on activity than
forecast. In the financial sector, the slow pace of
reduction in the high level of non-performing loans
could lead to a more prolonged period of tight
credit conditions, which would dampen the
recovery.
Fiscal adjustment continues

The general government primary balance is
forecast to reach a surplus of 2.2% of GDP in

90

Member States, Cyprus

2015, with a corresponding headline deficit of
1.0% of GDP. (50) Excluding the one-off effect of
banking recapitalisation in 2014, the primary
balance is expected to worsen by 0.4 pps. of GDP,
largely driven by factors beyond the control of the
government, such as new location rules regarding
VAT for e-commerce services, the channelling of
some revenue to the national banking resolution
fund, and a decrease in dividend income from the
Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC). The deficit
increasing impact of the above mentioned factors
are, however, partly compensated by one-off
revenues linked to fines imposed by the national
competition authority. On the expenditure side, the
expected 2015 outcome is affected by higher
expenditures related to the closure of Cyprus
Airways and the introduction of the new
Guaranteed Minimum Income scheme.

largely driven by the improving economic outlook.
This rise is expected despite the kicking-in of
items that had been frozen during the programme,
such as increases in wages and pensions. The
projections also account for dividend income from
the CBC. (51)
The worsening of the 2015 structural balance was
mainly driven by the deterioration in the headline
balance. In 2016, the structural balance is expected
to improve slightly, as the headline balance
improves and the output gap narrows further. In
2017, however, the structural balance is expected
to worsen again despite an improving headline
balance, as the output gap turns positive.

The primary surplus is expected to increase to
2.6% of GDP in 2016 and stay constant in 2017,

The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak in 2015
at about 108% and to decline to 95% in 2017. The
peak has been shifted from 2014 to 2015, as the
debt-decreasing impact of certain initiatives is now
expected to kick-in only in 2016.

(51)

These numbers do not account for the banking
recapitalisation of December 2015, as the size of the likely

Rebound in new loans supports growth

Economic growth is set to improve amid growing evidence that the low-interest environment is
supporting bank lending. The economy also benefits from low energy prices while exporters remain
resilient to the challenging external environment. Latvia’s fiscal position has improved on the back of
the better outturn in 2015 and the favourable economic outlook.
Growth gains momentum

Economic growth is estimated to have picked up to
2.7% in 2015 supported by better-than-expected
investment and construction volumes. Growth is
forecast to improve further to 3.1% in 2016 and
3.2% in 2017, driven mainly by private
consumption and investment. The risks to the
forecast are broadly balanced, as the unstable
external environment and domestic political
tensions are largely offset by the strong upturn in
the tourism sector, significant cost savings from
low energy prices, and the successful reorientation of domestic businesses towards new
products and markets.

However, as consumer sentiment remains
relatively weak, a large part of the income gains
are foreseen to be directed to precautionary
savings and debt repayment.
External balance remains stable

While imports are expected to grow faster than
exports in volume terms, the low price of energy
brings some terms-of-trade benefits to the
country’s external balance in 2016. The currentaccount deficit is therefore expected to remain
broadly stable at around 2% of GDP by the end of
2016 and to increase moderately in 2017. In 2015,
exports grew only marginally in volume terms but
above demand from trading partners, showing
significant resilience to the challenging external
environment. Export growth is set to accelerate
over the forecast horizon due to higher demand
from trading partners, while the continuous rise in
unit labour costs is expected to negatively impact
export market shares.

Low interest rates support demand

Following a decline in outstanding loans over the
past few years, lending activity began to increase
over the course of 2015 along with the fall in
interest rates. New loans to residents increased by
around 10% y-o-y in the third quarter of 2015.
Retail lending rose even faster by 23%, with
similar rates reported for both consumer and
mortgage loans. The positive surprise in both
investment and construction output can therefore
be at least partly linked to the rebound in new
lending. In addition, private consumption has been
supported by higher wages and low energy prices.

92

For the first time since the 2008-2010 crisis, the
unemployment rate dropped below 10% in 2015
and is expected to decline further to 8.6% in 2017.
Nevertheless, unfavourable demographics and
relatively high structural unemployment are
limiting employment growth to modest rates. Steep
wage growth is also negatively affecting
employment demand, especially in regions with
higher unemployment. Wage growth is
nevertheless expected to marginally slow down as
of 2016 due to a much weaker minimum wage
adjustment than in previous years.
Energy prices keep inflation low

The decrease in crude oil prices at the beginning of
2016 is posing substantial downward pressure on
consumer price inflation. Along with the
immediate impact on fuel prices, lagged effects on
natural gas, heating and transport services are set
to keep inflation (HICP) low at 0.4% in 2016.
Provided oil prices recover as assumed, inflation

Member States, Latvia

should reach 2.0% in 2017. Core inflation is
meanwhile forecast at a higher rate of 1.4% in
2016 and 2.2% in 2017.
Solid tax collection improves fiscal outlook

Latvia’s 2015 budget deficit is estimated at 1.3%
of GDP, based on a stronger-than-expected cash
revenue outturn and lower expenditure. Personal
income tax revenue and dividend payments from
state enterprises exceeded expectations in the last
few months of the year. Excise duties benefited
from an increase in fuel consumption linked to low
oil prices. VAT revenue outperformed private
consumption growth on the back of better tax
collection. Current expenditure turned out to be
lower-than-budgeted, in particular for purchases of
goods and services, while capital spending
exceeded the plans.
In 2016, the government deficit is projected to
decline to 1.0% of GDP, mainly as a result of netdeficit-reducing measures equivalent to 0.4% of
GDP. The strong tax revenue collection in 2015
has improved fiscal outlook. Personal income tax
revenue is expected to benefit from robust wage
growth, while the moderation in private

consumption implies a lower growth in indirect tax
revenue compared to the autumn 2015 forecast.
Government expenditure growth is driven by
wages and purchases, as well as the continued
increase in social spending on the back of the
growing number of pensioners and higher
contribution-based benefit rates. Capital spending
is expected to accelerate in 2017 as the number of
projects under the new EU budget framework
picks up. The debt buyback operation in December
2015 is estimated to produce interest saving of
around 0.1% of GDP in 2016 and 2017 as Latvia
benefits from the low interest on new borrowing.
The government deficit is forecast at 1.0% of GDP
in 2017 under a no-policy change assumption. The
structural deficit is expected to narrow from about
2.0% of GDP in 2015 to about 1½% of GDP in
2017, reflecting the improvement in the nominal
deficit.
Government debt is projected to temporarily
increase from about 37% of GDP in 2015 to 40%
of GDP at the end of 2016, reflecting the prefinancing of a large bond redemption in early
2017.

Robust domestic demand and recovering exports lifts growth

Growth is expected to strengthen in 2016 as private consumption remains strong and exports pick up. A
temporary decline in EU fund disbursements is expected to slow down investment growth in 2016 before
pickup up in 2017. As the labour market continues to tighten, wage growth is set to accelerate lifting
inflation in 2016 despite the continuing fall in energy prices. The improvement in public finances is set
to pause until 2017.
Mixed developments in 2015 result in lacklustre
growth

construction activities coupled with the impact of
EU structural fund period changeover.

Lithuania’s real GDP is expected to have grown by
1.6% in 2015. While domestic demand growth
exceeded initial expectations considerably,
plummeting demand from outside the EU led to
disappointing export performance. A surge in EU
fund disbursements fuelled rapid investment
growth in 2015. At the same time, increasing
competition for labour ensured robust wage growth
while negative inflation, driven by falling energy
and food prices, further supported real disposable
incomes.

Growing demand from the EU is forecast to drive
export growth in 2016 despite a drag from the
continuing recession in Russia and other CIS
countries. As the EU recovery strengthens
Lithuania’s export growth is expected to accelerate
in 2017 and receive a further boost once demand
from non-EU markets resumes growing. Solid
domestic demand is expected to keep the import
growth not far behind.

Improving external environment to help growth
in 2016

Economic growth is expected to rise from 1.6% in
2015 to 2.9% in 2016 as private consumption
continues to grow robustly and exports benefit
from an improvement in the external environment.
A further pick up in exports and recovering
investments is expected to lift real GDP growth to
3.4% in 2017. Rising real disposable incomes on
the back of wage growth and low inflation is set to
ensure that consumption continues to grow solidly
in 2016. Investment growth is expected to slow
down significantly in 2016, before recovering
somewhat in 2017, due to a slowdown in

94

While job creation is expected to slow down
considerably in 2016, a shrinking labour force due
to net emigration and population ageing will
ensure a falling unemployment rate. This in turn is
about to add further fuel to the fast wage growth.
Risks to the forecast are tilted to the downside and
stem from declining global trade and a prolonged
recession in Russia which could dampen export
growth.
Continued fall in energy prices to keep HICP
inflation low

Following a 0.7% drop in consumer prices in 2015,
inflation is expected to pick up slightly in 2016.
While rising wages are set to push prices of
services up at a solid pace, the continued fall in
energy prices is expected to keep inflation low in
2016. A trend reversal in energy prices is forecast
to increase inflation rapidly in 2017.
Fiscal improvement still on hold

In 2015, the general government deficit is
estimated to have risen to 0.9% of GDP from 0.7%
a year before. Higher social spending and an
increase in defence expenditure were only partially
covered by new revenue measures. In addition,
one-off factors had no positive impact on the
deficit as in 2014. The surplus coming from the
deposit insurance (0.4 pps.) was offset by
expenditures to compensate public wage cuts

Member States, Lithuania

considered unlawful by the constitutional court.
2015 tax revenues slightly exceeded the
government’s plan despite lower-than-expected
nominal GDP growth, as tax rich domestic
consumption grew strongly.
For 2016, the general government deficit is
forecast to increase to 1.2% of GDP in line with
the government's target. Strong domestic demand,
buoyant wage growth and some small tax increases
are set to support revenue growth. However, this is
expected to be insufficient to offset an increase in
non-taxable incomes, pensions and some public
wages.
Assuming no policy changes, the general
government deficit is forecast to fall to 0.4% of
GDP in 2017, mainly on the back of robust
economic growth and the expected limited increase
in expenditure.

Risks to the public finance forecast are tilted to the
downside, particularly in 2016 due to the electoral
cycle.
Lithuania’s structural deficit is expected to
decrease to about 1% of GDP in 2015 and to
increase to about 1½% of GDP in 2016 due to
additional expenditure measures, before decreasing
to about 1% of GDP in 2017.
General government debt is set to have increased
from 40.7% of GDP in 2014 to 42.7% in 2015, due
to the pre-financing of bond redemptions and
higher-than-usual pre-financing of EU-funded
expenditures. In 2016, debt is forecast to fall back
to 40.6% of GDP, while in 2017 it is expected to
increase again to 42.3% due to the end of year prefinancing of forthcoming bond redemptions.

Robust growth ahead

Luxembourg’s growth is expected to have accelerated to 4.7% in 2015 from 4.1% in the previous year,
mainly due to strong exports of financial and non-financial services. In spite of the VAT rates increase
headline inflation remained mute. Employment growth is projected to remain solid, while unemployment
is expected to decrease only marginally. Public finances are projected to remain sound.
Real GDP year-on-year growth in the last quarter
of 2015 is likely come in weak as a result of base
effects, given that the last quarter of 2014 was
exceptionally strong due to anticipation effects
related to the increase in VAT rates that took place
at beginning of 2015. Over 2015 as a whole,
however, Luxembourg’s economy is expected to
have expanded by 4.7%, driven by a sharp
improvement in net exports of services and strong
growth of 5.7% in the first three quarters of the
year.

stance,

investment is expected to remain subdued, as
capacity utilisation remains low.
Finally, in 2016 volatile financial markets are
forecast to limit the contribution to growth of net
exports. While import is expected to remain
broadly stable, financial market turbulence is
projected to have a dampening effect on the
export-focused financial industry.
In 2017, the contribution of net export to growth is
expected to become more pronounced, while
private consumption will contribute less, given a
less favourable labour market and increasing price
pressures. Overall Luxembourg’s economy is
forecast to grow by around 4.4% in 2017.

Robust but volatile growth ahead

In 2016, GDP is expected to grow by 3.8% still
mostly driven by the large, even if decreasing,
contribution from net export. By contrast, the
contribution from domestic demand is expected to
build up. Low oil prices, favourable financial
conditions and positive employment prospects will
provide tailwinds to private consumption.
Moreover, household purchasing power should
also benefit from indexed wage increases, even if
these are now only expected to occur in the second
half of the year. Favourable lending conditions
should
boost
investment.
In
particular,
construction is projected to remain robust over the
forecast period, supported both by household and
public sector investment plans, the latter being
engaged with the execution of large public
infrastructure projects. By contrast, in spite of the

96

The financial sector will remain the main growth
engine and in the near future, the country's
economic prospects will hinge on its ability to
address all the challenges that the sector is facing.
Job creation remains robust

In 2015, employment growth is expected to have
accelerated to 2.6% from 2.5% in 2014. However,
this proved to be insufficient to lower the
unemployment rate, which increased to 6.1% from
6.0% the previous year. As non-residents are likely
to benefit more from declining, but still robust job
creation, the unemployment rate is forecast to
decrease only marginally by the end of the forecast
horizon.
A rebound in inflation has been delayed

Headline HICP inflation fell to 0.1% in 2015,
mainly because of the pronounced drop in oil
prices. As oil prices are expected to remain low for
a protracted period, the projected rebound in
inflation is unlikely to occur before 2017. On the
basis of these projections, the automatic indexation
of wages will be triggered only in the second half
on 2016. Core inflation is projected to remain

Member States, Luxembourg

stable just below 2% in 2016 and 2017, better
reflecting the impact of the increase in all VAT
rates that occurred at the start of 2015.

In line with the expected incremental impact of
measures adopted with the 2015 budget,
government finances are projected to improve and
lead to a larger surplus in 2016 and 2017, even if
in the latter year’s improvements will be limited
given that Luxembourg’s share of e-VAT revenues
will be further reduced from 30% to 15% of VAT
proceeds related to e-commerce activities.

Small but stable fiscal surplus ahead

In 2015, the sharp drop in VAT revenues from
e-commerce, equivalent to around 1¼% of GDP,
was only partially counterbalanced by the
additional revenues from the new tax levied on
personal income and the revenues linked to the
2 pp. increase in VAT rates. Finally, in line with
the favourable evolution of the stock markets,
revenues from the subscription tax on the net
assets of investment funds were higher than
originally expected.

This forecast does not include any impact from the
announced reform of the taxation system set to be
implemented at beginning of 2017 given that it is
not sufficiently specified yet.
The surplus of the government’s structural balance
is expected to narrow by about 1¾% of GDP in
2015, still remaining in positive territory and to
decline further towards the end of the forecast
period as the output gap closes rapidly.

On the expenditure side, savings from the nonindexation of social expenditure have been offset
by a surge in public investment and associated
intermediate consumption costs. Costs related to
Luxembourg’s
EU
Presidency
and
the
implementation of a public sector-wide wage
agreement have also driven up overall expenditure.

Luxembourg’s debt-to-GDP ratio is set to decrease
from 23% in 2014 to 21.3% in 2015, to then
increase slightly to 22% at the end of the forecast
horizon.

The general government surplus is thus expected
to drop from 1.4% in 2014 to 0.2% of GDP in
2015.

17. HUNGARY

Private consumption becomes the main growth driver

Hungary’s economy grew by 3.7% in 2014 but real GDP growth is expected to have slowed down to
2.7% in 2015 and is projected to further decelerate to 2.1% in 2016 before rebounding to 2.5% in 2017.
Unemployment decreases further and inflation gradually picks up. Following an expected
overachievement of the official target, the government deficit is projected to stabilise at historically low
levels, around 2% of GDP.
Households sustain growth

GDP growth in Hungary declined to 2.4% (y-o-y)
in 2015-Q3 from 2.7% y-o-y in 2015-Q2. The
slowdown was caused mainly by the negative
contribution of the agricultural sector due to
weather conditions. At the same time, both
manufacturing
and
construction
posted
weaker-than-expected figures, in line with the
deceleration of exports and the slowdown in EU
fund absorption compared to the autumn
expectations. Overall, GDP is projected to have
increased by 2.7% in 2015.
Economic growth is expected to be slightly less
dynamic at the beginning of 2016 partly because of
the decrease in EU fund absorption as well as the
slowdown in external demand. This should be
partially compensated by steady growth in private
consumption of more than 3%. Real disposable
income and household spending will enjoy a boost
from a 1 pp. cut in the flat personal income tax rate
(from 16% to 15%) and the effect of an earlier
policy to convert foreign currency-denominated
loans into HUF. While households are also
expected to increase their investment in real estate,
corporate gross fixed capital formation will be
negatively affected by the slowdown in EU fund
absorption. Public investment is expected to be the
most affected and to fall in 2016, dragging overall
investment growth into negative territory.
In 2017, private consumption should remain robust
and drive growth. In addition, the reduction of the
bank levy and new central bank policies providing
subsidised lending to SMEs should create a
friendlier lending environment. Furthermore, the
reduction of the VAT on new homes to 5% is
projected to provide an impulse to the housing
market too. All in all, investment growth is
expected to turn positive again and the strength of
domestic demand as a whole should propel GDP
growth to 2.5%. Net exports are forecast to
contribute positively to growth, but to a lesser
extent than in 2016, driving the current surplus
wider. Throughout the forecast horizon,

98

household’s precautionary savings attitude is set to
decrease.
Unemployment continues to fall while inflation
picks up

The unemployment rate is at an all-time low and is
expected to further decrease to around 5% at the
end of the forecast horizon, as activity continues to
expand. Employment is growing, not just because
of the government’s public works scheme, but also
because of job creation in the private sector.
Prices in 2015 were broadly stable. In 2016,
inflation is expected to revive to 1.7%, but
lower-than-expected oil prices, subdued imported
inflation and low food prices imply that the central
bank’s 3% target is not likely to be reached before
the end of 2017.
Risks are rather on the upside

The agricultural sector posted a negative
contribution to growth in 2015. This means that a
better-than-average agricultural year is a positive
risk to 2016. On the other hand, the slow phasing
out of the Funding for Growth Scheme and the full
implementation of the announced policy
commitments towards the financial sector could
further improve lending conditions and help
growth more than expected.
The headline deficit stabilises at around 2% of
GDP

Based on the preliminary outturn data, the 2015
general government deficit is expected to have
reached 2.1 % of GDP, down from 2.5% in the
previous year and 0.3 pps. below the official
target. Tax and social security receipts
significantly exceeded the budgeted numbers,
while interest outlays turned out to be lower. These
favourable developments were partly absorbed by
additional expenditure, most notably the
higher-than-expected spending from domestic
sources on EU- funded projects.

Member States, Hungary

In 2016, the deficit is projected at 2.0% of GDP.
The forecast incorporates considerable tax cuts
amounting to 0.7% of GDP as well as
expenditure-increasing measures, such as a new
support scheme for families buying newly-built
flats. This is projected to be counterbalanced by
positive base effects, decreasing interest outlays,
savings in the domestic co-financing of EU-funded
projects, as well as by contained expenditure on
social payments and operating costs. At the same
time, the primary balance is expected to deteriorate
somewhat. It is assumed that the special reserve
(0.2% of GDP) will not be spent.
Based on a no-policy-change assumption, the
deficit is projected to decrease slightly to 1.9% of
GDP in 2017. Further expenditure decreases on
interest payments, pensions, and the domestic
co-financing of EU-funded projects are expected to
contribute to the reduction of the deficit. However,
this is expected to be largely offset by the effect of
the already announced deficit-increasing measures
(including the tax cuts) and the phasing out of
one-off revenues from agricultural land sales.

Regarding risks, the 2015 deficit outcome still
depends on the fiscal performance of local
governments which is subject to some uncertainty.
Looking ahead, notable negative budgetary risks
stem from the open-ended nature of the new
housing support scheme and the tight funding
targets set for operating costs, in particular in the
healthcare sector. However, the receipts from land
sales could well exceed the budgeted plans.
Hungary’s structural budget balance is expected to
remain somewhat below -2% over the forecast
horizon with an estimated temporary deterioration
in 2016 of 0.4 pps. Hungary’s debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decrease by less than 0.5 pps. to
75.8% this year, mainly due to delays in the receipt
of EU funds. As the effect of the low deficit
prevails, the pace of debt reduction is expected to
accelerate thereafter, leading the debt ratio to
decline to 72.4% by the end of 2017.

Robust growth outlook

Real GDP growth peaked in 2015 on the back of strong investment and supported by private
consumption. Growth is expected to moderate in 2016 and 2017 with the phasing out of the major
investment projects. The general government deficit and debt are forecast to decline further also thanks
to the favourable macroeconomic conditions.

in

and

Malta’s economy grew by 5.4% (y-o-y) in the third
quarter of 2015, slightly less than the 5.8%
increase reported in the second quarter. The latest
national accounts release features notable upward
revisions to the growth figures of recent quarters,
which will result in an even stronger carryover
going forward. The main engine of growth
continued to be investment, particularly machinery
and equipment investment associated with large
ongoing energy investment projects. Private
consumption expanded by 5.1% on the back of
strong
wage
growth
and
record-low
unemployment. The high import-dependence of
domestic demand resulted in a negative
contribution of net exports to growth. Favourable
developments in the traditionally volatile primary
income account fully offset this. As a result the
current account surplus increased further.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

Real GDP growth is forecast to reach 4.9% in 2015
before moderating to 3.9% in 2016 and further to
3.4% in 2017. The expected slowdown primarily
reflects the planned completion of large-scale
energy investment projects in 2016 and the
expiration of the 2007-13 programming period of
EU funding. Private consumption is therefore
projected to become the main driver of growth
over the forecast horizon, contributing on average

100

over 1.5 pps. per year to growth in 2016 and 2017.
Export growth is expected to continue recovering
gradually, helping Malta to regain export market
shares. As demand for capital goods slows down in
line with the decrease in investment and oil prices
remain subdued, net exports are expected to make
a positive contribution to GDP growth in 2016-17.
The risks to this macroeconomic forecast are
balanced. Upside risks are related mainly to the
investment outlook due for example to the
materialisation of additional infrastructure projects
linked to the Investment Plan for Europe and the
potential impact of the establishment of a
development bank to help SMEs access financing.
At the same time, protracted weakness in emerging
markets could hamper the recovery of exports,
given Malta’s large exposure to trading partners
outside the EU.
Unemployment continued dropping over the third
quarter of 2015 thanks to sustained job creation.
The unemployment rate is projected to average
5.4% for the year as a whole and to remain broadly
unchanged until the end of the forecast horizon.
The very low unemployment rate points to some
tightness in the labour market, which, combined
with strong productivity gains, are forecast to
result in some upward pressure on wage growth.
HICP inflation is forecast to return to above 2% by
2017 on the back of higher energy inflation,
reflecting the expiration of the low base effect
from cutting electricity tariffs for households in
2016 and a gradual recovery in oil prices in 2017.
Services inflation is also projected to accelerate.
Inflation is forecast to be among the highest in the
euro area over the forecast horizon.
Budget deficit decreases further

In 2015 the general government deficit is projected
to have decreased further to 1.6% of GDP, from
2.1% of GDP in 2014, supported by strong
nominal GDP growth. Revenue growth is expected
to benefit from the positive outlook for the labour
market and consumer demand, as well as the

Member States, Malta

proceeds from the citizenship programme (0.9% of
GDP). Despite the moderation in the growth rate
for social transfers and interest, current
expenditure is expected to increase by 5.5%
(y-o-y) in nominal terms. Net investment is
expected to remain at levels close to 2014, while
subsidies to investment are set to increase on the
back of a further capital injection into Air Malta
(0.5% of GDP).
In 2016 the deficit is forecast to further decrease to
1.1% of GDP. Despite the increase in excise duty
on various products, current revenue is expected to
grow less than nominal GDP. This reflects the
lowering of income tax for low income earners, the
phasing out of the eco contribution and the high
base effect for the proceeds linked to the
citizenship programme. Current expenditure is
expected to continue growing due to measures
introduced with the 2016 Budget, including an
upward adjustment of the minimum contributory
pension and the partial funding of the cost of home

care for the elderly. Public investment is expected
to decrease on the back of the phasing out of the
capital injection to the national airline, while the
sharp decline in the absorption of EU funds due to
the beginning of a new programming period
should be partially compensated for by a higher
reliance on national funds. In 2017, under a
no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is
expected to decline further to 1.0% of GDP thanks
to favourable nominal GDP growth.
The structural deficit ratio is estimated to have
remained stable in 2014. It is projected to improve
by ½ pp. of GDP in both 2015 and 2016 and by
¼ pp. of GDP in 2017.
From 66.9% of GDP in 2014, the debt ratio is
projected to fall further in 2015 to 64% of GDP,
also thanks to the expected repayment of some tax
arrears from the public energy utility corporation.
It is expected to follow a downward path and to
reach 58.7% of GDP by 2017.

19. THE NETHERLANDS

Recovery on track despite some easing of momentum

The economy of the Netherlands likely grew by 2% in 2015, twice as fast as the year before. Forwardlooking indicators suggest that the recovery will continue, with growth forecast at 2.1% in 2016 and
2.3% in 2017. Tax measures are expected to fuel domestic demand but lower gas production levels
should weigh on both industrial output and public finances.
Strong domestic demand growth in 2015

In 2015, economic growth is estimated to have
reached 2.0%, thanks in large part to a strong
performance of domestic demand (excluding
inventories) of 2.4 pps. Domestic demand thrived
on the back of an improving housing market,
which led to a jump of investment in housing and
construction. With other investment categories also
showing robust growth, total investment is
expected to have provided a GDP growth
contribution of 1.8 pps. Private consumption is
slowly recovering from a relatively steep fall after
the crisis and is expected to have provided a
positive growth contribution of 0.6 pps. in 2015.
Net exports are likely to have provided only a
minimal positive contribution to GDP growth,
whereas disinvestment in inventories is expected to
have detracted from GDP growth.
Consumption growth expected to accelerate

Private consumption is set to accelerate in 2016 as
the domestic cycle matures. Rising wage growth
and steady employment growth are expected to
bolster household income. This is further
stimulated by large tax cuts and recent pension
reforms, leading to higher disposable household
income and lower compulsory savings. All in all,
consumption growth is expected to increase from
1.7% to 2.2% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017. The
household saving rate is expected to stabilise in
2016 around 15% of gross disposable income,
before declining in 2017 to 14%.
The 2016 investment outlook is shaped by
international uncertainties

Investment growth is expected to moderate from
the brisk rates recorded in 2015 as the housing
market recovery is expected to slow, leading to
less dynamic investment in construction and
housing. Relatively healthy export growth and the
better domestic economic environment should
continue to fuel investment in equipment, albeit at
a slower pace than in 2015. Above all, the external
uncertainties surrounding the investment forecast

102

are large; lower growth in export markets, for
example, could lead some investment to be
postponed.

External surplus to remain high

Import growth is expected to outstrip export
growth throughout the forecast horizon, leading to
a negative contribution of net exports to GDP
growth on average. However, the current account
surplus is expected to remain elevated at around
10% of GDP in 2016, and to narrow only
moderately thereafter.
Slow labour market recovery

Labour market conditions have improved
markedly over the course of 2015 despite
economic growth waning in the second half of the
year. Over the course of 2015, total employment
grew by 0.9%. Rising vacancy numbers continue
to signal a recovery in labour demand.
Nevertheless, the number of vacancies is growing
relatively slowly and stands well below pre-crisis
levels, which suggests a lacklustre labour market
recovery. Employment is expected to increase only
slightly more than the growth of the labour force,
so the unemployment rate looks set to remain
above 6% throughout the forecast horizon. Recent
migration flows are unlikely to impact the labour
market significantly in the forecast, as current

regulations limit labour participation during the
application process for residence and work
permits.

to safety concerns. This is expected to reduce
government revenues by 0.1% of GDP in 2015 and
by 0.3% in both 2016 and 2017. Second, the
government has implemented a large tax-stimulus
package (EUR 5 billion, 0.7% of GDP) in 2016,
which will have an immediate revenue-lowering
effect over the entire forecast horizon. Since the
2015 autumn forecast, the government has freed
resources for covering the costs of refugees. In
total, the relevant budgets have been increased by
EUR 350 million in 2015 and by almost EUR 500
million in 2016. As these expenditures fall under
strict expenditure ceilings, with mandatory
compensating measures having been taken
elsewhere, the direct impact on the budget deficit
is expected to be minimal.

Inflation is expected to bottom out

HICP inflation is estimated to have reached 0.2%
in 2015, 0.1 pps. lower than in 2014. Although oil
prices are expected to remain very low for some
time, a gradual increase in the headline rate of
inflation is expected for 2016 and 2017. This
should come from a pick-up in public and private
sector wage growth and a swift closure of the
output gap, leading to positive domestic price
pressures. Moreover, strong and relatively stable
core inflation indicates limited second round
effects from low inflation, while base effects
linked to energy prices are expected to cause
volatility in headline inflation in 2016.

All in all, the general government deficit is
expected to turn out at 2.2% of GDP in 2015, and
to decline to 1.8% of GDP in 2016 and 1.5% of
GDP in 2017. The structural deficit is expected to
deteriorate by ½ pps. in 2016, after which it is
expected to stabilise in 2017. The sale of financial
assets and expected positive nominal GDP growth
has improved the outlook for the debt-to-GDP
ratio, which is expected to have reached 66.8% in
2015, and is set to decline to 66.2% in 2016 and
65.1% in 2017.

Slow improvement in headline deficit

Although the budgetary situation of the
Netherlands is improving on the back of relatively
strong growth in the tax base, several distinct
factors are expected to worsen the fiscal outlook.
First, the Dutch authorities have further reduced
the production ceiling for natural gas in the
Groningen field, as recurring earthquakes have led

20. AUSTRIA

Signs of economic growth picking up

Austria’s economic activity is expected to gather momentum in 2016 and 2017. Early signs that private
consumption and investment activity are increasing suggest a promising economic outlook supported by
foreign trade. Immigration is expected to lead to rising public expenditure, and labour market
integration of asylum-seekers remains a challenge. The financing of the income tax reform represents a
downside risk for the government budget.
Slow but stable economic development

Austria’s economy continues to grow at a slow but
steady rate, with real GDP expected to have risen
by 0.7% in 2015. Whereas private consumption
only increased at a low level, government
expenditure contributed largely to economic
growth, particularly towards the end of the year.
This is also due to exceptional spending resulting
from the sudden and large increase in asylum
seekers. Investment is expected to have grown by
0.7% in 2015 after two years of decline, which
indicates
accelerating
economic
activity.
Economic growth was supported by positive
foreign trade with markedly increased activity in
the third quarter for both exports and imports.
Signs of slightly accelerating economic activity

With improving dynamics in private consumption
and investment, Austria’s economy is expected to
end a four-year period of sluggish growth. GDP
growth in 2016 and 2017 is expected to be more
than double the rate in 2015 at 1.7% and 1.6%
respectively.
The main drivers for this increase in growth lie in
higher household incomes and growing investment
activities. The income tax reform taking effect
from 2016 should leave households with more
room for consumption, while inflation remains
contained. Stronger investment activity is
expected, especially for equipment, where subdued
and deferred investments have created needs for
renewal. At the same time, exports face a rather
promising outlook, triggering investment in
equipment. The increased inflow of asylumseekers should impact on GDP growth through
additional government expenditure and some
increase in private consumption.
Austria’s exporters are expected to find ways to
compensate for the weakened demand from
emerging market economies. The decline in
exports to China and Russia should be
counterbalanced by increased exports to the US

104

and main trading partners in Europe. In 2016, the
export industry will also benefit from low oil
prices and the low interest rate environment.
Growing labour force and unemployment

The increased inflow of asylum-seekers to Austria
during 2015 is expected to continue in 2016.
Although it will take time for the majority of
asylum-seekers to join the labour market, they are
expected to contribute to a rising labour force in
the coming years. In addition, elderly people will
increasingly participate in the labour market, partly
due to reduced possibilities for early retirement.
These increases in the labour force are expected to
contribute to an increase in the unemployment rate
to 6.2% and 6.4% respectively in 2016 and 2017.
Low oil price weighs on inflation

Energy prices will continue to have a dampening
effect on overall consumer price levels, as the oil
price is expected to remain low throughout 2016,
rising only in 2017. However, with stable inflation
in the services and tourism sectors, overall HICP
inflation remains positive. After reaching 0.8% in
2015, overall inflation is forecast to increase to
0.9% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017. This reflects the
brighter prospects for economic activity and
domestic demand growth in the coming years.
Higher social spending keeps pressure on
government accounts

The general government headline deficit is
expected to have decreased to 1.6% of GDP in
2015, mainly due to the fading out of a part of the
costs related to the restructuring of the banking
sector. Costs connected with the asset management
company HETA created for the winding down of
the former Hypo Alpe Adria Bank amounted to
roughly EUR 5 billion in 2014 (1.6% of GDP) and
to about EUR 2 billion in 2015 (0.6% of GDP). In
2015, government revenues picked up along with
improving growth dynamics, driven in particular

Member States, Austria

by increased taxes on products and higher taxes on
income and wealth paid by households.
In 2016, the government deficit is expected to
reach 1.7% of GDP, thanks to a further decrease in
expenditure for bank support. Expenditure for the
financial sector is estimated at EUR 700 million
(0.2% of GDP), corresponding to the provision
budgeted by the government for bank support. This
improvement is partially offset by higher social
transfers connected with increasing unemployment
and the inflow of asylum seekers, which is difficult
to predict. On the revenue side, uncertainty
remains on the effectiveness of measures aimed at
financing the income tax relief. This represents a
downside risk for the government budget, which
could partially offset the effects of the positive
macroeconomic outlook on collected taxes. In
2017, the government deficit is expected to remain
stable at 1.7% of GDP, mainly as an effect of the
2016 tax reform. This deficit projection is based on
the expectation that no further costs for the support
of the financial sector will arise, combined with an
expected increase in taxes on production due to the
projected increase in private consumption.

Austria’s structural deficit is estimated at around
⅓% of GDP in 2015, while it is expected to
increase to around 1% of GDP in 2016. The
estimated increase reflects the tax reform's impact
on revenues and the increase in government
expenditure, which occurs in a recovering phase of
the economic cycle.
Austria’s public debt is expected to have peaked at
85.9% of GDP in 2015, following the inclusion
under government accounts of impaired assets
from financial institutions under restructuring. In
June 2015, EUR 6.7 billion were transferred from
KA Neu, the former Kommunalkredit, to the
financial defeasance structure KA Finanz, recorded
as part of government accounts. In October 2015,
the settlement of several legal disputes concerning
the asset management company HETA, implied
for the government the assumption of liabilities
worth EUR 1.2 billion. In 2016 and 2017, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease to 85.1%
and 84.0% respectively.

21. POLAND

Underlying fiscal deficit on the rise in times of strong economic
growth

Economic growth in Poland is expected to remain robust and stable, driven by domestic demand.
Private consumption is expected to benefit from a strong labour market and a fiscal stimulus but price
pressures are set to remain subdued. The government deficit is projected to remain just below 3% of
GDP in 2016 but may exceed it in 2017, unless additional measures are taken.
GDP and jobs on the rise

In the second half of 2015, the Polish economy
continued to follow a path of strong and
remarkably stable growth. For the year as a whole,
real GDP is expected to have increased by 3.5%,
on the back of robust private consumption,
investment, and a small positive contribution from
net exports. The outlook remains favourable as real
GDP is projected to increase by 3.5% in both 2016
and 2017.
Private consumption is set to remain the dominant
growth driver, supported by further improvements
in the labour market as well as by an increase in
government transfers, notably a new child benefit.
Private investment is expected to grow moderately
as a result of an already high degree of capacity
utilisation, strong corporate profits and low interest
rates. On the other hand, a new tax on the assets of
financial institutions is likely to weigh on
investment if banks respond by adjusting their
lending rates. Public investment is set to accelerate
in 2017, as projects co-financed with EU-funds
from the new programming period enter the
implementation phase.
Contained unit labour costs and the projected
gradual improvement in external demand in 2016
and 2017 should support export growth. However,
net exports are forecast to contribute slightly
negatively to overall growth as strong domestic
demand fuels imports.
Employment growth is expected to slow to 0.5%
annually in 2016 and 2017 due to a shrinking
working age population and stagnating labour
force participation. Labour migration, especially
from Ukraine is set to become an increasingly
important element of the Polish labour market.
Most new jobs are expected to come with
permanent contract types leading to a decline in
the share of atypical contracts from the currently
very high level. The unemployment rate is forecast
to decline to 6.5% in 2017, below the historical

106

low observed in 2008, and should contribute to
faster nominal wage growth.

Inflation to remain low

Inflation is projected to turn positive in early 2016,
but price pressures are set to remain subdued as
energy prices are expected remain low for longer
than previously assumed. Consumer prices are
forecast to rise by 0.6% in 2016 and by 1.7% in
2017.
The risks to the macroeconomic forecast are
broadly balanced. On the downside, some of the
economic policy decisions taken or announced
since the last general elections can affect business
confidence. On the upside, public investment may
turn out to be stronger than currently projected.
Government deficit at and close to 3% of GDP
in 2015 and 2016

The general government deficit is projected to turn
out at 3% of GDP in 2015, down from 3.3% in
2014, yet up from 2.8% of GDP expected in the
autumn 2015 forecast. The upward revision
reflects effects working in opposite directions.
Originally planned for 2015, one-off revenues of

Member States, Poland

around 0.5% of GDP from the sale of mobile
internet frequencies were moved to 2016, while
expenditure has been revised slightly downward.
The general government deficit is expected to
decrease somewhat in 2016, to 2.8% of GDP. The
new child benefit (with estimated budgetary cost at
0.9% of GDP) is set to enter into force in the
second quarter of the year. Offsetting measures
include the one-off revenue from the sale of
mobile internet frequencies and new taxes on the
assets of financial institutions and on the retail
sector.
The fiscal outlook for 2017 very much depends on
the final outcome of recent government proposals,
in particular, a higher tax-free threshold for the
personal income tax (PIT) and a lower retirement
age. The on-going legislative process is
surrounded by a significant degree of uncertainty
regarding the key aspects of the proposals, which
makes an assessment of the likely budgetary
impact very difficult at this stage. As a result, and
given that the budget for 2017 will be adopted later
in the year, the two proposals are not incorporated
in the baseline scenario. This notwithstanding, the

no-policy-change forecast for the general
government deficit in 2017 exceeds but remains
close to 3% of GDP. The deterioration of the
headline deficit in comparison to 2016 is mainly
due to the full-year effect of the new child benefit,
a lower VAT tax rate due to enter into force in
2017, and the lack of additional one-off revenues.
Unless additional measures are taken, plans to
increase the tax-free PIT threshold and to lower the
retirement age would further worsen the fiscal
outlook for 2017.
Poland’s structural deficit is projected to have
marginally deteriorated in 2015 to about 2¾% of
GDP. It is set to widen further, to around 3¼% in
2016 and 3½% in 2017, under a no-policy-change
assumption.
The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is set
to increase from around 51% in 2015 to close to
54% in 2017. The debt projections for Poland are
subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty
because of the potential impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the relatively high share of
sovereign debt denominated in foreign currencies.

22. PORTUGAL

Gradual economic recovery amid high fiscal imbalances

Domestic demand is driving Portugal’s gradual economic recovery, but weaker external demand
continues to weigh on the growth outlook. The general government headline deficit is expected to have
reached 4.2% of GDP in 2015 and the structural balance is forecast to steadily deteriorate over the
forecast horizon.
Economic recovery continues at a gradual
pace

Real GDP growth decelerated in the third quarter
of 2015 to 0.0% q-o-q (1.4% y-o-y). The positive
contribution of domestic demand decreased
significantly compared with the previous quarters,
accounting for 1.9 pps. (y-o-y). This was mainly
due to the slowdown in equipment investment to
4.1% (y-o-y) and the decline in private
consumption growth to 2.3% (y-o-y) in 2015-Q3,
which was almost 1 pp. below the value of the
previous quarter. The net contribution of external
demand remained negative (-0.5 pps.) but less so
than in the first half of the year.
Short-term economic indicators suggest that the
recovery probably moderated somewhat towards
the end of 2015. The Commission’s Economic
Sentiment Indicator improved slightly in
December but remained below its peak reached in
the second quarter of the year. Weaker consumer
confidence and a slower pace of employment
creation in the second half of 2015 contributed to
the recent slowdown in private consumption
growth. However, due to its strong performance
over the first half of the year, private consumption
is expected to have grown by 2.6% in 2015. It is
expected to continue growing robustly by around
2% in 2016 and 2017 due to expansionary fiscal
policy measures and an increase in the minimum
wage. Investment is projected to have stabilised by
the end of 2015. Corporate deleveraging pressures
and a weaker external environment are expected to
limit investment growth in the forecast period. As
a result, total investment growth is projected to
decline to 3.0% in 2016 from 4.3% in the previous
year. In 2017, investment growth should gain
momentum again, supported by accelerated
implementation of EU funds. Exports are forecast
to grow broadly in line with foreign demand, but
imports are expected to outbalance exports over
the forecast horizon on the back of firm domestic
demand. As a result, the contribution of net trade
to GDP growth is forecast to remain negative
although less so than in 2015. Overall, GDP is
expected to have expanded by 1.5% in 2015 and is

108

forecast to pick up slightly to 1.6% in 2016 and
1.8% in 2017. Risks to the macroeconomic outlook
are tilted to the downside, primarily due to the high
indebtedness levels of the Portuguese economy. In
addition, policy uncertainty could increase risk
premia and lead consumers to delay spending and
businesses to postpone investments.
Labour market and inflation outlook improve

The demand-driven economic recovery, several
tax-increasing fiscal measures and the weakening
of the euro exerted upward pressure on consumer
price inflation in 2015 which stood at 0.5% for the
whole year. HICP inflation is expected to increase
only moderately over the forecast horizon, by
0.7% in 2016 and 1.1% in 2017, due to low
external price pressures and persistent slack in the
economy.

Long-term unemployment rate

Employment growth is expected to have slowed
somewhat towards the end of 2015 and the labour
force to have shrunk further mainly due to negative
migration flows. As a result, the unemployment
rate is estimated to have declined to 12.6% in
2015. The labour force is projected to decline
further, albeit moderately, over the forecast
horizon, in line with long term population
projections, while employment creation is set to
slow down in 2016 and 2017. The unemployment
rate is projected to gradually fall below 11% in
2017.

Member States, Portugal

Public finances benefitting from the recovery

The general government headline deficit is
expected to have reached 4.2% of GDP in 2015.
The upward revision relative to the autumn 2015
forecast is due to the direct public support in a
bank resolution operation (Banif) worth 1.2% of
GDP. Pending the final recording of public
guarantees granted in this one-off operation, its
impact may increase by a further 0.4% of GDP.
The headline deficit without one-off operations is
estimated at 3.0% of GDP in 2015, as overall
revenue from tax collection has remained in line
with budget projections and unplanned increases in
expenditure have generally been contained. Since
the reduction of the headline deficit is based on
cyclical factors rather than additional structural
measures, the structural balance is estimated to
have deteriorated by about ½ pps. of GDP in 2015.
Taking into account the measures announced in the
Draft Budgetary Plan for 2016, submitted on
22 January 2016, the headline deficit is forecast to
reach 3.4% of GDP in 2016. Due to the

pro-cyclical nature of most fiscal measures, the
structural balance is expected to deteriorate further
by about 1 pp. of GDP in 2016. Assuming no
policy changes, the headline deficit is projected to
remain broadly stable in 2017, while in the
absence of new consolidation measures the
structural balance is expected to further
deteriorate. Risks to the fiscal outlook are tilted to
the downside, linked to the uncertainties
surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, possible
spending slippages and the still missing agreement
on consolidation measures for 2016 and 2017 at
the cut-off date of this forecast.
Having reached 130.2% at the end of 2014, the
gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to have
only slightly fallen to 129.1% by end-2015, due to
the postponement of the Novo Banco sale, the
Banif resolution operation and statistical revisions.
The ratio should fall only slightly to 128.5% in
2016 due to a projected increase in government
cash buffers, but more pronounced in 2017, to
127.2%, due to primary budget surpluses and solid
growth of domestic demand.

Strong growth ahead amid fiscal loosening and financial risks

Driven by wage increases and fiscal relaxation, economic growth is forecast to peak in 2016 before
moderating somewhat in 2017. Inflation is projected to accelerate as of mid-2016, partially driven by
wage increases. Due to tax cuts and expenditure increases the fiscal deficit is set to increase
substantially. New legal initiatives in the financial sector pose risks to the macroeconomic outlook.
Robust growth in 2015

Real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2015
(3.6% y-o-y) was surprisingly strong given the
significant drop in agricultural production. The
expansion was driven mainly by services, with
retail trade surging after the cut in the VAT for
food as of 1 June 2015, and by the ICT sector.
Private consumption is thriving, buoyed by higher
disposable income and the recovery of local
currency lending. Investment has sustained its
upward trend. The economic sentiment indicator
reached a seven-year peak in the third quarter of
2015, pointing to continued momentum. Real GDP
growth in 2015 is thus estimated to turn out at
3.6%, its highest growth rate since 2008.

Domestic demand is set to remain the driver of
growth in 2016 and 2017. The 4 pps. reduction of
the standard VAT rate in January 2016 along with
negative inflation and a 19% increase in the
minimum wage from May 2016 are projected to
boost consumption and push growth up to 4.2% in
2016. As inflation picks up and the fiscal stimulus
fades in 2017, consumption growth is likely to
slow down. GDP growth, however, is expected to
remain above potential at 3.7% in 2017.

After it dropped to a record low in August 2015,
annual inflation in 2015 turned out at -0.4%,
mainly reflecting the June VAT cut for food and
low global energy prices. Brisk domestic demand
growth and the May 2016 minimum wage hike are
likely to exert upward pressure on prices. This is
expected to be partially offset by the 4 pps.
across-the-board VAT cut at the start of 2016 and
subdued oil prices. Annual average inflation is
forecast to reach -0.2% in 2016. As the impact of
the VAT cuts fades out and the output gap closes,
inflation is set to return to positive territory in the
second half of 2016. It is forecast to re-enter the
central bank's target band (2.5% ± 1 pp.) in 2016
and to reach an annual average of 2.5% in 2017.

Stable investor confidence and continued growth

sustain private investment growth over the forecast

The downward trend in unemployment is likely to

The unemployment rate is projected to fall from

employment is projected to grow over the forecast
horizon. The 19% increase in the minimum wage
in 2016 is expected to lead to higher unit labour
costs overall. The wage hike will partially offset
recent gains in productivity, thereby weighing on
competitiveness.

Member States, Romania

Risks tilted mainly to the downside

A major downward risk to the macroeconomic
outlook is the potential implementation of the law
on debt discharge as initially approved by
parliament. The retroactive application of the law
on the current stock of loans could have a negative
impact on credit growth, consumer and investor
confidence, and domestic demand. Upward risks
could come from a better-than-expected absorption
of EU funds and a higher multiplier effect from the
fiscal stimulus in 2016 and 2017.
General government deficit set to increase

Despite robust economic growth, the headline
deficit is set to rise significantly within the forecast
horizon on the back of enacted tax cuts and
expenditure increases.
In 2015, the general government deficit in ESA
terms is expected to have declined to 1.1% of GDP
from 1.4% in 2014, thanks to a robust growth of
tax revenue. Strong economic growth and
enhanced tax compliance more than offset tax cuts,
such as the decrease in the VAT rate for food
products and in the special constructions tax.

In 2016, the headline deficit is expected to increase
to 3.0% of GDP. The standard VAT rate has been
decreased from 24% to 20%, the tax on dividends
has been cut, and new exemptions in Personal
Income Tax (PIT) have been introduced. On the
expenditure side, public wages are set to increase
considerably. In contrast, public investment is
projected to drop in 2016 and 2017 due to a slower
take-up of big projects in the 2014-20
programming period of EU funding.
The headline deficit is projected to deteriorate to
3.8% of GDP in 2017 on a no-policy-change
assumption. An additional cut in the standard VAT
rate from 20% to 19%, the abolition of the extra
excise duty on fuel and of the special construction
tax, and further new PIT exemptions are expected
to have a negative impact on revenue.
The structural deficit is forecast to increase from
1% of GDP in 2015 to 4% in 2017 as a
consequence of the fiscal easing and the closing of
the output gap in 2016-2017. Romania’s
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise from 39.0%
in 2015 to 42.6% in 2017.
The main downward risk to the fiscal outlook in
2017 and beyond stems from an envisaged new
public wage grid.

Domestic demand takes the driver’s seat

After a solid performance in 2015 when growth was driven by net exports and private consumption,
Slovenia's economy is expected to moderate in 2016 before accelerating in 2017. Private consumption is
forecast to overtake net exports as the main growth driver and the general government deficit is
projected to gradually decline thanks to the positive cyclical conditions.
Solid growth in 2015

After growing 3.0% in 2014, Slovenia’s economy
maintained positive momentum in the first three
quarters of 2015, with real GDP rising by 2.6%
(y-o-y). Strong exports and recovering domestic
demand drove the economy in the first half of the
year. The slowdown in the third quarter to 2.1%
(y-o-y) was due to decreasing construction
investment and slower exports growth. For 2015 as
a whole, real GDP growth is expected to turn out
at 2.5%. Exports remained the key growth driver,
but were less strong than in 2014. Rising private
consumption, helped by the tailwinds of lower
energy prices, as well as rising employment and
consumer confidence, has contributed to GDP
growth more substantially than in 2014. In
addition, public infrastructure investment gave a
strong boost in 2015, which was the last year of
the drawdown period of EU funding for 20072013.

expected to increase in both 2016 and 2017 under
a no-policy-change assumption.
The current account surplus is forecast to remain
high, also driven by low import prices.
Deleveraging in the corporate sector is still
expected to continue while new private investment
is expected to be financed domestically. Risks to
the outlook are on the downside. The largest risks
are external, as adverse global developments could
hamper Slovenia’s trade with its main trading
partners. Private investment growth could be
slowed by both the volatile external environment
and remaining uncertainties with reforms.

Domestic demand set to drive future growth

GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 1.8% in
2016 mainly due to lower public investment,
which is forecast to revert to the historical average
after the exceptional 2015. Domestic demand,
particularly private consumption and private
investment look set to become the main growth
drivers in 2016 and 2017 and growth is expected to
pick up in 2017 to 2.3%. Private consumption is
expected to benefit from increasing wages,
employment growth and gradually recovering
housing market. Private investment is forecast to
rise strongly, as indicated by capacity utilisation
levels above their historical averages, rising
demand and better financing conditions.
The contribution of net exports to growth is
forecast to decrease progressively, as domestic
demand fuels imports. Net exports are expected to
deliver about one third of total GDP growth in the
first half of 2016, and by the middle of 2017
economic growth is expected to be almost fully
driven by domestic demand. Public consumption is

Decreasing but still high unemployment and
record-low inflation

Labour market conditions improved significantly
in 2015, with the unemployment rate expected to
fall to 9.1% and employment to grow by 0.9%.
Both indicators are forecast to continue on a
positive path but at a slower pace as wage pressure
increases. Inflation turned negative in 2015,
mainly caused by falling oil prices. Protracted low
energy and commodity prices are set to result in
prolonged period of low inflation. However, core
inflation should rise reflecting rising nominal unit
labour costs and increased household spending.

Member States, Slovenia

Gradual improvement
balance

in

the

government

In 2015, the general government deficit is
projected to fall to 2.9% of GDP from 5% in 2014,
mainly due to the continued implementation of
consolidation measures and the non-recurrence of
several one-offs that affected the deficit in 2014. In
2016, a large decline in public investment is
anticipated following the ending of the drawdown
period of EU funding for 2007-13. This coupled
with buoyant tax revenues should result in a
further decline of the government deficit to 2.4%
of GDP in 2016.
In the final quarter of 2015, Slovenia experienced
a large influx of migrants, equating to some 18%
of the population, transiting through the country.
The migrant related expenditure in 2015 was
partially met by exceptional payments from EU
funds. The Authorities expect these flows to
continue in 2016 and now estimate that the
expenditure will be some 0.3% of GDP higher than
what was included in the Draft Budgetary Plan.
They expect this to be largely offset by payments
from EU funds and international organisations,
resulting in a net effect of 0.1% of GDP in 2016.

In 2017, under a no-policy-change assumption
Slovenia’s deficit is expected to decline further to
1.9% of GDP mainly due to significantly above
potential economic growth. Overall risks to public
finances over the forecast horizon are tilted to the
downside as uncertainty remains regarding the
expenditure linked to migration, as no net impact
has been included for 2017. Furthermore, the
ongoing work out of non-performing loans poses
risks to the government deficit through the
activities of the Bank Asset Management
Company (BAMC) and the possibility of an
adverse impact from the resolution in the first
quarter of 2016 of two financial institutions
currently in wind down.
In structural terms, Slovenia’s fiscal position is
expected to show a marginal improvement in 2015
and 2016 before worsening in 2017. The
debt-to-GDP ratio continued to increase in 2015
and is projected at 83.5%. This increase was driven
by the continued accumulation of cash buffers due
to favourable market conditions. Debt is expected
to fall to 79.8% and 79.5% of GDP in 2016 and
2017 respectively, helped by the economic
recovery.

Booming investment and robust consumption drive the recovery

Economic growth strengthened in 2015 on the back of buoyant investment and robust household
consumption. Employment gains were strong throughout 2015 and labour market conditions are
expected to continue improving, in line with the ongoing economic expansion. Inflation is forecast to
turn positive in 2016 and the pace of fiscal consolidation is expected to pick up.
Robust economic growth continues

Real GDP growth is expected to have strengthened
to 3.5% in 2015 due to a substantial rise in
domestic demand. Investment benefited from
intensified drawing of EU funds, as the possibility
to make use of funding available under the
2007-2013 programming period came to an end.
Household consumption was supported by positive
labour market developments, sound wage growth,
continued low inflation and favourable credit
conditions. Net exports, however, are expected to
have contributed negatively to growth, as imports
were boosted by elevated investment activity and
their growth outpaced the growth of exports.
Slovakia’s recovery is forecast to continue, with
real GDP growth of more than 3% in both 2016
and 2017. As a result, the output gap is estimated
to continue closing over the forecast horizon.

pps.

Accelerating household expenditure looks set to
become the strongest driver of growth in 2016 and
thereafter. Private consumption is expected to
expand by 3.4% in 2016, buttressed by steady
gains in employment, solid real wage growth and
low credit costs. The continued fall in energy
prices also strengthens household budgets, with the
windfall gains expected to feed through to
consumption. Household spending is forecast to
ease marginally in 2017, as increasing prices bite
into real disposable income.

Domestic demand strengthens

Investment is expected to have expanded by more
than 10% in 2015, with public investment
receiving a substantial boost from EU funding and
private investment benefitting from declining
interest rates and improving credit conditions.
Public investment is forecast to recede in 2016, as
the drawing of EU funds returns to more normal
levels. The expected decline in public investment
expenditure should be partly offset by stronger

114

private investment activity. With a major
investment by Jaguar Land Rover scheduled to
take off in 2016, foreign direct investment will
once again be the main driver of overall
investment growth. At the same time, the recent
Volkswagen emissions regulatory problem
suggests the risk of a possible reassessment of the
company’s investment plans, which could
potentially affect its investment activity in
Slovakia, where it is has large operations.

Imports were fuelled by buoyant public investment
activity in 2015 and outpaced exports, implying
a negative contribution of net exports to real GDP
growth in 2015. Export growth is forecast to ease
in 2016, mirroring the expected slowdown in
import dynamics of Slovakia's main trading
partners, and to pick up thereafter. The trade
balance is forecast to be broadly neutral in 2016
and 2017.
Unemployment continues to decline

The unemployment rate fell to 11.5% in 2015 and
is expected to further decline to around 9.3% in
2017 on the back of robust economic expansion.
The activity rate increased substantially in 2015,
but long-term unemployment remained elevated.
Nominal wage growth picked up in 2015 and is
expected to rise to 3% in 2016, providing
a substantial boost to household purchasing power
in a low-inflation environment.

Member States, Slovakia

Inflation is expected to pick up only in 2017

Deflationary pressures observed in 2015 are
expected to slowly dissipate, mirroring the pickup
in consumer spending. Consumer prices declined
by 0.3% in 2015 because of the sharp fall in
energy prices but core inflation remained positive
at 0.3%. Headline inflation is set to turn positive
but remain close to zero in 2016, with the ongoing
decline in energy prices being offset by a recovery
in the prices of services. In 2017, inflation should
substantially increase relative to the low base of
the previous year.
Swifter consolidation ahead

In 2015, the general government deficit is
estimated to have declined only marginally to
2.7% of GDP. This is despite strong tax revenues
which reflect the continuing impact of measures to
fight tax avoidance. Higher-than-budgeted
spending on healthcare and additional corrections
related to the financing of EU funds prevented a
more pronounced improvement in the headline
government deficit.
The deficit is projected to decline more swiftly in
2016, when it could come down to 2.1% of GDP.
Revenues are expected to be supported by robust

tax revenue growth, despite the introduction of a
reduced 10% VAT rate on basic foodstuffs. On the
expenditure side, healthcare spending is projected
to grow at a slower pace compared to previous
years due to the implementation of a programme
aimed at savings on pharmaceuticals. Government
investment financed by national sources is
projected to decline and some big-ticket
expenditure is not expected to reoccur in 2016.
Several socially-oriented measures, such as a
reimbursement to households due to lower gas
prices, subsidies for home insulation and school
trips will hold back an even stronger consolidation.
The main risk stems from preparation costs for a
planned public-private investment in the Bratislava
ring road. The strength of the economy should help
drive the deficit down in to 1.7% of GDP in 2017,
assuming no changes in policy. However, a risk to
the forecast in that year stems from the measures
of the 'third social package' which have not yet
been factored into the forecast due to incomplete
information as to timing and specification.
The structural deficit should remain unchanged in
2015, decreasing progressively in the following
years. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to
have declined to 52.3% in 2015 and should
continue falling to around 51% in 2017.

26. FINLAND

Economic activity and public finances only gradually improving

Finland is likely to have avoided another year in recession in 2015, but the outlook remains subdued. In
2016-17, domestic demand is expected to be the main driver of economic growth, while exports are
projected to grow slowly. Public finances are gradually improving, with the headline deficit likely to fall
below 3% of GDP this year.
Recovery postponed into 2016

Finland’s economy was in recession between 2012
and 2014 but economic activity rose in the first
half of 2015. However, against expectations,
economic activity declined again in the third
quarter and the decline is expected to have
continued in the last quarter of 2015. Despite the
strong first half of the year, the weakness in the
second half means that real GDP in 2015 is
estimated to have remained unchanged from the
previous year. As economic activity deteriorated
towards the end of 2015, the starting point for
2016 is projected to be weak. Real GDP is forecast
to grow by 0.5% this year on the back of domestic
demand. Private consumption is expected to
increase as inflation remains very low and
investment growth is set to turn to positive. In
2017, real growth is forecast to accelerate to 0.9%.
Exports continue to struggle

The external environment remains difficult for the
Finnish economy, which is particularly exposed to
emerging markets such as Russia and China, where
growth is slowing. In 2015 alone Finnish exports
to Russia fell by one-third, although exports to the
euro area increased. In 2016, Finnish exporters are
expected to benefit from the revival of investment
in
Europe
and
gradually
improving
competitiveness. Nevertheless, exports are
expected to increase in 2016 and 2017 less than
global demand, leading to a further loss of export
market shares.
Real imports fell on the back of decreasing final
demand in 2015, but in 2016 and 2017 real imports
are expected to return to growth. In nominal terms
the value of imports has plummeted in 2015 due to
a sharp fall in oil and other commodity prices.
This, in turn, has improved the terms of trade and
the trade balance significantly. Consequently, the
current account returned into surplus in 2015. The
current account is expected to remain in a slight
surplus in 2016 and 2017.

Low inflation supports domestic demand

Consumer prices fell marginally in 2015,
particularly because of lower prices for fuels and
foodstuffs, while core inflation remained slightly
positive at 0.3%. As the 2016 oil price assumption
has been revised significantly downwards
compared with the autumn forecast, the inflation
projection has also been lowered and consumer
prices are now projected to rise by only 0.1%. In
2017, inflation is expected to accelerate to 1.5%.
The labour market has stabilised towards end 2015
as the temporary loss of employment in the first
half of the year could be recovered in the second
half. The unemployment rate is expected to
gradually fall but to remain above 9% in 2016 and
2017. The number of employees is forecast to
increase by 0.3% in 2016 and 0.5% in 2017 as the
outlook improves.
Thanks to the slight deflation, real wages and
household real disposable incomes increased in
2015 despite the rise in unemployment and low
nominal wage increases. Households also
benefitted from lower mortgage rates and
temporary loan repayment holidays. Consequently,
private consumption is expected to have increased
by 1.3% (y-o-y). This year the impact of these
positive temporary factors should start to fade and

Member States, Finland

consumption growth is projected to decelerate to
0.6% (y-o-y). As wage moderation continues and
inflation increases, real disposable income and
private consumption are expected to grow only
slowly in 2017 despite the projected increase in
employment.
Investment has decreased for four years now.
Housing construction has been subdued and the
recession and spare capacity have held back
equipment investment. R&D investment suffered
from the downsizing of the electronics sector´s
research
activities.
Although
construction
investment was sluggish in the past, the
construction sector now seems to be one of the
bright spots in the economy with increased
production expectations. In addition, some large
investment projects have been launched. Private
investment and more generally domestic demand
are expected to drive economic growth in 2016 and
2017.
Headline deficit likely below 3% of GDP in 2016

In 2016, public sector finances have mainly been
consolidated through expenditure cuts, bringing
the deficit from 3.2% of GDP in 2015 to an
expected 2.8% in 2016. The growth of public
consumption as well as investment will remain

lower than nominal GDP growth in 2016 and
2017. Pension expenditure, on the other hand, is
increasing due to population ageing, with the
pension reform dampening the increase only
gradually from 2017 onwards. On the revenue
side, the unemployment insurance contribution rate
was increased by one percentage point in 2016 to
balance the unemployment insurance funds.
The government introduced some revisions to the
2016 state budget proposal in November 2015.
Expenditures associated with immigration were
increased by about 0.2% of GDP, but overall the
expenditure increase is contained to about 0.1% of
GDP. Some 32 500 (0.6% of population) asylum
seekers arrived in Finland in 2015 (compared with
about 3 500 in 2014) and the number is expected to
remain elevated also in 2016.
As the public balance is improving only
moderately and nominal GDP growth remains
tepid, the debt-to-GDP ratio is set to increase to
65.0% in 2016 and reach 66.2% in 2017.
The structural balance improved slightly in 2015,
but is projected to remain broadly unchanged in
2016 and 2017.

27. SWEDEN

Shifting into a higher gear

Sweden is entering a period of robust economic growth supported by steady private consumption, strong
investment and increasing government consumption. The unemployment rate is expected to fall only
gradually as it will take time for new migrants to find jobs. The general government deficit is forecast to
remain stable as increased spending linked to immigration should be covered by revenues, which are
growing along with the economy and as a result of tax increases.
Broadening growth

Changing composition of investment

Sweden's economy shifted into a higher gear in
2015, forecast to have expanded at a rate of 3.6%,
making it one of the fastest growing economies in
the EU. Strong investment growth, rebounding
exports and increasing government consumption
provided a significant impetus to growth in 2015.
While this momentum looks likely to continue,
dissipating base effects are expected to lead to a
gradual slowdown of growth to 3.2% in 2016 and
2.9% in 2017. Although Sweden's GDP is
projected to grow above its long term average over
the forecast period due to the dynamically rising
population, per capita GDP growth remains below
its long-term average.

Investment kept expanding at a rate of more than
7% in 2015, driven by a strong rise in housing
construction. Equipment investment also started to
gain momentum in 2015 in light of increasing
capacity utilisation and a need for replacement
investments. Overall, Sweden's investment level is
higher than the EU average and above its pre-crisis
levels. Investment growth, however, is forecast to
decelerate to 4.2% in 2016 and 3.7% in 2017 as the
growth in equipment investment is unlikely to be
enough to compensate for the projected slowdown
in construction.

Graph II.27.1: Sweden - Output gap and contributions to
real GDP growth
pps.
% of pot. GDP

Driven by services, Sweden's exports in 2015 grew
at a faster rate than demand for imports among its
main trading partners, suggesting rising market
shares. As Swedish import growth slowed down at
the same time, net trade provided an additional
impetus to growth of 0.4% of GDP in 2015. Net
exports are expected to continue contributing
positively to real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017,
albeit to a lesser extent, while the current account
surplus is expected to remain stable during this
period. In line with rebounding exports, industrial
production also started to recover in 2015 and is
projected to continue expanding over the forecast
horizon.

Net trade helps sustain high GDP growth

Buoyant labour market
Surge in government consumption

Steadily growing real disposable income and rising
employment are expected to sustain solid
household consumption growth, which has been
the main engine of economic growth in recent
years. Over 160,000 people sought asylum in
Sweden in 2015 (equivalent to almost 1.7% of the
total population) and this figure is projected to
remain at high levels over the forecast horizon. As
a result, government consumption is forecast to
grow by 3.6% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017.

118

Employment is forecast to continue expanding at a
rather strong pace over the forecast period,
reflecting the strength of the economic recovery.
The effect of the solid employment growth on
unemployment is foreseen to be partly offset by an
increase in the labour force, linked to the surge in
migration. While migrants enter the labour force
relatively quickly, employment is likely to be
affected with a lag, as it could take several years
for newly arrived migrants to find jobs. Overall,
the unemployment rate is projected to fall from
7.4% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2017.

Member States, Sweden

Gradual rise in inflation

Despite loose monetary conditions and robust
domestic growth, HICP inflation has remained low
and is projected to only gradually pick up from
0.7% in 2015 to 1.1% in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017.
As in 2015, inflation is expected to be temporarily
boosted by tax hikes this year, while declining oil
prices exert downward pressure. An appreciating
krona could reverse the current rising inflation
trajectory. Therefore, Sweden's central bank has
announced its intention to directly intervene on the
foreign exchange market if necessary.
Risks remain balanced

Downside risks to the forecast are related to
weaker growth in Sweden's main trading partners,
which could negatively impact exports and
investments. The continued rise in house prices
could make the economy vulnerable to shocks,
possibly affecting household consumption and
housing investment. Upside risks are related to
private consumption growth in view of rising
disposable income and employment. Despite the
surge in housing investment, the number of new
dwellings built still falls short of housing demand.
Housing investment could thus be stronger than

expected. The arrival of a large number of asylum
seekers and the related integration policies could
lead to higher government consumption and public
investment in the short term, while their successful
integration into the labour market could provide
additional impetus for economic growth in the
medium to long term.
Stable public finances

Sweden's general government deficit in 2015
declined by 0.7% of GDP to 1.0% of GDP. This
was mainly due to a strong increase in tax
revenues, supported by buoyant private
consumption and tax increases. For 2016 and
2017, the deficit is expected to remain broadly
stable at 1.1% and 1.2% of GDP, respectively. For
these years, continued strong revenue increases are
expected to be matched by expenditure growth,
which are mainly related to migration and
integration. As Sweden’s output gap gradually
closes, the structural deficit is projected to increase
from about ¾% in 2015 to just above 1% in 2017.
The main negative risks for the budget are related
to migration, integration and sickness leave
expenditure. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
decrease over the forecast horizon, from 44.0% in
2015 to 42.3% in 2017.

28. THE UNITED KINGDOM

Growth eases but remains solid

Growth has moderated in 2015 as buoyant growth in business investment and private consumption was
partially offset by negative net exports. Growth is projected to ease further in 2016 and 2017 as the
output gap closes and turns positive. Inflation is currently negligible, reflecting the impact of declining
energy prices, but is forecast to rise in 2016 and 2017. Employment is projected to continue to rise, and
the unemployment rate to remain low, while productivity should pick up.
Solid, but unbalanced, growth in 2015

Despite softening from 2.9% in 2014, real GDP
growth is expected to have been solid in 2015 at
2.3%. It has been fuelled by domestic demand
which is expected to have contributed 2.9 pps. to
growth. Growth has been driven by vigorous
private consumption, which is expected to have
increased by 2.8% in 2015, and investment, which
is expected to have risen by 4.6%.
Nevertheless, growth remains unbalanced. The
services sector grew relatively rapidly, while
manufacturing output declined. Net exports are
expected to have detracted from growth for the
fourth consecutive year, as muted conditions in
some export markets depressed demand and
imports remained in line with domestic demand.

Growth to ease in 2016 and 2017

The output gap is expected to have closed in 2015
and to become positive in 2016 and 2017. Growth
is projected to decrease slightly to 2.1% in each of
2016 and 2017.
Private consumption growth is forecast to continue
to exceed GDP growth in 2016, by 0.5 pps.,
although the gap is projected to narrow thereafter.
Household disposable income should remain

120

Business investment is projected to grow on
average at 4.9% in 2016 and 2017, consistent with
that in 2015, as tailwinds remain supportive of
healthy growth. Investment is underpinned by
continued strength in corporate balance sheets,
buoyant corporate profitability, improved access to
credit, low borrowing costs and strong domestic
demand. However, businesses might choose to
delay planned investment, perhaps reflecting an
uncertain external environment, which is a
downside risk to the forecast.

forecast

buoyant, fuelled by a continued, albeit slower, rise
in employment, low inflation and a rise in
employee compensation. Although remaining
healthy, growth in consumption and household
income are set to soften in 2017 as employment
growth slows and inflation rises towards the Bank
of England's target of 2%. A downside risk is that
households decide to rebuild savings at a faster
rate than forecast.

Net exports are projected to detract from growth in
each year of the forecast period; as a result, the
unbalanced nature of growth is expected to
continue. Exports have been sluggish in recent
years and relative weakness in exports is projected
to continue, reflecting conditions in some major
trading partners. Imports are projected to rise, at a
higher rate than that in exports, because of the
strength in domestic demand.
Labour market remains robust

Employment growth is forecast to slightly exceed
that in the labour force to increase at 1.1% and
0.9% in 2016 and 2017 respectively. As a result,
the unemployment rate should fall slightly over the
forecast horizon. Nominal unit labour costs are
forecast to rise over the forecast period but real
unit labour costs are projected to stay muted as
productivity and real wage growth remain aligned.
A downside risk to the forecast is that productivity
does not pick up as projected.

remained unchanged in 2015. The appreciation of
sterling, further falls in energy prices, moderate
growth in wages and a compression of margins in
the supermarket sector have contributed to this
very low rate of inflation. For 2016, inflation is
expected to remain subdued at 0.8%, largely
reflecting weaker-than-expected energy prices, but
is projected to pick-up to 1.6% in 2017. Energy
prices may fall even further, thus prolonging very
low inflation rates.
Budget deficit continues to decline

In its Autumn Statement, delivered in November
2015, the UK Government reiterated its planned
fiscal consolidation path. It reduced slightly the
size of spending cuts compared to the July 2015
budget. However, the outlook for the deficit is
broadly unchanged due to rises in projected tax
receipts and lower debt interest. The document was
accompanied by the Spending Review, which
detailed around GBP 12 billion of measures to be
taken between 2016-17 and 2019-20.

spending of GBP 3.4 billion (0.2% of GDP) in
2016-17. At the same time, cuts of the same order
of magnitude have been planned between 2017-18
and 2020-21. The main revenue measure was an
apprenticeship levy on employers with pay bills
over GBP 3 million, which is expected to yield
0.15% of GDP in additional revenue in 2017-18.
The headline deficit is expected to fall from 5.0%
of GDP in 2014-2015 to 4.1% in 2015-2016 and
2.6% in 2016-17. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to peak in 2015-2016 at 87.6% and then to
slowly decline to 86.1% in 2017-2018. The
government aims to achieve a budget surplus by
2019-20. The structural balance is improving from
around -4% in 2015-2016 to close to -2% in 20172018. The main risk is that the rise in tax receipts
are weaker than forecast in case GDP growth
moderates by more than is projected.

29. THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Growth remains robust driven by domestic demand

The economy posted solid gains in the first nine months of 2015 driven by household consumption, a
surge in government spending and net exports. Private investment remained restrained, as uncertainties
about the external environment and the domestic political situation prevailed also in the later part of the
year. The outlook remains optimistic, with investment likely to pick up again once a new government is
installed. The government confirms its commitment to fiscal consolidation in the medium term, but fails
to curb current spending.
Private consumption to remain key growth
driver

The economy continued to post solid gains also in
2015-Q3. GDP growth accelerated to 3.5%
y-o-y, according to preliminary data. Given
upward revisions to earlier estimates, the economy
expanded by an average of 3.4% y-o-y in the first
nine months, with household spending as the key
growth driver, supported by net exports and a
surge in public consumption.
In 2016 and 2017, growth is projected to remain
solid, with a slight acceleration towards the end of
the horizon. Domestic demand would remain the
key driver. Household spending is expected to
benefit further from positive wage trends, a benign
price environment, ongoing job creation, and
further increases in transfers and pensions. Net real
wages have been rising for 18 months in a row, on
account of both, gains in nominal wages and
deflation. Social transfers and pensions were raised
further after the adoption of a supplementary
budget in August, and the government foresees
further increases in 2016. Investment remained
restrained also in the third quarter, with the
domestic political crisis taking its toll on
confidence. It is expected to return to moderate
growth rates once the political climate stabilises.
Contributions from net exports are diminishing

Export growth slowed down in the third quarter,
compared to the first half of the year, reflecting an
increasingly difficult external environment, and, in
particular, unfavourable conditions in global metal
markets, one of the country’s most important
exports. Import growth, which was roughly flat
during the first half of the year, picked up
marginally in the third quarter, and accelerated
further
thereafter,
possibly
pointing
to
strengthening export demand - the import content
of production by foreign companies, accounting
for about two thirds of the economy’s exports,
remains high, as most of the required machinery

124

and raw materials comes from abroad. In 2016, net
exports are projected to contribute positively to the
economy’s growth, yet making a negative
contribution later on, in view of an expected
renewed push in import demand. With a number of
newly established foreign plants starting
production this year and next, exports would post
solid increases, while the related demand for inputs
would still largely be served from abroad rather
than domestically. Compared to previous
expectations, the merchandise trade balance is
projected to improve significantly, driving the
current account into slight surplus.

Employment growth to remain robust

Labour market conditions are expected to have
improved somewhat further in 2015, yet masking
continued serious challenges in some target
groups, such as young workers and women. The
export industries accounted for the majority of new
jobs created in the first three quarters of 2015.
Employment growth is likely to continue at solid
rates, averaging 2.2% over the forecast horizon,
mainly on account of job creation in new foreign
production plants, but also in some domestic
manufacturing industries. This is expected to
translate into further reductions in the overall
unemployment rate.

Candidate Countries, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

Price pressures to remain moderate

Fiscal consolidation remains a challenge

Consumer prices decreased again towards the end
of the year, after a temporary rise over the
summer. Annual deflation in 2015 amounted to
0.3% mainly on account of a decline in energyintensive transport services, and a decline in food
prices (41% of the index) starting in October. The
price environment is expected to stay benign,
given only moderate expected increases in external
pressures and absence of domestic ones.

The supplementary budget for 2015 increased the
general government deficit target from 3.4% to
3.6% of GDP, on the back of lower annual growth
expectations (3.5% instead of 4%). Revenues in
the first half of the year outperformed - profit tax
collection more than doubled as exemptions for
reinvested profits had been removed. In response,
the government increased spending, in particular
for social transfers and public wages, rather than
using these extra revenues to rebuild fiscal space.
It projects the deficit to decline to below 3% by
2017, but the required spending cuts remain little
concrete. The country’s fourth Eurobond (EUR
270 million) was issued in November, in part to
finance the fiscal deficit in the first half of 2016.
However, given that proceeds from this issue went
to repayment of the 2005 EUR 150 million
Eurobond, the government may need to resort to
additional financing sources. It is expected that the
official deficit targets for 2016 and 2017 will be
exceeded, albeit not as severely as in the past.
Hence, the stabilisation of government debt is
unlikely over the horizon, and overall public debt,
which includes government-guaranteed debt of
state-owned enterprises is projected to increase
further.

Investment-driven growth

Surging public and private investments are set to drive economic growth in the next years. Private
consumption is likely to benefit from the gradual improvement in the labour market. Meanwhile, public
finances will remain strained by long-term commitments to finance a highway to Serbia and higher
spending on wages, pensions and some social transfers.
Growth was stronger than expected

Strong growth in fixed capital investment and
exports of services continued to support the
economy in the third quarter of 2015, boosting
GDP growth by 4.2% (y-o-y), up from 3.7%
growth in the previous quarter. Yet, private
consumption still remained subdued, presenting a
negative contribution to economic growth due to
stagnating wages and pensions in a low inflation
context. By contrast, the contribution from
government consumption and net exports turned
positive in the third quarter, the latter driven by
strong growth of services trade as a result of an
excellent tourism season, and offsetting the also
robust expansion of imports. Overall, considering
past years' trends for the last quarter, GDP is
expected to have increased by 3.9% in 2015.

seasonal pattern in line with retail traders' stocks
and
tourism-related
consumption,
while
manufacturing stocks remain flat as the metal
industry goes through restructuring. Yet, some
recovery of private consumption may result from
the government's plans to increase public sector
wages, pensions, and some social benefits as
foreseen in the 2016 budget. This will have an
impact on the broader economy as the government
is the major employer in the country, as well as by
the example it sets for collective bargaining in the
private sector.
The price factor

Falling global oil prices continue to weigh on
Montenegrin inflation. Yet, the impact on growth
from rising wages and pensions in 2016 could be
dampened in case of higher inflationary pressures
later on. This forecast considers two specific
inflationary risks, affecting commodity prices: one
related to the price of oil, projected to remain at
low levels unless geopolitical risks in producing
countries materialise, and the second one is related
to food prices, in case unfavourable meteorological
conditions affect future harvests.

Investment and tourism will continue to drive
growth

Growth dynamics are expected to continue
performing in a broadly similar way in 2016 and
2017. Thus, the substantial list of shovel-ready
projects will sustain the strong performance of
capital investments. Government fiscal space (and
hence, its consumption) will remain constrained
during the construction of the highway. Changes in
inventories are envisaged to continue its strong

126

The excellent results of the 2015 tourism season
were the main factor for the narrowing of the
external deficit. In the four quarters to September
2015, the current account deficit dropped to 12.6%
of GDP, down from 15.8% a year before, in spite
of further and simultaneous deepening of the
merchandise trade deficit. As a result, the forecast
revises upwards the positive contribution from
service exports, expecting that significant
investments on hotel capacities would sustain
tourism-related income also in 2016 and 2017.
Another technical factor recalibrated in this
forecast is the lower than expected import
elasticity of investments, allocating now more
weight to construction equipment rather than to
building materials.

Candidate Countries, Montenegro

Net financing needs remain substantial in 2016,
but would decline in the following years. In 2016,
the country will need to borrow EUR 688 million
(or some 18% of GDP). Out of this amount, the
main risk appears concentrated on the EUR 390
million to be rolled over in the capital markets in
early 2016. Another EUR 205 million to finance
the motorway in 2016 is secured by a USD
denominated loan. In 2017 (in contrast with 2016
and 2015) there will be no need to refinance
maturing Eurobonds, although a similar amount
from the highway's loan should be withdrawn each
year. Overall, Montenegro's public debt is set to
further increase in 2016 and 2017 driven by further
borrowing to finance capital spending.

Stronger labour supply dampens reduction in
unemployment

The unemployment rate continued to decline in
2015, although at a slower pace than foreseen due
to the simultaneous increase of the labour force.
For 2016, the forecast expects that employment
growth would continue at a similar pace as in
2015, to further accelerate in 2017 due to new
investments, namely in new power generation
plants.
Public spending to boost growth

The 2016 general government budget targets a
deficit of 6.1% of GDP. The large deficit reflects
the EUR 255 million (or 6.8% of GDP) spending
to continue the construction of the priority section
of a highway to Serbia. In addition, to stimulate
the economy the government reduced as of 2016
the higher tax rate on personal income (paid by the
employer) from 13% to 12%, and increased public
sector wages, pensions and transfers. However, in
the absence of new fiscal measures and structural
reforms to counter these expenditure increases, this
forecast reviews slightly upwards the deficit for
2016 and 2017.

According to Montenegro's fiscal rules, once the
public debt reaches the limit of 60% of GDP
- which is expected to happen soon - the
government should present a plan to bring the debt
below this threshold in the next five years. Yet, the
new debt management plan could be challenged by
cost overruns during the construction of the
highway or by loosening fiscal discipline, in
particular during the electoral year of 2016.

Economic growth accelerating amidst multiple challenges

GDP growth is forecast to gradually accelerate on the back of stronger domestic demand. Investment
growth, in particular, is expected to be robust throughout the forecast horizon, boosted by confidence
effects, rising foreign direct investments, and higher public capital expenditure. However, the forecast
faces a number of exogenous risks and preserving policy predictability and a strong commitment to
implement planned structural reforms remain important factors for an improved growth outlook.
Investment growth accelerated

Low international primary commodities prices
have continued to support the ongoing recovery.
GDP growth has picked-up in the third quarter of
2015 to 2.2% y-o-y, driven mainly by exports and
investments. Recent reforms improving the
business environment, coupled with base effects
and rising FDIs, have underpinned double-digit
investment growth in the same quarter. Higher
government expenditure on goods and services has
nudged public consumption growth slightly above
zero, signalling a weakening of the otherwise very
strong fiscal consolidation effort. Households’
consumption growth remained negative, although
less so than previously expected due to higher
disposable income as a result of remittances
inflows and lower commodity prices.

preserving policy predictability and a strong
commitment to implement planned structural
reforms continue to be important factors for an
improved growth outlook. Apart from that, the
forecast is also facing a number of exogenous
risks, stemming from a slowdown in some
emerging markets, the effects of tighter US
monetary policy, and geopolitical tensions.

High-frequency indicators point at a continuation
of good economic performance in the last quarter
of 2015. Industrial production growth has
remained robust in October and November, still
largely driven by energy and mining. In addition,
manufacturing production increased in most of the
sectors and retail trade turnover grew at a steady
pace.
Consumption

to

support

Private consumption is expected to turn to a
marginal growth already this year. In addition to
higher budgetary transfers, it should be supported
by a pick-up in private sector employment and
small wage gains, in particular in the private
sector. The decline of public consumption,
characterising the previous three years, is foreseen
to wind down as fiscal consolidation efforts are
being reduced. Thus, GDP growth is forecast to
gradually accelerate on the back of stronger
domestic demand. Investment growth, in
particular, is expected to remain robust throughout
the forecast horizon, boosted by confidence
effects, rising foreign direct investments, and
higher public capital expenditure. However,

The good export performance, which has been
crucial in reducing external imbalances in the last
few years, is forecast to continue. It is envisaged to
be supported by an ongoing recovery in most of
Serbia’s major trading partners and productivity
gains due to domestic reforms and new investment.
At the same time, the rebound of domestic demand
is expected to underpin a steady increase in
imports, keeping the net exports contribution to
growth close to zero or slightly negative. As a
result, further reductions of external trade
imbalances are foreseen to be marginal and the
current account deficit to remain broadly
unchanged.
Price pressures to remain low

Inflation has been persistently below the central
bank target tolerance band for almost two years.
The expected increase in domestic demand and
adjustments in administered prices are forecast to

Candidate Countries, Serbia

pull inflation marginally up into the target band.
However, low international commodity prices,
exchange rate stability, and stable inflationary
expectations should anchor inflation dynamics.
Recent price stability and strong fiscal
consolidation have facilitated monetary policy
easing. Lower borrowing costs, along with policy
measures to address the very high ratio of
non-performing loans are envisaged to eventually
spur a revival of lending activity and further
support economic growth.
Labour market indicators have been influenced by
recent methodological changes. In the next few
years, employment gains are projected to be
limited as more dynamic job creation in the private
sector is largely offset by losses in the public
sector. Still, these gains would be sufficient to
continue driving unemployment down, although
the unemployment rate would remain very high.
Fiscal consolidation – impressive but unfinished

over-performance on the revenue side. It created
space for a limited increase of pensions, one-off
payments to some categories of employees, and
targeted increases of public sector wages.
Significant one-off revenue and expenditure have
influenced budgetary outcomes and have the
potential to do so again in 2016.
Following a significant consolidation in 2015,
medium-term fiscal prospects are much less
impressive. The budget deficit is forecast to remain
broadly unchanged in 2016, before declining
slightly in 2017. However, these levels of deficit
would imply further increases in government debt,
approaching 80% of GDP. Thus, a more ambitious
fiscal consolidation strategy would be required to
stabilise and eventually reduce the public debt
ratio to more sustainable levels. In addition, the
fiscal scenario is subject to uncertainty, stemming
from the actual implementation of some of the
planned structural adjustment measures, in
particular those related to the downsizing of public
sector employment.

The budget deficit in 2015 is expected to have
been better than anticipated, mainly as a result of

32. TURKEY

Moderate growth supported by lower oil price

Moderate output growth is set to continue based on the low oil price, an accommodative monetary
policy, and hikes in government-controlled wages. Net exports will subtract from growth, partly due to
Russian sanctions and the unstable security situation domestically and in the near abroad. Inflation is
set to approach double digits in the context of pass-through from last year's depreciation and domestic
inflationary pressures. The current account benefits from the low oil price while the public debt ratio
continues to decline.
Domestic demand has strengthened

The Turkish economy continued to expand at a
moderate rate in the first three quarters of 2015
with real GDP up by 3.4% on a year-on-year basis.
There was a pronounced shift towards
domestic-demand driven growth with consumer
spending increasing by 4.5%, supported by the
lower oil price and easy financial conditions.
Private investment mustered 4.3% growth after
having been close to stagnation for two years. In
contrast to 2014, net exports exerted a drag on
growth as exports contracted while imports
expanded. For the fourth quarter of 2015, the data
suggest that final demand continued expanding at a
moderate pace. Inventory adjustment, however, is
expected to have dampened GDP growth following
a positive contribution in the third quarter.
Exports are underperforming

The forecast projects that the external sector will
continue to subtract from output growth in 2016
and 2017 in spite of the lira’s real effective
depreciation in 2015. Import growth is projected to
outpace export growth, but both remaining at
relatively low rates. In the short term, exports are
expected to be held back by (1) Russian sanctions
following the downing of a Russian bomber
aircraft by the Turkish air force last November, (2)
a disproportionally high impact from the oil price
decline on export demand, (3) the conflicts in
Syria and Iraq, and (4) an unstable domestic
security situation reducing foreign tourism. On the
positive side, the repeal of international sanctions
on Iran is expected to provide some lift to Turkish
export growth.
On the domestic demand side, consumer spending
is projected to increase at an average annual rate of
3.6 % over the next two years, i.e. roughly the
same as the average for the past three years. It will
be supported by the purchasing power provided by
the lower oil price and by the government's 30%
increase of the minimum wage as of January 2016.

130

Some restraint on consumer spending will come
from indirect taxes hikes and the unstable security
situation. Business investment is projected to
continue growing at a moderate rate, supported by
a pent-up need for replacement investment. While
household borrowing appears to have been curbed
by macro-prudential measures, non-financial
corporations increasingly seem to take advantage
of the easy financial conditions.

Returning to potential growth

Annual output growth is estimated to have reached
3.1% in 2015 despite negative growth
contributions from net exports and inventory
adjustment. Although net exports are forecast to
continue suppressing activity in 2016, rising
inventories are projected to push annual growth up
to 3.4%. For 2017, the forecast expects waning
headwinds for export growth to support a further
rise in GDP growth to 3.6% which is close to the
current medium-term potential growth rate.
This growth forecast is associated with significant
risks. On the upside, accelerating wages and
stronger household borrowing may provide a
sharper-than-projected
boost
to
consumer
spending. On the downside, there is a risk that the
security situation might worsen, domestically and

Candidate Countries, Turkey

in the near abroad. But the largest risk may be that
a sustained reversal of capital inflows requires a
sharp policy adjustment and results in domestic
demand suppression. Capital outflows have
already increased recently, partly because global
investor sentiment has shifted away from emerging
economies, not least from those with large current
account deficits like Turkey.
Inflation is ticking up

Headline inflation rose by 0.6 pps. to 8.8% in the
course of 2015 as the Turkish lira depreciated
significantly
against
major
international
currencies. The exchange-rate pass-through,
together with strongly rising food prices, has more
than offset the disinflationary effect from the lower
oil price. In spite of overshooting the official 5%
inflation target by a wide margin, the central bank
has kept its main policy rate unchanged at 7.5%
since February 2015. The forecast projects
consumer price inflation to increase further in the
near term and to remain in high-single digits
throughout the forecasting period on the basis of
the current monetary policy stance, the recent
hikes in government-controlled wages, and
ingrained inflation expectations.

Rising unemployment, but a lower current
account deficit

Employment growth is expected to continue
running somewhat below output growth. The
unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually to
10.8% in 2017 assuming that the labour force
(aged 15-64 years) will increase by its trend
growth rate in recent years.
Turkey’s long-standing current account deficit has
narrowed for the second consecutive year in 2015,
falling to an estimated 4.8% of GDP. Due to large
energy imports, the current account has benefitted
strongly from the oil price decline. This effect
should narrow the deficit further in 2016, but not
in 2017 when a renewed widening is projected.
Public finances remain relatively stable

Based on the budget realisation for the central
government, the general government deficit is
estimated to have narrowed slightly to 1.4% of
GDP in 2015. Accelerating expenditures are
expected to increase the deficit somewhat in 2016
followed by a renewed narrowing in 2017. General
government debt as a share of GDP is projected to
continue its downward trend towards 30%.

Growth pick-up supports debt reduction plans

Economic growth is on an upward trajectory because of surging investment and a positive contribution
from net exports. Foreign direct investment, focusing on some major projects, is set to remain an
important source of growth. However, economic sentiment remains volatile and lending to the economy
subdued, while the persistently low oil price triggers adjustment in the extractive sector. Fiscal
consolidation remains high on the policy agenda.
Growth set to improve in 2015

Flash data indicate that GDP growth in the first
three quarters was 2.7% year-on-year, driven by
surging investment and net exports. Private
consumption recorded a contraction in the first half
of the year mainly as a result of precautionary
saving behaviour by households, but it turned to a
1.9% year-on-year growth in the third quarter.
However, business and consumer confidence
remains volatile, pointing to a heightened level of
uncertainty.

economy.

Reflecting still below-potential economic activity,
the annual rate of inflation averaged 1.9% in 2015,
undershooting the Bank of Albania’s (BoA) target
of 3% for the fourth consecutive year. In response
to this, BoA stepped up monetary easing by cutting
its policy rate to a new historic low of 1.75% in
November. However, the pass-through of
monetary stimulus continues to be hampered by
weak lending from banks that have become
risk-averse amid a falling but still very high
(around 20%) share of non-performing loans
(NPLs).
Big projects boost investment

The investment revival, which follows three years
of contraction, is driven by some major projects
financed by foreign direct investment in the energy
sector. One of them, the Albanian section of the
Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, is expected to enter an
intensive phase this year and is likely to boost
gross fixed capital formation even as investments
by petroleum producers are cut back due to
enduringly weak crude oil prices. Bank lending for
business purposes is expected to experience a
gradual recovery as various regulatory and
legislative efforts are implemented to tackle the
NPL problem.
Household spending should benefit from
employment gains and improving financial
conditions, but remittances from Albanians living
abroad have been volatile lately, reflecting in

On the production side, the extractive industry is
adjusting to lower prices for oil and other
commodities by cutting production targets.
Therefore, this industry, which has been an
important contributor to growth over the past five
years, will likely be a drag on economic activity in
2016. A downside risk to the outlook stems from
weather-induced
volatility
in

generation, which satisfies most of Albania's
electricity needs.
Trade weakness with diverse causes

In the first three quarters, both exports and imports
fell in real terms. The oil price fall and the
reorientation of some of the oil production to the
domestic market weighed on goods exports, even
as services exports, boosted by manufacturing
services and tourism spending, performed well.
Imports, on the other hand, were affected by weak
household spending, while the purchase of
investment-related goods soared. In the years to
come, the expected gradual recovery in Albania’s
main export destinations is set to support foreign
sales, especially of traditional products such as
textiles and food. Imports, for their part, are
projected to be boosted by continuing growth in

Candidate Countries, Albania

investment and the expected increase in household
consumption. Overall, net exports are likely to
make a negative contribution to growth in the
coming years, while the current account deficit is
expected to widen.
Ambitious plans for fiscal consolidation

Preliminary budget figures indicate that in 2015
revenues underperformed even relative to the
reduced target set in July. The 5% shortfall was
mainly caused by lower-than-expected revenue
from VAT and excise duties. However, the extent
to which expenditure lagged behind the budgeted
figure was even greater, at 5.7%, driven by
underspending by local governments and on social
security. Capital expenditure also fell short of the
reduced target, pointing to persistent problems
with respect to the management of public
investment. Overall, the budget deficit in 2015 was
10.4% lower than planned and undershot the 4% of
GDP target by some margin.

headline deficit of 2.2% of GDP as well as a
primary surplus of 0.6%. It aims to achieve this by
tightly controlling expenditure and increasing
revenues through economic growth and better
administration, whereas tax adjustments will only
play a minor role. Even if the underlying nominal
GDP growth assumption might be somewhat
optimistic, a more conservative estimation of
individual tax receipts and the government’s
readiness to cut spending if revenues disappoint
overall make meeting the targets attainable. Public
debt, which has risen steadily since 2011 to over
70% of GDP, is thus expected to start decreasing
this year. Medium-term projections assume that a
continuing improvement in the primary balance
and stronger economic growth will further dent the
debt ratio. However, the rising foreign-currency
component of debt is subject to exchange rate
risks, while spending pressures may mount in the
run-up to the parliamentary elections in 2017, just
when Albania’s IMF-supported programme, which
currently acts as a disciplinary anchor, expires.

The budget for 2016 is based on the assumption
that nominal GDP will grow by 6.2% and targets a

Solid growth as headwinds intensify

While headwinds have emerged over recent months, particularly in the external sector, the outlook for
the US economy remains steady and broadly in line with previous expectations, expanding by around
2.5% annually. Recovery in the labour market, which underpinned the recent initiation of monetary
policy normalisation, is expected to be sustained, even as downside risks become increasingly evident.
Following the slowdown recorded in the first
quarter of 2015, the US economy grew at a
quarterly rate of 1.0% in the second quarter and
0.5% in the third. While private consumption and
fixed investment showed resilience throughout the
year, net exports have weighed on growth and, due
to the combined effects of a strong US dollar and
deteriorating external environment, will remain a
drag throughout the forecast horizon. On the
domestic front, the renewed fall in energy prices
over recent months should provide a fillip to
consumption and non-energy-related investment,
even as the energy sector continues to contract. In
addition, the budget deal agreed in December
removes a considerable degree of fiscal policy
uncertainty, while at the same time providing for
government consumption to make a positive
contribution to growth.

are expected to rise gradually in line with
tightening monetary policy, the outlook for
residential investment remains solid, driven by
pent-up demand for housing and rising household
net wealth.
Budget deal provides a boost

December’s agreement to pass a USD 1.1 tn
expenditure bill, combined with a further
USD 600 bn in tax cuts, has ensured that the
government is fully funded for the next two fiscal
years, avoiding a potential government shutdown;
while at the same time providing for modest
increases in discretionary expenditure, meaning
that fiscal policy will no longer be a drag on
growth.

Consumption and

Private consumption growth, benefitting from the
labour market’s recovery and falling energy prices,
was particularly strong in 2015 and remains the
key driving force behind economic recovery.
While both of these factors should remain
supportive over the forecast horizon, particularly
as tighter labour market conditions provide for a
pick-up in wage growth, private consumption is set
to moderate slightly in future years.
The fall in oil prices over recent months has had a
significant impact on the US energy sector,
prompting cutbacks in both employment and
capital expenditures. Investment in non-energyrelated sectors, however, buttressed by solid
domestic demand and an environment of still
accommodative financial conditions, is expected to
perform relatively well throughout the forecast
horizon.
Lower policy uncertainty on the fiscal and
monetary fronts should also help, although there
remains uncertainty regarding the US presidential
election and the future pace of monetary policy
normalisation. Similarly, though mortgage rates

Renewed vigour in the labour market

Following some moderation earlier in the year, the
labour market’s recovery regained momentum
towards the end of 2015. Monthly job growth
accelerated to 284,000 in the final quarter of 2015,
considerably higher than the 200,000 average
recorded over the first three quarters. The
unemployment rate, meanwhile, has continued to
fall back to pre-crisis levels and is currently at
5.0% (down from 5.7% in January 2015), with
wider measures of labour market slack also falling
throughout the year. The stronger labour market

marginally attached workers, resulting in largely

The
unemployment rate is forecast to fall further,
eventually reaching 4.7% in 2017, amid only a
minor cyclical uptick in the participation rate.

crisis monetary policy. With the policy debate now
shifting towards future rate increases, it is expected
that the tightening cycle will proceed at a gradual
pace without significant market disruption.

The final months of 2015 have seen clearer signs
of rising price and wage pressures. While headline
price indices continue to be dragged down by
tumbling energy prices, core CPI rose to 2.1% in
December (its highest since mid-2012), even as the
Fed-preferred PCE continued to stay at 1.3%
throughout the year. Likewise, wage growth
accelerated to 2.4% (y-o-y) on average in the
fourth quarter, up from 2.1% in the first half. The
labour market’s continued tightening should also
prompt a further acceleration of wage and price
growth.

Developments in the external environment proved
challenging throughout 2015 because of the further
strengthening of the US dollar and a sharp
weakening of global import demand, including
among key trading partners of the US. The dollar
appreciated strongly in real terms in 2015 and is
set to remain strong on account of the December
lift-off combined with divergent monetary policy
stances across advanced economies. Net exports
are therefore now expected to act as an even bigger
drag on growth than in the autumn, subtracting as
much as 0.7 pps. and 0.4 pps. from growth in 2015
and 2016, respectively, (0.1 pps. more compared to
the AF) and 0.3 pps. in 2017.

Initiation of monetary tightening

The labour market’s robust performance,
combined with signs of firming price pressures,
underpinned the Federal Reserve’s December
decision to raise interest rates for the first time
since 2006. Overall, the decision further underlines
the progress made in sustaining economic recovery
in the US and marks a new stage in post-financial

External environment and market volatility

Aside from the labour market, economic data over
recent months, particularly in the manufacturing
sector, has been subdued. This loss of momentum,
combined with increased financial market
volatility seen over recent months, highlights that
the growth outlook remains vulnerable, with risks
now firmly tilted towards the downside.

Moderate and volatile growth

The economy is expected to continue on a moderate growth trend underpinned by continued
accommodative monetary policy and recovery in investment, but heightened volatility from planned
fiscal consolidation will weigh on growth towards the end of the forecast horizon.
Real GDP growth is estimated at 0.7% in 2015,
reflecting upward revisions for 2015-Q2 and
2015-Q3. The outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains
broadly unchanged from the Autumn Forecast.
Growth is expected to pick up to 1.1% in 2016,
and to slow down again to 0.5% in 2017 in the
wake of the planned consumption tax hike in
2015-Q2.
Near-term growth rebounds

In 2015-Q3 real GDP rose 0.3% q-o-q (after an
initial estimate of -0.2% q-o-q), whilst the
2015-Q2 contraction was gradually revised up in
successive releases from -0.3% (q-o-q) to -0.1%
(q-o-q), which supports the estimate of 0.7%
growth for the year as a whole. After declining
0.2% (q-o-q) in 2015-Q2, domestic demand
rebounded and firmed up in 2015-Q3, with all
components adding to growth except public
investment. Exports rebounded solidly after having
contracted sharply in 2015-Q2, and export
volumes rose in October for all the major export
destinations, including Asia.
Domestic demand remains volatile

Private consumption appears to have recovered
from the slump in 2015-Q2, but leading indicators
point to a mixed outlook. Consumer confidence
recovered to the highest level in two years, but
retail sales and real consumer spending remain
volatile. The unemployment rate stands close to
historic lows (3.3% in November), whilst the new
job openings-to-applicants ratio hovers at a
25-year high. Labour market conditions are set to
remain tight as labour supply shrinks on a longterm downward trend, whilst job creation
continues on the back of resilient corporate
activity.
However, entrenched labour duality between
regular and non-regular workers and low labour
mobility will continue to hamper sustained real
wage growth, which will also fall in the wake of
the April 2017 consumption tax hike. Private
consumption is therefore likely to remain sluggish,
whilst front-loaded demand ahead of the tax hike

138

and a subsequent fall will entail continued
volatility in consumption expenditure, and weigh
on growth in 2017.
Gross fixed capital formation rose for three
consecutive quarters, but private investment has
remained rather volatile. Private residential
investment appears to be set on a moderate
recovery trend following a sharp post-tax-hike
contraction, but housing starts point to continued
volatility. Residential investment is projected to
continue improving moderately supported by
resilient employment and accommodative financial
conditions.

Private non-residential (business) investment
recovered 0.6% (q-o-q) in 2015-Q3 after
contracting in Q2, and machinery orders, a leading
investment indicator, remain on a long-term
moderate growth trend, suggesting that business
investment is gradually firming up. Looking ahead,
business investment is expected to continue
recovering as investment conditions improve on
the back of stronger profits, loose financing
conditions and improvements in tax and corporate
environment.
However, volatility from planned fiscal
consolidation is likely to extend also to investment
over the forecast horizon, in particular private
residential investment, while still weak potential
growth from incomplete structural reform and

Other non-EU Countries, Japan

adverse population dynamics is expected to weigh
on the long-term investment growth outlook.
External demand recovers moderately

External demand is projected to continue to
recover moderately underpinned by resilient
growth in advanced economies, and continued
external competitiveness from monetary policy
divergence with the US.
Fiscal consolidation makes progress

In 2014 the general government deficit was
reduced to 6.2% of GDP and the primary deficit to
5.6% on the back of robust tax revenue growth
from stronger corporate profits, employment
growth, and the April 2014 increase in the
consumption tax rate. Further progress with fiscal
consolidation is expected with the April 2017
consumption tax hike. At the same time,
expenditure pressures persist as evidenced by a
JPY 3.5 tn (0.7% of GDP) supplementary budget
for FY 2015, whilst lack of additional revenue
measures and reliance on robust nominal growth
projections may hamper achieving the target of a
primary balance by FY 2020.

Monetary policy remains accommodative.

Headline CPI inflation (0.3% y-o-y in November)
is projected to pick up only gradually reflecting
waning base effects from past currency
depreciation and weaker commodity prices, and
subdued wage growth. The Bank of Japan has
recently expanded its easing stance via a set of
supplementary measures, most notably entailing a
further extension in the average remaining
maturity of its Japanese Government Bond
purchases, and is expected to continue its
accommodative stance over the forecast horizon.
Risks

Weaker-than-expected income growth would
weigh on households and affect private
consumption. There is also a risk that the pullback
in consumption in the wake of the 2017 tax hike
might be more abrupt than expected. Weaker-thanexpected economic growth may lead to a slippage
in the consolidation path ahead, with possible
repercussions on financing conditions. The export
sector remains exposed to the risk of weaker-thanexpected growth in emerging economies, in
particular China and ASEAN countries, which in
turn may affect business confidence and
investment.

36. CHINA

Gradual slowdown expected amid sizeable downside risks

Economic growth is expected to slow further as China continues to rebalance away from excessive
investment levels towards higher consumption and service sector growth. Macroeconomic policy is
likely to be used actively to support this transition and stabilise growth in the near term, but
accumulated imbalances pose genuine downside risks given the complexity of adjustment needed and
the high levels of uncertainty.
Real GDP grew by 6.9% in 2015, and is expected
to slow gradually to 6.5% in 2016 and 6.2% in
2017. This constitutes a benign scenario which
assumes that economic rebalancing continues
without a sharp correction or ‘hard landing’. At the
same time, the complexity of China’s current
transition process must not be underestimated and
downside risks are significant. Heavy industry and
real estate, in particular, suffer from a combination
of excess capacity and high debt in an environment
where nominal GDP growth has slowed markedly.
In the short term, risks can probably be mitigated
by China’s capacity to provide additional policy
stimulus. However, while active monetary and
fiscal measures may alleviate short term pressures,
they risk aggravating existing imbalances and
heightening medium term adjustment pressures –
unless they are carefully calibrated to work with
the grain of reform. Recent bouts of volatility in
stock markets, sustained capital outflows and
pressures on the exchange rate reflect growing
concerns and rising uncertainty about the future
trajectory of the Chinese economy and whether the
adjustment process can be managed smoothly.
High-frequency indicators point
growth and continued rebalancing

to

lower

Headline growth was remarkably steady in 2015,
at 7.0% in the first and second quarters of 2015,
before slowing marginally to 6.9% and 6.8% in the
third and fourth quarter. High-frequency indicators
point to slower growth ahead. Industrial value
added continues to decelerate, growing by 6.1% in
2015, its lowest reading in over 25 years.
Manufacturing PMIs have fallen below 50
signalling contraction. Growth in fixed asset
investment has also declined steadily, with a 12%
expansion in 2015, substantially down on previous
growth rates. Real estate investment has fallen
more sharply, hampered by the overhang of unsold
properties following the bursting of a real estate
bubble in 2014. By contrast, growth in retail sales
was above 10% in real terms in 2015, while robust
services imports and elevated service sector PMIs

140

confirm a picture of substantial restructuring in the
composition of demand.
Turmoil in China’s stock market points to
growing uncertainty

Volatility in China’s equity market was a key
feature in 2015, with the inflation of an equity
bubble in H1, which subsequently burst in
July/August. January 2016 saw a renewed bout of
turbulence. The immediate macroeconomic effects
of these moves on the Chinese economy are likely
to be limited as equity markets are still developing
in China and equities make up only a low share of
household assets or corporate financing. Moreover,
the overall market level has changed little between
January 2015 and January 2016. Nevertheless the
increased volatility likely indicates heightened
uncertainty about the domestic economy and the
risks involved in the correction of imbalances.

Trade is expected to recover only gradually

China’s trade in 2015 saw a brusque adjustment.
Goods exports were down by 2.5% in 2015 as a
whole in USD value terms. This reflects subdued
global demand and a significant (15%) rise in the
RMB real exchange rate from mid-2014 to
mid-2015. Exports are expected to recover to only
modest positive growth rates in 2016 given the
tepid outlook for global growth and continued

Other non-EU Countries, China

strength of the RMB on a trade-weighted basis.
Goods imports fell 14% in USD value terms in
2015. This partly reflects low commodity prices,
but also some fall in volumes, adding to concerns
about the strength of domestic demand.
Explanatory factors include the slowdown in real
estate and lower construction material imports, the
restructuring of the economy away from
import-intensive investment, and reduced imports
for reprocessing into exports. In sharp contrast,
services imports grew strongly in 2015, up by
around 20%. This pattern is expected to continue
into 2016 and 2017, with goods imports recovering
only slowly and services imports remaining brisk.
Macroeconomic policies are set to remain
supportive

In the near term, macroeconomic policies are
likely to remain accommodative and geared
towards preventing an abrupt slowdown in growth.
A monetary easing cycle started late in 2014, with
cuts in policy interest rates and reserve ratios and
targeted liquidity injections in specific sectors.
Low and falling inflation rates have limited the fall
in real interest rates, maintaining some downward
pressure on credit growth. However, credit growth
continues to outpace nominal GDP growth adding
to the build-up of already very high debt levels.

Fiscal policy is expected to continue to respond
flexibly to any unanticipated weakness in demand,
including further increases in infrastructure
spending and corporate tax cuts.
But downside risks have increased

Risks for the outlook have increased substantially.
Accumulated imbalances, notably high levels of
corporate debt, raise concerns given the sharp
slowdown in nominal GDP growth rates. Volatility
in financial markets could potentially interact with
weaknesses in the real economy to generate selffeeding cycles, particularly given the high levels of
implicit guarantees in the financial system. The
optimal policy mix therefore requires a delicate
balance between measures to sustain activity and
financial stability in the short run, and to pursue
structural adjustments to unwind China’s
imbalances in the medium term. Moreover, policy
levers that worked well in the past may be losing
some traction. Active monetary and fiscal
measures both risk worsening existing imbalances
unless carefully designed to support structural
reforms rather than impede them. A growing
appreciation of the complexity of the task facing
the Chinese authorities has, in itself, raised doubts
about whether the process can be managed
smoothly.

Domestic adjustments to changes in the external environment

There is a clear adjustment process ongoing in EFTA in response to changes in the external
environment. Switzerland is still affected by the loss in competitiveness and adverse developments in the
niche markets that supported its economy in the past year. Norway performed better than expected in
the third quarter but will continue to be impacted by lower oil and gas prices as the private domestic
sector already anticipates more difficult times while Iceland’s tourism led-boom is still strong, albeit
signs of overheating are appearing.
Switzerland

The recent past has seen remarkable changes in
Swiss foreign economic relations. The floor of the
Swiss franc with the euro was abandoned and the
Swiss government advanced on implementing the
outcome of the initiative against mass
immigration. Both relate to the important drivers
of Swiss economic outperformance: the strong
trade performance, in particular in niche markets
like watch making, and the influx of labour
migrants, which have been relatively highly skilled
in the case of Switzerland.
Notwithstanding the important external dimension,
the change in economic growth momentum also
has its roots in lacklustre private domestic demand.
Private domestic demand growth is expected to
remain subdued and only increase well into the
next year. Household consumption is expected to
develop weakly this year as both employment and
nominal wages are under pressure in the context of
the appreciating Swiss franc and consumers
become more pessimistic about the economic
prospects.
The turn the economy has taken has been
cushioned by public finances. The general
government budget deficit increased from 0.2% of
GDP in 2014 to 0.6% in 2015. The budget deficit
is expected to bottom out this year at 0.8% of
GDP. This should still be within the debt break
rule given that output is foreseen to be well below
the government’s estimate of potential growth.
The appreciated Swiss franc will not only impact
the size and composition of domestic demand, but
also, and more importantly, the export
performance. The competitive position has been
eroded by the appreciation of the Franc and by real
wage growth outpacing productivity growth in past
years. This has increased the vulnerability of Swiss
export performance to global economic
developments. The strong income growth in new
markets and the large internationalization of some

142

Swiss producers have helped the Swiss economy
outperform. However, income growth in these
new, emerging, markets is cooling and impacting
the demand for the niche products. Exports are
expected to show only limited growth as a
consequence of the deteriorated competitive
position, on which a reduction of foreign labour
inflow can be expected to have a negative impact,
and of lower external demand growth. In addition,
the appreciation will also increase domestic
demand for foreign products, raising imports.
Therefore, net trade is expected to contribute little
to economic growth over the forecast horizon
although that is already an improvement compared
to 2015.

The competitive position is not the only risk to the
Swiss economy. Volatility in foreign financial
markets could lead to a strengthening of safe haven
capital inflows and thus to a further exchange rate
appreciation with risks to financial and monetary
stability. Recently, however, the value of the Swiss
franc seems to be less connected to stock market
volatility.
The downward pressure on inflation from the
appreciation of the Franc will diminish as the
Swiss franc seems to have stabilised around a new
equilibrium value. Inflation will return to positive

territory over 2016 and show a slight further
increase in 2017 to 1.0%.
Norway

The government is increasing its spending, the
sovereign wealth fund is expected to see a net
outflow of funds, unemployment is increasing in
particular among the highly qualified, and
consumer confidence continues to fall. The central
bank cut its interest rate to record low levels
amidst a depreciating exchange rate and the trade
surplus is shrinking.
Still, the latest national account data show a GDP
growth of 1.8% quarter-on quarter, a positive
surprise in this third quarter of the year. Following
near stagnation in the first half of the year the
exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter
was underpinned by increasing natural-gas
production, increased government spending as well
as increases in mainland exports not directly
related to oil and gas. Irrespective of the positive
surprise, the outlook for the Norwegian economy
is not particularly bright. The economy is expected
to show less growth this year and next while the
risks are tilted to the downside.

forecast

Private consumption has been the countervailing
force to the contraction in investment last year but
started to lose momentum during the year. Private
consumption is expected to grow at a relatively
modest 1.5% this year before accelerating to 2.0%
next year. Risks are on the downside. Consumer
confidence has fallen sharply in the past quarters
from 18.6 in 2014-Q3 to -4.1 in 2015-Q3. This is
related to a rise in the unemployment rate since the
summer of 2014 and general uncertainty about the
economic outlook. Moreover, significant risks to
private consumption stem from the highlyleveraged and highly-priced real estate market.
New entrants into the housing market have paid for
the real estate revaluation through high
indebtedness. Their solvency, hence, depends on
the developments in housing while their liquidity
depends on the labour market developments. Both
are at risk of taking a turn for the worse. In
addition, inflation is under upward pressure as a
consequence of the depreciating exchange rate. As
a consequence, real wages are falling. This process
is reinforced by the labour market dynamics.
In contrast to the loss in export value of oil
shipments, the traditional non-oil/gas export sector
is doing relatively well thanks to the weaker NOK
but it still has to overcome an erosion of its price
competitiveness. The depreciation of the NOK will
help regain some of the competitiveness as will the
expected wage moderation. As a consequence, net
trade is expected to contribute modestly to growth.

The economy continues to benefit from booming
tourism and low inflation, supporting disposable
income. However, the ongoing currency
appreciation impedes the country’s price
competitiveness. Furthermore, the recent wage
agreements could push inflation above the Central
Bank target of 2.5%. The envisaged lifting of
capital controls could lead to sharp swings in
Iceland’s external balances, but could also result in
substantial wind-fall revenues for Iceland’s public
finances, allowing a rapid reduction in public debt.

The Norwegian economy is adjusting to lower oil
prices and related developments like the
depreciation of the NOK which are forecasted to
increase only gradually in over the forecast
horizon. As a consequence of the low oil prices,
off-shore investment, which accounts for more
than one quarter of total investment, is declining
and will continue to decline this year albeit at a
slower rate. Next year conditions are expected to
improve for gross fixed capital formation although
the construction sector is expected to lag.

Strong investment, consumption and exports
resulted in real GDP growth by 4.5% in the first
three quarters of 2015. Employment is expected to
have risen by about 3.5% in 2015, bringing
unemployment further down to 4.2%. A
strengthening exchange rate (by nearly 6%) and
low import prices have helped to keep average
inflation low, at 1.6% in 2015. After an annual

143

European Economic Forecast, Winter 2016

fiscal deficit of 0.1% of GDP in 2014, the budget
deficit stood at 1% of GDP in the first three
quarters of 2015. The high import content of
investment and private consumption resulted in a
worsening of Iceland’s trade balance, increasing
the deficit to 1.3% of GDP by September 2015.

substantial wage increases and at the same time
low inflation. These supporting effects are
expected to peter out over the forecasting time
horizon. Exports are projected to benefit from a
flourishing tourism sector. The recent wage
agreements are likely to dampen employment
growth in the coming years, but will also increase
labour supply, which however will have to
increasingly resort to labour from abroad, as
domestic employment rates are already high. Thus,
the unemployment rate will drop at a slower pace.

Inflation is likely to rise above the Central Bank
target of 2.5% in 2016-17, partly resulting from
high wage agreements of 2015, but also due to
strong demand from tourism. Stronger domestic
demand will lead to a widening of the trade deficit,
while the services balance will continue to benefit
from strong tourism. Overall, the current account
balance is forecast to deteriorate in 2016-17.

The government’s fiscal target for 2016 of largely
balanced accounts is in line with the current
growth outlook. Exceptional one-off revenues
related to the planned lifting of capital controls
could lead to substantial revenues in 2016. If those
funds are used primarily for lowering the debt
burden, the debt ratio could drop well below 50%
of GDP by end 2017.

Key factors for output growth in 2016-17 will be
tourism, investment and private consumption.
Investment is expected to remain strong reflecting
tourism-related construction, capital renewal in the
fishing and tourism industry and silicon-related
investment projects. Private consumption will
benefit from strong growth of disposable income,
resulting from high employment growth,

Recession bottoming out but outlook still bleak

The recession which Russia experienced in 2015 due to the fall in oil prices, sanctions and structural
bottlenecks, has recently bottomed out. However, the outlook has deteriorated since the autumn due to
the continued decline in oil prices and the prolongation of sanctions, so the economy is expected to
contract again in 2016 before growth turns slightly positive in 2017.
Recession bottoming out but the outlook
remains bleak

Consumption and
slightly in 2016

Russia’s economy slid into recession in 2015 as
pre-existing structural bottlenecks (mainly the
excessive reliance on the energy sector and low
investment) were overwhelmed by the collapse in
oil prices and economic sanctions.

Investment fell sharply in 2015 (albeit bottoming
out during the summer) reflecting constrained
access to Western capital markets amid sanctions,
elevated borrowing costs and a deteriorated
business environment.

Real GDP (y-o-y%)

17

Real GDP is forecast to have contracted by 3.7%
due to a sharp decline in private consumption and
investment on the back of elevated borrowing
costs, weak economic confidence and rising
inflation.
However, latest data releases point to a bottoming
out of the recession, as the fall in GDP eased
somewhat in 2015-Q3 (-4.1% y-o-y, following a
4.6% decline y-o-y in 2015-Q2) reflecting a slower
contraction in industrial production; although the
decline in retail sales and consumption has not yet
reached its bottom. The near-term outlook remains
rather bleak (with risks of protracted stagnation
now prevailing over prospects of a gradual
recovery), amid a significant downward revision of
the oil price forecast, the extension of sanctions
until July 2016, weak business sentiment,
persistently high borrowing costs and a likely lack
of structural reform momentum ahead of elections.
Negative growth of 1.2% is expected for 2016,
followed by very weak growth in 2017 (i.e. 0.3%).

investment

to

contract

Private consumption, previously the main growth
driver, fell roughly as much as investment,
reflecting a slump in real wages amid high
inflation caused by the rouble’s depreciation and
the ban on Western food imports. Moreover, fiscal
consolidation pressures limit the room for a
counter-cyclical stimulus, as suggested by the
roughly unchanged size of public expenditure in
the 2016 budget. In this context, private
consumption growth is expected to remain
negative in 2016 and around zero in 2017 given
the very weak GDP growth profile.
Export growth is expected to have turned negative
in 2015, as structural bottlenecks and falling
investment have so far prevented Russian firms
from reaping the benefit of the weaker rouble.
Constrained access to capital, reduced bank
lending and weak confidence weigh on Russia’s
export potential, although there are signs of
resilience/boost in a few sectors (i.e. energy,
agriculture, metals and pharmaceuticals). Exports
are set to recover somewhat in 2016 and 2017
given the gradual easing of geopolitical tensions
and increasing external demand. Imports collapsed
in 2015 on the back of the large fall in domestic
demand, the sharp depreciation of the rouble and
the embargo on Western food imports. Moreover,
they are expected to remain slightly negative in
2016 and grow only marginally in 2017, reflecting
a bleak growth outlook.
A somewhat deteriorating labour market

Although the labour market is expected to remain
relatively resilient, adjusting mainly through
wages, employment over the forecast horizon is
now expected to fall by slightly more than before,

from 17% to 11%), although further rate cuts are
still considered likely in the course of 2016.

Gradual disinflation amid renewed pressure on
the rouble

After worsening sharply in 2015 due to lower tax
revenues and the cost of recapitalising banks and
corporates, Russia’s fiscal deficit is set to remain
roughly stable in 2016 based on the adopted
budget. The final outcome, however, is expected to
be worse given the budget’s rather optimistic
assumptions about growth and the oil price and
because of the adverse fiscal situation of regional
governments. The deficit is to a large extent
funded by the Reserve Fund, which is at risk of
being almost fully depleted by the end of this year.
Some deficit reduction is expected in 2017 amid
efforts to adjust to a prolonged period of low oil
prices and to contain the depletion of buffers.

Another wave of rouble depreciation started at the
end of 2015 as the oil price resumed its decline,
with the currency reaching new record lows.
Although inflation moderated at the end of the year
(12.9% in December), the disinflation path is
likely to be less rapid than currently foreseen by
Russian authorities, due to the embargo on food
imports from the West (in force until August
2016), the introduction of a similar ban on Turkish
products and heightened risks of additional market
turbulence and rouble depreciation. Hence
inflation is expected to fall to average annual rates
of 8.5% and 6.2% in 2016 and 2017, respectively,
i.e. still far from the Central Bank of Russia’s
(CBR) medium-term target of 4%.
Amid lingering concerns over inflation and risks of
further market turbulence, the CBR suspended the
sequence of monetary easing carried out during the
first half of 2015 (bringing the key policy rate

Fiscal position likely to deteriorate faster than
planned amid low oil price

Risks to the outlook

Downside risks to the outlook are related to the
possible further prolongation of sanctions beyond
summer 2016 (amid unresolved geo-political
tensions) and the possibility that the oil price falls
by more than expected.

Statistical Annex

Note on concepts and sources
1. The Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN)
produces, under its own responsibility, short-term fully-fledged economic
forecasts in winter, spring and autumn. These forecasts cover the
principal macroeconomic aggregates for the Member States, the
candidate countries, the European Union as a whole, the euro area and
the international environment.

2. Data for 2015, 2016, and 2017 are forecasts. The source for all tables is the
European Commission, unless otherwise stated. Historical data for the
Member States are based on the European System of Accounts (ESA
2010). US national accounts are based on SNA 2008, whilst the Japanese
accounts use SNA 1993.

3. Tables 5 and 6 on domestic demand and final demand respectively,
present data including inventories.
4.

In Tables 17 and 18, the data are based on the national index for USA
and Japan, and for EU Member States and aggregates prior to 1996.

5. The potential output gap is calculated with reference to potential output
as estimated via a production function, where the increase in the capital
stock and the difference between actual unemployment and the
NAWRU play a key role.
6. Employment data used in tables 23-29 and 32-33 are based on full-timeequivalents (FTEs), where available. Currently, Spain, France, Italy, and
the Netherlands report FTE data. In the absence of FTE data, employment
is based on numbers of persons. In the calculation of EU and euro-area
aggregates, priority is given to FTE data, as this is regarded as more
representative of diverse patterns of working time.

the aggregation is carried out on the basis of current exchange rates.
Tables 49 - 52, 60 and 61 show also EU and euro-area "adjusted"
balances. Theoretically, balances of EU and euro area vis-à-vis third
countries should be identical to the sum of the balances of the individual
countries in the EU or the euro area. However, intra-EU or intra-euro-area
balances are non-zero because of reporting errors. The creation of the
internal market in 1993 reduced border controls and formalities, and
accordingly the scope and precision of intra-EU trade coverage.
Typically, intra-EU imports are underestimated compared to intra-EU
exports, leading toerestimation of the surplus. For the past the "adjusted"
balances are Eurostat estimates for EU and ECB estimates for the euro
area. For the future, they are ECFIN's forecasts based on the
extrapolation of the discrepancies observed in 2014.

9. Geographical zones are defined as follows :
Euro area :
EA19 (BE, DE, EE, IE, EL, ES, FR, IT, CY, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, AT, PT, SI,
SK, and FI)
European Union :
EU28 (EA19, BG, CZ, DK, HR, HU, PL, RO, SE, and UK).
Candidate countries :
Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Montenegro, Serbia, and Albania.
Potential candidates :
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Advanced economies :
EU, candidate countries, USA, Japan, Canada, Iceland,
Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand.
MENA (Middle East and Northern Africa) :

Asia :
7. Source: National Accounts (ESA 2010). Discrepancies with balance of
payments statistics may arise due to methodological differences and
revision schedules.
8. EU and euro-area data are aggregated using exchange rates. World
GDP is aggregated using Purchasing Power Standards (PPS). In the tables
on world trade and international payments,

Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar.

All countries in that region except Japan and the Asian MENA
countries.
Latin America :
All countries in that region.
Sub-Saharan Africa :
All countries in that region except the African MENA countries.
