 2 Update of economic and monetary 
developments
 Summary
 Financial market volatility following the referendum in the United Kingdom on EU 
membership has been short
-lived. However, uncertainty about the global outlook has 
increased, while incoming data for the second quarter point to subdued global 
activity and trade. Global headline inflation, meanwhile, has remained at low levels, 
mainly reflecting past energy price declines. Risks
 to the outlook for global activity, 
and in particular for emerging market economies, remain on the downside and relate 
primarily to political uncertainty and financial volatility.
 Euro area financial markets have weathered the spike in uncertainty and vol
atility 
following the UK referendum with encouraging resilience. As a result, overall 
financial conditions remain highly supportive. In particular, while the EONIA forward 

curve has shifted downwards, especially at longer horizons, possibly reflecting 
expe
ctations of both lower growth and further monetary policy actions, followed by 
low
-risk sovereign bond yields, sovereign spreads vis
-à-
vis ten
-year German 
government bonds have narrowed and those on corporate bonds have continued to 

tighten. At the same time, euro area banks™ equity prices have declined further. 
 The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing, supported by domestic 

demand, while export growth remains modest. Looking ahead, the economic 

recovery is expected to proceed at a moderate pace. Domestic demand remains 
supported by the pass
-through of the ECB™s monetary policy measures to the real 
economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate 
profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Sustained employme
nt 
gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low 
oil prices provide additional support for households™ real disposable income and thus 

for private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is expected to 
be mildly expansionary in 2016 and to turn broadly neutral in 2017 and 2018. At the 
same time, headwinds to the economic recovery in the euro area include the 

outcome of the UK referendum and other geopolitical uncertainties, subdued growth 
prospe
cts in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a 
number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. 

Against this background, the risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the 

downside. 
 Euro area headline inflation has remained at levels around zero in recent months. 
Measures of underlying inflation have on balance not yet shown clear signs of an 

upward trend, while pipeline price pressures have remained subdued. Market
-based 
measures of long
-ter
m inflation expectations have declined further and remain 
substantially below survey
-based measures of expectations. Looking ahead, on the 
basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low in

the next few months before starting to pick up later in 2016, in large part owing to 
base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by the ECB™s 
monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates 
should increase further in 2017 and 20
18. The monetary policy measures in place since June 2014, including the 
comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures adopted in March this 
year, have significantly improved borrowing conditions for firms and households, as 
well as credit flows across the euro area, thereby supporting the economic recovery. 

In particular, low interest rates, as well as the effects of the ECB™s targeted longer
-term refinancing operations and the expanded asset purchase programme
, continue 

to support robust growth in
 money and the gradual recovery in credit dynamics. 

Banks have been passing on their favourable funding conditions in the form of lower 
lending rates, and improved lending conditions are fostering a recovery in loan 
growth. Indeed, the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2016 

indicated further improvements in loan supply conditions for loans to enterprises and 
households and a continued increase in loan demand across all loan categories. In 
the light of the prevailing uncertainties, it is essential that the bank lending channel 
continues to function well.  
 At its meeting on 21 July 2016, based on the regular economic and monetary 
analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates 
unchanged. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates 

to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the 
horizon of the net asset purchases. Regarding non
-standard monetary policy 
measures, the Governing Council confirmed that the monthly asset purchases of •80 
billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and 
in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of 
inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
 Given prevailing uncertainties, the Governing Council will continue to monitor 
economic and financial market developments very closely and to safeguard the 
pass
-through of its accommodative monetary policy to the real economy. Over the 
coming months, as more information becomes available, including new staff 
projections, the Governing Council will be in a better position to reassess the 
underlying macroeconomic conditions, the most likely paths of inflation and growth, 
and the distribution of risks around those paths. If warranted to achieve its objective, 

the Governing Council will act by using all the instruments available within its 

mandate.
 The Governing Council confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of 

monetary accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels 
that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay.

1 External environment
 





The outcome of the referendum took financial markets by surprise 
and prices adjusted rapidly in the immediate aftermath of the vote. Since 23 June 
the 
pound sterling has depreciated sharply.
 However, 
the impact 
on most global markets 
has been short
-lived
, although bank equities have declined, particularly in the euro 
area. 
Uncertainty about the global outlook has risen since the referendum.
 In the 
short
-term 
the largest impact has been felt by the UK economy, as 
uncertainty about 
the future trading and investment relationships between the U
nited 
Kingdom
 and the 
EU 
is weighing
 on demand. Other non
-euro area European economies, particularly 
those with close trading links with the United Kingdom, may also be affected
. 
Outside Europe, the impact is expected to be more limited
 but political 
uncertainty 
across advanced economies has risen, which could dampen confidence and 

investment. Private sector forecasts for major economies have been revised 
downwards slightly.
 




 The Bank of England left 
interest rates unchanged at its meeting in July, although it signalled possible action 
in the 
near future
. In the United States, market expectations for interest rate 
increases during 2016 have moderated. According to the 
federal 
funds futures curve, 
markets 
are fully 
pric
ing
 in a 25 b
asis 
point
 hike only 
towards the end of 2017. 
Financial markets also expect further easing by the Bank of Japan.
 





 The 
global composite output Purchasing Managers
™ 
Index
 (PMI
) 
recorded a further decline
 in the second quarter, 
falling 
to 51.3
 Œ 
the lowest value 
seen 
since end
-2012 (see Chart 1)
. Global trade growth has contr
acted 
further. The volume of world imports of goods fell by 

0.6% in April
 2016, on a 
three
-m
onth
-on-three
-m
onth
 basis. 
While t
rade 
growth improved in advanced 
economies, it deteriorated further in emerging market 

economies (EMEs), particularly Asia. The sh
ort
-term 
outlook for global trade 
is subdued, 
with the global PMI 
for new export orders remaining below the threshold 
value of 50 in June.
  

 In 
the OECD countries, annual CPI 
inflation 
increased by 
0.8% in May, the same pace as in the previous two 
months. The energy component has continued to weigh 
on inflation
. 
OECD inflation excluding food and energy 

stood at 1.9%
 in May (see Chart 2). Among large

EMEs, inflation fell in China and Brazil and was unchanged in India. Having fallen 
sharply over the past year, inflation ticked up in Russia. 
 



 OPEC output increased in June, driven 

mainly by supply increases in Iran, Saudi Arabia and 
Nigeria. Non
-OPEC supply also increased in June, 
underpinned by a partial recovery in Canadian oil 

production. On the demand side, 
the 
International 
Energy 
Agency
™s 
forecasts for global oil demand growth 
in 2016 have been revised upwards
. 
The prices of non
-oil commodities have increased 
marginally
 since 
the 
start of
 June.
 


 The pace of 
economic activity slowed to 0.3%
, quarter on quarter, 
in 
the first quarter of this year
 (1.1% in annualised terms), 

driven by weaker household spending and a decline in 
non-residential investment. However, recent data point 
to a rebound 
in GDP growt
h in the second quarter. 
Growth in personal consumption expenditure 
has 
increased
, reflecting gains in real disposable income 
and households™ net wealth partly as a result of improved housing market conditions. 
In April and May retail sales rose at a 
stead
y 
pace and vehicle sales rebounded
, after dipping in March.
 Moreover, the labour market remains resilient. US non
-farm 
payroll
 employment
 rose by
 287,000 in June, after more modest increases in the 
previous two months. 
In June,
 annual headline CPI inflation declined to 1.0%
, dampened by lower energy and food price inflation, while inflation 
excluding food 
and energy rose
 slightly
, to
 2.3
%, the highest rate seen in four years.
 


 Following the 
decline 
in the 
final quarter of 2015, GDP grew by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the 
first quarter
 of 
2016. 
The latest indicators, however, point to subdued activity in the second quarter, 
as industrial production contracted in May and the B
ank 
of Japan™s 
Tankan sur
vey 
signalled some deterioration in business conditions. Labour market conditions
 are 
tight, with the unemployment rate 
standing 
at 3.2%
 in May
, the lowest level in more 
than two decades. However, wage growth remains weak. Annual headline CPI 

inflation dec
lined further
 into negative territory in May
. 
 


GDP 
growth slowed to 0.4%
, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter 
of 2016. Activity was driven primarily by robust private consumption, while 
investment recorded
 a decline and net exports also continued to 
exert
 a drag on 
growth. 
According to short
-term indicators, the UK economy continued to expand in 
the second quarter of 2016 at a relatively robust pace, similar to that seen in the 

previous quarter. However, the uncertainty created by the outcome of the UK 
referendum is likely to weigh on economic activity
 in the near term
, in particular 
investment and trade.

In the second quarter of 2016 China recorded GDP growth
 of 6.7
%, 
year
 on year
 Œ 
the same rate as in the previous quarter and in line with the 
growth target range of 6.5%
-7% set 
by 
the 
Chinese authorities for 2016. Activity has 
relied on government support in recent quarters. Fixed asset investment has been 
boosted by strong growth in infrastructure investment, while capital expenditure in 
the manufacturing sector has moderated. 
 

 Activity has remained resilient in commodity
-importing countries, such as India
 where activity expanded by 7.6%
, year on year, in the first quarter
 of 2016
. Turkey 
also experienced sustained rates of GDP growth in the same period. However, 
looking ahead, the attempted military coup has increased political uncertainty, which 
could weigh on demand. Among commodity exporters, activity has been weak. 
Brazil 
remains 
in recession.
 However, in Russia, there are signs that the economy has 
bottomed out
, as GDP
 returned
 to positive growth of 0.3%
, quarter on quarter, in the 
first quarter
 of 2016
. 
Capital flows towards EMEs have remained generally resilient 
in recent months. Taking a longer perspective, however, the gradual deceleration of 
economic activity in EMEs has contributed to a gradual waning of net capital flows to 

EMEs in recent years (see Box 
1). 2 Financial developments
 


Sovereign spreads vis
-à-
vis the German Bund ten
-year rate 
widened immediately after the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership, 
especially for lower
-rated issuers, but thereafter spreads overall declined to below 
their early June levels, with
 the exception of those for Portugal and Greece. 




The broad EURO 
STOXX index lost slightly more than 2% during the review period (2 June to 20 July 
2016). Over the same period the S&P 500 index in the United States rose by around 
3% (see Chart 3). These developments were the result of a relatively st
able 
performance ahead of the UK referendum, losses of close to 8% and 5% for the euro 
area and US indices, respectively, between 23 and 27 June, and a recovery phase 
thereafter. Euro area bank equity prices overall lost 13% since early June, while US 
bank equity prices declined by around 4%. The overall declines, although large, are 
nonetheless much smaller than the drop in banks™ equity prices in the two main 
economic areas between 23 and 27 June, of around 25% and 10% respectively. 
Profitability concerns, as well as country and bank
-specific events, continued to 
weigh on the euro area banking sector in particular. Market expectations of equity 
price volatility spiked significantly just after the UK referendum, but fell back to their 
initial level in the remainder of the review period.

 Spreads on issues by 
euro area NFCs have declined since early June across 

all rating classes, with a limited and short
-lived rebound 
after the outcome of the UK referendum. On 20 July 
NFC bond spreads were, depending on the rating, 30
-40 basis points lower than in early June and 50
-80 
basis points lower relative to 10 March, the day on 
which the Governing Council announced the CSPP 
(see also Box 2). In the financial sector, bond spreads 

also declined across all rating classes since early June. 
The diverging behaviour of bank equities, which 
declined significantly, and financial bond spreads, whi
ch 
continued to narrow, is consistent with the view that 
profitability concerns 
Œ 
rather than perceptions of 
increased default risks among financial institutions 
Œ 
were the key factor behind developments in the banking 
sector.




 In 
bilateral terms, since 2 June the euro appreciated by 
8.1
% against the pound sterling
, 
amid heightened 
uncertainty after the outcome of the UK
 refere
ndum on 
EU membership. Higher volatility and 
a decline in risk 
appetite supported the Japanese yen, leading to a 
depreciation 
of the euro against the Japanese currency 

of around 5%. The euro also depreciated against the 
US dollar, the Swiss franc and the currencies of most 
emerging market economies and commodity
-exporting 
countries
 (see Chart 4)

the outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership was announced, the 
downward shift of the curve ranged from 10 basis points at the one
-year horizon to 
20 basis points at the eight
-year horizon. These developments reflected downward 
revisions to expected growth and rising market expectations of further monetary 

policy easing in response. By 20 July these declines had remained stable up to the 
one-year horizon, but had widened further, up to around 30 basis points, across
 the 
remaining maturities.
 3 Economic activity
 




 Real GDP 
increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter
 in the first quarter, 
supported
 by robust private 
consumption dynamics as well as continued improvements in investment, whereas 
net trade contributed negatively. Changes in inventories also contributed 
positively
 to 
GDP growth in the first quarter of 2016. 
 




. Private consumption increased 
further in the first quarter of 2016, by 0.6% quarter on quarter, following a temporary 
slowdown in the 
previous quarter 
owing to adverse 
weather effects 
on energy and 
seasonal goods consumption, and the terrorist attacks in France.
 From
 a longer
-term
 perspective, 
consumer spending has been benefiting from rising real disposable 

income among households, which primarily reflects rising employment and lower oil 
prices. 
Households™ real gross disposable income grew in the first quarter of 2016,
 by 2.1%
 year
 on year. After improving further in the second quarter of 2016, 
consumer confidence declined 
slightly 
in July following the UK referendum 
outcome 
and remained above its long
-term average. Households™ balance sheets have also 
become less constrained
. 










Total investment increased by 0.8%
, quarter on 
quarter
, in the first quarter of 2016
 mainly owing
 to a rise in equipment investment. 
Rising investment in metal products and machinery made up about half of the 
increase in y
ear-on-year
 terms in the first quarter, while construction and ICT 
(information and communication technology) investment contributed equally to the 
remaining part. In the second quarter of 2016 there was some weakness in the 
industrial production of capital
 goods which
 declined
 in May
 by 2.3%, month on 
month, 
thereby more than offsetting the strong increase of 1.7% 
recorded 
in April.
 A 
weak external environment
 combined with
 fewer industrial orders of capital goods
 and subdued production expectations in the capital goods sector
 will most likely 
weigh on the growth rate of non
-construction investment
 in the months to come. 
Construction investment
 continued to grow in the first quarter of 2016, but a fall in 
production in the first two months of the second quarter of 2016, together with a 

negative carry
-over from declines in February and March, suggest subdued 
dynamics for 
housing investment in the second quarter of 
2016.  ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 5 
/ 2016

. Improving profits and
 the need to replace investment after 
years of subdued fixed capital formation should also support total investment going 
forward.
 However, uncertainty related to the UK referendum outcome
 and its 
potential implications for the euro area economy might weigh on
 the
 investment 

outlook.
 In addition, deleveraging needs and a slow pace of reform implementation, 

particularly in some countries, as well as subdued potential growth prospects, may 

also dampen investment growth.
 











When taking monthly trade outcomes for April 
and May together, extra
-euro area goods exports fell 
somew
hat compared with the second quar
ter of
 2015. 
Among the emerging market economies, growth in 

exports to China increased, while growth in exports to 
Russia and Latin America
 decreased
. As for the 
advanced economies, exports to the United States 

made a broadly neutral contribution
, whereas exports to 
non-euro area Europe (including the United Kingdom) 
increased. The relative strength of euro area exports 
since the turn of the year compared 
with
 global trade 
growth point
s 
to gains in euro area export market 
shares. Looking ahead, the slight appreciation of the 
effective exchange rate of the euro in the first half of 
this year is expected to weigh on euro area exports. In 
addition, exports may be negatively affected by the 
possible adverse consequences of the UK
 referendum outcome for global trade 
flows. Moreover, more timely indicators,
 such as surveys
, signal 
continued subdued 
developments
 in foreign demand and relatively weak
 export orders 
from 
outside the 
euro area in the near term. 
 












. Industrial production 
(excl
uding
 construction) declined in May, following strong growth in April
, resulting in 
an average index level for the first two months of the second quarter of 
2016 that 
stands 
0.2% below that for the first quarter
. 
Construction production and new orders 
continued to decline in April. Retail sales and car registrations rose in April and May 

by 0.3%, month on month, 
although
 car registrations declined in June. More timely 
survey data are in line with continued growth in the second quarter, albeit at a lower 

rate than in the first quarter
. The composite output Purchasing Managers™ Index 

(PMI
) 
remained unchanged in June, leading to a quarterly average slightly below the 
level seen in the first quarter of 2016 (see Chart 5). The Economic Sentiment 

Indicator (ESI) declined slightly in June. Both indicators remain above their long
-term 
average levels.

further by 0.3%
, quarter on quarter
, in the 
first 
quarter of 201
6. As a result, 
employment stood 
1.4
% above the level recorded one year earlier, the highest 
annual rise observed since the first quarter of 2008
. The
 unemployment rate 
in the 
euro area also continued to decline in May 2016, falling
 to 10.1
% (
see Chart

. 
Long-term unemployment (those who have been unemployed for at least 12 months) 
continues to decrease slowly 
but 
remains above 5% of the labour f
orce
. More timely 
survey 
data continued to improve in the recent months and are consistent with 
further employ
ment gains in the period ahead. 
 







 Domestic demand continues to be 
supported by the 
ECB™s 
moneta
ry policy measures. 
Their favourable impact on financing conditions, 

together with improvements in corporate profitability, is 
boosting
 investment. Moreover
, continued employment 
gains and the still relatively low price of oil should 
continue to
 support households™ real disposable income 
and private consumption. However, heightened 

uncertainty 
following the 
UK referendum
 might affect 
confidence and
 trade. Other 
geopolitical uncertainties
 also pose challenges for
 the economic recovery in the 
euro area
. 
At the same time, the economic recovery 
is still 
being 
dampened by the ongoing balance sheet 

adjustments in a number of sectors, the insufficient 

pace of implementation of structural reforms and 
subdued growth prospects in emerging markets.
 Against this background, the risks to the euro area 
growth outlook remain tilted to the downside.

no clear signs of
 further upward 
momentum since a turning point
 was reached in early 
2015. Looking at the main components, services price 

inflation has been hovering around 1% in recent 
months, while non
-energy industrial goods price 
inflation has been within a range of 0.4% to 0.7%.
 


After declining for several successive months 
import price inflation 
in non-food 
consumer goods
 increased from 
-1.4% in April to 
-0.7% in May. This 
pattern is fairly 
similar
 to that of developments in the 
euro nominal effective exchange rate. The annual rate 
of change in the producer price index for domestic 
sales of non
-food consumer goods industries
 increased 
slightly further
, to 
0.1% in May
, from 0.0% in April and 
-0.1% in March
. 
The limited 
upward pressure on producer prices ma
y result from
 the 
impact of an 
improvement 
in economic conditions being
 offset by that of weak cost pressures stemming from, 
for example, low commodity 
prices
. 

 Growth in compensation per employee 
was 
1.2% 
in year
-on-year terms in the first quarter of 2016, slightly down from 1.3% in the 
fourth quarter of 2015. Factors that may be weighing on wage growth include 

continued elevated levels of slack in the labour market, weak productivity growth, the 
low inflat
ion
 environment 
and the ongoing i
mpact of
 labour market reforms 
implemented during the crisi
s. 






The five
-year 
forward inflation rate five years ahead 
has 
declined since the beginning of June and 
reached a new all
-time low in early July. A large part of the decline appears to be 
due to technical factors, as increased demand for safe assets amid deteriorating 

market sentiment following the UK referendum on EU membership has contributed
 to dampening
 market
-based measures of inflation. While these measures may 
therefore recover as market sentiment improves, the decrease may also indicate that 
market participants consider inflation unlikely to pick up soon. At the same time, 
markets continue to price in only a limited risk of deflation.
 In contrast to market
-based measures, survey
-based measures of long
-term inflation expectations, such 
as those 
obtained from
 the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and 
Consensus Economics surveys, have been more stable (
see Chart

 The ECB™s 
non-standard monetary policy measures
 partly account 
for this development
. 
From a counterpart perspective, 

the largest source
s 
of money creation in 
May
 were
 the 
bond purchases made by the Eurosystem in the context 

of the public sector purchase programme (P
SPP) and shifts away from longer
-term financial liabilities. The 
annual rate of change of 
the
 longer
-term financial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves) of monetary 

financial institutions (MFIs) 
remained strongly negative 
in 
May
 2016. This reflects
 the flatness of the yield 
curve, linked to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary 

policy measures, which has made it less favourable
 for 
investors to hold longer
-term bank 
liabilities
. 
The attractiveness of the targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations
 (TLTROs
) as an alternative to longer
-term 
market
-based bank funding also played a role
. In this 
context, the allotment 
in June 2016 of the first operation 
in the second series of TLTROs (
TLTRO
-II
) 
amounted to •399 b
illion, 
which was
 slightly below market expectations. Furthermore
, 
the gradual recovery in the growth 
of credit to the private sector contributed to increased money creation. 
The MFI 
sector™s net external asset position continues to weigh on annual M3 growth
. This 
developm
ent continues to reflect capital outflows from the euro area and ongoing 
portfolio rebalancing in favour of non
-euro area instruments (in particular
 the euro 
area government bonds sold by non
-residents under the PSPP)
.  

 The annual growth rate 
of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for sales and securitisation) 
increased in 
May
 (see Chart 
9). 
While the annual growth rate of loans to 
non-financial 
corporations (NFCs)
 recovered further in May, the annual growth rate of loans to 
households has remained broadly stable since February 2016. These trends were 

generally observed across the euro area and were supported by the
 significant 

decreases 
in bank lending rates 
witnessed 
since summer 2014 (notably owing to the 
ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy measures)
, as well as
 by improvements in the 
supply of and demand for bank loans. Despite these positive signs, the ongoing 

consolidation of bank balance sheets and persistently high levels of non
-performing 
loa
ns in some 
countries
 remain a drag on
 loan growth.

 14 main effects of the TLTROs on loan supply translate into an easing of terms and 
conditions, rather than in changes 
in credit standards.
 

 Composite lending rates for 
NFCs and households have de
creased 
by significantly 
more than market reference rates since June 2014
 (see 
Chart 10)
. 
Receding fragmentation in euro area 
financial markets and the improvement in the pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending 

rates
 have played a positive role in this context
. 
Furthermore, the decrease in banks™ composite funding 
costs has supported the decline in composite lending 
rates. Since
 June 2014 banks have been progressively 
passing on the decline in their funding costs in the form 

of lower lending rates.
 Moreover, t
he sizeable take
-up in 
the first 
TLTRO
-II operation 
implies a significant 
reduction in 
bank funding costs
, which can be passed 
on to final borrowers in the economy. 
Between May 
2014 and 
May
 2016, composite lending rates on loans 
to euro area NFCs and households fell by
 around
 100 and 9
0 
basis points
 respectively; vulnerable 
euro area 
countries have seen particularly strong reductions in 
bank lending rates. Over the same period, the spread between interest rates 

charged on very small loans (loans of up to •0.25 million) and those charged on 
large loans (loans of above •1 million)
 in the euro area followed a downward path. 
This 
generally 
indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises are benefiting to a 
greater
 extent than large 
companies
 from the decline in
 lending rates.
 




 The 
strengthe
ning in April and May was supported by, among other things,
 the ECB™s 
monetary policy package announced in March and was widespread across 
countries, while the increase in March 
was
 driven by two large transactions. Market 
data show that corporate bond issuance moderated 
nota
bly in the second half of 
June
, most likely related to concerns 
about the 
EU 
referendum
 in the United 
Kingdom
, before strengthening again in the first half of July. The net issuance of 
quoted shares by NFCs has remained 
relatively
 modes
t in recent months. (See 
Box
 5 for non
-banks
™ 
increasing role in providing new financing to euro area NFCs 
since 2008.)
 
 The overall nominal cost 
of external financing for NFCs has remained broadly unchanged at 
the
 historical
ly low level reached in April 2016, masking diverging movements across financing 

instruments. The cost of equity financing increased moderately in May and June and 
declined in July
, 
following the developments
 in equity prices. By contrast, the cost of 
market
-based debt financing continued to decline over the period
 from May to July

 Recent developments in capital flows

 emerging market economies
 







2Net c
apital 
inflows to EMEs 
recovered quickly after the global financial crisis. 

However
, this rebound reversed in 2011 and since then
 net 
capital inflows have followed a downward trend (
see 
Chart A). Moreover, after a modest recovery in 2013, 

there was a renewed decline in net capital inflows to 
EMEs, which have remained negative for the last six
 quarters. This is the longest period of consecutive net 
capital outflows from EMEs since 2001. The 
reversal
 seems to be broad based across different types of 
investment class. In particular, foreign direct 
investment, which is the most stable component of the 
financial account, remained below its long
-term average 
(2000
-Q1 2016) over the last two years
. 








 EME currencies 
were
 on a downward trend 
between 2011 and 2015. The weakening was particularly pronounced in the perio
d between mid
-2014 and late 2015 when the US dollar started to strengthen amid 
gradually building market expectations of a tightening of US monetary policy. Since 
early
 2016 EME currencies have started to recover part of 
their
 losses.

 Since 2010 growth in major EMEs has been on a 
downward trend, driven both by a deteriorating external environment and domestic 
structural factors (see Chart C).
4 At the same time, growth in
 advanced economies 
has stabilised since 2013. This has resulted in a diminishing growth differential 
between EMEs and advanced economies, making the former less attractive for 
foreign investment. Moreover, low growth or recessions in some EMEs might have 
bolstered gross capital outflows. The average quarterly growth differential decreased 

from 1.2 percentage points in the pre
-crisis period (2001
-07) to 0.9 percentage point 
in 2010
-15 and to 0.7 percentage point over the last two years.

 The model 
results show that
 net capital inflows respond to 
global risk aversion, 
which is 
consistent with the empirical evidence found in the literature.
5 Furthermore
, the 
recent period of net capital outflows from EMEs also seems to have been strongly 
driven by the decline
 in oil prices which 
began in 2014. 
Oil price 
declines 
directly 
affect the 
economic and financing conditions of commodity exporters. However, 
change
s in oil prices are also positively correlated with net capital inflows to 
commodity importers. This could be associated with the fact that oil prices partly 
reflect global demand conditions and therefore global income.
6 In particular, while 
the initial phase of the fall in oil prices as of mid
-2014 was mainly supply
-driven, the 
decline
 from
 autumn 2015 
to
 January 2016 is believed to 
have been
 more demand
-driven.

 The orderly developments in financial markets in 
December 2015, when the US policy rate hike was fully priced in by the m
arkets, 
compared with the ﬁtaper tantrumﬂ episode in 2013, have highlighted the importance 
of expectations
 concerning US monetary policy for global financial market 
developments. Using several different proxies for US monetary policy expectations, 
a significant effect of such expectations on aggregate net capital flows to EMEs is 
not found.
8 However, these expectations seem to play a more significant role as a 
determinant of portfolio flows examined at higher frequencies.
9 The role of interest 
rate differentials between 
EMEs
 and advanced economies is 
also 
not clearly 
captured 
in the specific set

significant in

Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its aim
 of 
achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term
. 





 



 To be eligible for 
purchase, securities must, as a necessary condition, be eligible as collateral for 
Eurosystem credit operations. In particular, they must have a minimum first
-best 
credit assessment of at least credit quality step 3 (investment grade) according to the 
Eurosystem credit assessment framework from an external credit as
sessment 
institution. In addition, the securities must be denominated in euro; the eligible 

maturity spectrum ranges from a minimum remaining maturity of six months to a 

maximum remaining maturity of 30 years at the time of the purchase; the securities 
mus
t be issued by a corporation established in the euro area; 
and securities issued 
by credit institutions are not eligible for purchase. The Eurosystem applies an issue 
share limit of 70% per security.

amount purchased is published on a weekly basis and the split between primary and 
secondary 
markets is published each month on the ECB™s website. The corporate 
bond market is generally less liquid than the government bond market, as corporate 

bond issues are much smaller in terms of outstanding amount than most government

make up the majority of the volume under the CSPP (see Chart A) and trades are 
typically larger in the primary market than in the secondary market. Average trade 
sizes under the CSPP are broadly comparable to those under the third covered bond 

purchase programme (CBPP3) and smaller than trades under the public sector 
purchase programme (PSPP). The corporate bond repo mark
et likewise
 tends to be
 less liquid than the government bond
 repo market. To support market liquidity, the 
Eurosystem has since 18 July
 made its CSPP bond holdings available for securities 
lending via the national central banks conducting 
purchases.
  




Owing to the large number of eligible corporate issuers, purchases have so 
far been spread over 458 different bonds issued by 175 different issuers. Yields of 
the purchased bonds have ranged from around 
-0.3
% to above 3%,
 with just above 
20% of the purchases being made at negative yields above the ECB™s deposit facility 
rate of 
-0.4%. The ratings of the bonds range from AA to BBB
- 
and the distribution of 
purchases broadly mirrors
 the rating distribution of the universe of eligible bonds. 
The purchases are well diversified across corporations in many economic sectors 
(see Chart B) and across the euro area countries where bonds are outstanding.

Following the current practi
ce in the 
literature, the impact of the CSPP announcement
 is assessed
 through an event study approach focusing on 

the two
-week period after the announcement. The 
empirical analysis suggests that the monetary policy 
decisions announced in March, which include the 
launch of the CSPP, the cut in the ECB deposit facility 

rate and the new series of four targeted longer
-term 
refinancing operations (TLTRO
-II)
, have improved the 
external financing conditions of firms. Providing precise 

estimates of the impact of the policies is most likely not 
feasible. However, focusing on the spread between the 
individual corporate bond yield and the risk
-free rate of 
the same maturity might help to identify more directly 

the effects of the CSPP. 
 















14 Most of these
 bonds are 
eligible for CSPP purchases. However, the same 

analysis also identifies a notable impact on the 

corporate bond market segments
 dominated by 
ineligible bonds. In particular, it shows an 
impact 
of 25
 basis points
 on high
-yield
 bonds, i.e. bonds with a 
rating lower than investment grade, and an impact of 5
 basis points
 on corporate bonds issued by 
financial 
institutions
, which include both ineligible bank bonds 
and eligible bonds issued by insurance corporations. 

The evidence of a decline in corporate credit spreads 
owing to the CSPP is corroborated by the sizeable 

spread contraction for bonds issued by insurance 
corporations when it was confirmed on 21 April that 
                                                                    14  
The results are based on a panel data analysis where spreads of 4,750 individual euro area corporate 
bonds are disaggregated into their dri
ving factors by means of a two
-step procedure. In a first step, the 
idiosyncratic risks of individual bonds are disentangled from a systematic or aggregate factor equally 

affecting all corporate bonds together over the period October 1999
-March 2016. The s
econd step 
considers the determinants of this systematic component, i.e. global factors, such as oil prices and the 

VIX (the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index), and monetary policy.

While issuance was subdued at the beginning of the year amid 
elevated financial market uncertainty, it rebounded significantly after the CSPP 

announcement. Preliminary data (see Chart E) suggest that issuance in the second 

quarter of 2016 was well above the average seen in previous years. Moreover, the

The launch
 of 
money 
market 
statistical 
reporting
 









 In
-depth 
knowledge of the dynamics of short
-term interest rates is a key element
 for the 
conduct of monetary policy, affording a better understanding of its
 transmission
 mechanism, as well as
 for financial stability and microprudential supervision
. To this
 end, the ECB 
and the Eurosystem 
have identified a pressing
 need to collect
 very 
timely, high frequency and granular money market transactional data, initially from a 
first wave of the 52 largest credit institutions in the euro area, which are referred to 
as the money market statistical reporting (MMSR) dataset.








15 The main 
purpose of this dataset is to provide 
the Eurosystem with frequent (daily),
 accurate, timely (the day after the conclusion of 
the trade)
 and comprehensive data
 on transactions concluded by the reporting credit 
institution
s in the euro money markets, which will allow improved monitoring of the 
transmission of monetary policy decisions 
to
 money markets
. It
 will also 
provide 
valuable information on the functioning of
 the euro 
money markets, 
permitting
 in-depth
 analysis 
of developments in short
-term interest rates. 
 












 The new Regulation 
requires
 the daily 
reporting of
 transaction
-by-transaction 
information on 
unsecured and secured 
lending and borrowing transactions
 in euro
 with a maturity 
of 
up to 
one year
. All 
foreign exchange swap
 transactions
 with a maturity 
of 
up to 
one year
 involving euro
 and all OIS
 transactions
 denominated in euro
 must also be reported
. 
The detailed 
trade data to be provided include the volume, rate, counterparty type and collateral 
type, together with the time at which the transaction was conducted.
 













 The ECB 
collects
 data reported 
by the largest euro area 
monetary 
financial institutions (
MFIs
), based on the size of their total main balance sheet 
assets in comparison 
with
 the total main balance sheet assets 
of all euro area MFIs. 
The reporting agents either report to the NCB of the Member State where they are 
                                                                    15

 25 resident, providing data for all their branches located in EU Member States and 
EFTA countries, or directly to the ECB. In accordance with Regulation ECB/2014/48, 
the Governing Council of the ECB may in future expand the number of reporting 
institutions
 based on, for example,
 the significance of 
an MFI's activities in the 
money markets and its relevance to the stability and functioning of the financial 
system.
 




 In this regard, the dataset 
is based on transaction
-by-transaction data from reporting agents 
on transactions conducted 
with other MFIs, 
other financial intermediaries, insurance corporations, pension funds, central banks 

(excluding transactions related to Eurosystem tender operations and standing 

facilities)
 and the general government
, as well as transactions with non
-financial 
corporations classified as 
ﬁwholesale
ﬂ 
pursuant to the Basel III liquidity coverage 
ratio framew
ork.
 










With a view to limiting the impact of teething problems and ensuring full 
automation from 1 July 2016, the credit institutions started to send data 
on 1 April 
2016. This three
-month interim period was deemed necessary to fine
-tune the 
reporting process before the legal obligation came into force on 1 July.








 To this end
, 
the Eurosystem based
 the underlying taxonomy and data 
transmission format on the ISO 20022 standard. A set of four reporting messages 
and a 
status message containing feedback information 
was
 approved by the 
ISO 
Securities Standards Evaluation Group in January 2016.
 T
he messag
es will 
be used 
for
 both the MMSR in euro and the Sterling Money Market Data collection
 by the 
Bank of England
.  



This could include 
breakdowns for the various market segments by frequency and concentration of 
market activity per reporting agent, together with an analysis of changes in volumes 

and rates over time. It will be the natural successor to similar publications, such as 
the Money Market Survey which gave an overview of the money market on a
n annual basis. It will also be used as background data for publications such as the 
Euro Money Market Study.

 Recent developments in euro area 
construction 
activity
 





 Construction activity grew rapidly 
in the period preceding
 the financial and economic crisis that started in 2008. The 

subsequent
 reces
sion was very pronounced in the sector: from peak to trough, 
both 
value added and employment declined by 
around 25%
, with large differences across 
countries
16. 
Although the economic recovery in the euro area
 started in 2013
, 
construction activity does not 
seem to have bottomed out until 2015 and has only 
begun to show signs of recovery in recent quarters (see Chart A).
 
Construction value added in the euro area and in the 
largest euro area countries
 (index: 2004=100; quarterly data; working day and seasonally adjusted; chain
-linked 
values)
  Sources: Eurostat
 and ECB calculations.
 


Before and after the crisis, construction activity in most of the largest euro 
area countries (with the exception of Germany) exhibited a significant cyclical 
pattern, driven by the boom and bust of the property market. Between 2004 and 
2007 the largest positive contributions to euro area construction activity w
ere made 
by France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, while construction in Germany was 
                                                                    16  
In some Member States, the decline was as high as 75% (Greece and Cyprus), while in others it 
remained moderate (for example, 2.5% in Belgium and 7% in Germany).

 27 much weaker. After
 2008 construction activity fell in most of the largest economies, 
with the exception of Germany, where it remained relatively flat until 2010. Value 
added and production in the construction sector began to pick up in Germany after 
2010, led by an increase in housing demand,
17 while in Spain and the Netherlands 
the sector started to grow only in early 2014. 
 




 Construction production increased in the last quarter of 2015 and 
the first quarter of 2016 in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and several smaller 
euro area countries, while in France and Italy it seems to be st
abilising. Similarly, 
increases in value added
18 were recorded in most euro area countries over the same 
two quarters.
 






 A breakdown of the monthly construction 
production indicator shows that construction of 

buildings
19 has been increasing strongly, while civil 
engineering remains weak. Correspondingly, 

construction investment is driven by housing 

investment, which also bottomed out in 2015 and has 
started to increase in the last few quarters (see 
Chart
 C).
 





 Several factors support demand for 
housing investment. First,
 real disposable income 
growth has started to accelerate as labour markets 
have improved, while households are more willing to 
invest when the probability of becoming unemployed is 

lower. Second, real mortgage lending rates have 
declined
 and credit conditi
ons have been favourable, 
partly reflecting the recent monetary policy measures in the euro area. Third, recent 
fiscal measures, including tax incentives in several countries,
20 support housing 
demand. Finally, returns on alternative forms of household investment are low, 

providing further incentives for residential investment. These factors are expected to 

continue supporting demand for housing and construction activity in the forthcoming 

quarters.
                                                                     17

 On 
the one hand, the volume of building permits granted 
suggests an increase in the construction of buildings 

looking ahead (see Chart D),
 and the
 construction 
confidence 
indicator in the European Commission™s 

business surveys i
s currently 
around its long
-term 
average
. On the other hand, the first quarter of the year 
might have been influenced
 by weather effects and thus 
some caution is warranted when considering the 
strength of the figures for the year as a whole. In the 
first quarter of 2016, Germany made the largest 
contribution to the increase in euro area construction 

value added.
 This str
ong increase in construction 
activity in Germany, however, may be related to the 

mild weather conditions.
21 Indeed, in each of the past 
three years (including 2016), the first quarter has been 
the strongest (although in 2015 this was reflected in 
higher value added and investment, but not in higher 

production), but has been followed by a decline in the 
second quarter, pointing to weather effects over the winter periods. Furthermore, the 

Purchasing Managers™ Index on euro area construction output,
 following
 strong 
increases at the start of the year, has declined significantly in recent months to a 
level indicating broadly flat construction activity, and the assessment of order books 
has followed a similar path
. In addition, monthly construction production fe
ll in April 

and May, signalling some risks to the strength of the recovery in the construction 
sector and residential investment in the second quarter of 2016. Taken together, 
these short
-term indicators point to some correction in the strong growth of 
con
struction activity seen in the previous two quarters.

Trends in the external financing 
structure of euro area non
-financial 
corporations 
 



This box discusses the 
recent changes in the external financing structure of euro area NFCs, the possible 
factors behind them and potential implications for the transmission of monetary 
policy measures.






Traditionally, euro area firms have mostly relied 
on bank lending to finance their fixed investment and 
working capital needs. Looking at cumulated 
transactions between 2002 and 2008, the share of bank
 financing in
 total
 NFC financing stood at around 70
% (see Chart 
A). However, this share dropped to 50% in 
the period from 2002 to early 2016, implying that 
alternative financing sources have gained in importance 

in the euro area. The decline in 
bank financing 
is 
primarily driven by developments in the fina
ncing 

structure of large enterprises. By contrast, small and 

medium
-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the 
backbone of the euro area economy, continue to be 

financed mainly
 via bank credit. It is worth noting that
 a move to an even more market
-financed sy
stem can be 
observed 
in the U
nited 
States
, where the share of bank 
financing in
 total
 NFC external financing f
ell to 25% in 
the period 
from 
2002 to 
early 201
6, down from 40% in 
the pre
-2009 period.
22 












These are outlined below.
                                                                    22  
In terms of notional stocks, the shares of 
bank 
loans (not corrected for loan sales and securitisation)
 in 
NFC total external financing (net of intra
-sectoral loans, unquoted shares and other equity issued, 
financial derivatives and ot
her accounts payable) stood at 3
5.4
% in the euro area in the first quarter of 
2016 
(down from 41
.3% 
in the fourth quarter of 2008
), 
while the respective share of debt securities 
issued
 stood at
 10.1% (up from 6.5%) and that of
 quoted shares issued
 at
 29.9
% (
broadly unchanged 
from
 29.7%).

 30 1. A protracted period of weakness in bank lending.
 The net flow of finance from 
banks to NFCs contracted in 2009 and 2010, and again between 2012 and 
2014, refl
ecting 
both credit demand and 
supply 
factors, including stricter 
regulation and supervision (see Chart B). To the extent that credit supply 
restrictions 
were binding, NFCs were forced to find alternative sources of 
financing. 
Notwithstanding a recovery in 
bank lending to NFCs since late 2014, 
net credit flows remain rather low, implying an ongoing fall in the share of bank 
credit
 against the background of a strengthening in NFCs™ overall external 

financing.

2. Relatively robust bond issuance activity of NFCs.
 Partly to compensate for the 
decline in bank lending but also reflecting increasingly favourable market
-financing conditions
, NFCs 
substantially
 increased their net issuance of debt 
securities, especially between 2009 and mid
-2014.23 Though
 NFCs™
 bond issuance activity has been less vibrant since mid
-2014, it remains above pre
-crisis levels
, 
as suggested by
 the
 most recent 
data 
on issuance activity 
for 
the 
second quarter of 
2016, further supported by t
he ECB™s new corporate sector 
purchase programme (CSPP) announced on 10 March 2016 (see Box 2 in this 

issue of the Economic Bulletin)
 and record
-low corporate bond yields
. The 
nominal cost of market
-based debt stood at 1.45% in mid

 (percentages per annum)

ynch, ECB, ECB calculations. 
 Notes: 
The overall cost of financing for NFCs is calculated as a weighted average of the cost of bank lending, the cost of market
-based 
debt and the cost of equity, based on their respective amounts outstanding derived from the euro area accounts. 
The latest 
observation for o
verall cost and lending rates 
is for
 May 2016
 and the latest observation for the cost of market
-based debt and cost of 
quoted equity 
is 20 July 2016. 
 3. Rising importance of non
-MFI
s 
in financial intermediation.
 L
ending from non
-MFIs
24 to NFCs has increased since the crisis, which 
has 
also mitigated the 
effect of 
weak
 bank credit.
25 In recent years, the 
vigorous
 developments in non
-MFI loans have mainly 
reflected
 an increase in loans granted by financing 
special purpose entities (
SPEs
) 
to their parent company
, financed by the 
issuance of debt securities by these subsidiaries. Financing SPEs are typically 
resident
 in 
a different
 euro area country 
from
 the parent company or outside the 
euro area to benefit from a favourable tax regime and financial technology.
 Hence, the observed robust developments in loans from foreign entities in 

recent quarters most likely also mirror the increasing levels of bond issuance by 
firms through their subsidiaries located outside the euro area.
 4. Higher
 recourse to intra
-sectoral financing.
 NFCs also significantly increased 
their recourse to trade credit and intra
-sectoral loans between mid
-2010 and the 
end of 2012 to mitigate the negative impact of lower credit
 supply on the 
availability of external financing. At the same time, during the crisis firms 
financed a larger share of their activities with internally generated funds and 
                                                                    24  
Non
-MFI loans consist of loans from 
other financial inst
itutions (
OFIs
) and
 insurance corporations and 
pension funds (
ICPFs
). Loans from OFIs include loans from financial vehicle corporations established 
to be holders of securitised loans originated by banks, financing 
special purpose entities, financial 
leasin
g companies, venture capital corporations, development capital companies and holding 
companies. Loans from ICPFs cover, inter alia, loans granted directly to finance construction projects, 

purchases of securitised loans to investment portfolios and 
possibl
y 
participation in syndicated loans.

 32 higher retained earnings. This development has moderated debt financing 
growth and has helped to stabilise gross indebtedness. Moreover, NFCs have 
continued to park a significant part of their retained earnings in liquid assets. 
The current record
-high liquidity buffers should improve firms™ shock absorption 
capacity.
 






A more diversified funding structure of firms may render them more resilient 
to shocks hitting the ban
king system
. It also diversifies the channel through which 
monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy. This has been reflected in the 

ECB™s monetary policy, which has included a wide range of instruments to inject 

additional stimulus in recent year
s. A stronger role of non
-MFIs in financial 
intermediation may accelerate monetary policy transmission as some non
-MFIs may 
adjust their risk exposures more 
flexibly
 than banks in response to changes in the 
business and financial cycles. However, it 
remain
s 
to be seen whether the current 
trend towards a more market
-based
 financing pattern for the real economy will 
continue once bank lending has fully recovered. In the past, a sustained growth in 

NFC external financing has always coincided with stronger bank
 loan dynamics.
 The 
EU has launched several initiatives to improve firms™ access to risk capital and 

market
-based financing. It is, however, too early to say to what extent these 
initiatives will be successful in reducing dependence, particularly of SMEs, on bank 

credit.

26

The CSRs are embedded in the
 European 
Semester of policy coordination, which ensures that Member States discuss their 
economic and budgetary plans with their EU partners throughout the year. They put 
into practice the commitment to regard national economic policies as a matter of 
com
mon concern in a monetary union, as also stipulated in Article 121 of the Treaty 
on the Functioning of the European Union. CSRs provide tailored reform 
recommendations to individual Member States on how to enhance growth and 
resilience while maintaining so
und public finances.
27 The timely implementation of 
these recommendations is critical to reduce the high unemployment rates and boost 
low potential growth in euro area countries. It will also make the euro area more 
resilient to adverse shocks and therefore
 ensure the smooth functioning of EMU as 
a 
whole.

 In November 2015 the European 
Commission released its Annual Growth Survey and Alert Mechanism Report. While 
the Annual Growth Survey identified the main policy priorities for the EU as a whole, 

the Alert Mechanism Report assessed developments in Member States to establish 
whether there were emerging imbalances or existing imbalances which needed to be 
corrected through targeted policy actions. On the basis of these documents, the EU 

Council approved recommendations for the euro area early in 2016, setting
 out the 
main areas for reform for EMU as a whole. The euro area CSRs published on 
1 
February 2016 called for remaining imbalances to be corrected, labour market 

rigidities to be addressed, product market competition to be strengthened, and 
framework conditions to be enhanced in particular through improvements in 
insolvency proceedings for businesses and households, not least with a view to 

facilitating a reduction in non
-performing loans. On 18 May the Commission provided 
Member States with the draft 2016 CSRs. Following discussions in the respective 
EU committees, the EU Council
 adopted 
the final CSRs on 12 July.
 





28 The Commission 
found
 in February this year that
 for the
 overwhelming 
majority of
 2015 reform 
recommendations (more than 90%)
 there ha
d 
been only 
ﬁsomeﬂ or ﬁlimitedﬂ progress with implementation, while 
only
 a small number of 
recommendations
 had 
been ﬁsubstantiallyﬂ or ﬁfullyﬂ implemented.
 Moreover, this 
weak implementation of structural reforms constitutes a deterioration, following 
already disappointing experiences with national CSR compliance in previous years. 

The insufficient implementation of 
CSR
s 
is all the more concerning given remaining 
rigidities and vulnerabilities in euro area countries, as reflected in, among other 

things, the Commission
™s finding that an
 increasing number of countries 
have
 excessive
 imbalances
29. 
 

The 2015 
CSRs were streamlined by the Commission with a view to allow
ing
 Member States 
to focus on
 key priority issues of macroeconomic and social relevance. However, 

despite this measure, implementation did
 not improve,
 as noted above. This year
™s recommendations have been further reduced, even for most countries with 
excessive imbalances. 
 


 Across Member States the Commission has 

significantly increased the number of CSRs addressing the need for policies to 
support investment through the enhancement of framework conditions, for example 
by improving the business environment and increasing the
 effectiveness of the 
                                                                    28

 35 frameworks for non
-performing loan resolution. The latter will be particularly 
important for countries with high levels of private sector indebtedness, where a 
quicker resolution of non
-performing loans should help viable firms to invest again. 
Chart A shows a breakdown of the 2016 CSRs by reform area. It indicates that in 
many countries a large share of recommendations address bottlenecks in framework 
conditions, which include all measures related to the regulatory environment, the 
judicial system, insolvency frameworks, housing policy and financial sector 
regulation. Such bottlenecks negatively affect market entry, reduce incentives for 

firms to invest and hamper resource reallocation.
 




 While important labour market 
reforms were undertaken in the past, in particular in the 

countries which had been most affected by the financial 

and sovereign debt crises, the resilience of labour 
markets across euro area countries remains limited and 
unemployment high.
30 Against this background, and 
given the limited implementation of the labour market 
CSRs which have now been dropped, continuing r
eform 
efforts with regard to the labour market appear 
warranted.
31 




In the 20
15 CSRs, the Commission excluded certain policy areas 

which were already covered by other monitoring 

channels.
32 These included the energy sector (which is 
covered in the context of the energy union) and the monitoring and enforcement 

mechanisms related to the Single Market. It remains essential, however, that 
developments and policies in these areas are also monitored in the context of the 
European Semester to ensure that all significant economic policies implemented by 
Member States are assessed in a holistic manner.

 The layers of the global financial
 safety net: taking stock
 1 Introduction
 



In debates about global 
financial stability, policymakers and academics often refer to the global financial 

safety net, understood as a set of institutions and mechanisms which provide 

financial support to prevent a crisis and financial support to countries hit by a crisis, 
both facilitating adjustment at the country level and preventing the crisis from 
spreading further. A crisis can be of domestic or external origin and it can take many 

different forms. A balance of payments crisis occurs when a nation is unable to pay 
for essential imports or service its external debt. In some cases, balance of 
payments problems can be compounded by a sharp exchange rate depreciation and 

a currency crisis. Financial crises stem from insolvent or illiquid financial institutions, 
and fiscal crises are caused by excessive fiscal de
ficits and debt levels. The GFSN 
can contribute to preventing and mitigating the effects of such crises. However, the 
GFSN has not been established in one single process and does not have a coherent 
design. The elements of the GFSN are diverse, have different origins, follow different 
rules and incentives, and help in addressing different types of crises. Foreign 

exchange reserves, central bank swap and repo lines, funding by regional financing 
arrangements (RFAs) and
 international financial institutions are considered t
he key 
elements of the GFSN
. 


 Owing to 
high levels of economic and financial interconnectedness
, 
contagion is a regular 
characteristic of crisis
 episodes. 
Challenges in one 
country
 often do not stay 
confined within that country
™s borders, but tend to
 spread through
 various channels 
across countries. Therefore, by providing a country with 
ﬁfinancial 
breathing space
ﬂ, 
the GFSN not only limits the economic slowdown and provides a window of 

opportunity to implement reforms needed for a quick return to economic stability and 
growth, but also limits spillovers to other economies and thereby contributes to 
global financial stability, in turn supporting
 financial integration and globalisation
.33                                                                     33

The design of 
some of its elements has been influenced by domestic or regional rather than global 

concerns and is, hence, not the result of an ex ante widely shared consensus at the 
international level. 
 



 The global financial crisis has also highlighted the 
continued relevance of the GFSN for advanced economies. One of the most 

important challenges for both EMEs and advanced e
conomies is capital flow 
volatility, which has remained elevated since the onset of the global financial crisis 

(IMF, 2016a
34). At the same time, the GFSN had not kept up with financial 
globalisation and the increasing size of capital flows, and the expansi
on of its 
elements has not been even (IMF, 2016b
35). 


  Emerging markets remain concerned about persistent financial market volatility given 

that monetary policies in advanced economies may diverge for some time in the 

future.
36 While there is overall agreement on the need for sound domestic policies 
and frameworks as a first line of defence, views differ on the need for b
etter 

coverage of the GFSN and the appropriate size of the GFSN both in terms of the 

types of instruments available to specific countries and in terms of the amount of 

resources available to address crises.
 




 Section 2 of this article recalls the key role played by 

domestic policies, Section 3 then reviews the elements of the GFSN, Section 4 

dis
cusses the scope for interaction between them and the final section draws some 
conclusions.
 2 The role of sound domestic policies
 



 Analysing effects of both real and 
financial shocks faced by IMF members
, Becker et al. (2006) conclude that countries 
                                                                    34

While some advanced economies
™ central banks have started the normalisation of their monetary 
policy, the interest rate path signalled by other advanced economies
™ 
central banks does not point to an 
imminent normalisation of their
 monetary policies. During previous episodes of such constellations of 
monetary policy, capital outflows from emerging markets increased (for example, when some advanced 
economies signalled an impending normalisation of monetary policy and later on embarke
d on a 

normalisation path, following a period of general loosening of monetary policy across advanced 

economies after the onset of the global financial crisis).

 38 can
 self
-insure against shocks through their own policies and institutions.
37 Kawai 
(2009) summari
ses the policy lessons
 from the Asian and global financial crises
 for 
preventing and reducing the risk of systemic crises 
as (i) establishing
 effective 
financial regulation and supervision to monitor and act on economy
-wide systemic 
risk
, (ii) adopt
ing
 sound macroeconomic management (monetary, fiscal, exchange 
rate and public debt
) 
and (
iii) maintain
ing
 sustainable current account and capital 
account positions.
38 Similarly, Lane and Milesi
-Ferretti (2011) find that the pre
-crisis 
development
s in the ratio of private credit to GDP, 
the 
current account deficit and
 the 
degree of
 openness to trade are helpful in understanding the intensity of the 
global 
financial crisis
 in 2008
-09.39 Such empirical findings are in line with the notion that 
crises 
stemming from the build
-up of macroeconomic or financial imbalances can be 
avoided in the first place by maintaining strong fundamentals, that is by "keeping 
one™s house in order". 
 



 For instance, 
during the recent 
global financial crisis
, pre
-existing domestic policy frameworks and 
subsequent actions by national authorities were key to mitigate adverse crisis 

effects
. In particular
, EME
s™ 
resilience to the deterioration in external funding 
conditions was stronger than in previous crises. 
Owing
 to reforms 
including 
fiscal 
rules to promote countercyclical polic
ies,
 central bank independence
 to underpin low 
and stable inflation
, and better debt management to limit the impact of devaluations 
on government balance sheets, countries were able to 
display
 a more 
resilient
 macroeconomic environment
. By loosening monetary and fiscal policies
, they
 supported
 financial and economic stability. More flexible exchange rate regimes 

helped a number of countries to diminish the impact of external shocks on the 

domestic economy, while the resilience of financial sectors in some economies had 
been improved through better regulation.
 Countercyclical macroprudential measures 
applied in a few 
EMEs
 to limit credit growth also contributed to the containment of 
the 
negative externalities of 
the 
credit crunch. 
 


 Capital flow
 reversals
 may be difficult to weather by relying on flexible 
domestic frameworks, such as a flexible exchange rate, alone. In addition, sudden 
economic adjustments may have
 a negative effect on long
-term growth or
 may affect 
some parts of the population disproportionately. 
The GFSN 
therefore provide
s 
countries 
with complementary support to address a crisis, while also helping to 
address
 crisis spillovers 
to other countries
.                                                                     37

 39 3 The different layers of the global 
financial
 safety net
 







 First, 
the layers of the GFSN may induce ex ante moral hazard in that countries may 

invest less in good policymaking and creditors may lend imprudently to vulnerable 

countries (thereby increasing their own vulnerability), in the expectation that support 
will be provided in the event of a crisis. Second, the layers of the GFSN may 
promote ex post moral hazard in that they may induce crisis
-hit countries to delay 
needed adjustment. Therefore, the GFSN needs to be designed in such a way as to 

encourage and support the implementation of sound domestic policies. 
 



 As the layers of the GFSN have 
developed independently and at different speeds, the extent of and approaches to 
limiting moral hazard in the provision of emergency liquidity differ among the 
elements of the GFSN, depending on their purpose and set
-up. Hence, this section 
gives an overview of how the different elements of the GFSN address moral hazard. 

Moreover, it provides some evidence on their effectiveness. 
 3.1
 International reserves
 


 A country
™s international reserve position comprises official foreign currency and gold 
reserves as well as claims on international financial institutions that can be rapidly 

converted into foreign exchange reserves such as claims on
 the IMF or special 
drawing right (SDR) holdings. Foreign assets accumulated beyond a certain level 

can also be transferred to sovereign wealth funds and employed as reserve 
complements to
 meet external shocks
.40 Foreign currency
 reser
ves comprise 
external 
assets generally controlled by national monetary authorities and include 
foreign currency
-denominated banknotes, deposits and
 marketable securities
. With a
 total value of 
USD
 11 trillion at
 end-2015, 
foreign exchange
 reserves constitute the 
largest component of the GFSN. Th
e 
dominance of foreign exchange 
reserves 
is often
 attributed to the holder
™s independence 
in the usage of 
this source
 of foreign 
currency liquidity. 
                                                                     40  
Although 
they are 
not 
considered part of the GFSN, sovereign wealth funds 
are also domestic sources 
of reserves and play an important role in macroeconomic management and global 
financial stability. 
Lam and Rossi (2010) argue that sovereign wealth funds
 can facilitate a more efficient allocation of 
resources across countries
, enhance market depth and liquidity, including at times of financial stress
, and 
play a stabili
sing role in
 global financial markets, particularly because most of them are long
-term 
investors with mainly unleveraged positions
 (see Lam
, 
R. and
 Rossi
, 
M., 
ﬁSovereign wealth funds
: investment strategies and financial distress
ﬂ, Journal of Derivatives & Hedge Funds
, 
Vol. 15
(4
), 2010). 
Moreover, sovereign wealth funds aim to provide insurance for the budget and the economy against 
commodity price volatility and external shocks. For a detailed discussion, see

™s reserve holdings just before the 
global financial crisis 
relative to 
its
 predicted holdings based on financial motives can
 significantly predict 
exchange rate movements of both emerging and advanced
 economies
 in 2008. 
Adequat
e levels of international reserves are generally associated with a lower 
probability of sudden stops
43 and lower borrowing costs, most likely via the signalling 
channel.
 Fernandez
-Arias and
 Levy
-Yeyati (2012) find that during
 the Lehman 
Brothers episode 
a h
igher reserves
-to
-foreign
 debt ratio predicted a lower increase in
 sovereign bond
 spreads over a cross
-section of emerging markets.
44 Hur and Kondo 
(2003)
45 confirm that international reserves are negatively associated with sudden 
stops in addition to debt default, banking crises and currency crises. Therefore, 

market participants closely monitor 
the 
level of reserves as an indicator of the 
soundness of an ec
onomy.
 These results indicate that during cris
is episodes 
international reserves act as a buffer and help to reduce macroeconomic and 
financial volatility. 
 



 The former include 
maintaining confidence in the domestic currency, smoothing periods of extreme 
volatility 
through interventions in foreign exchange markets or addressing market 
dysfunctions
. Non-precautionary motives 
include the support of 
monetary policy, 
the 
inter
-generational transfer of national assets or the pursuit of 
export
-led
 growth 
policies
 via a competitive exchange rate
. 
Ghosh et al. (2012)
, 
investigating dominant 
drivers of reserve accumulation 
between
 1980 and 2010, conclude that 
the relative 
importance of these determinants has shifted over time.
46 According to their results
, insurance against capital
 account shocks and currency undervaluation with 
mercantilist motives have been predominant factors in reserve accumulation. 
By 
contrast, according to 
the 
IMF Survey of Reserve Managers
47 the main motives for 
building up 
international reserves are 
constituting buffer
s 
against liquidity needs and 
smoothing exchange rate volatility

 One of the main drivers of 
th
is trend 
was th
at EMEs
 recogni
sed the self
-insurance 
benefits of reserves in view of higher capital flow 

volatility. 
Aizenman and Marion (2003) identify 
such 
precautionary demand for reserves as a cause of 
increasing
 international reserves in East Asia following 
the Asian crisis.
48 Also
 Bastourre et al. (2009)
 confirm
 the significance of precautionary determinants of 
international reserve accumulation 
by EMEs.
49 





 Throughout
 the 
global financial crisis, many central 
banks took action against the collapse in 
cross
-border 
funding
 and provided foreign currency to their domestic foreign exchange markets
 by 
drawing on reserves
. 
However, the marginal benefit of using reserves declines as 
they are depleted. A swift fall or a continuous depletion of international reserves can 

send negative signals to the markets about the sustainability of 
domestic 
cris
is mitigation policies. In fact, national authorities
 may not want to use their foreign 
exchang
e reserves beyond a certain level
. 
Aizenman and Sun (2009) capture this 
concern about
 losing 
international reserves in their analysis of reserve usage 
by EMEs 
during the 
global financial crisis
.50 This concern can be explained by the 
motivation of EMEs to maintain similar reserve benchmark ratios to peer countries. A 

decline in reserve indicators b
eyond peer country averages might increase investors
™ 
risk aversion towards the country and also its vulnerability to deleveraging and 
sudden stops. 
 



. The financial costs 
arise as a result of the likely negative differential between the 
returns on the international reserves and the yields
 paid on domestic sterili
sation 
instruments
51. 
In addition, excessive reserve accumulation 
may 
entail inefficiencies
                                                                     48

 42 and distortions
 at the 
regional and global levels, e.g. via misaligned exchange rates 
and global imbalances
52. 





 The traditional reserve 
adequacy benchmarks utilise import coverage, short
-term external debt and the broad money stock in the 

econ
omy.
53 In Chart 2, these three rules of thumb are 
translated into one simple indicator, which is the equally 
weighted average of all three. A reserve adequacy ratio 
higher than one indicates that the country
™s foreign 
exchange reserves are more than the average amount 
implied by the most
 commonly
 used benchmarks
 (i.e. 
three months of imports, 100% of short
-term debt and 
20% of M2).
54 There are also many model
-based 
adequacy measures. Among them, the IMF
™s Assessing 
Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric is designed to
 measure balance of payments
-related vulnerabilities and is calibrated according to 
the relative frequency of different shocks as well as country characteristics such as 
the exchange rate regime and the existence of capital controls
55.In general, only 
count
ries with managed exchange rate regimes require sufficient levels of 

international reserves to manage the effects of capital outflows
 on their currencies
. 



. While 
excessive reserve accumulation can create negative externalities, adequate holdings 
of reserves for precautionary purposes are an essential element of a country
™s safety 
net. However, it would be inefficient and, from a global perspective, undesirable for 
each country to be fully self
-insured against large external liquidity shocks by foreign 
exchange reserves only since this can lead to large social costs and the 

aforementioned imbalances and distortions. Therefore, other layers of the GFSN 

providing elements of joint insurance are useful complements, which can reduce the 
costs at the level of countries seeking insurance as well as distortions and side 
effects of excessive reserve accumulation.
                                                                     52  
The discussion about 
ﬁglobal imbalances
ﬂ 
refers to the notion that large current deficits in some parts of 
the world are funded by surplus countries with an undervalued exchange rate. This constellation may 
not be sustainable over the longer term, in particular as it may also lead to distortions in asset markets 

via purchases of safe assets by reserve
-accumulating countries. Since their
 peak in 2006, global 
imbalances in terms of flows have narrowed, however (
World Economic Outlook
, IMF, 2014, Chapter 
4).
 53  
Three
 months of import
s 
and 100% short
-term debt coverage 
are
 indicators of vulnerability against an 
external finance shortage. 
The M2 
coverage 
ratio takes into account an internal drain
 on external 
financing which is driven by domestic investors.
 As a rule of thumb
, 
20% of domestic financial liabilities 
(M2) that could potentially be converted into foreign currency are used as a b
enchmark to assess the 
adequacy of the level of reserves in the event
 of a 
domestic sudden stop. See Jeanne, O.,

ﬂ, Brookings Papers 
on Economic Activity
, Vol. 1, 2007, pp. 1

An indicator below one does not necessarily imply that a country does not have a sufficient level of 

foreign exchange reserves.

 Central bank swap
 and repo lines
 



. 
A central bank swap line is an arrangement between 
central
 banks which combines two transactions
: a spot transaction between 
a 
central 
bank 
issuing
 one currency 
and a 
central bank issuing another currency for a fixed 
term and a reverse transaction at maturity applying the exchange rate used in the 
spot transaction. During the term between the transactions, the central bank 
that
 requested the activation of the swap (the receiving central bank) pays a fee to the 

liquidity
-providing central bank and can use the foreign currency liquidity to lend it 
to 
its domestic fi
nancial sector
. 
Although the conditions of swap agreements are 
designed to protect the balance sheets of both central banks 
involved
, the
 risk that 
one of them may not be in a position to honour
 its commitment
 has to be taken into 
account. To mitigate this
 risk
, the receiving central bank pledges its own currency or 
other 
assets as collateral to the 
liquidity
-providing central bank
. 
 






 Throughout economic history, swap
-type agreements between monetary authorities
 have been used for a multitude of 
purposes
, such as 
supporting foreign 
exchange rate policies, 
managing ass
ets and 
liabilities, promoting 
the 
international use of currencies, facilitating the functioning of 
financial markets 
and ensuring
 financial stability.
 In the course of the recent global 
financial crisis, central bank swap lines have been utilised with the
 aim
 of mitigating
 possible negative spillovers from a
 deterioration in international funding conditions 
to
 financial stability and 
the 
real economy within and across 
countries
. 



 Goldberg et al. (2011)
56 find that the 
US 
dollar swap 
lines among central banks were effective 
in reducing
 US dollar funding pressures 
abroad and stress in money markets. They conclude that the 
US 
dollar central bank 
swap facilit
ies are an important part of 
the
 toolbox for dealing with systemic liquidity 
disruptions. Coffey et al. (2009)
57 also conclude that Fed swap line announcements 
and actual operations 
are
 effective in reducing global institutions
™ 
US 
dollar funding 
liquidity 
risk. Overall, the effectiveness of a swap line depends on the credibility of 

the commitment to provide sufficient foreign currency liquidity in a timely manner and 

a pricing policy that hinder
s 
opportunistic bidding
. 



 After 2007 central banks in advanced economies set up swap 
lines in response to the international financial crisis both among themselves and with 
some emerging econo
mies. 
In particular, US dollar liquidity provided by 
the Federal 
Reserve swap lines helped to restrain funding stress in major advanced financial 
                                                                    56

 44 markets at the peak of the crisis. While most of the short
-term liquidity

established between advanced and emerging economies

or been
 terminated, the swap 
arrangements
 between
 the European Central 
Bank
58, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, 
the 
Bank of 
Japan and the Swiss National Bank evolved 
into an unlimited
 and standing (i.e. 
open-ended) 
bilateral swap network. The rest of the existing swap lines have pre
-set 
limits
. 





 Since 2009 the People™s Bank of China 
has rapidly expanded its swap line network and 
in 
February 2016 it h
ad 
31 active swap lines amount
ing
 to 
USD
 500 billion
.59 Although
 a 
core motivation of 
the 
Chinese swap
 line
s is 
often
 to 
support bilateral trade 
and investment with the countries that are part of its 

swap line network,
 they can also be used to address 
finan
cial stability challenges and foreign exchange 
liquidity shortages. 
When renmi
nbi swap lines are used 
to
 address reserve currency shortages
, there 
are
 additional costs associated 
with
 the conversion of 
renmi
nbi 
into the 
respective
 reserve currency.
  






Swap lines are not substitutes for other 
elements of the safety net. In fact, they are instruments designed to 
help address 
currency mismatch
-related stress in financial markets rather than funds that can be 
used to 
finance balance
 of payments imbalances. 
 








 The central bank swap lines can in principle be unlimited in size and have 
no commitment costs at the initiation of the lines. As the experience during the global 

financial crisis suggests, swap lines can not only help to mitigate funding liquidity 

strains in the respective market segment, but can also contribute to global financial
 stability via the confidence channel. However, owing to the domestic mandates of 

the liquidity
-providing central banks, the country coverage of swap lines is limited. In 
the case of the ECB and the Eurosystem, the provision of euro liquidity via swap or 
repo lines depends on: (i) the existence of exceptional circumstances characteri
sed by significant euro liquidity needs as a result of serious market dysfunctions
; (ii) the 
                                                                    58

 Financing by international financial institutions 
 

 With 189 member countries,
 the 
IMF
 is the most 
comprehensive and largest provider of liquidity insurance. Its special role with regard 
to the overall functioning of the GFSN is enshrined in 
its Articles of Agreement. The 
latter define its primary purpose as being to ensure the stability of the international 
monetary system.
 The IMF does this through various activities that help countries 
prevent and address crises
, notably by
: (i) advising co
untries in the context of 
surveillance and 
promoting
 sound policies as a first line of defence; (ii) warding off 
crises through the provision of access to liquidity resources under its lending 
policies, including via precautionary lines; (iii) providing financial assistance in a 
crisis subject to appropriate conditionality as necessary
, to overcome balance of 

payments problems; and (iv) preventing moral hazard through appropriate access 

requirements and conditionality
.60  


 First, IMF 
programmes help countries to stop a crisis from spreading further (e.g. Papi et al., 
2015). Second, IMF programmes can act as a cat
alyst for re
-attracting private 
investors
 (Bordo et al., 2005; Mody and Saravia, 2006; Morris and Shin
, 2006).61 Third, IMF programmes can also help to prevent future capital flow reversals and 
crises (e.g. Eichengreen et al.
, 2008)
.  





 Potential demand for IMF resources has risen 
with the growing integration of EMEs into the global economy and heightened risks 

of cross
-border spillovers also among advanced economies, as was amply 
demonstrated during the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis led to 
increased resource needs among IMF members. To cope with its task,
 the IMF
™s resources were boosted (IMF, 2016
b). I
n April 2009 the G20 agreed to increase the 
resources available to the IMF through expanded New Arrangements to Borrow 
                                                                    60  
The resources available for the IMF
™s lending function currently am
ount to approximately USD
 1 trillion, 
which makes the IMF the largest single provider of liquidity insurance (see IMF, 2016
b), although in 
terms of actual disbursements the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has topped the IMF in recent 
years. In addition,
 the IMF
 can allocate 
SDRs
 to supplement existing reserves in line with its Articles of 
Agreement.

by up to USD 500 billion
 as part of a global plan for recovery. In 2010 the 
membership agreed on a quota reform to double the IMF
™s paid
-in resources 
permanently, which however only came into effect in January 2016. In the interim 

period, the IMF received pledges for bilateral loans of more than USD
 400 billion 
from some of its members to temporarily supplement permanent resources. In 
addition, a new SDR allocation of USD 250 billion was agreed to provide the 
membership with liquidity to address the crisis. 
 







 The IMF
™s Articles of Agreement emphasise the need to adopt policies on the use of 
its general resources that will 
help
 members to solve their balance of payments 
problems in a manner consistent with the 
IMF
™s provisions
 and the need to 
safeguard IMF resources. Therefore, the IMF provides loans only conditional on 
good policies which also ensure the repayment capacity of the borrower.
 62 While 
conditionality has been helpful to address members
™ 
balance of payments problems 
and to prevent moral hazard (e.g. Jeanne and Zettelmeyer
, 200163), 
some countri
es 
also experienced social unrest or adverse financial market reactions related to the 
specific conditionality of the programme (e.g. Vreeland
, 2007
64). There have been 
concerns that due to these experiences some countries may be reluctant to 
approach the IMF for support. 
 


 (e.g. Vreeland
, 2007). If a country 
delays asking the IMF for assistance, its mounting problems may lead to contagion 
to other countries, the need for a larger resource envelope when it finally does 
approach the IMF (making a greater demand on IMF resources) and the need for a 
greater reform effort 
by the country (
increasing
 the likelihood of a political backlash). 
Moreov
er, reluctance to rely on the IMF as the global layer of the GFSN may lead to 
an inefficient stockpiling
 of 
national foreign exchange 
reserves. 
                                                                     62  
The need to ensure that the IMF is repaid is enshrined in Article 1(v) of its Articles of Agreement. IMF 
resources are typically safeguarded by ensuring the repayment capacity of a member through setting 

conditions either for the qual
ification to obtain a loan (ex ante conditionality) or the release of tranches 
against evidence of compliance with an agreed set of conditions (ex post conditionality). In other words, 

loans are provided only to conditionally solvent countries
. 
Conditions 
are jointly agreed between a 
member and the IMF upon the request from the member to access a loan and prior to the IMF 

Executive Board
™s approval.
 63  
Jeanne and Zette

 provide 
a broad interpretation of moral hazard as being
 not only taking risks 
with
 the money of the global
 taxpayer (hence IMF lending needs to be paid back)

 also with that of 
the domestic taxpayer, who can eventually foot the bill 
for
 bad
 policies.

, 
IMF programme countries experienced large capital outflows when 
recommended policies were not as

For example, in Indonesia, the IMF

ency. The 
bank restructuring without deposit guarantees led to bank runs and capital outflows

(e.g. IMF, 2009; 2014a; 2014b
65). The 
enhanced Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PL
L) 

have been designed to shield countries with sound fundamentals from liquidity crises 

caused by external 
contagion.
66 Both facilities 
requ
ire the fulfilment of
 certain pre
-qualification criteria (ex ante conditionality) and entail no
 (FCL)
 or streamlined 
(PLL) 
ex post conditionality
. 
As they can be requested (and used) in the absence of actual 
balance of payments pressures
 and only entail 
an IMF
 commitment to provide 
financing if the member so requires (not necessarily actual disbursements), they 

should be less costly in political terms than the IMF
™s standard programmes with 
elaborate conditionality requirements in terms of prior actions and
 performance 
criteria. However, the precautionary facilities have to date only been used by five 
countries.
  



 In the view of many EMEs, the IMF
™s governance structure is overly influenced by 
advanced country considerations, even after the 2010 quota review (IMF, 2015). 
 



 EMEs may be tempted to rely also on financing provided by other international 

financial institutions which may be perceived as imposing less stringent conditions. 

In addition to the traditional project
-driven support by the World Bank (mainly to 
developing and emerging economies), regional development banks provide funding 

for structural purposes, particularly infrastructure development, including the 

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and, most recently, the New Development Bank (NDB) of 
the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the Asian 

Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The BRICS countries have also set up their 
own Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) for mutual financial support.

 RFAs exist in many, 
though not all, regions of the world (see Chart 4). Some 
RFAs have been in place for a long time, while others 
have been established only more recently in response 

to the global financial crisis. 
The ﬁolder
ﬂ 
RFAs,
 such as 
the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF)
,68 founded in 1976
, and 
the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR)
,69 which 
emerged in 1989, have
 more than three decades of 
lending experience.
 The Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), an 

agreement to provide bilateral swap lines, was set up in 

response to East Asia™s perceived need to develop a 
regional mechanism after the 1997
-98 financial crisis 
(see Sussangkarn, 2011
70). 
The CMI
™s successor, 
the 
Chiang
 Mai 
Initiative 
Multilateralisation (CMIM)
 Agreement
,71 and the European facilities (
the temporary 
European Financial 
Stabilisation Mechanism, 
EFSM
, and 
European Financial Stability Facility
, EFSF, 
and the permanent European Stability Mechanism, ESM) have been set up more 

recently to boost resources for crisis prevention and resolution.
 The lending 
capacities of RFAs differ substantially. For example, smaller RFAs have a lending 
capacity below USD
 10 billion, while the second largest RFA, the CMIM, and the 
largest RFA to date, the ESM, have total lending capacities of USD 240 billion and 
EUR 500 billion respectively. 
 


 Regarding 
their purpose and set
-up, most RFAs provide financial resources to members with 
balance of payments problems to address economic crises and prevent regional 

contagion. Some, but not all RFAs set conditions for macroeconomic adjustment 
before disbursin
g financing, such as 
the ordinary loan 
facility
 and the extended loan
 facility of the AMF or the loans provided by FLAR. Some RFAs link their assistance 
to conditions for IMF financial support
.72                                                                     68  
The Arab Monetary Fund
™s aim is to assist its non
-OPEC members. 
Members include Algeria, Bahrain, 
Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, O
man, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. 
 69  
FLAR was established as an extension of FAR (
the 
Andean Reserve Fund), which was set up 
in 1988
. Members include Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. See also

 (e.g. Ocampo and Titelman, 2009)
73. 
In addition, the limited number of RFA members can be an aid to quick decision
-making, which facilitates the timely disbursement of funds during a crisis. 
 

The resources of several RFAs are limited, which constrains the 
duration, magnitude and number of loans that the RFA can offer at any one time. 
Also, countries with a lower willingness to adjust or with larger adjustment needs as 
well as countries which perceive IMF support as politically costly may prefer RFA 
support. As a consequence, RFAs may become overburdened in a regional or 

protracted shock. To support RFAs in their vital role of providing regional crisis 

support, there is a strong case for strengthening them (e.g. Kawai, 2015
74). 


 In view of the existing links 
between some RFAs and the IMF, there seems to be scope for cooperation that 
provides support to RFAs, while avoiding ﬁfacility shoppingﬂ and an overburdening of 
RFAs. In 2011 the G20 endorsed
 six principles for cooperation between the IMF and 
RFAs (see Box 1) which help to guide this process.
  

 G20 
Principles for Cooperation Between the IMF and Regional Financing Arrangements 
(15 October 2011)
 In November 2010 
the 
G20 Leaders requested that the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank 
Governors explore ﬁways to improve collaboration between RFAs and the IMF across all possible 
areasﬂ. Based on contributions by the EU and 
the
 ASEAN+3 countries that are members of the 
G20, the following non
-binding broad principles for cooperation 
were 
agreed. Also, collaboration 
with the IMF should be tailored to each RFA in a flexible manner in order to take account of region
-specific circumstances and the characteristics of RFAs.
 1. An enhanced cooperation between RFAs and the IMF would be a step forward toward better 
crisis prevention, more effective crisis resolution, and would reduce moral hazard. Cooperation 
between RFAs and the IMF should foster rigorous and even
-handed surveillance and promote 
the common goals of regional and global financial and monetary stability.
 2. Cooperation should respect the roles, independence and decision
-making processes of each 
institution, taking into account regional specificities in a flexible manner.
 3. While cooperation between RFAs and the IMF may be triggered by a crisis, ongoing 
collaboration should be promoted as a way to build regional capacity for crisis prevention.
                                                                     73

 50 4. Cooperation should commence as early as possible and include open sharing of information 
and joint
 missions where necessary. It is clear that each institution has comparative 
advantages and would benefit from the expertise of the other. Specifically, RFAs have better 
understanding of regional circumstances and the IMF has a greater global surveillance 
capacity.
 5. Consistency of lending conditions should be sought to the extent possible, in order to prevent 
arbitrage and facility shopping, in particular as concerns policy conditions and facility pricing. 
However, some flexibility would be needed as regards
 adjustments to conditionality, if 
necessary, and on the timing of the reviews. In addition, definitive decisions about financial 
assistance within a joint program should be taken by the respective institutions participating in 
the program.
 6. RFAs must respect the preferred creditor status of the IMF.

 3.4
 Interaction between the layers of the global financial safety net
 


The 
interaction between the safety net™s different layers needs to be based on their 
various purposes and operating features and the role which each element could and 
should fulfil. This section reviews these interactions.
 
As the global financial safety 
net has developed increasingly outside the IMF, partly through countries
™ 
self
-insurance activities and partly
 through the provision of financing by other bilateral or 
regional arrangements or institutions, the coordination ties within and between layers 
are limited. Especially since the global financial crisis, the
 GFSN 
has become more 
multi
-layered and more dive
rsified
 in part owing to differing objectives and set
-ups of 
the different elements. Hence, the coverage of the GFSN is not the same for each 

country.  At the same time, different purposes and rules also imply that there is only 

limited scope for substitutability between the layers of the GFSN.
 






 To avoid overburdening a single layer, the complementary use of certain 
other layers of the GFSN could be further explored. Attention should be paid
 to the 
ability of each element of the GFSN to achieve its general objectives, to 
its
 specific 
characteristics and 
to 
the ability of countr
ies
 to access each of these GFSN 
elements.
 In this context, it should be borne in mind that at the regional level
 there is 
not only 
a 
growing number and size of RFAs, but also an
 increase in 
the 
size and 
number of regional development banks that have 
the
 potential
 to
 offer 
complementary financial support.
 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 5 
/ 2016
 51 





 Effective crisis prevention is 
well
 served by the IMF 
through appropriate
 macroeconomic, financial
 and macroprudential
 policy 
surveillance.
 It is therefore essential that the incentive structure built into the 
qualification criteria of precautionary facilities supports strong policies, thereby giving 
traction to surveillance.
 Effective crisis resolution relies on the adequacy and efficient 
use of the IMF
™s resources. Maintaining a sufficient level of resources and utilising 
them in a judicious manner, including for precautionary purposes, is therefore 

essential for the IMF in fulfilling its stabilising role as the truly global layer of the 

GFSN. This 
stabilising role of the IMF would be enhanced by
 a deeper 
understanding and
 a reduction
 of the political cost
 for some countries 
associated 
with seeking
 the
 IMF
™s 
assistance
.  


This does not contradict the observation that the 

accumulation of precautionary reserves as a means of self
-insurance has served 
many countries well during crisis times. However,
 excessive reserve accumulation 
carries
 a cost 
and risks creating
 imbalances and systemic inefficiency. 
The
 cost of 
precautionary reserve accumulation varies across countries
 and needs to
 be weighed
 against the cost of having insufficient own reserves. Greater transparency 

with regard to the availability and cost of reserve accumulation by individual 

countries could play a useful role in this respec
t.
 




 Their establishment is a decision for central banks
 in line with their 
respecti
ve mandates
. 
In particular, there is no scope for liquidity provision from 
central banks to governments. Another consequence of the mandate
-based 
provision of these lines is that it is not possible for one entity 
Œ 
not even the IMF
 Œ 
to 
serve as
 coordinato
r of the provision of central bank swap lines.
 
. 
Some 
RFAs are now closer to being operational than prior to the global financial crisis, but 

as several infrastructures remain untested and may be overburdened in the event of 
a regional shock, closer cooperation between the IMF and RFAs, also outside crisis 
episodes, would be worth developing. RFAs are at very different stages of 

development and they vary widely in terms of their 
size, focus,
 and frequency and 
nature of lending. In addition, surveillance tools are still under development for many 

RFAs.
 Given the IMF
™s broad expertise in both surveillance and lending, closer 
cooperation between the IMF and RFAs deserves to be pursued, in partic
ular 
through advice and technical assistance to those RFAs which have not yet been 

tested. 
The G20 principles (see Box 1) are an adequate instrument to guide 

cooperation between the IMF and RFAs. The diversity of RFAs underscores the 
case for a tailored approach. The European experience of crisis resolution shows 
that there are also substantial benefits to be derived from the involvement of an RFA 
in stabilising a country and that RFAs may be complementary to IMF support.

 52 4 Conclusion
 














The various 
elements of the GFSN 
have been
 shaped by historical developments and they are all 
conceived
 to make a contribution to the maintenance of economic and financial 
stability 
by 
providing insurance
 and by 
supplying finance in crisis situations, as 
discussed in
 the previous sections. 
 







 However, the stabilising role of the IMF 
could b
e further 
enhanced by 
making 
the use of its facilities more timely and effective and by a continued evolution of its 
governance. 
While 
central bank 
swap
/repo
 lines 
have been
 highly successful in 
mitigating
 foreign exchange funding tensions, it should be 
emphasised 
that their 
usage has
 to be decided by
 central banks, in line with their respective mandates
, 
and they are hence not suited to coordination under a global umbrella such as the 
one offered by the IMF
. The other elements of the GFSN also have their o
bjectives 
and limitations. Given their considerable growth in the wake of the global financial 
crisis, a more heterogeneous landscape has emerged for the GFSN.
 One promising 
avenue to pursue is the strengthening of those RFAs that have not yet been tested,
 through advice and technical cooperation.
 





To prevent the evolving GFSN from developing in sub
-optimal directions, either because part of the resources are not available to certain 

countries or regions, or because the availability of resources creates greater room 

for moral hazard behaviour, a global stocktaking is warranted in the current post
-global financial crisis environment. Such a review
 should focus primarily on how to 
strengthen the role of the IMF as the truly global hub of the GFSN, given its universal 

membership. 
This stocktaking should not be conducted in isolation. Reforms which 
aim at containing demand for financial safety net resources should also be analysed 
more thoroughly. Recent efforts to strengthen global financial regulation and the 

sovereign debt restructuring framework, as well as the option to mobilise private 

sector liquidity support in a crisis
, are important elements in this rega
rd.

 53 New evidence on wage adjustment in 
Europe during the period 2010
-13 This article presents evidence from the third wave of the Wage Dynamics Network 
(WDN) survey, which was recently conducted in 25 
EU countries to assess how 
firms adjusted to the various shocks and labour market reforms that took place in the 
European Union during the period 2010
-13. The article focuses on wage rigidities 
and wage adjustment. The main results discussed can be summarised as follows: 
Downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) was prevalent in EU countries during the 
period 2010
-13. Nevertheless, its incidence was lower during the period 2010
-13 than during the first phase of the crisis (2008
-09). This resistance of firms to cut base 
wages 
Œ 
in favour of freezing them 
Œ 
contributed to a lower frequency of wage 
changes during the period 2010
-13 than in
 the period of economic stability prior to 
the crisis (2002
-07). The survey evidence also suggests that firms used 
cuts in 
bonuses
 as a substitute for cuts in base wage
s 
to adjust their wage costs. Finally, a 
substantial percentage of firms in the euro area countries that undertook wide labour 
market reforms found it easier to adjust both employment and wages in 2013 than in
 2010. 
 1 I
ntroduction 
 


 Understanding wage rigidities, their sources and their 
patterns is essential for conducting monetary policy and designing appropriate 
structural policies. Inertial wage behaviour is an important factor behind price 
stickiness in the euro area, as suggested by the findings of the Inflation Persistence 

Network (IPN), a Eurosystem research network analysing the features and 
determinants of price setting in the euro area.
75 Downward nominal wage rigidity 
(DNWR) 
Œ 
resistance to wage decreases
 Œ 
might have implications for the choice of 
the optimal rate of inflation. In the presence of DNWR, a positive rate of inflation is 

needed to facilitate the adjustment of relative (real) wages and thus ﬁgrease the 
wheels of the economyﬂ. Hence, an inflation rate which is too low could, in the 
                                                                    75

and the

These showed that inertial wage behaviour is an important factor behind price stickiness in the euro 
area and therefore a key determinant of monetar
y policy transmission. Further evidence of this 
relationship is provided for 17 EU countries in Druant et al., ﬁFirms™ price and wage adjustment in

 54 presence of DNWR, lead to long
-term unemploymen
t. 
Such considerations have 
generated a long
-standing debate in macroeconomics which goes back to Tobin.
76 The wage adjustment mechanism used by firms also plays a crucial role in the 
transmission of economic shocks. In fact, during the recent economic and 
financial 
crisis, the degree of wage flexibility determined, among other factors, the speed, 
nature and cost of adjustment in the presence of economic shocks.
77 In addition, 
identifying the sources of wage rigidities is essential to designing appropriate 

structural policies that facilitate adjustment to shocks.
78 More generally, wage 
flexibility is essential for the proper functioning of a multi
-country monetary union with 
segmented labour markets
, such as the euro area, where there is significant cross
-count
ry heterogeneity in labour market features and performance.
79 Indeed, with 
cross
-country differences in the ability of firms to adjust wages in response to 
shocks, a country exhibiting stronger rigidity will suffer from a loss of competitiveness 
relative to
 countries that have more flexible labour markets. 
 


 The WDN survey collects information that enables researchers to examine the effect 
on wages, employment and price adjustments of firms™ characteristics, the economic 

environment and the institutional features of the labour markets where the firms 
operate. The third wave of the WDN survey (WDN3) was recently
 conducted and 
covers the period 2010
-13. An important value added of the WDN3 survey is that it 
also collected information that can be used to evaluate the incidence of the various 
shocks and the relevance of recent labour market reforms that are deemed to affect 
labour market adjustments.
 



 The article is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the main 
features of the WDN survey. Section 3 briefly discusses certain features that underlie 
the cross
-country heterogeneity in wage rigidities and, more generally, in labour 
market performance in Europe during the period 2010
-13. Section 4 presents 

sty
lised facts on nominal wage rigidities, covering wage stickiness and the frequency 
of base wage changes (4.1), downward nominal wage rigidity (4.2) and the use of 
                                                                    76

 2 The WDN survey: sample and data
 



 It was
 launched by the Wage 
Dynamics Network, an ESCB research network focusing on identifying the sources 

and features of wage and labour cost dynamics that are most relevant for monetary 
policy.
80 The first wave of the WDN survey (WDN1) was carried out by 17 na
tional 
central banks (NCBs) between the end of 2007 and the first half of 2008. It collected 
information from a period of economic stability and relatively stable growth, namely 
2002-07. During summer 2009, ten NCBs conducted a more focused follow
-up surve
y, 
specifically 
with the
 aim of understanding firms™ reactions to the initial stage 
of the crisis (2008
-09). This was the second wave of the WDN survey (WDN2).
81 


The aim of the WDN3 survey 
was to assess recent labour market adjustments and firms™ reactions to the various 
shocks and labour market reforms that took place during the second phase of the 
crisis (2010
-13). 
This wave collected information from over 25,000 firms from the 
following sectors: manufacturing, energy, construction, trade and transportation, 
market services, financial intermediation and, for some countries, non
-market 
services
.82 By design, the sample is relatively balanced across firm size categories 
within each country and across the sectors considered. Its distribution closely follows 
the distribution of private employment in each country. However, the sample size 
varies across countries both in absolute terms and relative to the number of firms in 

each country. Thus, individual weights have been calculated for each firm to make 
the sample representative of the overall number of firms in each country and to 
account for the number of workers that the firm represents in a
 given country. 
 

 This feature has resulted in different questionnaires across 
waves. Coverage in terms of countries also varies across waves, as does the 

sam
ple of firms in each country. Thus the WDN surveys are not, strictly speaking, 
different waves of a panel, but have led to cross
-country datasets with ample 
geographical and sectoral coverage. The main advantage of conducting an ad
 hoc 

survey at the firm level is its flexibility. Firms can be asked directly about the features 

of their wage and price setting, their reactions to shocks or their perceptions of the 
effectiveness and impact of reforms 
Œ 
information that would otherwise be difficult to 
                                                                    80  The WDN, as such, was in operation from July 2006 until December 2009.
  
81  Fully harmonised WDN1 survey data is available for
 Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Ireland, 
Greece, 
Spain
, 
France,
 Italy, Lithuania,

here wages are concerned, surveys addressed to firms typically provide 
more accurate information than those addressed to households. Nevertheless, 
several shortcomings inherent in ad
 hoc surveys should be borne in mind, such as 
low response rates and potential misinterpretations of the questions. Moreover, 

responses may be influenced by the specific macroeconomic environment prevailing 

at the time of the survey.
 3 Cross
-country heterogeneity in the incidence of the crisis 
during 
the period 
2010
-13 
 The W
DN3 survey provides firm
-level information on several aspects that can be 
used to account for cross
-country heterogeneity in European labour markets and 
wage rigidities.
  
3.1
 The incidence of shocks 
 





The WDN3 survey provides detailed information on a variety of 
shocks that hit European firms during the period 2010
-13.
83 Chart 1 provides a brief 
overview of the incidence of shocks across countries; it displays the percentage of 
firms that reported a decrease (or strong decrease) in total demand and access to 
credit. On average, 36% of EU firms reported a fall in demand; in the euro area 42% 

of firms experienc
ed a fall in demand, while only 23% did so among non
-euro area 
firms. At the country level, 71% of firms in Greece and 59% in Cyprus reported 

facing a demand shock, in contrast to Estonia and the UK, where less than 18% of 

firms reported this kind of shock. Heterogeneity similarly emerges when focusing on 
credit shocks. While 66% of firms in Greece, 48% in Cyprus, 45% in Slovenia and 
about 39% in Spain report more restricted access to credit, this is the case for only 

around 5% of firms in Estonia and Malta, and 11% in Latvia. Interestingly, the 
volatility of demand, rather than the level, appears to be a concern among the Baltic 
States, which, during the period 2010
-13, were recovering from a large deterioration 
in the labour market.

When reporting the shocks, f
irms 
were asked to
 distinguish between domestic and external in the case 
of demand shocks, and between different financing methods (for financing new investment projects, 
refinancing, etc.) in the case o

were asked to provide 
information on 
the volatility of demand, customers™ ability to pay and the availability of supplies.

 3.2
 Collective wage bargaining in Europe 
 

 Theoretical literature assigns an important role in wage adjustment and wage rigidity 

to wage bargaining institutions, and an extensive body of empirical literature 

attempts to quantify this role. Such quantification, however, remains difficult and 
comparable information at the international level is limited. The WDN1 and WDN3 
surveys provide information on the centralisation and coverage of collective wage 

agreements. Regarding centralisation, the surveys asked firms
 whether they apply a 
collective wage agreement negotiated and signed outside the firm and/or at the firm 

level.
85 The latter type of agreement is usually regarded as more flexible than the 
former, as it gives firms greater scope to react to economic circum
stances specific to 
the firm. 
                                                                     85  It is often the case that agreements at both levels coexist in the firm.

 On average, around 75% of firms applied a collective wage agreement in the euro 
area in 2013, while in 2007 this figure was 95%. By contrast, in the non
-euro area 
countries surveyed, only around 34% of firms applied a collective wage agreement in 
2013, as opposed to 28% in 2007. It is noteworthy that in the Baltic States only a 
very small percentage of
 firms applied collective agreements (11
-18% in 2013).
86                                                                     86  In Ireland, the partnership agreements which set out the framework for collective bargaining over pay in 
both the public and private sectors were abandoned in 2010 and most firms have been operating 

without a formal agreement on pay since. Nevertheless, is likely that they operate under informal 

agreements.
  
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 5 
/ 2016
 59 Differences between euro area and non
-euro area countries are also apparent when 
looking separately at collective agreements signed at the firm level and those signed 
outside the firm. In the euro area, collective bargaining was still mostly signed 
outside the firm at the sector level (this applies to 64.3% of firms, accounting for the 

largest proportion of workers) 
Œ 
with the exception of the Baltic States, where wage 
bargaining was predominantly organised at the firm level. The latter is also the case 

for the non
-euro area countries (see Table 1).
87 However, a trend towards more 
decentralised bargaining has been observed in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and 

Slovenia.
 


88 Nevertheless, the 
evidence collected by the WDN3 survey confirms that a large proportion of workers 
are still covered by some kind of collective wage agreement. The coverage rate 
before the crisis was high 
Œ 
68% on average and over 80% in the euro area 
Œ 
while 
in 2013 the average coverage was 60% across all sampled firms and 73% across 

euro area firms.

 Labour market reforms during the period 
2010
-13 




 This is another factor that may have influenced the 
reaction of firms to shocks and contributed to the
 observed cross
-country labour 
market heterogeneity.
89 In the WDN3 survey, firms were asked whether adjusting 
employment (via a number of channels) and adjusting wages (of both incumbents 

and new hires) had become easier or more difficult than in 2010.
90 Cha
rt 2 shows 
the percentage of firms in each country that found it easier to adjust employment in 

2013 than in 2010 (it reports the average across the different channels), while Chart 

3 displays the percentage of firms that found it easier to adjust wages in
 2013 than in 
2010. These charts show that it is precisely in the countries where the largest and 
most wide
-ranging labour market reforms took place (mostly the ﬁstressedﬂ 
countries) that substantial percentages of firms found it easier to adjust labour co
sts 

in 2013 than in 2010.

 However, it must be 
borne in mind that the easiness of adjustments may hinge on other factors. For 

example, 27% of Spanish firms reported that cutting the wages of incumbents in 

2013 was easier than doing so in 2010, but when asked to identify specific rea
sons 
behind that change, they attributed particular importance to changes in workers™ 
attitudes (see Box 1). This is likely to be a consequence of the intensity and duration 
of the crisis in Spain, rather than any regulatory changes.

 Firms™ perceptions of changes in the ease of labour 
market 
adjustment and the role of 
reforms in stressed euro area countries
 during the period 2010
-13 (based on the WDN3 
survey)
 

91,

92 It focuses on firms™ responses to the WDN3 
survey regarding labour market adjustment channels and how they were influenced by labour 
market reforms, workers™ attitudes,
 trade
 union behaviour and the enforcement of law
s. The box 
defines labour market adjustment channels in a very broad way but gives special attention to labour 

market reforms.
93 At the same time, WDN3 survey information on firms™ perceptions also allows us 
to disentangle the impacts of demand
-side factors, such as the severity of various shocks affecting 
stressed countries, and supply
-side factors, such as changes in trade union behaviour 
and workers™ 
attitudes. 
 




 In particular, as discussed in this article, firms adjusted wages, employment 
and prices to increase their competitiveness and performance. For example, firms in most stressed 

countries reported that it was either just as easy or less difficult to adjust wages and/or employment 
in 2013 compared with 2010 (see Table 1). Overall, it seems that labour market adjustment was 
perceived to be easier than in the past in Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal (i.e. firms that found 

it less difficult to adjust wages and/or employment significantly outnumbered those that found it 
more difficult), while firms™ overall ability to make these adjustments did not alter much in Ireland
, 
Italy
 and Slovenia. This is consistent with the different timing
s 
of labour market reforms in different 
countries
. For instance, the effects of the earlier reforms of the first group of countries 
were more 
likely to be captured over the sample period of the WDN3 survey (2010
-13). By contrast, significant 
labour market reforms in Italy were only implemented at a later stage, in 2012 and 2015, while 

labour market reform in Slovenia was implemented towards the end of the WDN3 sample period in 
2013. Meanwhile, Ireland was already considered to be a relatively flexible economy before the 
crisis and experienced economic difficulties mainly in 
its
 first phase (2008
-09); it is thus unsurprising 
that perceptions did not change much in Ireland over the period 2010
-13.

Following 
the definition used in the article entitled ﬁThe impact of the economic crisis on euro area 
labour marketsﬂ, 
Monthly Bulletin

as stressed during the period 2010

 Ireland,
 Greec

Spain, 
Italy, Cyprus, 
Portugal
 and
 Slovenia.

 are described in detail in Box 2 of the article entitled ﬁWhat is

 93  
It should be recognised that the issue of labour market adjustment channels is much broader than 

investigated in this box. Furthermore, the limitations of the survey data should also be taken into 

consideration when studying the impact of reforms.

, and dismissal costs and procedures.
95 It is 
therefore not surprising that
 the firms that said it was now easier to adjust or lower wages 
outnumbered those that said it was more difficult. By contrast, firms in Slovenia report that the ease 
of adjusting 
the 
wages of incumbents in 2013 remained broadly similar to
 that of
 2010; the same 
applies to lowering 
the 
wages of new hires in Ireland. Furthermore, adjusting 
the 
wages of 
incumbents in Italy actually seems to have been somewhat more burdensome in 2013 than in 2010, 

while adjusting 
the 
wages of new hires remained broadly similar. Overall, increased wage flexibility, 
as reported by firms, should be seen as an important buffer against even higher potential increases 
in unemployment in stressed countries during the crisis. At the same time, it is important to bear in 
mind that wage policies should also reflect wider labour market conditions and productivity 
developments. 
 

 This is reported
 particularly by 
firms in 
Greece, Spain
 and Portugal. In Cyprus and 
Sloveni
a, laying off employees for economic 
reasons eased to a lesser extent, and in Ireland
 and Italy
 it remained broadly unchanged. Firms in 

Ireland also reported that the ease of adjusting working hours was 
broadly 
similar 
in comparison 
with
 2010, as did firms in Italy, Cyprus and 
Slovenia
.96 From the policy perspective, it is important 
that increased flexibility is combined with active labour market policies to allow workers to red
eploy 

quickly to new sectors and job opportunities. Such a policy mix would reduce the duration of 
unemployment and further reduce structural unemployment in the euro area. In particular, firms will 

be more likely to increase employment in the future if there is more flexibility regarding the 

adjustment of labour requirements.
                                                                     95  The impact of labour market institutions on wage developments is also discussed in detail in Box 
4 in 
the article entitled ﬁIncreasing resilience and long

97 The firms surveyed in these two countries 
indicated
 that reforms were
 an important reason for the increase in the ease of labour
 market
 adjustment, while changes in 
workers™ attitudes in Spain also played a significant role, particularly as regards the wage channel
 (see 
Chart A). The latter may be partly explained by the strong increase in the unemployment rate 
in Spain over the period 2010

 This is consistent with various 
labour reforms in Greece, including the decentralisation of wage bargaining.
98 Although there was 
little
 improvement in the flexibility of labour 
market 
adjustment in Italy (see Table), the survey 
results
 suggest 
that the
 labour reforms 
implemented did 
influence labour market dynamics for some 
firms (see

The WDN3 survey shows that euro area countries 
that demonstrated stronger reform efforts made it easier for firms to adjust both employment and 
wages
, thereby facilitat
ing
 the wider adjustment process. This box shows that wage flexibi
lity 
helped
 to reduce lay
-offs during the adjustment period. Labour market efficiency indicators also 
show that euro area countries are still a long way behind the highest performing 
OECD member 
countries, hence more reforms are necessary for all euro area
 countries. Further labour and product 
market reforms are crucial to deliver the necessary flexibility and adjustment capacity required of 
euro area countries. This is particularly important given the slowdown in reform momentum over the

ing 
that adjustment is not unfairly placed on specific groups of workers, such as temporary or new 
employees. At the same time, active labour market policies

are required to facilitate labour market

  4 Nominal 
wage
 rigidities 
This section presents evidence on nominal wage rigidities, their sources and their 

consequences during the period 2010
-13 and in comparison with the pre
-crisis 
period (2002
-07). 
 4.1
 Frequency
 of wage setting
 



 The frequency of wage changes provides a measure of the extent to which 
wages are sticky. This measure is often used in the literature and in policy analysis.
 It is an essential ingredient in the calibration of standard dynamic stochastic general 

equilibrium models with staggered adjustment mechanisms, which are widely used 
for monetary policy analysis. 
 


100 The
 WDN3 survey 
explicitly asked firms about the frequency of wage changes for their main 
occupational group. A similar question was included in the WDN1 survey, thus 
enabling a comparison between firms™ behaviour during the period 2010
-13 on the 
one hand and
 the period of economic stability prior to the crisis (2002
-07) on the 
other. Chart 4 summarises the responses, grouping the potential answers into: (i) 

more frequently than once a year, (ii) once a year, and (iii) less frequently than once 
a year. Around 48.5% of firms in the 25 EU countries of the WDN3 sample reported 

that, during the period 2010
-13, they changed their employees™ base wages once a 
year; 40% changed wages less frequently than once a year; and only 4% did so 

more frequently than once a year. These aggregate figures hinder large 

cross
-country heterogeneity; for example, the percentage of firms that adjusted 
wages less than once a year during the period 2010
-13 ranges from 60% in Italy to 
                                                                    99

-term growth: the importance of sound institutions 
and economic structures for euro area countries and EMU

 The estimated duration of the 
wage spell (the number of months for which wages remain unchanged) was 15 
months on average in the sampled countries in 2007, compared with 16.8 months for 
the same countries during the period 2010
-13. For the 25 countries of the WDN3 

survey, the average wage spell was, as reported above, 17 months. This general 
reduction in the frequency of wage changes can be observed in every country. The 
low (and decreasing) frequency confirms the prevalence of wage inertia, which may 
have delayed adjustment to shocks at the country level. 
 






 This has been 
forma
lly explored using WDN3 survey data in a multivariate analysis for the 25 
countries sampled. According to the findings, base wages are changed less often if 

the firm experiences credit restrictions or a decline in demand, and if it is reluctant to 
cut nominal wages. During a period in which economic conditions may in fact be 
calling for a wage reduction, the reluctance to cut nominal wages might prevent 

wage changes as firms freeze wages instead of cutting them. The evidence from the 
WDN3 survey data is that substantial numbers of freezes are largely responsible for 
the lower frequency of wage changes observed.
102 Institutional features in the labour 
                                                                    101  In Malta, firms change wages at least once a
 year due to the annual Cost
-of
-Living Adjustment (COLA) 
mechanism (i.e. partial indexation to past inflation).

 downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR).

 68 market also contribute to explaining the cross
-country differences in wage stickiness: 
base wages are changed more often in the presence of collective bargaining and 
internal policies that adjust base wages for inflation.
103  


 Prima facie, higher wage inertia may suggest that 
wages will take more time to respond to economic recovery. Nevertheless, the lower 
frequency of wage changes over the period 2010
-13 seems to be related to factors 
that are linked to the crisis; it is thus likely that the frequency of wage changes will 

eventually return to pre
-crisis levels, in particular as wage freezes thaw. In any case, 
although higher than during the crisis, the pre
-crisis frequency of wage changes is 
also indicative of the prevalence of
 wage inertia and delayed adjustment. 
 4.2
 Downward wage rigidity
  





 It is typically defined on the basis of nominal wage freezes. 
DNWR prevents wage cuts, meaning that firms keep base wages unchanged even if 

economic conditions justify a cut. The WDN survey, in its three waves, collected 

information on whether firms cut or froze the base wages of some of their employees 
and on the proportion of workers affected. Babeck
ý 
et al. summarised the evidence 
on DNWR for the period 2002
-07.104 Fabiani et al. used WDN2 survey data to 
provide evidence on how wage rigidity led firms to adjust labour in response to the 

shocks during the period 2008
-09.105 This article summarises evidence on DNWR for 
the period 2010
-13, drawing from the WDN3 survey. 
 

 In 2007 around only 2.3% of firms in the 
sampled countries reported having cut wages in the previous five years. During the 

acute phase of the crisis, in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, only 

3.2% of the surveyed firms reported having cut wa
ges.
106 The evidence from the 
WDN3 survey reveals that only 4% of the surveyed firms cut wages at least once 

over the period 2010
-13.107 There is, however, remarkable heterogeneity in wage 
cuts across countries. In 2013 about 55% of firms in Greece implemented
 wage cuts, 
                                                                    103  These results are in line with those of the WDN1 survey for the pre
-crisis 
period (2002
-07). See Druant

The low percentage of firms having reported
 nominal
 wage
 cuts
 in 2007
 is not necessarily indicative of 
downward nominal wage rigidity but may simply reflect the 
absence
 of 
a shock large
 enough
 as a
 trigger. This is no longer the case
 as of
 2009
. 
107  
The incidence of wage cuts in terms of affected workers is also very low. In the pre
-crisis period
 (2002
-07)
, on average, 
around only
 0.2% of workers a year were affected by wage cuts. During
 the period
 2008
-09, in spite of the depth of the shock
, the incidence of wage cuts increased only moderately, 
affecting 1.8% of workers. Finally, during the period 2010
-13 the incidence of wage cuts was also 
minor, ranging from 0.4% to 0.8% of workers per year.
  
ECB Economic Bulletin,

/ 2016
 69 followed by 37% in Cyprus and 25% in Croatia. At the other extreme, less than 
2% of firms cut wages in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Hungary and the 
Netherlands. During the period 2008
-09 Estonia was the exception, with 40% of 
firms (acco
unting for 30% of employees) implementing wage cuts. All this seems to 
indicate that firms cut nominal wages only in the case of severe economic difficulties. 
In fact, an important factor determining the propensity to cut wages, which can, in 
part, explain
 the heterogeneity observed across countries, is the nature and intensity 

of the shocks that the firm faced. A first look at the data shows that about 8% of the 
firms that suffered a decline in demand cut base wages (against 4% on average), 
and this increases to 12% among the firms that in addition faced credit constraints. 

The proportion is largest, at 18%, among those firms that experienced a strong 

shock in demand as well as credit constraints. 
 





Of the firms sampled in the WDN1 survey, 9.6% reported that they 
had frozen base wages at least once during the period 2002
-07. This percentage 
subs
tantially increased to 34.5% of firms during the period 2008
-09 in the countries 
covered by the WDN2 survey
 (with another 35% of firms indicating their intention to 
freeze wages in the future). In the WDN3 survey, 24% of the sampled firms reported 

that they had frozen base wages at least once over the period 2010
-13 (see 
Chart
 5).
108 This evidence on wage freezes, together with the low incidence of wage 
cuts, is indicative of the prevalence of DNWR. Overall, DNWR was still prevalent 

during the period 2010
-13 in spite of the intensity and length of the crisis, but it 
seems that it reached its peak in the first years of the crisis (2008
-09). There also 
appear to be substantial differences across countries in the incidence of wage 

freezes during the period 2010
-1
3, with firms in Ireland, Greece and Cyprus having a 
greater propensity to freeze base wages in this period (see Chart 5). The 
heterogeneity in the incidence of wage freezes and wage cuts across sectors and 
firm size is not as pronounced as across countries. Construction was perhaps the 

sector with the lowest percentage of wage freezes, but it should be borne in mind 
that construction suffered huge employment cuts before that period. Preliminary 
research points not only to the nature and intensity of the shocks but also to 

institutional features and firm characteristics as factors behind the cross
-country 
differences in DNWR.

 In the presence of DNWR, firms are also likely to 

moderate wage increases; in a period of low inflation such as the current one, this 

may trigger second
-round effects, further dampening wage inflation. Elsby, and 
Stübe
r and Beissinger, among others, argue that, even if increasing nominal wages 
raises workers™ effort and productivity, a wage cut of the same amount will reduce 
effort and productivity by a larger amount, such that reversing wage increases will 

incur an extra cost in terms of productivity.
109 As a consequence, forward
-looking 
firms will moderate wage increases in the presence of DNWR.
110 4.3
 Other channels to lower firms™ wage bill: bonuses and benefits 
 

 In fact, downward rigidity in base wages can 
be (partially) circumvented by including ﬁflexible wage componentsﬂ in the total wage 
bill. Bonuses and benefits are the main examples of these components. While 
companies avoid reductions in base wages for various reasons, reductions in 
                                                                    109

In fact, the two main reasons identified in the literature for firms™ reluctance to cut nomi
nal wages are (i) 
the belief that nominal wage reductions can damage worker morale and effort, and (ii) the possibility 
that the most productive workers would leave as a consequence. See Bewley, T.

 The average share of bonuses in the total wage bill of 
the firms sampled in 2007 was 11%, falling to 7.4% in 2013 for the subset of 
countries that participated in the WDN1 survey.
113 For the 25 countries participating 
in the WDN3 survey, the average was 7%. A smaller fraction of bonuses and 
benefits in the total wage bill may reflect slower economic growth in 2013 relative to 
the pre
-crisis period (2002
-07), but it is also suggestive of the increased role of 
bonuses in firms™ labour cost flexibility. 
 

 The WDN3 survey asked firms whether they used bonuses and 
benefits as an adjustment mechanism to reduce labour costs during the period 2010
-13. Regression analysis using WDN3 survey data shows that firms that are subject 
to nominal wage rigidities are more likely to cut bonuses in order to adjust labour 
costs. This finding confirms some degree of substitutability between wage flexibility 

and the flexibility of bonuses during the period 2010
-13. Similar substitutability was 
also found for the period 2002
-07 with data from the WDN1 survey. 
 


 Demand and credit shocks are both associated with an 
increased use of flexible wage components as a means of adjusting costs. 
Moreover, regression analysis supports the view that the use of bonuses and 
benefits is not influenced by unionisation; cutting bonuses is thus likely to be a 
strategy developed outside formal collective bargaining
. 

 Sectoral wage Phillips curves and the capacity of WDN3 survey micro data to inform on 
their slope
 

 Data on the 
performance of the euro area labour markets at the country and sector levels
 were combined
 with 
informa
tion from the WDN3
 survey
 to explain one aspect of wage rigidity: the responsiveness of 
wage growth to economic slack. 
Country and sector
-specific wage Phillips curves
 were estimated
, 
focusing on the slope coefficient of the Phillips curve, which captures the responsiveness of wage 
growth to economic slack. The slope of the Phillips curve 
reflects
 how sticky wages are
114, which in 
turn depends on a variety of factors widely studied in the literature. WDN3 survey
 data
 were used 
to 
account for those factors and
 to 
examine their capacity to explain the estimated responsiveness of 
wage growth to economic slack. 
 


 Every sector can be described in terms of a specific degree of 
economic slack and different labour market characteristics (e.g. composition of workers or labour 

market institutions) that affect wage growth. Such heterogeneity has been particularly notable
 since 
                                                                    113  
See Table 2. Conditional on firms paying bonuses, the figures 
were
 16% in 2007 and 10% in 2013.

 73 the crisis, as not all sectors were affected in the same way.
115 The heterogeneity
 could be captured
 by estimating the Phillips curve with sectoral rather than aggregate data and combining it with the 
information on firm and labour market characterist
ics from the WDN3 survey. 
It was then possible to 
assess
 how different characteristics of the labour markets across countries and sectors affect
ed the 
responsiveness of wage growth to economic slack.
 



116

 The Phillips 
curve regressions
 were run
 for five sectors in each of the euro area countries (93 regressions in 
total). These sectors follow
ed the same categorisation used in the WDN3 survey: (
i) manufacturing, 
(ii) electricity, gas and water, (iii) construction, (iv) business services and trade
117, and (v) financial 
intermediation.
 




 For the second part of the analysis 
using WDN3 survey data, however, staff only used 
slope coefficients from the Phillips curves where 
all estimated coefficients of the explanatory variables ha
d 
signs in line with economic theory.
118 

119 These factors include 
a firm

120, the 
proporti

121, the percentage of 
the

costs attributable to labour
122, the presence of alternative means of cost adjustment (bonuses, 
etc.)
123, the degree of indexation and frequency of wage adjustment
124, and
 the use of wage cuts

 In particular, wage flexibility (and 
therefore the slope of the Phillips curve) was 
negatively related to the proportion of highly 
skilled employees owing to the high costs 

associated with their recruitment and training. 
This tends to limit wage cuts for such workers 
and thus decreases wage flexibility. There are 

several reasons why wages tend to be more 
flexible in large firms: (i) they are more likely to 
sign firm
-level collective pay agreements that 
are usually regarded as more flexible than 
agreements signed outside the firm; (ii) they 
have more complex compensation structures; 

(iii) they often offer extra wage components 
that contribute to wage flexibility; and (iv) they tend to have more dispersed wages. The reluctance 

of firms to cut wages is typically used to define downward nominal wage rigidity. In this sense, a 
higher proportion of employees actually affected by wage cuts points to lower wage rigidity.
  



 Nevertheless, the negative sign of the coefficient on indexation could suggest that indexation, when 

operative, dominates wage setting irrespective of
 economic developments
. 
 









 It is
 therefore 
difficult to
 draw any conclusions about their impact on the slope of the Phillips curve.
 However
, their 
insignificance could be a reflection of the limited sample size, which 
was
 dictated by data 
availability, and the fact that, while the wage Phillips curve
 was estimated
 over the period 1997
-2014, the cross
-sectional regression c
ould
 only be based on data from the WDN3 survey (i.e. the 
period 2010
-13). This may explain, for example, the insignificance of the proportion of employees 
affected by wage freezes; the latter increased substantially during the crisis, but the Phillips curve 
estimated over the longer period may not 
have 
fully capture
d 
th
is change. 
 






 Despite the limitations related to data availability 
and the construction of the sample, the analysis provides
 valuable information
 on which firm and 
labour market characteristics seem to matter for the responsiveness of wages to labour market 

conditions. These findings contribute to ECB staff™s
 understanding of wage growth dynamics at the 
aggregate level, which is particularly important in the current period of muted wage growth.

 75 5 Conclusion
s 




. Drawing on evidence from the WDN3 survey, a firm
-level survey recently conducted in 25 EU countries, this article contributes to a better 

understanding of wage rigidities in the European Union after the Great Recession, 

namely during the period 2010
-13. 
A number of tentative conclusions can be drawn 
from this evidence. 
 
. Around 49% of firms in 
the 25 EU countries sampled report that, during the period 2010
-13, they changed 
their employees™ base wages
 once a year, while 40% changed them less frequently 
than once a year. 
 





 This seems to be at 
least partially attributable to the resistance of firms to lower base wages, i.e. to the 

prevalence of DNWR.
 




. Nomi
nal base wage cuts are extremely rare among European firms, 
and this was the case even during the crisis. Meanwhile, the percentage of firms that 

reported having frozen base wages increased dramatically with the crisis, reaching 
its peak during the period 
2008
-09, before declining over the period 2010
-13. 
 

. Firms facing DNWR are more likely to use bonuses and benefits to reduce 
labour costs; this may help to circumvent the DNWR constraint. Results also point to 
a (probably moderate) role of bonuses and benefits as shock absorbers during the 
period 2010
-13. 






 The WDN™s main research objectives also include 
understanding employment and price adjustment and, more generally, how firms 
have adjusted to the various shocks and labour market reforms that took pl
ace 
during the period 2010
-13.

 76 Increasing resilience and long
-term 
growth: t
he importance of
 sound 
institution
s and economic structures
 for 
euro area countries and EMU
 Sound institutions and economic structures are essential for the resilience and the 
long-term prosperity of the euro area. However, there remains a significant gap in 
terms of the quality of national institutions and the efficiency of economic structures 
between most euro area countries and the best performing members of the 
Organisation for Economic Co
-operation and Development (OECD). After having 
increased
 in the period 2011
-13, the momentum of structural reforms has weakened 
in recent years in euro area countr
ies
, despite 
the fact that 
significant reform effort 
is still needed to 
strengthen
 resilience and ensure long
-term growth
. This article recalls 
the main benefits of sound institutions for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), 
provides evidence for gaps between euro area countries and best performers in 
terms of institutional quality and
 labour and product market functioning, and 
considers the national versus the common perspective in shaping a stronger and 

more resilient euro area. It shows that in terms of quality of institutions as well as for 
labour and product market functioning euro
 area counties are 
still
 distant from 
international best
-performers. The article reports evidence that reducing the gap to 
the frontier would increase productivity and long
-term growth as well as ensure more 
resilience to adverse shocks. The latter would be important not only for the countries 
themselves, but also for improving
 the smooth functioning of EMU. It is therefore of 

utmost importance that decisive institutional and structural reforms are carried out to 
foster employment and investment growth, and
 increase potential output in all euro 
area countries
. 1 Introduction
 



. It builds on two previous Economic Bulletin articles, which dealt with the 
importance of structural reforms in the euro area and the need to foster real 

convergence.
126 They showed the effects
 of structural reforms on key 
macroeconomic variables
 as well as
 how weak institutions and structural rigidities 
constrained real convergence among EU countries. They also
 suggested
 how further 
structural reforms could be a powerful tool
 to restore growth and competitiveness in 
the euro area.
 This article complements the previous analysis by revisiting the 
                                                                    126

 77 importance of sound institutions, particularly as regards two key pressing issues: 
how to increase resilience and how to boost productivity
 and potential growth
 across 
the euro area countries.
 


 In the event of structural changes or an abrupt adverse
 shock, rigid economic 

structures hinder a timely reorientation of resources, i.e. capital and labour, towards 
other sectors. High public debt makes it more difficult to pursue counter
-cyclical 
fiscal policies,
127 while high private debt thwarts the ability of households and firms to 
take smooth consumption and investment decisions
. 
Similarly, and relatedly, high 
net external indebtedness makes countries vulnerable to a sudden withdrawal of 
foreign investors
™ 
funds.
 Chart 1
 shows
 that
 the high debt problem is relatively 
widespread across the euro area countries and has been generally associated with 

poor economic growth since the beginning of the financial and economic crisis.
 


Private and public debt (2007) and output growth per capita (2007
-15) (x-axis: public and private debt as a percentage of GDP (2007); y
-axis: change in GDP per capita since the peak)
  











Chart 2
 shows that for 
two
-thirds of the euro area countries total factor productivity (TFP) growth has 
averaged at below 1% over the past 20 years. At the same time the United States 

has seen rates of slightly above 1%. This picture is worrying, as TFP is a key 

determinant of GDP growth and, in turn, GDP growth is necessary to boost 

employment and help reduce high levels of private and public indebtedness.
 Against this background
, the article 
examines how
 sound institutions and 
economic 
structures can address insufficient resilience and weak productivity, particularly in a 
monetary union. This is done in three steps.
                                                                     127

 It shows that on the main economic 
structures (i.e. labour and product markets), as well as on a set of principal 

institutions, euro area countries remain far from the OECD frontier of best practices.
 








It shows how 
sound labour and product market regulations as well as good governance institutions 
increase resilience and are a key source for lo
ng-term growth. This section shows 
that despite the significant benefits to be gained from institutional and structural 
reforms and the still large distance from best practices, the pace of reforms across 
the euro area has, after picking up early in the crisis, been slow, especially in 
countries under an economic adjustment programme.
 




 There is ample evidence and c
onsensus on
 the importance of adaptable 
product, labour and
 capital markets for the smooth functioning of
 EMU
, in the context 
of a single monetary policy. Against the background of slow implementation of 
reforms, this section reviews the current EU governance framework and draws some 
lessons for the future.

128 This is because such
 reforms 
can i) 
promote 
a better use of 
an economy™s resources by reducing
 barriers 
to
 the swift movement of capital and 
labour across firms
, leading to a better use of
 labour 
and thus higher employment 
rate
s, ii) eliminate barriers to entry for new firms and iii) more generally ensure a 
level playing field across all economic actors. 
 







 The latter often includes the overall conditions for setting up and running 
businesses. 
 






. Sound 
institutions, such as legal certainty, efficient public administration or the absence of 
corruption, provide the basis for all specific economic structures, such as labour and 

product markets, to work appropriately. Box 1 elaborates on the concepts of 
institutions and economic structures and lists possible policies which could impact 
their functioning.
 
 The concept of institutions and economic structures and how they impact the economy

and ensure that sound economic incentives are in place for 
encouraging people to invest, innovate, save and solve problems of collective action, and for 
ensuring the efficient provision of public goods.
 One of the most prominent examples in this re
gard 
is the enforceability of property rights, which 
Œ 
if guaranteed 
Œ 
significantly influence
s 
the incentives 
to invest and innovate.
 





In market economies, regulations try to prevent market failure and 
preserve social cohesion, and therefore play a
 significant
 role in
 determining economic str
uctures
, for example i
n 
labour or product markets. There are several cases in which regulations can be 
welfare
-enhancing if used appropriately. 
If
 a market does not function well, such as
 in cases of 
natural monopol
y 
in large network industries 
(e.g. energ
y)
, it might be beneficial to regulate the 
market. 
In general, 
however, 
too much regulation could create the wrong incentives for investors, 
firms and employees, so that labour or capital is not used where 
it is 
most useful from a welfare 
perspective. Such
 excessive regulation or protection could 
ultimately
 hinder
 productivity
 and employment growth as well as
 a swift response to adverse shocks.

 80 one hand
, job security arrangements, minimum wages and collective bargaining might need to be 
regulated to provide sufficient social protection for workers or 
to
 encourag
e 
productivity growth 
(through training and the 
development
 of firm
-specific skills). On the other hand, excessive 
regulation impedes the timely adjustment of firms and employees to economic shocks by 

discouraging hiring and favour
s 
people currently in employment 
over
 the unemployed. The key 
issue for policymakers is to try to balance the need for a certain degree of regulation with the need
 
to avoid
 excessive distortions. The main categories of labour market institution cover (i) the rules of 

the wage
-setting process, (ii) labour
 (protection) legislation, (iii) activation policies, (iv) income 
replacement policies (v) labour taxation and (vi) education and vocational training policies. 
 




Economic changes could happen gradually, such 
as structural change brought about by globalisation
, or more abruptly in the event that
 adverse 
shocks hit the economy. In such cases, the price and quantity of labour need to be able to adjust. 

Moreover, the degree to which reallocation between sectors is possible can be very important
. 
Against this background, labour market policies must 
provide
 sufficient flexibility in the wage
-setting 
framework and prevent excessively strict labour protection legislation from creating
 a ﬁlock
-inﬂ 
effect. At the same time, security 
must
 be ensured
 for workers
 in 
the event
 of temporary 
unemployment by granting sufficient unemployment benefits
, and the reactivation of workers 
must 
be fa
cilitated 
through targeted employment programmes. 
 



A high degree of competition among firms in goods and services markets ensures 
that prices do not become excessive in relation
 to the costs of production. Given that markets with 
higher competition tend to exhibit lower prices than markets with limited competition, consumers 

benefit from more competitive markets. This in turn reduces unjustified rents for producers and 

raise
s 
consumer welfare. Moreover, competition also tends to favour the variety of products
, thereby giving
 consumers more 
choice. In addition, it seems that firms in markets with high barriers 

to
 entry tend to innovate less. This in turn impedes technological progress, productivity and thus job 
creation. 
 
 In order for the 
economy to
 weather shocks, it must be possible for prices to adjust quickly and 
for 
production 
factors to
 be reallocate
d 
between firms and sector
s. The price adjustments are essential to ensure 
a pass
-through of changes in labour costs to consumer prices. In the event
 of a decline in labour 
costs after a negative shock, the competitiveness of an economy can only improve if prices 
also 
adjust. Without swift price adjustment the cost of an adverse shock would otherwise fall on the real 
disposable income of households. 
 


. General policies rela
te
, for 
example
, to ensuring a strong and efficient regulation authority
 that can
 monitor the state of 
competition in all relevant markets. Moreover, policies 
can
 create favourable broader business 
conditions to facilitate 
the entr
y 
of new firms and alleviate the administrative burden of existing 
firms. Sector
-specific policies 
include,
 for example
, competition policies 
for
 network industries (e.g. 
energy, telecom
s 
or transport), 
the 
retail sector and closed professions (e.g. notarie
s, pharmacies 
or lawyers).

. It is common 
practice to measure institutional quality, in particular, in 

terms of perceptions; this may not necessarily reflect 

the quality of the law but rather the actual workings of 
the economy. In this article we use as a proxy for 
institutional quality the four governance indicators 

computed by the World Bank: government 
effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control 
of corruption. The aggregate of these indicators has 
been referred to as the delivery quality
 of government 
services
,130 or simply 
as institutional
 delivery. 
Chart 3
 shows these four indicators for the euro area countries
, 
the United States, and the three best performers in the 
OECD. A higher index number indicates higher 
institutional standards. For all four indicators, the quality 

of institutions in the euro area is
 on average weaker 
than in its peer regions.
 



 Chart 4
 shows that 
the institutional quality indicator varies greatly across the euro area countries, with 

Finland at the frontier of institutional strength, some countries (e.g.
 the Netherlands 
and Luxembourg) 
very
 close to the OECD best performers, and
 some (e.g. Greece 

and Italy)
 close to the OECD worst per
formers.

 This is because the suitability of specific regulations (e.g. employment 
protection) can only be assessed in a wider context (e.g. the level of social 
protection). For this reason, a
 wide range of indicators should be used to assess the 

overall efficiency of the labour market. As stated in the Five Presidents™ Report,
131 best practices for labour markets should combine elements of security and flexibility. 

This means flexible and reliable labour contracts that avoid a two tier labour market, 

comprehensive lifelong learning strategies, effective policies to help the unemployed 
re-enter the labour market, modern social security systems and enabling labour 
taxation. There was a rise in unemployment in euro area countries during the crisis 
and it still remains very high in some member states (see Chart 5). Reforms which 
enhance flexibility and security in a balanced manner increase labour market 
efficiency, thereby facilitating job creation and reducing the high rates of 
unemployment in the countries concerned.
 






The indicators 
consulted 
have
 de jure
 and de facto
 aspects. The OECD 
product 
market regulation (PMR) 
index 
focuses on the 
legislative aspects of the regulatory environment related 
to economy
-wide regulation (e.g. state control) and 
industry
-level regulation (e.g. barriers to trade in 
manufacturing). By contrast
, the World Bank Doing 
Business indicator 
focuses 
mainly 
on the 
implementation aspects 
of the cost of doing 
business.

 the (standardised) aggregate of the
 two 
indicators. This aggregate indicator suggests that t
he euro area appears to have

 three

 On the 
basis of this indicator, all euro area countries

particular the countries with the

, need to improve competition and 
overall
 conditions for doing business.

. Chart 7
 sho
ws that, on the basis of 
the indicators used for this analysis, countries with 

below average quality of institutions also tend to have 
below average quality of product and labour markets. 
This high correlation might, among other things, reflect 

the fact that, in the presence of sound institutions, 
societies and lawmakers are more likely to overcome 
vested interests and carry out reforms that benefit the 
majority of citizens.
 




 As noted in greater 
detail in Box 1, institutions and certain economic 

structures (such as those pertaining to labour and 
product markets) are multifaceted and often not easily 

or not at all quantifiable. Also, given that indicators are 
often based on perceptions, they might be affected by 
cyclical influences, e.g. in times of crisis perceptions of 

the functioning of certain institutions could be worse 
than in good times. Another issue relates to the 
arbitrariness of the scale used, in particular for de fa
cto
 indicators. Moreover, the 
sample size and composition of the surveyed matter, as do their changes through 

time. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the broad composite indicators chosen 
in Charts 4
-6 regarding the institutional and regulatory quality
 of a particular country 
would need to be complemented with a more profound investigation of the actual 

functioning of the economy and its public sector.

 84 3 Evidence 
for the impact of institutional and structural 
reforms 
for euro area countries
 Building on the above indicators, this section looks into the empirical evidence linking 
both institutions and economic structures to resilience and long
-term productivity 
growth.
 3.1
 Increasing
 economic resilience
 

 Economic resilience has an ex ante
 and an ex post
 aspect. In general, ex ante 
resilience refers to 
the capacity to 
resist to shocks while ex post
 resilience refers to 
the capacity to moderate the costs
 of, and recover quickly after,
 an adverse shock. 
The two aspects are interconnected. H
ow 
well economies deal with shocks
 depends 
on a range of factors
, including the policy environment, the depth of economic and 
financial diversification and, in particular, the quality of institutions and economic 

structures. 
 




Adverse shocks hitting economies can have a common origin 
or be idiosyncratic. In the case of a common origin (e.g. the bursting of the dot
-com 
bubble or the financial crisis of 2007
-08) economic resilience can be tested by 
comparing the reaction of different countries to the same shock. This comparison is 
usually done by assessing the impact of the shock on the economy (ex ante 
resi
lience) and by computing the recovery time (ex post resilience).
 






 Acemoglu et al.
132 find that countries with 
institutional 
problems suffer substantially more volatility as measured by the standard deviation 
of per capital output. 
Rodrik
133 comes to a similar conclusion, finding that the effect 
of 
external shocks on growth 
is larger the greater the latent social conflicts in an 
economy and the weaker its institutions of conflict management. High quality 

institutions and economic structures also tend to reduce the probability of crises, as 
Box 2 shows. Countries with the weakest institutions in the sample of OECD 

countries are significantly more prone to economic shocks than countries with 

well
-functioning institutions and sound labour and product markets.

 85 identifying common shocks and testing their impact on countries with different 
economic structures. They look at sectoral data across European countries and find 
that a high level of product market regulation makes industries less resilient to 
adverse shocks. They show that the different capacity to absorb shocks 
within 
industrial sub
-sectors 
seems to be 
explained 
to a large extent by how far product 
market reforms have advanced.
 Duval and Vogel
135 conduct a similar analysis, 
focusing, however, on the persistence of shocks in the output gap. 
The
ir simulations 
indicate that rigid labour and product markets lengthen
 the time it takes for output to 
return to potential following a shock and increase the
 cumulative output loss incurred 
over the period. Box 3 highlights an example of ex post resilience, giving evidence of 
unemployment decline episodes after the implementation of structural reforms. 
 
 Higher quality institutions and economic structures reduce the probability of crisis
 




 The exercise, the outcome 
of which is shown in the chart, first identifies a 

large fall in output
. This is done by
 taking the 
distribution of annual GDP growth across all 
OECD countries from 1990 to 2014 and defining 
the tenth
 percentile of the distribution as 
a crisis 
event. This percentile has a median GDP 
growth rate of 
-4%. 
Second, a probit regression 
model is estimated, where the dependent 
variable is the probability 
of experiencing a GDP 
slump in the order of magnitude covered by
 the 
tenth
 percentile
. On the right
-hand side of the 
equation, institutional and structural variables as 
well as a set of control variables, such as 
government expenditure and short
-term interest 
rates, are added. The results show that the 
probability of a severe reduction in GDP, i.e. a 
crisis event falling under the tenth percentile of 

the 
distribution, is significantly lower for a 
country with the strongest institutions and 
structural characteristics in the sample than for 
a country with the weakest institutions and characteristics. The message appears consistent across 
the three policy areas: labour market, product market and institutional quality. Improving on all 
these fronts is therefore very important to reduce the probability of being affected by a severe crisis. 

In particular, product market reforms, which also include overall conditions for setting up and 
                                                                    135

(total government expenditure and nominal short
-term interest rates) are 
assumed to be average. For institutional quality, the average probability is 

obtained from WGI; for product market institutions, the av
erage probability is 
obtained from Doing Business and GCI product market efficiency; and for 

labour market institutions, average probability is obtained from EPL, GCI and 

Heritage labour market flexibility. Data are based on the period 1990

 86 running businesses, seem to be particularly beneficial for increasing the adjustment capacity of a 
country. 
  

 Prior t
o the financial crisis, several 
studies had shown how the working of the competitiveness channel had been slow in 

the 
euro area
 owing
 to structural rigidities.
136 In a recent study, Biroli et al
.137 confirm 
these results. Overall they find that excessive regulations in product and labour 
markets appear to make inflation differentials more persistent in the face of a 
common shock. This implies that in a monetary union
, where the nominal exchange 

rate channel is no longer available 
as 
a mode of adjustment, the working of the 
competitiveness channel is impeded by highly regulated
 labour and product market 
structures, thereby preventing an automatic smoothing of shocks at 
the 
country level. 
Between 2011 and 2013 structural reforms undertaken in the countries most af
fected 
by the sovereign crisis are likely to have improved the 
functioning
 of the 
competitiveness channel.
 
 High levels of debt can make the economy more vulnerable to shocks and int
ensify 
or prolong economic downturns. This is because they hinder the ability of 
households and firms to smooth consumption and investment spending decisions, 

and the ability of governments to cushion adverse shocks. High public debt generally 
implies high
 future tax rates, which will undermine investment. Negative feedback 
loops between high 
sovereign 
debt and a weak financial sector are 
still 
constraining 
investment decisions and economic growth. High private and public sector debt 

remains a major vulnerability in many euro area countries. Some empirical studies 
derive implicit thresholds for debt ratios and find that, 
once
 a certain level of debt 
has 
remained
 for a number of years, there is evidence that GDP growth remains 

subdued.
138  





. For example, recent analysis by staff of
 the European Commission
 found evidence that
, in the presence of 
a high stock of
 private debt
, the quality of 
insolvency frameworks is important for financial stability and for spurring 

entrepreneurship and thereby mitigating the impact of deleveraging on growth. In 
particular, it was found that a good insolvency framework is associat
ed with speedier 
                                                                    136

 Episodes of unemployment
 decline 
in the euro area and the role of structural reforms
  




 This box aims to explain episodes 
of unemployment absorption, by focusing on the relative importance of the unemployment rate, 
GDP growth and labour and product market reforms. This is done using an event study approac
h. 
The unemployment absorption event is defined as
 an event that cumulatively 
fulfils
 the following 
conditions: (1) the unemployment rate declines by at least 3 percentage points in a three
-year 
period; (2) the decline in the unemployment rate over a three
-year period is at least 25% of the 
initial unemployment rate; and (3) after five years the unemployment rate remains below that at the 
beginning of the episode.
140 The data sample covers the euro area countries over the period 1995
-2015. In total 12 episodes can be identified (see Table
 A).
 





 Macroeconomic 
developments play an important role in driving 

these episodes. The chart (first panel) shows 

that the unemployment rate increases before 
an episode of absorption and is substantially 
higher than the sample average. In addition, 

the unemployment peak is preceded by a sharp 
deceleration in the GDP growth rate (see chart, 
second panel). GDP growth picks up in the 

period before the episode starts, and the 

unemployment rate falls with a lag.
 





 The reform 
stance is computed using the OECD™s indicators of employment protection legislation (EPL) and of 

regulation in energy, transport and communications (ETCR)
141. These series are a proxy for labour 
and product market reforms. The focus is on relatively large reforms, which are defined as reforms 
that exceed one standard deviation of the change in the indicator over all observations in each 
                                                                    139

the period 2005

the 
absence of any reform according to the definition
 above, 
1 
in case of one reform episode and 2 in the case of simultaneous reform episodes 
in EPL and 
ETCR
. The chart (third panel) shows that in the years before the unemployment absorption 
episode, countries tend to have implemented more reforms. The reform activity peaks one year 
before the episode starts and declines thereafter. Taken together, the three panels in the chart 
indicate 
that on average the willingness to introduce reforms is higher
 when GDP grows at slower 

pace and unemployment is high and increasing. In other words it rises during adverse economic 

conditions.

marks the beginning of the unemployment absorption episode. Each variable is demeaned by the sample average of observations in each year (the 
unemployment rate is demeaned by the average unemployment rate in each year; the GDP growth is demeaned by the average GDP growth in each year; 
and reform stance is demeaned by the number of the selected reforms in each year).
  









 In this model the dependent variable 
equals 1 
where
 an unemployment absorption 
episode starts and 0 in the absence of

loyment absorption episode.
 The 
regression results show that higher 
unemployment rates and higher GDP growth

 89 unemployment rate and the GDP growth rate, is also positively correlated with the start of an 
unemployment absorption episode. Table B suggests that a reform episode is associated with an 

increase of 9% in the probability of a
 successful unemployment absorption episode.
 Overall, these results show that the implementation of significant reforms could contribute to ex post 
resilience by accelerating the reduction of unemployment.

 Strengthening productivity and long
-term growth
 






 In the 
early 1970s, the development of an efficient economic system and well
-defined 
property rights had already been shown to be a key factor in allowing western 
economies to raise their wealth compared with the rest of the world.
143 Thirty years 
later, Acemoglu et al.
144 showed, by means of a number of historical episodes in 
developed and developing economies, how
 the existence (and enforceability
) 
of 
property rights 
has determined
 individuals
™ 
incentives to invest in physical or human 
capital or adopt more efficient technologies
. 
 

 Chart 8
 shows the correlation between the residual of a 
simple catching
-up model and the quality of institutions 
in 1999, where the average
 per capita GDP growth 
between 1999
 and 2014 depends 
only 
on the level of 
GDP per capita in 1999 and a constant. For the euro 

area countries a clear positive relationship emerges 
between institutional quality and the residual. Starting 
with the evidence 
shown in Chart 8
, 
recent work 
(Masuch et al.
145) provides some
 analysis in support of 
the view that the quality of institutions is an important 

determinant of long
-term growth in European countries. 
The results seem particularly 
relevant
 for
 countries 
where institutional delivery is below the EU average 

and initial public
 debt is above a certain threshold. They 
are also consistent with the view that the quality of 
institutions
 may be 
more
 important for long
-term growth 
in countries where the exchange rate tool
 is no longer 
available.

 90 institutions affect growth is productivity growth. De Rosa et al.
146 find that for a panel 
including European countries corruption tends to reduce firm
-level productivity 
growth.
 

This has been shown in many empirical 
cross
-country or country
-specific studies. As regards product market regulation
, 
there is considerable evidence that product market regulation raise
s 
barriers
 to entry
 for new firms, in turn
 contributing
 to higher prices and lower
 turnover, and 
is likely to 
slow the process of reallocation of resources
.147 Lower competition in one sector can 
also impact competition in other sectors in the value chain. Studies show that 

reducing regulation in sectors which provide input to the next level in the value chain 

could improve
 the 
access to key intermediate inputs
 and thereby increase
 competition 
at the next level.
148 Moreo
ver,
 countries could expect 
significant
 productivity
 growth gains
 from structural reforms that would allow
 them to achieve 
the level of the best performers
 in labour and product markets. As regards 
labour 
market regulations,
 Bouis and Duval
 149 and Bassanini
 et al.
150 find evidence that 
overly stringent 
EPL 
weakens productivity in
 sectors where labour turnover 
is generally relatively
 high. These findings are consistent with the view that strict
 EPL 
makes it more difficult for firms to respond quickly to changes
 in technology or 
product demand that
 require reallocation of staff or downsizing, thereby inducing 
them to use their resources less efficiently. Relatedly, Box 4 looks at labour market 
rigidities and how they affect wage responsiveness in euro area countries. It shows 
that better functioning labour market structures would affect wage responsiveness, in 

turn facilitating the adjustment process by allowing wages to react 
properly to 
developments in the level of 
unemployment.
 However, there are also some stud
ies 
in which the impact of EPL on productivity is less clear. Koeniger
151 argues that the 
lack of clear impact could be driven by incumbent firms, which are pushed to 
innovate in order to avoid downsizing, whereas, on the other hand, higher EPL 
prevents the entry of new firms and therefore suppresses productivity. Stringent 

product market regulation
 can also have a negative impact of the allocation of 
labour, as
 it prevents 
the 
exit 
from the market or downsizing of 
less 
productive firms, 
thereby hampering allocative efficiency.

 The impact of institutional rigidities on wage responsiveness in the euro area
 



It
 shows how institutional rigidities 
Œ 
such as labour and product market institutions and 
regulations 
Œreduce the responsiveness of euro area wages to unemployment. Such institutional 
rigidities tend
, therefore
, to
 increase employment and output losses associated with downward 

asymmetric shocks, and impede adjustments which prevent excessive overheating of the economy 

during upward shocks. Reforms in product and labour markets can reduce wage rigidities
, thereby 
enhancing the euro area™s growth, resilience and adjustment to shocks.
  



Anderton et al.

estimates of wage Phillips curves for four 
sectors of 
the 
euro area
 economy
 Œ 
manufacturing, market services, construction 
and the public sector
 Œ 
by pooling data across 
the individual euro area countries.
153 Interaction 
terms between institutional rigidity indicators 

and the unemployment rate are statistically 
significant and positively signed, indicating that 
the response of wages to unemployment is 

smaller 
Œ i.e. 
the Phillips 
curve is less steep 
Œ 
if 
labour and product markets are more 

regulated. 
The table shows that h
igher 

employment protection
, stricter product market 
regulation
 and higher union density all seem to 
weaken the response of wages to unemployment in both upturns and downturns, especially in 
sectors such as manufacturing
, thereby impeding the workings of the competitiveness channel.
154                                                                      152  Anderton, R., Hantzsche, A., Savsek, S. and Tóth M., ﬁSectoral Wage Rigidities and Labour and

 The chart shows that the response of 
wages to unemployment is lower by about one
-quarter during economic downturns, with 

downward wage rigidity particularly apparent in 
the manufacturing and service sectors
, which 
further impedes competitiveness adjustments.
155 Downward wage rigidity seems to be confirmed 

by recent micro
-level survey evidence
156 which 
seems to indicate that wage freezes are 
freque

to institutional or negotiation
-related
 difficulties 
in implementing wage cuts.
157 

. Greater wage flexibility will deliver higher wa
ge 
differentiation across different types of workers 
and sectors. This
 will allow wages to rise 
appropriately in growing sectors
, which is necessary to help accelerate the reallocation process and 
ensure a more efficient match between labour supply and demand. Furthermore, eliminating 

rigidities in the economy 
will enable 
economic growth 
to
 pick up faster, promoting employment and 
dampening disinflationary pressures.
  




. Varga and in™t Veld
158 compared structural indicators of 
labour and product markets and defined the gap for each indicator relative to the 

three best performers. Assuming that half of the gap vis
-à-
vis best performance is

 93 productivity impact of regulations is channelled via the effects on production, prices 
and wages. They simulate the impact on TFP of reforms towards the lightest 
regulations in product and labour markets. For the larger euro area countries, they 
show that all countries could achieve significantly higher productivity growth if they 
moved towards best practices.






 For 
example, the IMF
159 and Bouis et al.
160 find that while 
product market reforms can 
already 
deliver gains in the 
short term, the impact of some labo
ur market reforms
 depends significantly
 on the prevailing economic 
condition
s at the time of implementation. 
Reductions
 in 
labo
ur tax wedges
, for example, would
 have larger 
effects during
 periods of slack
. 
By contrast, reforms to 
employment
 protection arrangements and 
unemployment benefit
 systems 
would exert positive 
effects in good times, but can have negative 
distributional consequences in the short to medium 
term 
in periods of slack.
 This calls for a proper 
sequencing of reforms. For example, reforms 
addressing key bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the 
regulatory environment, bu
siness conditions, public 

administration or the judicial system, and thereby 
incentivising market entry and business expansion, 
should help domestic demand and boost output even in 

the short term. While an appropriate sequencing of 
reforms can overcome potential short
-term costs, a 
protracted postponing of necessary reforms can be 
welfare
-decreasing in the long
 run and hinder the necessary adjustment capacity of 
countries.

 The financial crisis created additional reform 
momentum compared with pr

crisis years. However, the more far
-reaching policy 
measures have generally been confined to the most vulnerable countries. In 

particular, countries under macroeconomic adjustment programmes have 
implemented significant reforms aimed at reducing rigidities in labour and product

 94 markets. This is also mirrored in the track record of addressing the OECD™s Going 
for Growth policy recommendations (
Chart
10).
161 Despite the remarkable progress 
during crisis years, the OECD identified a significant slowdown of reform momentum 

in the more vulnerable euro area countries in more recent years, often associated 

with the end of an adjustment programme.
 The track record is also moderate as 
regards following the EU™s country
-specific recommendations (CSRs).
162 


 High level of 
public and private debt and high unemployment rates 
are weighing on the ability of the economy to recover 
and call for renewed reform impetus. Despite some 

adjustment of imbalances in recent years, furth
er 
structural reforms would increase resilience to any 
future adverse shock and increase the countries™ 
capacity to grow. 
 


. The tr
ack 
records for implementing both the OECD™s Going for 
Growth recommendations and the CSRs indicate that 
major reforms have not taken place in recent years. 

While these countries are less prone to shocks, the lack 
of structural reforms reduces their economic growth, 
and to some extent also the economic growth of the 
euro area overall (see in more detail Section 
4).  4 Facilitating a smooth functioning of EMU
 



Structural reforms in one member country can have a positive 
impact on the euro area as a whole, although the effect will probably be relatively 
small.
163 If necessary structural reforms are not made, however, this could 
undermine the smooth functioning of EMU, as it is likely to increase the 
vulnerabilities of the countries in question and thereby make the euro area as a 

whole more susceptible to adverse shocks.

The 
increased 
interdependence that
 arises
 from sharing a 
single
 c
urrency and monetary policy
 calls for greater 
scrutiny of national economic policies
 in the euro area. 
As a lesson from the crisis, the governance framework 
has been strengthened. As regards the proper 
functioning of economic structures, the creation of th
e macroeconomic imbalance procedure (MIP) and the 

reinforced country
-specific (reform) recommendations 
were meant to ensure sufficient reform momentum. Like 

CSRs, the MIP applies to all EU countries but is of 

particular importance for the euro area countries, as it 
provides a surveillance framework for ensuring that 
harmful imbalances do not endanger the smooth 
functioning of EMU. 
 





. As outlined, for example, in the Five 

Presidents™ Report, the full application of the existing governance tools is essential to 
facilitating reform efforts and ensuring a smooth functioning of EMU. Yet, as regards 
the MIP, despite the identification of excessive imbalances in an increasing number 

of countries over several years (
see 
Chart 11), the
 corrective arm (the excessive 
imbalance procedure) has not been applied so far. The full application of the 

corrective arm of the MIP, including the
 agreement of corrective action plans with the 

countries concerned, could facilitate the timely correction of excessive imbalances 
and increase the reform momentum. The current framework, if fully applied, could 
improve the scrutiny of national economic po
licies in the short term.
 




. This new convergence process towards more resilient economic 
struc
tures would help to outline a clear path of reforms which 
would
 increase the 
resilience of euro area countries and the euro area as a whole.
 A first step in this 
respect was taken with the European Commission™s communication of 21 October 
2015, which suggests progressively identifying best practices and carrying out cross
-examinations across policy or thematic areas in the application of the governance 
framework. The implementation of such best practices would increase the resilience 
and the growth potential of euro area countries as described in Section 3.
 5 Conclusion
 



. It has discussed 
how improving national institutions and economic structures can lead to a double

the macroeconomic imbalance procedure since 2012

 Note: The chart counts for each year the countries which the European Commission 
deemed to exhibit ﬁexcessive imbalancesﬂ. Countries under an economic adjustment 

programme enter the MIP automatically after the end of their programme. In 2014 
Ireland, in 20
15 Portugal, and in 2016 Cyprus were added to the procedure.

 96 dividend by raising individual countries™ well
-being and improving the smooth 
functioning of EMU. While there is ample empirical evidence for this double div
idend, 
reform progress towards best practices has, overall, been relatively modest since the 
inception of EMU. This comes at a high cost. Weak trend GDP and employment 

growth seem to be caused predominantly by relatively weak national institutions and 
rigi
d market structures and thus a lack of proper structural and institutional reforms. 
After a strong pick
-up in reform momentum between 2011 and 2013, particularly in 
the countries involved in adjustment programmes, there seems to have been a 

return to the slow pace observed in the pre
-crisis period. However, this slowdown 
seems unjustified in the light of the performance of the euro area countries 
compared with peer OECD countries.
 
. This is a 
concern as productivity growth remains weak and the stock of debt, in particular 
public and non
-performing private debt, is elevated and only declining at a slow 
pace. Fostering reform implementation is one of the objectives of the new economic 
governance 
structure. However, this objective has hardly been met during the first 
four years of application of the MIP. A more forceful application of the economic 

governance instruments is essential if the timeline for completing EMU proposed in 

the Five Presidents™ Report is to be met.
