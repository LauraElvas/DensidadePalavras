 Summary
 The information that has become available since early September confirm
ed a continued moderate but steady recovery of the euro area economy and a gradual 
rise in inflation, in line with previous expectations. The euro area economy has 

continued to show resilience to the adverse effects of global economic and political 
uncertain
ty, aided by the ECB
™s 
comprehensive monetary policy measures, which 
ensure very favourable financing conditions for firms and households. Overall, 
however, the baseline scenario remain
s 
subject to downside risks.
 Available global indicators point to a modest rebound in global activity and trade 
growth in the third quarter. At the same time, global headline inflation 
has remained 
at low levels as past energy price declines 
have weighed
 on price increases. Risks 
to the outlook for global activity remain on the downside and relate in particular to 
political uncert
ainty and financial imbalances.
 Since early
 September, sovereign yields have risen and the EONIA forward curve 
has edged upwards
, with yields on
 intermediate maturities
 in particular reaching 
level
s 
close to those reached after the UK referendum on EU membership
 in late 
June
. Corporate bond spreads rose marginally and overall remained significantly 

lower than in early March 2016, when the 
corporate sector purchase programme
 was announced. Equity prices have declined marginally, with valuations in the 

banking sector remaining particularly depressed relative to early 2016
.  
The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. Looking ahead, the economic 
expansion 
is expected to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Domestic demand 

should be supported by the pass
-through of 
the 
ECB™s monetary policy measures to 
the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate 

profitability continue to promote a recovery in investment. Moreover, still relatively 

low oil prices and sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past 
structural reforms, provide additional support for households™ real disposable income 
and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area will be 

broadly neutral in 2017. However, the economic recovery in the euro area is 
expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, the necessary balance 
sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of 

structural reforms. The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the 

downside and relate mainly to the external environment.
 According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation in September 2016 was 

0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. This reflected mainly a continued increase in annual 

energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in 
underlying inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, inflation 
rates are likely to pick up over the next couple of months, in large part owing to base

 3 effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Supported by the ECB
™s 
monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, inflation rates 
should increase further in 2017 and 2018.
 The monetary policy measures 
put 
in place since June 2014 have contributed to an 
improv
ement in
 borrowing conditions, as well as credit flows
, across the euro area, 
thereby supporting the 
economic recovery. 
In particular, the
 euro area bank lending 
survey for the third quarter of 2016 indicate
d 
that the ECB™s asset purchase 

programme and the negative deposit facility rate had contributed to more favourable 

terms and conditions on loans.
 At the same time, banks 
have 
continued to report 
improving loan demand, amid further declines in
 bank lending rates 
that reached
 historical lows in August 2016.
 Thus the recovery in loan growth 
has 
continued at a 
moderate pace, despite losing some
 momentum over the summer period. With 
respect to market
-based financing, the net issuance of debt securities by non
-financial corporations strengthened markedly in September 2016
.  
 At its meeting on 20 October 2016
, 
based on 
the
 regular economic and monetary 
analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the
 key ECB interest 
rates
 unchanged. 
The Governing Council continue
s 
to expect the key ECB interest 
rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well 

past the horizon of 
the 
net asset purchases. Regarding
 non-standard monetary 
policy measures, the Governing Council confirm
ed that the monthly asset purchases 
of •80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if 

necessary, 
and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment 

in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
 Looking ahead, the Governing Council remains committed to preserving the very 

substantial degree of monetary accommodation which is necessary to secure a 

sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the 
medium term. To that end, the Governing Council will continue to act, if warranted, 
by using all the instruments available within its mandate. In December the Governing 

Council™s assessment will benefit from the new staff macroeconomic projections 
extending through to 2019 and from the work of the Eurosystem committees on the 
options to ensure the smooth implementation of the purchase programme u
ntil 
March 2017, or beyond, if necessary.

The global composite output

increased marginally further in September
 2016, with

Global financial conditions have remained favourable.
 EMEs have continued to 
benefit from 
improvements in 
risk sentiment
, with 
capital flows to 
such countries
 proving
 resilient amid a broad
-based improvement in financial conditions
. Global risk 
appetite has, in part,
 been buoyed by central bank action in 
some
 major advanced 
economies. 
In August, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England cut 
interest rates and announced further quantitative easing. 
In September, the Bank of 
Japan
™s Policy Board
 decided to increase further its
 monetary accommodation, 
introducing what it termed ﬁquantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield 

curve controlﬂ. It also committed
 itself to expanding
 the monetary base until the 
observed rate of 
inflation exceeds 
its price stability target and remains above that 
level
 in a stable manner.
 In the United States, on the other hand, the Federal 
Reserve

the 
base effects of past declines 
in 
commodity price

increase in headline inflation in the months ahead, the presen
ce of 
ample spare 
capacity will continue to weigh on global inflation over the medium term.

Annual CPI inflation

on the back of the recent depreciation of the pound sterling. Indeed, 
recent data on input prices point to the build

 The Chinese economy is continuing to expand at a robust pace. 
The latest 
data 
confirm stable GDP growth of 6.7% year on year in the third quarter, mainly driven by 
consumption, while the contribution of gross fixed capital formation decreased 
slightly compared with the second quarter, in line with a slow rebalancing of the 
econ
omy. Net exports remained a small drag on growth. House price
s 
in 
larger cities 
have been rising sharply, at rates of around 
30% 
year on year. As a result, some 
local authorities have started to impose restrictions
 on purchases
. Meanwhile, in

. Inflation picked

 Long-term euro area government bond yields have risen since early 
September. 
During the review period (8 September to 19 October 2016), ten
-year 
sovereign yields increased by between 6 and 30 basis points. Overall, sovereign 
spreads vis
-à-v
is the German Bund ten
-year rate remained broadly stable in most 
countries, with the exception of Greece and Italy where they rose by 12 and 21 basis 
points respectively.
 Euro area equity prices have been broadly stable 
since early September. 
At the end of the review period 
the euro area equity index still remained around 3% 
below its level just before the UK referendum on EU 
membership and 2% lower than in early 2016. 
Profitability concerns, as well as country and bank
-specific events, continued to weigh on the euro area 
banking sector. On 19 October, bank equity prices were 
around 20% lower than in early 2016 (see Chart 3). 

Equity prices declined in the United States by around 
2% over the review period while they remained broadly 
stable in Japan and rose by over 2% in the United 

Kingdom. Market expectations of equity price volatility 
rema
ined overall stable in the euro area and were 
significantly lower than the relative peak reached in late 
June on account of the UK referendum.
 Spreads on bonds issued by non
-financial 
corporations halted the downward trend prevailing 
since the Governing Co
uncil™s announcement of the corporate sector 
purchase programme (CSPP) in March.
 After a phase of declining yields which 
started in early March 
Œ 
including a short
-lived reversal in June attributable to the 
tensions sparked by the UK referendum 
Œ 
spreads on issues by euro area non
-financial corporations (NFCs) have risen marginally across all rating classes
 since 
early September. Nevertheless, on 19 October, NFC bond spreads were, depending 
on the rating, 15
-50 basis points lower than in early March, when the Governing 
Council announced the launch of the CSPP. In the financial sector, bond spreads 
also rose slightly across all rating classes during the review period. The diverging 
behaviour of bank equities 
Œ 
which have recorded a significant decline since e
arly 
2016 Œ 
and financial bond spreads indicates that profitability concerns, rather than 
perceptions of increased default risks among financial institutions, continue to be a 
key factor behind developments in the banking sector.
 In foreign exchange market
s, the euro 
was broadly stable 
in trade
-weighted 
terms.
 In bilateral terms, since 8 September, the euro 
has 
appreciated by 
5.7
% against the pound sterling, amid 
continued 
uncertainty after the outcome of the UK 
referendum.
 It also appreciated vis

 The economic recovery in the euro area 
is continuing
, 
notwithstanding some 
weather
-induced volatility in the first half of 2016. 
Real GDP increased by 0.
3%, 
quarter on quarter,
 in the 
second
 quarter
 of 2016
 on the back of a modest 
contribution from domestic demand, alongside a stronger contribution from net trade 
(see Chart 5). By contrast, changes in inventories contributed negatively to GDP 

growth in the second quarter. The latest economic indicators, hard data as well as 
survey results 
have 
continued to 
show resilience
 and point to ongoing moderate 
growth in the third quarter.
 Consumer spending, 
which 
has been 
the main 
driver of the ongoing recovery,
 continued to 
contribute positively to GDP growth in the first half 
of 2016
. Private consumption growth eased to 0.2%, 
quarter on quarter, in the second quarter. This 
slowd
own should be seen in the light of the strong 
outcome in the first quarter, when consumption rose by 
0.6% on a quarterly basis. The lower consumption 
growth in the second quarter mirrored a rise in the 
saving ratio as real income growth continued to hold u
p. 

Indeed, 
during the ongoing recovery 
consumer 
spending has been benefiting from rising real 

disposable income among households, which primarily 

reflects rising employment and low oil prices. 
Households™ real gross disposable income grew in 
the 
second 
quarter of 2016,
 by 
2.5
% 
year
 on year
, which is 
the highest growth rate in 15 years
. Households™ 
balance sheets have also become less constrained. 
Household
 debt-to
-income ratios have continuously 
been decreasing in the ongoing recovery, thereby 

supporting
 overall consumption growth.
 Going forward, consumption should continue to grow at a steady pace. 
After 
improving in the second quarter of 2016, consumer confidence declined somewhat in 

the third quarter 
Œ 
a slowdown that may partly be attributable to 
the 
UK referendum 
outcome and recent terror
ist attacks. However, consumer sentiment 
still 
remains 
above its long
-term average. Data on retail trade (up to August 2016) and new 
passenger car registrations (up to September 2016) are in line with positive growth 
in 
consumer spending in the third quarter, possibly at a somewhat stronger rate than in 

the second quarter. Moreover, further employment growth, as suggested by 
the 
latest 
survey indicators, should also continue to support consumer spending.
 Investment activity slowed in the second quarter after the positive weather 
effect on construction activities in the first quarter
. 
Total investment displayed 
zero growth, quarter on quarter, in 
the second
 quarter of
 2016 reflecting a rise in 
non-construction investment, offset by a decline in construction investment. Rising 
investment in transport equipment made up virtually all of the increase

ing the remaining part. 
Construction 
investment
 contracted by 0.4% in the second quarter, following three consecutive 
quarters of growth. T
his 
slowdown was largely driven by investment in Germany as a 
result of the fading
-away of the weather effect that had
 a strong upward impact on 
the outcome for the first quarter.
 Incoming information suggests that 
business investment grew moderately
 in the third quarter of 2016
, while construction investment picked up.
 The weak 
growth in business investment is backed up
 by data on the industrial production of 
capital goods, which grew only weakly in July and August compared with the second 
quarter. Moreover
, confidence in the capital goods sector was
, on average
, lower in 
the third quarter than in the second quarter and the assessment of order books in the 
capital goods sector remained subdued in the third quarter, particularly 
for 
orders 
from abroad, suggesting some adverse impact from the weak international 
environment. 
With regard to construction investment, u
nderlying factors 
such as 
building
 permits
 granted, the demand situation in the sector
 and the assessment of 
order books signal a continuation of the recovery going forward
. In addition, more 

timely monthly production data, alongside survey results, point to a rebound in 

construction activity in the third quarter of this year.
 The recovery in business investment is expected to continue
 beyond the next 
quarter
. Support to business investment is expected from demand, accommodative 
monetary policy as well as favourable financing conditions and replacement needs. 
Improving profits should also support total investment going forward
. Downside risks 
to the 
business investment outlook
 relate to the international environment, including 
uncertainties surrounding ﬁBrexitﬂ.
 Euro 
area 
total 
export
s showed some strength in the second quarter of 2016, 
but monthly extra
-euro area goods 
trade 
data point so far to a weak third 
quarter
. Monthly trade outcomes for August suggest that extra
-euro area goods 
exports rebounded somewhat compared with the same period in 2015 (in three
-month
-on-three
-month moving average terms). However, extra
-euro area export 
growth still remains weak by historical standards. Among the emerging market 
economies, growth in exports to China 
decelerated
, while
 goods exports to Russia 
and Latin America declined
. 
As for 
the advanced economies,
 exports to
 the United 
States
 made a negative contribution,
 whereas exports to non
-euro area Europe are 
likely to have contributed positively. Looking ahead, the slight appreciation of the 
effective exchange rate of the euro since the beginning of 2016 is expected to weigh 
on euro area exports.
 In addition, exports may be negatively affected by the 
possible 
consequences 
for global trade flows of the UK referendum
 outcome. M
ore timely 
indicators
, such as surveys
, signal 
continued subdued developments
 in foreign 
demand
, although export orders seem to have improved somewhat in the third 
quarter.
 Overall, the latest 
economic 
indicators are
, on balance, 
consistent 
with 
ongoing modera
te real GDP growth
 in the 
third 
quarter of 
2016. Industrial

which is 2.0 percentage points below its most recent

. This decline has been 
broad
-based across gender and age groups.
 Moreover, 
long-term unemployment (those who have been 
unemployed for at least 12 months) continues to 
decrease slowly
, but 
remains above 5% of the labour 
force
. More timely survey results point to further labour 
market improvements in the period ahead.
 Looking ahead, the economic expansion is 

expected to proceed at a moderate 
but
 steady pace
. Domestic demand should be supported by the pass
-through of the monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable financing 

conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote a 
recovery in investment. Moreover, still relatively low oil prices and sustained 

employment gains, which are also associated with past structural reforms, provide 
additional support for households™ real disposable income and private consumption. 
In addition, the 
aggregate 
fiscal stance in the euro area will
 likely
 be broadly neutral 
in 2017. However, the economic recovery is expected to be dampened by still 
subdued foreign demand, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of 
sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms. The risks to the 

euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the 
external environment. The results of the latest round of the 
ECB™s Survey of 
Professional Forecasters
, conducted in early October, show that private sector GDP 
growth forecasts were broadly unchanged compared with the previous round 
condu
cted in early July.

Headline inflation increased further 
in recent months.
 The upward trend in 
headline inflation observed since the recent low of 
-0.2% in April 2016 mainly reflects 
the waning impact of past declines in oil prices (see
 Chart 7)
. Most measures of
 underlying inflation do not show 
any clear signs of an upward trend.
 Following 
increase
s 
in the first half of 2015, annual HICP 
inflation 
excluding food and energy has hovered around the 1% 
mark since then. Similarly, other measures of 
underlying inflatio
n have show
n 
no clear signs of 
upward momentum either. This 
may
, in
 part
, be
 due to 
the indirect 
downward effects of past sharp declines in 

the
 prices 
of oil and other commodities, which 

materialise with a lag. More fundamentally, domestic 
cost pressures
 Œ 
particular
ly wage grow
th 
Œ 
have 
remained subdued.
 Import price inflation remains negative, while 
producer price inflation continues to be fairly 
stable. 
The a
nnual growth 
rate of import prices for 
non-food 
consumer goods
 decreased slightly further to 
stan
d at 
-1.4% in August, down
 from 
-1.3
% in 
July.
 Further along the pricing chain, producer prices for 
domestic sales
 of non
-food consumer goods remained 
broadly stable, with the
ir annual growth rate 
standing at 0.1% in August
, 
up slightly 
from the 0.0% observed in July
. While 
the
 improvement
s seen
 in economic 
conditions 
are
 likely to have exerted upward pressure on producer prices, this may 
have been offset
 by low commodity
-related
 input prices
 and global disinflationary 
pressures more generally
. Wage growth has remained subdued
. Annual growth in compensation per 
employee declined slightly to stand at 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016, down 

from 1.2% in the previous quarter. Wage growth probably continued to be dampened 
by significant slack in the labour market, weak productivity growth, low inflation and 
the ongoing impact of labour market reforms implemented in some countries during 
the financial and economic crisis.

 5Broad money growth remained 
robust
. The annual growth rate of M3
 stood at 
5.1% in August, after 4.9% in July, having hovered around 5% since April 2015 
(see 
Chart 
9). 
Growth in M3 continued to be driven 
by 
its
 most liquid components
, given 
the 
low opportunity cost of holding 
liquid
 deposits
 in an environment of very low 
interest rates and a flat yield curve
. 
After a series of slowdowns from its peak in July 
2015, annual
 M1 growth edged up to 8.9%, from 8.4% in July.
 Broad money growth continued to be driven by 
domestic sources of money creation.
 Purchases of 
debt securities in the context of the public sector 
purchase programme (PSPP) continued to have a 
considerable positive impact on M3 growth (see the 
orange bars in Chart 9)
. By contrast, the contribution of 
credit from monetary financial institutions excluding the 
Eurosystem to general government continued to be 
negative (see the green bars in Chart 9)
. 
 Domestic counterparts other than credit to general 
government 
also 
exerted a positive impact on M3 
growth
 (see the blue bars in Chart 9). On the one 
hand, this reflects the gradual recovery in the growth of 
credit to the private sector. On the other hand, the 
significantly negative
 annual rate of change 
in MFIs™ 
longer
-term financial liabilities (excluding capital and 
reserves) 
continued to support M3 growth
. T
his
 is partly 
explained by the flatness of the yield curve, linked to 
the ECB™s monetary policy measures, which has 
made 
it less favourable
 for investors to hold 
long
-term deposits and bank bonds
. 
The attractiveness of the targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations
 (TLTROs) 
as an 
alternative to longer
-term market
-based bank funding
 has also played a role
.  The MFI sector™s net external asset position continued to weigh on annual M3 
growth
 (see the yellow bars in Chart 9).
 This development 
reflect
s ongoing
 capital 
outflows from the euro area and portfolio rebalancing in favour of non
-euro area 
instruments
, in particular
 euro area government bonds sold by non
-residents under 
the PSPP
 (see also Box 2 entitled ﬁTARGET balances and the asset purchase 
programmeﬂ
 in this issue of the Economic Bulletin
). The recovery in l
oan 
growth continued at a moderate pace.
 The annual growth 
rate of MFI loans to the private sector (adjusted for sales
, securitisation
 and notional 
cash pooling
) was stable 
in 
August
 (see Chart 
10), for
 both 
loans to 
non-financial 
corporations (NFCs)
 and loans to households. While the gradual recovery in loan 
dynamics los
t some of its
 momentum 
over
 the summer period, it continues to be 
supported by 
significant decreases 
in bank lending rates since s

(notably owing to the ECB™s monetary policy measures)
, as well as
 by improvements 
in the demand for bank loans. At the same time, the ongoing consolidation of

 15 financial and non
-financial
 balance sheets and the need for adjustment of bank 
busines
s models
 in some 
countries
 remain a drag on
 loan growth.
 The 
October 2016 euro area bank lending survey
 suggests 
that 
loan growth continue
d 
to be 
supported by increasing demand across all loan 
categories in the third quarter of 2016
. 
Credit 

standards remained unchanged
 for loans to 

enterprises, following a net easing from the second 

quarter of 2014, but eased for loans to households. 
Competitive pressures and, to a lesser extent, lower 
risk perceptions continued to have an easing impact on 

credit standards for loans to both enterprises and 
households.
 Banks 
also indicate
d that the ECB™s asset 
purchase programme (APP) had had a net
 easing 

impact on
 credit 
terms and conditions, and that the 
ECB™s negative deposit facility rate had had a positive 
impact on lending volumes
. At the same time, banks 
reported a negative impact on their margins as a result 

of the APP
 and the negative deposit facility rate.
 Bank lending rates 
on loans to NFCs and 
households
 fell to a new historical low in August 
(see Chart 1
1).
 Composite lending rates for NFCs and 
households have de
creased 
by significantly more than 
market reference rates since the announcement of the 

ECB™s credit easing measures in June 2014. 
Decrease
s 
in bank
s™ composite funding costs
, to which the funding 
cost relief provided by the TLTROs contributed,
 have supported the decline in composite lending rates.
 Between May 2014 and August 2016 composite 
lending rates on loans to euro area NFCs and 
households fell by 110 basis points and around 100 

basis points r
espectively.
 The decline 
in bank lending 
rates
 over this period was stronger in vulnerable euro 
area countries than in other euro area countries, 

indicating an
 improvement in the pass
-through of 
monetary policy measures to bank lending rates. Over 

the same
 period, the spread between interest rates 

charged on very small loans (loans of up to •0.25 
million) and those charged on large loans (loans of 
above •1 million)
 in the euro area followed a downward 
path. 
This 
generally 
indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises 
have
 benefited
 to a 
greater
 extent than large 
companies
 from the decline in
 lending rates.
 The declines in banks™ funding costs and bank lending rates
 have helped
 to mitigat
e 
asymmetries 
that existed across euro area countries and 
have reduced 
fragmentation in funding cost and lending conditions.

 16 The net issuance of debt securities by NFCs strengthened markedly in 
September 2016, after having been rather subdued in July and August
. 
The 
latest official ECB data show that issuance activity
 remained
 muted 
in July
 and August
. This was 
due to seasonal factors, 
and preliminary data suggest that it 
strengthened markedly again in September 2016, with the rise being 
broadly based 
across countries. Overall, the issuance activity from March to September is 

estimated to have exceeded by a considerable margin the levels observed in the 

same period of 2015. Issuance was supported by, among other 
factors
, the ECB™s 
corporate bond purchases. The issuance of quoted shares by NFCs has remained 
fairly modest
 in recent months.
 Financing costs for euro area NFCs remain favourable. 
Nominal financing costs 

for euro area NFCs continue to be
 very favourable, although they are estimated to 
have increased slightly in August
-September 2016, after reaching a new histor
ical 
low in July. The increase was attributable to a rise in the cost of equity financing. 
However, the cost of market
-based debt financing has stabilised at very low levels in 
recent months as a consequence of the ECB™s latest non
-standard monetary policy
 measures and the 
overall 
decline in global bond yields.

 1 Economic developments in the aftermath of the 
UK 
referendum on EU membership
 This box 
analyses recent developments 
and the outlook for the UK economy 
and the euro area following the outcome
 of the referendum on EU membership 
held on 23 June 2016.
2 A majority of around 52% voted in favour of the United 
Kingdom leaving the EU. The Prime Minister recently indicated that, by March 2017, 
the country will formally notify the European Council of its intention to withdraw from 
the EU. According to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, this would start a 
process culminating in a withdrawal agreement between the EU and the United 

Kingdom. Failing that, the E
U Treaties would cease to apply to the United Kingdom 
two years after the notification triggering Article 50, unless the European Council, in 

agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decided to extend this period. At 

present, hig
h 
uncertainty
 surrounds
 the United Kingdom™s future economic 
relationship with the EU, in particular its future access to the Single Market.
 Despite heightened uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, 

economic activity 
in the United Kingdom 
has so far been resil
ient. 
Private 
consumption
 appears to have been particularly robust. In fact, the GfK consumer 
confidence indicators rebounded in August and September, following strong declines 
immediately after the referendum (
see 
Chart A). Retail sales have
 also held up 
relatively well.
 However, uncertainty appears to have weighed on investment, as 

shown by the drop in investment sentiment indicators 
(see 
Chart B).
 Looking at the
 foreign exchange markets, the outcome of the referendum took 
many market participants by surp
rise.
 The pound sterling depreciated sharply in 
the days following the referendum before stabilising somewhat during the summer 
(see Chart 
C). In September and, in particular, early October, the pound sterling 
weakened
 further
, as political announcements in the United Kingdom were widely 
interpreted as decreasing the likelihood of the country retaining Single Market 

access in the future. Overall, the pound sterling has depreciated by around 1
4% in 
nominal effective terms since the referendum.
                                                                     2

 Other financial markets have weathered the rise in 
uncertainty relatively well.
 Stock markets have 
recovered from their abrupt decline in the days 
following
 the referendum. Yields on gilts and private 
bonds stand below their pre

althoug
h they increased somewhat on the back of the 

above

October.
 In August the Bank of England cut Bank Rate
 by 25 basis points to 0.25%, expanded its asset 

purchase programme and launched 
a 
Term Funding 
Scheme to support the interest rate pass
-through
 to the 
economy
. Furthermore, the new Chancellor of the 
Exchequer has abandoned the objective of achieving a 
fiscal surplus by 2019
-20 and stated the government™s 
readiness to reset fiscal policy if needed.
 Looking ahead, 
economic activity is 
generally 
expected to slow down.
 Recent forecasts for real 
GDP growth have
 been revised down significantly since the referendum (
see Table 
A). These projections entail a marked economic downturn, with real GDP growth in 

2017 falling to
 levels ranging from 0.8% to 1.1%. Indeed, heightened uncertainty 
is likely to
 continue to weigh on investment in the future. Moreover, the recent 
sharp 
depreciation of the pound sterling (see Chart C) will gradually erode real incomes, 
dragging down private consumption
 while supporting net exports. Over the longer 
run, output 
growth is 
generally 
expected to remain below the path projected before 
the referendum. This partly reflects the transition to a less open economy (in
 terms of 
trade, migration and foreign direct investment), which adversely affects innovation,

 While inflation currently stands at low levels, it is 
expected to 
rise
 in the near term
. In September 
annual consumer price inflation increased to
 1%, 
still
 
below the Bank of England™s target of 2% (
see Chart 
D). However, indicators of pipeline price pressures, 
such as the PMI indicator 
for
 input prices, have 
increased over recent months, along with import prices. 
The pipeline price pressures mainly reflect the sharp 
depreciation of the pound sterling over recen
t months. 
Market
-based inflation expectations have also edged 
up. Turning to the euro area
 economy
, recent data 
release
s 
have overall shown resilience and a

 TARGET balances and the asset purchase programme
 20 2 TARGET balances and the asset purchase programme
 TARGET balances have seen renewed increases since the launch of the 
Eurosystem™s
 asset purchase programme (APP; see Chart A).
4 TARGET 
balances are the claims and liabilities of euro area national central banks (NCBs) vis
-à-
vis the ECB that result from cross
-border payments settled in central bank money.
5 Each NCB has either a positive
 balance (i.e. a claim in TARGET) or a negative 

balance (i.e. a liability in TARGET). When a country™s banking sector receives a 
cross
-border inflow of central bank money, its claim increases or its liability 
decreases; cross
-border outflows have the oppos
ite effect. The total TARGET 
balance, which is the sum of all positive balances,
6 is only affected when central 
bank money flows between countries with positive and negative balances.
7 The 
launch of the APP has led to a rise in 
cross
-border 
payments by purchasing central 
banks, which has caused renewed increases in the total TARGET balance.

 Notes: 
The total TARGET balance is the sum of all positive TARGET balances.
 The red and yel
low vertical lines denote the 
commencement of purchases under the APP and the PSPP respectively.
 Cross
-border APP transactions are common owing to the integrated nature of 
euro area financial markets and give rise to changes in TARGET balances. 
Securities 
transactions are not limited by national borders under the APP, with 
                                                                    4  
ﬁTARGETﬂ stands for ﬁTrans
-European Automated Real
-time Gross settlement Express Transfer 
systemﬂ. In May 2008, TARGET2 fully replaced the original TARGET system as the real
-time gross 
settlement system owned and operated by the Eurosystem. In the interest
s of readability, however, the 
term ﬁTARGET balancesﬂ is used here to describe the balances accumulated by central banks in both 
of those systems, and the TARGET2 payment system is also referred to as ﬁTARGETﬂ.
 5  
For more details, see the box entitled ﬁPu
blication of TARGET balancesﬂ,

 6  
This is equal in magnitude to the sum of all negative balances
. Total claims and liabilities sum to zer
o, 
since all obligations resulting from activity in TARGET are owed by and to pa
rticipants in the system.
 7  
The total TARGET balance increases if central bank money flows from a country with a liability to a 

country with a claim, and it decreases if that money flows in the opposite direction. By contrast, flows 

between two countries with claims (or two countries with liabilities) change the composition, but not the 

value, of the total TARGET balance.

 TARGET balances and the asset purchase programme
 21 central banks purchasing securities from a wide range of counterparties located 
across the euro area and beyond. When a central bank purchases securities, it 
makes a payment in central bank money to the selling counterparty at the time of 
settlement, receiving the security in exchange.
8 In the case of a cross
-border 
transaction,
9 that liquidity flow affects the TARGET balances of the sending and 
receiving NCBs and may potentially alter the
 total TARGET balance. Consequently, 

the location of the TARGET accounts used by APP counterparties to receive 

payment for securities determines the impact that asset purchases have on TARGET 

balances immediately following the purchase.
10  Asset purchases from counterparties located in a different country from the 

purchasing central bank can directly affect TARGET balances. 
Counterparties 
whose NCBs are connected to TARGET use their accounts at those NCBs,
11 while 
counterparties located elsewhere can use an account at a correspondent bank with 

access to TARGET.
12 Banks based outside the euro area tend to make payments in 
TARGET via branches or correspondent banks in countries with claims in TARGET, 
such as Germany or the Netherlands.
13 It follows that when an NCB purchases 
securities from a non
-domestic counterparty, whether it is located in another euro 
area country or outside the euro area, the purchase is likely to give rise to cross
-border flows of central bank money.
14  A very large majority of APP purchases involve counterparties located in a 
different country from the purchasing central bank. 
In volume terms, around 
80% of all APP purchases have involved non
-domestic counterparties.
15 Furthermore, around 50% of APP purchases have involved sellers resident outside 

the euro area. This has given rise to substantial cross
-border flows of central bank 
money, affecting national TARGET balances and leading to structural inflows of 
central bank money in countries hosting large numbers of non
-resident 
counterparties (such as Germany).
                                                                     8  
The selling counterparty may not necessarily be the legal owner of the security. Counterparties can 
also act as intermediaries, holdi
ng securities and managing transactions on behalf of owners.
 9  
This is defined as a transaction where money is credited to an account held by the seller at a central 

bank other than the purchasing NCB.
 10  
Settlement can take place in the TARGET account us
ed by the selling counterparty or the TARGET 
account of a custodian bank or central securities depository. The analysis in this box is based on the 

assumption that liquidity from APP purchases flows to the TARGET account used by the counterparty. 

This is a
 simplifying hypothesis adopted in order to simulate liquidity distribution resulting directly from 
purchases.
 11  
This includes euro area
-resident branches of banking groups headquartered outside the euro area. 
Furthermore, f
ive non
-euro area countries cur
rently participate in TARGET: Bulgaria, Denmark, Croatia, 
Poland and Romania.
 12  
Banks with branches that are in the European Economic Area, but outside the euro area, can also hold 

an account at a Eurosystem NCB as a direct participant in TARGET.
 13  
For a
 more detailed discussion on the subject of non
-euro area banks with accounts at Eurosystem 
NCBs, see ﬁThe impact of Eurosystem securities purchases on the TARGET2 balancesﬂ, 
Monthly 
Report
, Deutsche Bundesbank, March 2016. The locations of participation in TARGET by non
-euro 
area banks typically reflect historical relationships with euro area branches or correspondent banks, 

and have remained largely unchanged since the TARGET2 payment system was set up in 2007/08.
 14  
The ECB also purchases securities under the APP, which are recorded as flows from the ECB to the 

sellers™ NCBs. As a result, the ECB™s liability in TARGET has increased since the launch of the APP.
 15  
In this context, ﬁnon
-domesticﬂ refers to a counterparty that is located in a country which i
s different 
from that of the purchasing NCB. This includes counterparties located in other euro area countries.

 22 Analysis of data on individual APP transactions indicates that the upward 
trend observed in TARGET balances largely reflects 
cross
-border liquidity 
flows arising from the settlement of APP purchases. 
Chart B shows the evolution 
of the total TARGET balance since the launch of the public sector purchase 

programme (PSPP) in March 2015, which has led to a sizeable increase in the

can further 
affect
 TARGET balances, the first

 In contrast to previous periods of rising TARGET balances, changes in the 
TARGET balances immediately after APP purchases are a direct consequenc
e of the implementation of monetary policy decisions, rather than a symptom of 
renewed stress in financial markets. 
TARGET balances increased from mid
-2007 to late 2008, and again from mid
-2011 to mid
-2012. The increases in TARGET 
balances during those periods were rooted in the market stress and fragmentation 

that resulted from the financial and sovereign debt crises.
16 As banks lost access to 
market
-based funding, they replaced private sources of funding with central bank 
liquidity obtained from their NCBs
 through repurchase operations.

 23 repurchase operations had no immediate impact on TARGET balances, as they were 
settled domestically,
18 but the subsequent redistribution of liquidity, influenced by 
market stress and fragmentation, did have an impact. The link between the 

implementation of monetary policy decisions and TARGET balances was therefore 

indirect. With the APP, however, there is a direct link, since central banks are 
initiating cross
-border payments in order to pay for securities purchased under the 
programme. T
he ensuing upward trend in TARGET balances largely reflects the 
settlement of these cross
-border transactions by central banks and, therefore, does 
not signal renewed stress in financial markets.
                                                                       18  
When reserves are injected via repurchase agreements, the NCB records a liability in the form of an 
increase in current accounts of commercial banks and records an asset in the form of lending 

operations.

 Recent developments in euro area residential property prices
 24 3 Recent developments in euro area residential property 
prices 
The upturn in euro area house prices has continued in the first half of this 
year. 
According to the ECB™s aggregate residential property price indicator, the 
annual growth rate in euro area house prices was 3.0% in the second quarter of 
2016, up from 2.7% in the previous quarter and 2.2% in the last quarter of 2015.
19 This points to a continuation of the upturn that started in early 2014 after the house 
price index reached a low (see Chart A). The annual growth rates are now back
 to 
the longer
-term average.

 Note: The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2016. 
 Developments in euro area residential property prices are still heterogen
eous 
across countries, but the differences are narrowing
. 
The dispersion appears to 
have diminished over time, reflecting the fading
-out of adjustments and corrections in 
housing markets in a number of countries after the 2007
-08 financial crisis. This 
narr
owing dispersion not only reflects the fact that fewer countries have recorded 
extreme high or low growth rates than previously, but also that the core of the 
distribution of residential property price growth rates is more compact (see Chart B). 
Neverthele
ss, the upturn in house prices has been taking place at different growth 

rates across countries. Looking beyond shorter
-term volatility in house price growth, 
countries that have been at the upper end of the spectrum of average annual growth 

rates in nominal house prices since early 2014 include Germany, Estonia, Ireland, 
                                                                    19  
According to Eurostat™s House Pric
e Index (HPI) released in October, house prices in the euro area 
increased by 2.9% year on year in the second quarter of 2016, decelerating slightly from 3.1% in the 
first quarter. While Eurostat™s HPI is broadly similar to the ECB™s residential property p
rice indicator, the 

HPI refers to different country indicators for some euro area countries.

21 Upturns in house price cycles have often come to an end because 
expansions developed into outright booms with unsustainable valuations. Valuation 
measures applied to euro area aggregate data suggest that prices are currently 

broadly in line with fundamentals and show no signs of the excess seen in 2007, i.e. 
at the end of the previous major upturn (see Chart D).

 Exchange rate pass

 27 Articles
  Exchange
 rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 1Exchange rate movements are one factor affecting inflation in the euro area. The 
exchange rate can influence euro area inflation both directly via the price of imported 
final consumer goods, and indirectly via the price of imported intermediate goods 
used in euro area domestic production. Empirical studies have shown that exchange 

rates have a stronger and more immediate effect on import prices than on final 
consumer prices. Moreover, the size and speed of the exchange rate effects differ 
across product categories. The macroeconomic environment, factors affecting 

pricing decisions at the firm level and the shocks driving the exchange rate 
movements determine the strength of the exchange rate effects on inflation. Over 
time, the size of exchange rate pass
-through is documented to have declined in 
the 
euro area and other advanced economies. This decline can be attributed
 to several 
factors
, including
 the 
low inflation environment prevailing in many economies over 
the 
past two decades and the changing composition of imports. 
 Introduction
 The degree to which exchange rate changes are transmitted to import prices 

and subsequently to final consumer prices is commonly referred to 
as the 
ﬁexchange rate pass
-throughﬂ.
 Understanding the role of exchange rates in 
shaping economic outcomes is important from a
 monetary
 policy perspective.
 In 
particular, assessing the degree of pass
-through
 of exchange rate movements to 
import or domestic
 prices
 is essential for 
monitoring and forecasting domestic 
inflation. 
 Exchange rate changes are transmitted to HICP inflation via a number of 

channels, both direct and indirect.
 Exchange rate movements are passed on 
directly 
to consumer prices via their
 impact on
 the
 import prices
 of final consumer 
goods. 
Following an exchange rate depreciation, imported final consumer goods 

become more expensive (ﬁfirst stage pass
-throughﬂ
), pushing up overall HICP 
inflation.
 Figure 1 provides an overview of the direct and indirect effects of a 
depreciation in the euro nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). The direct channel 
is depicted by the arrow labelled ﬁ1ﬂ, which joins import prices directly with consumer 

prices and depends on the pricing decisions of foreign producers exporting to the 

euro area. 
 Indirect effects, which can take longer to trickle through the economy, work via 

production costs and real channels.
 The euro depreciation translates into higher
 production 
costs due to 
more
 expensive imported inputs, and these
 feed through the 
different stages of domestic intermediate and final goods production
 (ﬁsecond stage 

pass
-throughﬂ)
, with an inflationary impact on domestic consumer prices. This 
channel is depicted by the arrows labelled ﬁ2ﬂ, which connect import prices with 
ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7 / 2016
 Œ 
Articles
 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 28 producer prices and then consumer prices, and depends, inter alia, on the pricing 
behaviour of domestic firms. The latter might pass on the increase in costs resulting 
from the euro depreciation in order to keep mark
-ups and profits
 constant, or they 
might keep prices constant and accept lower profits, thus dampening the pass
-through to final consumer prices.
 As regards the real channels, the euro depreciation decreases euro area 

export prices denominated in foreign currency and increases import
 prices in 
euro.
 This, in turn, leads to an increase in net exports and higher GDP growth
 (indicated by the arrows labelled ﬁ3ﬂ).
 As the increase in 
real 
GDP 
growth 
leads to
 higher
 labour demand and 
higher
 wages
, this puts
 upward pressure on consumer 
price
s 
(indicated by the arrows labelled ﬁ4ﬂ)
. These indirect effects can be reinforced 
by expectations of a positive loop of future higher growth and inflation.

 Schematic overview of direct and indirect effects of a depreciation in the NEER
  Note: T
he arrows connecting the boxes indicate causality, while the arrows inside the boxes refer to the direction of movement of th
e variable.
 The composition of the consumption basket is also relevant for understanding 
how exchange rate changes affect HICP 
inflation.
 The harmonised index of 
consumer prices (HICP) is a weighted average of a representative basket of goods 

and services consumed by households in the euro area. This basket covers a wide 

range of items, from food and clothing to accommodation services, which have 
different shares of imported inputs in their production structure.

 29 effect depends on the composition of the consumption basket, which can change 
over time. 
 Exchange rate pass
-through 
also 
depends on what shocks drive 
exchange 
rates and inflation at each point in time.
 The exchange rate pass
-through is 
usually understood as a correlation between exchange rate changes and inflation, 
without any meaningful economic interpretation. However, from an economic point of 
view, 
the pass
-through is related to the nature of the shocks driving the exchange

their prices. 
 The article is structured as follows:
 The next section illustrates the 
respons
iveness of various prices to exchange rate changes and shows how 
sequences of appreciations and depreciations highly complicate the dynamics of the
 exchange rate
-price
 relation. 
The third section
 discusses 
determinants of
 exchange 
rate
 pass
-through in the theoretical literature and their 
empirical 
relevance for the 
euro area.
 The fourth section
 presents estimates of pass
-through to import and 
consumer prices in the euro area across various studies and discusses the 
importance of looking at underlying macroe
conomic 
shocks when assessing 
exchange rate impacts. The last section
 concludes.
 Exchange rate movements and inflation along the pricing chain 
 Changes in the exchange rate of the euro against its trading partners are 
reflected more quickly and more sizeab
ly in movements in import price 
inflation, and less so in producer and consumer price inflation.
 The nominal 
effective exchange rate of the euro against 
38 of its main trading partners (NEER
-38) 
has depreciated by around 4% since the second quarter of 2014
 (i.e. when the 

period of depreciation started). 
This 
depreciation
, the combined result of an initial 
10% depreciation (up to mid
-2015) and a smaller subsequent appreciation,
 put substantial upward
 pressure on import prices for consumer goods excluding ene
rgy 

and food. The price of these goods increased by roughly 3.5% over the same period 
and has, in
 recent
 years,
 displayed
 a strong contemporaneous correlation with the 
NEER
-38 (see Chart 
1). 
Recent movements in the NEER
-38 have also lifted 
domestic inflati
on somewhat. T
he effects of exchange rate developments on inflation 
are expected to 
remain
 positive 
for a while longer
 because changes in the exchange 
rate take around two years to fully pass through
 (see Box 1 in this article)

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 30 The strong correlation of euro exchange rate 
changes with import price inflation reflects the 
direct effects of movements in the exchange rate, 
while the weaker relation with producer prices and 

HICP r
eflects indirect effects that take time to 
materialise, as well as dampening effects along the 

pricing chain.
 Producer price inflation is expected to 
react more and faster than consumer price 
inflation 
after an exchange rate 
change. 
An exchange rate 
deprec
iation will directly affect the price of imported 
goods, both intermediate and final. More expensive 
imported final goods put direct
 upward pressure
 on HICP
 inflation (indicated by the 
arrow 
labelled
 ﬁ1ﬂ 
in 
Figure
 1).25 However, a larger share of the import
ed goods is used as inputs by euro area producers than is 
directly consumed. Euro area producers combine the 

imported inputs with domestic inputs to deliver domestic 
intermediate and final consumption goods (arrows 
labelled 
ﬁ2ﬂ
). They also charge a mark
-up in the final 
price of the goods they sell. This indirect effect on the 
HICP
 via domestic production 
takes
 more time to materialise compared 
with
 the 
effect on producer price
 inflation.
 Besides the exchange rate movements, 
other 
factors
 play a
n 
important role in driving domestic inflation
, such as the amount of 
slack in the economy.
  Simple correlations reveal that import prices tend to be more volatile and more 

closely related to exchange rate movements than producer prices
 (see Chart
s 2 
and 3). The correlation between the annual growth rates of 
the 
NEER
-38 and import 
prices across product categories is quite strong,
 ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 over the past 
ten
 years. Where
 domestic producer price indices
 are concerned, the correlation with 
the exchange rate is 
strongest
 for the producer price index (
PPI) 
of intermediate 
goods, and
 weaker
 for capital and consumer goods. For the period 1997
-2006, t
he correlation between the annual growth rates of
 the
 NEER
-38 and the producer prices 
for
 intermediate 
goods is 0.21, 
whereas
 it 
is almost zero for consumer and capital 
goods.
                                                                     25  
The size
 of the direct effect is small, as the imported goods used directly for consumption represent 
around 15% of the overall HICP (5% from the non
-energy industrial goods component and almost 10% 
from energy).

Domestic producer prices for different categories of 
goods (annual percentage changes)
  Sources: Eurostat, ECB and ECB staff calculations.
 Note:
 The latest observation is for July 2016.
 The empirical literature has shown that the observed relationship between the 

exchange rate and producer prices depends on sector and product 

characteristics.
 Intermediate goods tend to be more homogeneous, with more 
elastic demand and a higher share of imported inputs than capital goods. 

Homogeneou
s products can easily be substituted if they become relatively more 

expensive and this implicit higher degree of competition means that their price tends 
to be common across markets. As a consequence, exchange rate changes are more 
directly reflected in euro prices for intermediate goods.
 In the case of capital goods, 
exchange rate pressures feeding into PPI inflation can be expected to be negligible, 
as their cost is not immediately reflected in the prices set by firms but is amortised 
over several time periods. Finally, the pass
-through to the PPI for consumer goods is 
found to lie between that for intermediate and capital goods. Consumer goods 
markets tend to be less competitive than those for intermediates because consumer 
goods are less homogeneous, for
 example because of the importance of branding. 
Furthermore, pass
-through can differ between sub
-categories of consumer goods, as 
these contain different shares of imported inputs. For instance, the item ﬁjewellery 

and watchesﬂ embodies a larger share of imported inputs (gold) in production 

compared with the item ﬁnewspapersﬂ, which depends more on domestic production 
costs. This translates into a higher pass
-through for ﬁjewellery and watchesﬂ
 compared with 
ﬁnewspapersﬂ
.26 The long time
 lags involved in the transmission of an exchange rate change to 
HICP inflation via the pricing chain imply that, at each point in time, the net 

effect reflects a combination of lagged effects from past exchange rate 
movements.
 For instance,
 the recent 
imp
act of the exchange rate on inflation 
                                                                    26

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 32 reflects a
 combination of the boosting effects from the strong euro depreciation in 
2014/15, and the dampening effects of the recent appreciation as illustrated in Box 1 
of this article. This dynamic overlap of the effects of past and current exchange rate 
movements makes it difficult to quantify the pass
-through to HICP inflation.
 Box 
1 
Overlapping dynamics of euro/US dollar exchange rate changes from 2010
-16 and the 
effects on HICP inflation
 Given delays
 in pass
-through, 
volatile exchange rate
 movements generate overlapping 
lagged 
upward and
 downward impacts. This box presents a mechanical estimate of the 
impact of this dynamic overlap on inflation, based on the euro/US dollar exchange rate 
developments of the last six
 years
. Looking at quarterly averages since 2011
, it is possible to
 identify four clear phases of appreciation and depreciation 
in the euro
 NEER, which were mainly 
driven by the US dollar (see Chart A). The euro/US dollar exchange rate is particularly 
rele
van
t 
for 
euro area inflation 
compared
 with
 other currencies
 because commodity prices are set in 
dollars
. As 
a consequence, large swings in the euro/US dollar exchange rate affect headline inflation directly 
via imports of energy and other commodities. This
 box therefore focuses on the overlapping effects 
of successive waves of appreciation and depreciation of the euro against the US dollar.

/US dollar exchange rate changes
 (index Q2

 Sources: ECB
 and ECB staff calculations.
 From mid
-2011 to the third quarter of 2012, the euro depreciated by around 13% 
against 
the US 
dollar and by around 7.6% in nominal effective terms vis
-à-
vis 38 trading partners (NEER
-38). 
Subsequently, the euro appreciated by 9.5% against the US dollar, from the end of 2012 to the first 

quarter of 2014 (11% in NEER
-38 terms). After peaking in the period between the second quarter of 
2014 and mid
-2015, it depreciated by 19% against the US dollar (
-10.4% in NEER
-38 terms). That 
decline was partially reabsorbed from mid
-2015 to mid
-2016 as the euro appreciated again by 
around 2% against the US dollar, and even more strongly, by 6%, in effective terms. As a result, the 
euro
/US dollar exchange rate, which has a weight of around 12% in
 the NEER
-38, has
 contributed 
almost entirely to the lower level of the NEER
-38 so far in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 
five years earlier.

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 34 The compound
 effects of 
successive euro/US dollar
 exchange rate movements 
can be 
estimated 
based on the results of the model presented in Hahn
27, modified by substituting 
the NEER with the euro/US dollar exchange rate.
 HICP inflation continues to be 
positively 
affected by the large depreciation of the euro against the
 US dollar 
that began in
 2014. According to 
this mechanical calculation
, the contribution of the euro
/US 
dollar exchange rate to headline 
inflation reached a
n 
initial
 peak of 0.5 p
ercentage 
point
 in the last quarter of 2012 as a result of the 
first depreciation phase mentioned above. The following appreciation phase led to an overall neutral 
impact in 2013 and 2014, which was offset in 2015 and 2016 by the 19%
 depreciation that took 
place between the second half of 2014 and
 the
 first half of 2015. The lagged effect of this 
depreciation phase is 
also 
expected to
 positively
 affect inflation in 2017. 
With
 the fading
-out of the 
past depreciation
, if the euro
/US 
dollar exchange rate remains constant at 
the level 
recorded so far 
for
 the third quarter of 
2016, it 
should
 stop supporting inflation at the beginning of 2018.

 The final effect of the exchange rate movements on import price

depend

 As can be observed in Charts D

 import prices and euro
 area inflation across models, indicating some degree of uncertainty in pinning down an exact 
number for this estimate.

 Determinants of exchange rate pass
-through 
 There are many reasons why exchange rate pass
-through 
is 
incomplete, i.e. 
less than proportional, at the level of import prices and, to a greater extent, at 
the level of consumer prices. 
Some of these reasons relate to the microeconomic 
structure and behaviour of firms while others concern the general macroeconomic 
environment. Exporting firms™ decisions as to how they price their exports to the euro 
area are affected by structural conditions, such as the currency in which they invoice, 

the degree of competition in the euro area market and the costs resulting from 
changing prices. Macroeconomic factors involve changes in the degree of openness, 
the structure of imports and the expected persistence of the exchange rate 
change. 
Some sources of incomplete pass
-through
 correspond to the
 import price
 stage;
 others 
can be traced
 to
 the
 behaviour of firms at successive stages in the pricing 
chain. 
 At the import price stage, 
the exchange rate pass
-through is related to the 
degree of competition across industries.
 Following a euro depreciation, foreign 
products mechanically become relatively more expensive in euro. This is referred to 
as producer currency pricing and corresponds to full pass
-through to import prices in 
euro. In a competitive market, where the number of domestic and foreign producers 
is relatively high, foreign firms tend to lose market share in the euro area following a 
depreciation of the euro; to retain this share, they need to keep their prices in euro 

as stable as possible, thus reducing their margins. This can go as far as local 
currency pricing, i.e. zero pass
-through to euro area import prices. In a market with 
low competition, firms that export to the euro area can more easily adjust their prices 
in euro and nevertheless keep their market share. Indeed, the theoretical literature 
has shown that the degree to which firms can adjust their mark
-up in response to an 
exchange rate change depends on (i) their pricing power, which is a function of how 
easily their product can be substituted with other similar ones, and (ii) the degree of

 36 market concentration, namely the number of firms present in the industry.
28 As a 
consequence, the greater the capacity for substitution between domestic and 
imported products and the higher the number of producers servicing the euro area 
market, the lower the pass
-through to import prices in euro. Furthermore, pricing 
decisions on the part of exporters to the euro area can interact with distribution 
margins set by euro area local distributors in the supply chain. Regardless of the 
strength of sensitivity of euro area import
 prices to exchange rates, if 
local 
distributors 
absorb exchange rate fluctuations in their own margins, consume
r 
prices
 
will experience less pass
-through than 
those
 at the border
.29 Empirical research for the euro area has confirmed diverse impacts on prices 

at the industrial sector level.
 Differences in exchange rate pass
-through
 can be 
explained by the import stru
cture,
 as 
discussed
 in Box 2
 of this article
. Osbat and 
Wagner
30 report wide ranges of exchange rate pass
-through across manufacturing 
sectors that can be explained by sectoral variables
 such as import penetration and 
firm 
concentration
. Campa and Goldberg
31 show that pass
-through to import prices 
is found to be higher in energy and lower in manufacturing across several euro area 

countries and the United States. Campa et al.
32 also find that exporters price 
discriminate to a larger extent between markets for manufacturing goods than 
between those for commodities. Hahn
33 similarly reports that, among the sub
-sectors 
of industry (excluding construction), the exchange rate pass
-through is highest in 
electricity, gas and water supply, as well as in the energy sector. The lowest pass
-through is found for capital goods. As mentioned in the previous section, the reason 
lies with the product characteristics: energy products are more homogeneous, 

entailing a higher degree of competition, and their price is set in internat
ional 
markets. By contrast, capital goods are less homogeneous and less substitutable, 
leading to less competition; hence they are priced more locally. 
 The
 currency of invoice for imports of goods and services also 
determine
s 
the 
degree 
and speed 
of 
pass
-through and can depend on many structural factors. 
Foreign producers that export to the euro area might sell their products by charging 
one common price across all customers in their own currency. Under this scenario, 

movements in the exchange rate pass directly into euro area import prices and the 
pass
-through is complete. If, instead, foreign producers charge a different price in 
                                                                    28

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 37 each export market, the effect of the exchange rate on import prices in euro may be 
incomplete. The decision to price imports in producer or local currency depends 
primarily on the state of local competition.
34 It can also depend on the existence of 
strategic complementarities, as exporters tend to use the currency of the country that 
dominates their industry or that their main competitors use.
35 More homogeneous 
goods, meanwhile, are priced in US dollars.
36  The role of
 the euro as a currency of invoice has increased 
in the 
21st century.
 The introduction of the euro resulted in a larger share of euro area imports 

denominated in euro; consequently, foreign producers exporting to the euro area 
have been using the euro (local currency) more actively in their transactions with 
euro area importers. The expected result would be 
a lower
 exchange rate pass
-through to domestic euro area price
s.37 Indeed, in 2013, 52% of extra
-euro area 
imports 
in goods were settled in euro, compared with 49% in 2006; the same figures 

for extra
-euro area imports in services are 62% and 54% respectively
.38 The results 
presented in Box 2 support the conclusion that
 Member States with a higher share of 
extra
-euro area imports invoiced in euro experience a lower degree of exchange rate 
pass
-through. 
 The extent to which firms hedge themselves against exchange rate 

movements also determines the degree of exchange rate 
pass
-through to 
import prices. 
Hedging against exchange rate movements can take place in two 
ways: one occurs naturally via the increased integration of firms into global value 

chains and the growing use of imported inputs from various source countries
39; t
he other is a specifically financial strategy. Larger firms with access to hedging are more 

likely to invoice in the importer™s currency and pass through the changes in the 
exchange rate to a lesser extent.

 However, there are also forces that
 might work in the opposite direction: the 
share of euro area imports as a percentage of GDP has increased enormously since 1970, which could 
have led to an increase in the exchange rate pass
-through over time due to the increased share of 
imports in consu
mption.

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 38 Focusing on the last stage of the pricing chain, 
namely consumer prices, pass
-through tends to be 
higher for durable goods and lower for non
-durable 
goods. 
The impact of an exchange rate 
change
 on non-energy industrial goods (
NEIG
) 
inflation is
, to a 
large
 extent
, transmitted
 via the prices of durable NEIG 
(see Chart 
4).41 In response to a 
1% appreciation of the 
NEER
, the inflation rate of durable NEIG is estimated to 
decline by about 0.08 percentage point. This pass
-through 
is relatively quick
, with
 the full effect expected 

to materialise after about a year. 
Semi
-durable NEIG 
prices are affected as well, but these effects are 

significant only in the short term
. The percentage point 
estimates show a smaller response for semi
-durable 
prices than for durable NEIG prices
, with a more 
protracted pass
-through. Semi
-durable NEIG prices are 
estimated to decrease by 0.05 percentage point 
following a 
1% appreciation
, with
 the full effect passed
 through only after about three years. The prices of non
-durable NEIG,
 by contrast, seem hardly
 to
 respond to 
an exchange rate shock
 at all
 (about 0.01 percentage point). For semi
-durable NEIG 
prices
, the exchange rate pass
-through is significant only in the short
 term
; for
 non-durable
 NEIG prices, it is insignificant
. 
 Wide
r macroeconomic factors, such as the degree of openness, affect the 
impact of exchange rates on consumer prices. 
The more open an economy or a 
sector, the higher the degree of pass
-through.
 Imported foreign inputs need to be 
combined with domestic inputs to produce final domestic consumption goods. A 

higher share of imported inputs
 or 
final goods relative to domestically produced 
ones amplifies the impact of exchange rate movements on domestic prices, and 
open economies
 tend to
 experience a higher and quicker pass
-through. This is supported 
by evidence that pass
-through in the euro area is found to be higher compared with 
that in the United States, as the share of imported inputs across industries tends to 

be higher in the euro area.
42 Naturally, this share tends to be higher in euro area 
small economies such as Austria, Ireland and Belgium than in larger economies, for 

example France. However, the analysis in 
Box 2
 finds only a small role for the 
degree of openness in explaining differences in exchange rate p
ass
-through across 
euro area countries.
 Finally, the size of exchange rate pass
-through is affected by price rigidities 
and by t
he perceived persistence of shocks
.43 If there are ﬁmenuﬂ costs to 
                                                                    41

 Exchange rate pass

 inflation
 39 adjusting prices, then it might not make sense for importers and exporters to change 
their prices in response to small currency movements. If firms perceive the exchange 
rate shock as non
-lasting, they will adjust prices only partially. Therefore, a lower 
(perceived) persistence of exchange rate shocks can result in low pass
-through. 
Indeed, the stable inflation environment that has been achieved in many euro area 

economies has reduced the persistence of price and exchange rate shocks, thus 
also reducing the frequency of price changes and the degree of exchange rate p
ass
-
through.
44 As with openness, however, the regression analysis in Box 2
 indicates 
that, once many other factors are taken into account, the inflation rate explains only 

a small part of the differences in the degree of exchange rate pass
-through across 
euro area countries.
 Box 
2 
Currency invoicing and exchange rate pass
-through
 This box looks at the role of currency invoicing 
in
 exchange rate pass
-through.
45 Recent 
empirical studies based on micro
-level
 (i.e. goods
-level
) data have found that the transmission of 
exchange rate movements to import prices differs sizeably depending on the currency chosen to 
invoice import transactions, and that the pass
-through is 
lower 
when a
 higher share of local 
currency is used to invoic
e imports.
46 Translating this finding to the macro level, this box relates 
differences in country
-specific degrees of long
-run exchange rate pass
-through across euro area 
economies to the relative use of the euro as an invoicing currency. 
 Estimated degrees
 of exchange rate pass
-through vary markedly across euro area 
economies.
47 According to pass
-through estimates based on a standard log
-linear regression 
model, for the euro area aggregate a 
1% nominal effective appreciation of the euro has
, on average
, resu
lted in a 0.51% decline in aggregate import prices. However, this finding masks 
substantial heterogeneity in exchange rate pass
-through
 across euro area economies. Indeed,
 long-run exchange rate pass
-through is estimated to range from 0.29% in Austria to 0.75% in 
Ireland. 
                                                                       44

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 40 Standard determinants of exchange rate pass
-through explain only a fraction of the total 
variation in pass
-through across euro area economies.
48 The existing literature that aims to 
explain cross
-country differences in 
pass
-through
 focus
es 
on a combination of macroeconomic and 
microeconomic structural determinants, including the level of inflation, the degree of openness and 
the micro
-structure of imports
.49 Following the standard regression approach, results suggest that 
inflation and openness, the standard macroeconomic determinants, explain 
around 
only 4% of the
 pass
-through
 heterogeneity across euro area economies. The R
-squared increases to 24% when 
agricultural and raw material imports
 are included in
 total imports, suggesting that the import 
structure of an economy is an important determinant of cross
-country differences in 
pass
-through
. The cross
-country variation in the use of the euro as an invoicing currency for extra
-euro 
area imports is substantial.
 The role of local currency in
voicing is a
 determinant that has received 
little attention in existing studies 
on cross
-country differences in 
pass
-through
. Table

Euro i
nvoicing shares 
in extra
-euro area imports
 range from just over 20% in 
Greece to more than 70% in Estonia. The variation in the use of the euro may mainly reflect 
different ratios
 of intra
-euro area export
s 
to total exports
. Euro area 
economies tend to invoice a 
larger share of their extra
-euro area imports in euro if they export mainly to other euro area 
countries, partly reflecting the need for foreign exchange hedging, along with other motives such as 
reducing transaction costs. Since balancing costs and revenues in the same currency is a cost
-efficient way to hedge against exchange rate risk, euro area economies 
that
 predominantly rely on 
intra
-euro area exports, and whose revenues are hence mainly denominated in euro, can be 
expecte
d to be more likely to invoice extra
-euro area imports in euro.

 41 Euro invoicing shares explain a large part of 
the cross
-country variation in pass
-through, 
including
 when controlling for standard 
determinants of pass
-through.
 In order to 
control for other factors that affect the choice of 
invoicing currency
, equation (
1) (reported in 
footnote 24) is modified to include the share of 
local currency invoicing of extra
-euro area 
imports in
 the
 euro area economy. The share of 

local currency invoicing 
strongly
 correlate
s 
with 
long
-run pass
-through
 and is statistically
 highly
 significant
, even
 when controlling for standard 
determinants of 
pass
-through
 heterogeneity. 
Moreover, the R
-squared increases markedly, 
by more than 30 percentage points.
50 In sum, the results suggest a strong link 

between invoicing currency choice and 

exchange rate pass
-through.
 Euro area 
economies with a 
smaller
 share of the euro as 
an invoicing currency for extra
-euro area 
imports tend to 
experience
 a significantly 
higher
 degree of exchange rate pass
-through to import 
prices.
  Estimates of the aggrega
te exchange rate pass
-through in the euro 
area
  
The previous sections described the mechanisms 
whereby
 movements in 
exchange rates affect import prices and the HICP, and the
 factors that 

determine
 the magnitude and the speed of this effect.
 This section pr
esents 
empirical evidence on the size and speed of the exchange rate pass
-through to 
import and consumer prices for the euro area and euro area Member States. 
 Aggregate exchange rate pass
-through estimates for the euro area vary 
depending on the models an
d samples used in the analysis.
 Given that the size 
of the exchange rate pass
-through depends on sectoral and firm
-level factors, which 
vary over time, and on aggregates, which change their composition, it comes as no 

surprise that ad hoc specifications using country
-level aggregates yield different 
estimates 
Œ 
according to country and time. Hahn
51 estimated a vector autoregression 
(VAR) including the NEER of the euro and the pricing chain. Updated estimates of 
                                                                    50  
If country
-specific 
NEERs are used to estimate 
equation (
1), the coefficient estimate 
for
 local currency 
invoicing in
creases further (from 0.7 to 1.4
), which points to an even stronger relation between 
invoicing and 
pass
-through.
 Moreover, e
ven after 
control
ling
 for extra
-euro area import shares, the 
increase in R
-squared
 is larger when
 local currency invoicing is included 
in the regression
.

 Exchange rate pass

 42 this model show that a 1% depreciation of the euro increases HICP inflation by 
0.10% after one year and 0.23% after three years (see Table 1). Other models tend 
to report similar results for the HICP.
52 More recently, Comunale and Kunovac
53 have 
used a Bayesian VAR and a different approach to identify an
 exchange rate shock. 
They found that, after a one
-year period following a 
1% depreciation in the NEER of 
the euro, import prices in the euro area
 would
 rise 
by 
0.50
%, producer prices 
by 
0.
37% and consumer prices 
by 
0.11%. 
Regarding the four largest euro a
rea 
economies, they found that an exchange rate shock would have a similar impact on 
HICP inflation in Germany, France and Italy to HICP inflation in the euro area, 
whereas they estimated a much greater effect for Spain (see Table 2). Studies 
focusing only
 on import prices produce a range of estimates across countries.

 Estimates of exchange rate pass
-through in the euro area based on the NEER 
tend to be lower than those base
d on the euro/US dollar bilateral exchange 
rate. 
The bilateral euro
/US 
dollar exchange rate
 has recently exhibited larger 
movements compared with the NEER
-38 of the euro
, as illustrated in Chart A in 
Box
 1. This is because the changes 
in the euro
/US dollar
 exchange rate are 
counteracted by changes 
in other currencies 
included 
in the basket of currencies 
comprising the NEER. Moreover, the US dollar has a strong impact because it is the 
invoicing currency of commodities; it thus tends to pass through to impor
t prices
 of 
food and energy quickly and completely. 
 Some empirical studies argue that pass
-through may have declined in the euro 
area
 since the 1990s. 
Campa
 et al.
55 investigated changes in the pass
-through to 
import prices in euro area countries based on 
sectoral 
data up to 2004. They 
detected declines in the
 estimates of the exchange rate pass
-through to
 import 
prices in around two
-third
s 
of the industries in their sample, but most of this evidence 
is not statistically significant. 
Only manufacturing indu
stries
 present statistically 
significant effects
. 
ECB researchers
56 found tentative evidence of a decline in the 
exchange rate pass
-through for the euro area based on a panel VAR and the Area 
Wide Model, with data up to 2007. Clearer evidence 
of changes in the exchange rate 
pass
-through for several 
Member States
 has been
 reported by
 the IMF and Sekine.
57 Both studies note
 a substantial decline in the exchange rate pass
-through to
 import 
prices
 and consumer prices
 for a number of advanced economies.
 When the m
odel 
proposed by Hahn is estimated over rolling windows of 20 years, a decline in pass
-
through since 1980 is found for both import prices and HICP inflation. In particular, 

while the model estimated over the full sample (the first quarter of 1980 to the fi
rst 
                                                                    55

 44 quarter of 2016) finds that a 1% appreciation in the NEER would lead to a 0.23% 
decline in HICP inflation after three years, the same model estimated over a rolling 
sample finds that this effect would be negligible in the most recent iteration 
(the 
sec
ond quarter of 1996 to
 the first quarter of
 2016) 
of the rolling window estimation 
(see Chart 5).
  
The composition of imports is one factor that has 

been put forward to explain the potential decline in 
exchange rate pa
ss-through. 
Indeed, the 
compositional shift from sectors with high 
pass
-through
 (such as energy
) 
to sectors with lower 
pass
-through, 
(such as manufacturing and food
) 
has been proposed 
as one of the reasons for a decline in the pass
-through 
to import prices
.58 ECB researchers
59 have c
ompared
 aggregate exchange rate pass
-through
 estimates, 
computed by 
aggregat
ing sectoral estimates
 using the
 import shares
 of each sector
 in 1988 and 2005 
as 
weights, to show that this would mechanically result in a 

decline in 
ove
rall 
import price pass
-through
 from 0.83 to 
0.74. 
 Another
 proposed explanation for the secular 
decline in exchange rate pass
-through to import 
prices is globalisation and the emergence of low
-cost exporters
. Gust, Leduc and Vigfusson
60 suggest 
that part of
 the decline in the exchange rate pass
-through might be related to increased trade integration
, 
as firms have become more responsive to competitors™ prices
. 
This competitive 
pressure is further increased by the rising prominence of low
-cost producers in 
international trade.
 Several factors at the firm level may also have contributed to the declining 
exchange rate pass
-through. 
First, as illustrated in Box 2 of this article, an 
increasing share of extra
-euro area imports is invoiced in euro, meaning that an 
increasing proportion of foreign exporters choose to price their exports to the euro 

area in euro. According to the results shown in the box, this can lead to lower pass
-through. T
he increasing import content of exports and 
the 
lower cost of hedging per 
unit of risk may also
 have
 dampened the response of import prices to exchange rate 
movements.
61  An influential explanation for the decline of exchange rate pass
-through at 
both the import price and final consumer price stages is that the low inflation 
                                                                    58

 Exchange rate pass

 45 environment supported by credible monetary policy has led to a reduction in 
the perceived persistence of shocks and that, as a result, firms have tended to 
adjust prices less frequently.
 Taylor
62 notes that the low inflation environment 
achieved in many cou
ntries 
has resulted in
 lower pass
-through. 
Lower inflation leads 
to a reduction in the expected persistence of cost and price shocks 
and consequently
 to lower
 exchange rate
 pass
-through
 to prices, as producers have less 
incentive to change their price
s 
in 
the face of less persistent shocks.
 A way to reconcile the different estimates presented so far across models, 
countries and samples is to recognise that, far from being a structural 
parameter at the macroeconomic level, exchange rate pass
-through depends 
on the nature of the shocks driving 
exchange rates
. This has been shown in 
theoretical models where exchange rate pass
-through is a function of the underlying 
shocks in the economy and the competitive structures of the industries involved.
63 Empirically, ho
wever, most approaches are based either on simple regressions or on 
identifying exchange rate shocks in a manner that does not take into account the full 

economic structure and consequently the most important shocks that drive the 
economy.
64  A more economically meaningful approach 
to study the impact of the 
exchange rate on inflation would be to employ a method similar to that used 
when 
looking at the impact of other variables (for example, oil prices
), in order
 to 
determine
 what 
shocks 
move exchange rates in the first place.
 In reality, the 
exchange rate 
does not move as a consequence of one particular shock, but 
is instead influenced by
 various driving forces
. The entire constellation of 
macroeconomic shocks affecting the exchange rate at each point in time should be 
considered. 
The fact that pass
-through can be shock
-dependent has long been 
discussed in the literature.
65 However, in empirical terms, disentangling the 
underlying economic forces driving the exchange rate is difficult, as this is a highly 

endogenous variable. The key question revolves around what moves exchange 
rates. Is it a domestic supply shock? Could it be global demand? Or is it monetary 
policy, either domestic or foreign? 
 Depending on the shock, the response of consumer prices 
to an 
exch
ange rate
 movement
 will be different.
 For instance, an expansionary domestic monetary 
policy shock will be followed by a euro depreciation, with a direct inflationary effect 
on import prices. This direct effect will feed into consumer prices and be amplified by 
                                                                    62

 46 the other transmission channels of monetary policy, leaving ﬁroomﬂ for mark
-ups to 
adjust. It could therefore be expected that such a shock would lead to a higher 
correlation between exchange rate and HICP movements, i.e. to a higher pass
-through, than would be observed after a depreciation caused by, for example, a 
negative domestic supply shock such as lower productivity. Instead of being 
accompanied by the amplifying effects of an expansionary shock, such a 
depreciation caused by a negative domestic supply shock would occur in an 

environment where firms found little space to maintain or increase their mark
-ups 
and the pass
-through down the pricing chain would be contained. Similarly, the euro 
could also depreciate because of a foreign monetary policy tightening; in this case, 

however, any fall in foreign demand due to the restrictive policy abroad, other things 
being equal, would be a drag for euro area growth and would not foster a domestic 
inflationary environment. 
 In other words, while some shocks lead to self
-reinforcing exchange rate and 
price dynamics, other
s 
lead to counterbalancing effects on inflation.
 In the 
case of a negative domestic demand shock, which could cause the exchange rate to 
depreciate, the overall ﬁpass
-throughﬂ could easily lead to an apparently perverse 
correlation between exchange rates and consumer price inflation, as found by 
Comunale and Kunovac
66 for the euro area, and Forbes et al.
67 for the United 
Kingdom. 
 A common result
 from the existing studies
 that adopt this approach 
is that the 
exchange rate pass
-through
 following a monetary shock is relatively 
high
. This 
is observed by Comunale and Kunovac for the exchange rate pass
-through following 
a monetary policy shock or an exogenous exchange rate shock
 modelled as a risk 
premium shock. The exchange rate channel can thus be considered active in the 
transmission of monetary policy. Bobeica and Jaroci
ski
68 look at a similar set of 
shocks for the euro area and disentangle the effects of interest rate shocks
 and the 
shocks that affect the spread between short
-term and long
-term rates. 
 Research on quantifying exchange rate pass
-through
 based
 on 
macroeconomic
 shocks
 is still in an incipient phase
, 
as indicated by the wide 
variations not only in quantification,
 but also in the perceived contribution of 
economic shocks to exchange rate movements. A better understanding of the 

relevance of the prevailing current shocks for quantifying the responsiveness of 
HICP inflation to exchange rate changes is necessary for understanding the effects 
of any policy mix.

 Exchange rate pass
-through into euro area inflation
 47 Conclusions
 Understanding the way exchange rates shape the outlook for inflation is 
crucial for conducting monetary policy effectively and 
understanding the 
strength of its transmission mechanism
. Drawing on evidence from the available 
data, models and existing literature, this article contributes to a better understanding 

of 
the complex role of the exchange rate in affecting prices
 in the euro area. 
A number of 
conclusions
 can be drawn from this evidence. 
 First,
 the effect of the exchange rate is strongest and most immediate for 
import prices, and declines along the pricing chain. 
Simple graphical correlations 
illustrate that import prices tend to correlate with exchange rate movements, 

whereas this effect is more muted for producer prices and final HICP inflation. The 

presence of local distribution costs, a lower share of imported inputs in the final 
HICP, and the relatively long time taken for the indirect effects of exchange rate 
shocks to feed through the economy are the main factors contributing to this pattern.
 Second, the size and speed of the exchange rate pass
-through seems to differ 
across product categories, indicating that cost structures and pricing 
decisions at the firm level are important for gauging
 the exchange rate effects 
at the aggregate price level.
 Empirical results show that pass
-through to producer 
prices of intermediate goods is higher while pass
-through to prices of capital goods 
is lower. The impact on consumer goods tends to lie somewhere
 in-between. Within 
the non
-energy industrial goods components, pass
-through tends to be highest for 
durable consumer goods. These differences at the goods category level can be 
related to different industry characteristics.
 Third, estimates of exchange rate pass
-through for the euro area vary 
considerably across models and across time period
s. The exchange rate pass
-through estimates based on the bilateral euro
/US dollar exchange rate are found to 
be proportionally higher than those based on the 
NEER
 again
st the euro 
area
™s 38 main trading partners.
 Moreover, 
empiri
cal studies have provided some evidence 
that, since the 1990s, the sensitivity of import and domestic prices to the nominal 
exchange rate has declined. Several explanations have been put forward, such as 
the change in the composition of imports towards less exchange rate
-sensitive 
sectors, more currency invoicing of extra
-euro area imports in euro, natural and 
financial hedging against exchange rates via participation in global value chains and 
financial instruments, and the contribution of the low inflation environment. 
 Last, recent studies advocate looking at the underlying economic shocks 
when analysing the responsiveness of import and domestic prices to 
exchange rate changes. 
The
 studies are far from reaching a consensus
 on the 
importance of each shock in driving the exchange rate and on the size of pass
-through following each shock. However,
 they seem to agree that 
when 
a monetary 
policy shock driv
es the nominal exchange rate
, a relatively larger pass
-through
 tends 
to be generated
. 
The fact that the exc
hange rate pass
-through is shock
-dependent 
can explain why
, in some periods
, the reaction of final prices to exchange rates is 
smaller or larger than would be expected based on simple historical regularities.

 Business investment developments in the euro area since the crisis
 48 2 Business investment developments in the euro ar
ea 
since the crisis
 Business investment is both an important driver of the business cycle and a 
determinant of future growth prospects. While recovering less than in other 

advanced economies, the ratio of euro area real business investment to value added 
has recently surpassed its historical average. The recovery in investment is being 
driven by a combination of improving demand, profit expectations
 and financing 
conditions
, as well as 
declining uncertainty. However, weak absolute investment 
growth in the euro area has slowed growth of the capital stock, which has weighed 
on potential and productivity growth since the crisis. Moreover, euro area gross 

corporate debt remains historically high and several regulatory and institutional 
factors continue to drag on business investment, despite a number of reforms in 
recent years. At this stage, policies aimed at improving the regulatory environment 

and credit conditions, reducing entry barriers, increasing the overall flexibility of 
labour and product markets and providing an efficient debt restructuring framework 
are particularly important for fostering investment. Finally, targeted and efficient 
infrastructure investment can support business investment.
 Stylised facts on business investment
 Investment is a key driver of the business cycle and determines future growth 
prospects.
 As an important expenditure component of GDP, making up about 20%, 
real investment, through 
cyclical swings
, drive
s 
the business cycle. Investment 
decisions also crucially determine the capital stock and hence potential growth
69. 
Without sufficient investment, the capital stock cannot be renewed regularly, 
impeding technological progress and hindering structural change in the economy as 
a whole. Investment 
Œ 
and primarily business investment (proxied by real non
-construction investment, see Box 1) 
Œ 
also increases the productive capacity of 
labour by boosting capital deepening.
 This article focuses on the recovery in euro area real business investment 

over the past three years, assessing its drivers and the policy 
responses
 required in order to improve investment 
conditions.
 Following a period of 
substantial contraction during the crisis, real business investment has recovered 

visibly since early 2013 (see Chart 1). The strong fall in euro area total investment 

witnessed during the Great Recession and the decline in investment in 2011
-12 were 
the consequences of lower business investment, but also a strong downward 

correction in overheating housing markets and persisting budgetary constraints that 

resulted in lower construction and public investment in some countries. The general 
increase recorded in total fixed capital formation since early 2013 has been driven by 
non-construction investment, while construction investment started to rise only in 
2015 (see Chart 2). In recent quarters, real investment

Data on real business investment and capital stock in the euro area
 Non

used as a proxy for business investment in this article.
 Total investment values are available 
from the quarterly national accounts
, released by Eurostat
, for the euro area and its member 
countries, where total investment is also available broken down by main asset
 classes
 at a quarterly 
frequency. Adjusting total investment for construction (i.e. dwellings and non
-residential 
investment), the resulting non
-construction investment covers (i) machinery, equipment and 
weapons systems, (ii) intellectual property products and (iii) agricultural products. The first 
component is, in turn, made up of transport investment, information and communication technology 
(ICT) equipment, other machinery and equipment, and weapons systems. However, the latter two 
components are not mandatory for the European national statistical institutes to report under the 

ESA 2010 transmission programme and hence relevant data are not available for the euro area and 
most countries at a quarterly frequency. Better data availability exists at an annual frequency, 
although it
 is not sufficiently frequent for the analysis presented in this article. From a sectoral 

perspective, Eurostat does not compute quarterly real business investment in the national accounts, 
as official sector investment data by main asset
 classes
 are only available in value terms on a 
quarterly basis. Moreover, total
 investment by government and by non
-financial companies is 
currently only expressed in nominal

and predominantly

non-seasonally adjusted terms. The

  Euro area business investment is now back to the pre
-crisis peak recorded in 
2008, while business investment in other advanced economies has recovered 

more markedly (see Chart 3).
 In the euro area, business investment declined in

growth rates than observed in the period prior to the crisis. In the United Kingdom 
and the United States, the trough in investment was recorded in 2009. There is also 

heterogeneity across euro area countries. Of the almost 15% increase in the level of 
business investment observed in the euro area since the trough, Germany, Spain 
and France have contributed considerably, while there was a limited contribution 
from Italy (see Chart 4).

 Business
 investment developments in the euro area since the crisis
 51 The ratio of euro area real business investment to 
value added has now surpassed its long
-term 
average.
 The real investment share to value added, 
which gives a measure of the 
size
 of investment in the 
overall economy, tends to be pro
-cyclical over time (see 
Chart 5). The business investment ratio has also been 

generally higher in Germany and Spain than in France, 

as the latter is a more service
-intensive economy. The 
dispersion across the ratios of the largest euro area 

countries peaked before the crisis but has since fallen 

back to a lower constant level. From a longer 
perspective, the euro area ratio and those of other 
advanced economies trended upwards prior to the 

crisis for several reasons.
71 A combination of lower cost 
of finance, increases in replacement investment and 

technological progress in ICT and the investment goods 

sector 
Œ 
leading to a fall in the relative price of 
inves
tment goods 
Œ 
spurred investment in real terms. In 
some countries, such as Spain, the increase may have 
also reflected higher expected marginal returns on 
investment related to a perceived strength in the underlying trend growth rate of the 

economy. In some countries ﬁover
-investmentﬂ may have occurred
, for instance 
during the widespread ICT boom in the late 1990s, resulting in ﬁexcess capital stockﬂ 
on the back of unrealistic expectations of firms™ marginal returns. During the global 
financial crisis 
Œ 
and again in the sovereign debt crisis 
Œ 
investment fell much more 
than value added. In the aftermath of the crisis the ratio started to rise in the euro 
area, as a normal feature of the cyclical recovery, and has now 
surpassed
 its long
-term average.
72 A break
down of euro area investment by asset
 classe
s shows that changes in 
investment in machinery and equipment contributed mostly to the swings in 

business investment
 over the past decade
. Machinery and equipment investment 
arises 
largely
 in the corporate sector and is hence a close proxy for business 
investment. 
During the recovery since 2013, investment in machinery and equipment 

(of which transport equipment constitutes about one
-quarter)
 made up most of the 
total increase in investment, while intellectual property products contributed to the 
remaining share (see Chart 6). Investment in equipment is gradually recovering and 
                                                                    71 See also Rodriguez Palenzuela, D. and Dees, S., ﬁ

ountries have different equilibrium ratios of investment to

 reflecting di

 levels of economic development and different economic structures
. Economies are

subject to structural changes over time. 
For instance, there may be a structura

become more service
-intensive and less capital
-intensive (see OECD Economic Outlook, Vol. 
2015/01).

 Business investment developments in the euro area since the crisis
 52 is expected to return to its pre
-crisis level, while investment in intellectual property 
products
73 has proved 
relatively 
resilient throughout the past decade.
 The decline in the growth rate of fixed capital 
formation has led to a deceleration in the growth of 
euro area capital stock since 2008, which is 

unprecedented in a historical perspecti
ve (see 
Chart
 7).
 The capital stock, measuring the value of all 
fixed assets in use, can be derived from cumulated 

investment adjusted for the technological content of 
capital goods, relative price trends of capital goods and 
the depreciation rate. The growth rate of the total 

economy capital stock for Italy and Spain slowed 
significantly after the crisis, particularly in Italy, where 
the capital stock has declined since 2013. Diminishing 

contributions from the capital stock have weighed on 
potential output
 growth in these countries over recent 
years. The slowdown in capital stock growth has been 
less pronounced in France and hardly visible in 

Germany.
 Meanwhile, the capital stock depreciation rate has 

flattened somewhat since the crisis, suggesting a 

slowdo
wn in the consumption of fixed capital (see 
Chart 8).
 Depreciation rates are generally higher for 
ICT goods than for machinery and equipment (which in turn are higher than for 

dwellings). Regarding 
their 
dynamics, the depreciation rates for the whole econo
my 
have 
levelled out since 2008 in France and Italy, and also in the euro area, albeit in a 

less pronounced manner. In Germany the flattening took place somewhat later 
Œ 
around 2012. Only in Spain does the depreciation rate seem to have risen since 
2008, which may be related to compositional changes in the capital stock, 
associated with the shrinking construction sector. The change in the euro area 

depreciation rate with respect to its pre
-crisis dynamics may be related to the decline 
in the capacity utilisation rate and the decreased ﬁwear and tearﬂ of assets. Lower or 

slower
-growing depreciation rates, ceteris paribus, would suggest less need for 
replacement investment to maintain the level of the capital stock.
                                                                     73 Shares of intellectual property products to value added have constantly increased in the euro area 
countries over recent decades and currently range from above 5% of value added in France to about 

3% in Italy. According to

 Fixed capital formation also increases the productive capacity of the economy 
by boosting labour productivity.
 During the crisis, productivity growth in the euro 
area was dampened by the weak contribution of investment to capital deepening 
(see Box 2).
 Box 
2 
Investment and productivity 
Œ 
a comparison of the euro area and the United States
 In the aftermath of the crisis, the slow rebound in euro area investment may further 
constrain the euro area™s ability to 
boost
 its long
-term lacklustre productivity growth, as 
investment is a major driver of capital deepening and thus, in turn, an important driver of 

labour productivity growth. 
Capital deepening refers to the process of increasing the capital
-labour ratio by giving labour more capital to work with. However,
 capital deepening may also occur 
with little net investment in times when strong labour shedding mechanically increases the ratio of 

the capital stock to a depleted workforce. Charts A and B show that, in advance of the crisis, US 

capital deepening had been increasing at 
roughly
 twice the pace of that of the euro area owing, in 
part, to a markedly higher rate of investment in the United States over the pre
-crisis years. With the 
onset of the crisis, strong labour shedding in both economies helped to mitigate the impact of the 

notable slowdown in the rate of investment on capital deepening on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Indeed, for the euro area, the marked reversal in the earlier robust rate of employment growth led to 
an increase
 in the rate of capital deepening over the course of the main crisis years, despite the 
strong 
decline in the rate of 
investment.

deepening in the United States
 (annual percentage changes)

 Despite the rebound in euro area activity since the first quarter of 2013, euro area capital 
deepening has barely increased during the e
conomic recovery.
 A similar stagnation has also 
occurred in the United States. As the charts show, US investment rebounded more strongly towards 

pre
-crisis rates of increase, while euro area investment remains markedly subdued. In part, this 
reflects 
the
 longer, and stronger, 
recovery 
in broader activity in the United States, following the 
deep but short
-lived contraction experienced during the Great Recession of 2008
-09. 
Despite this 
difference, however,
 the rate of capital deepening in both economies has been limited
, 
since 2013, 
by 
proportionally
 similar offsetting effects from robust employment growth.
74 Labour productivity growth in the euro area has been weak due to both capital deepening 
and growth in total factor productivity.
 Overall, it is the combined effects of capital deepening 
and wider ﬁintangibleﬂ technological and organisational progress, known as total factor productivity, 
which determine the pace of an economy™s labour productivity growth. The euro area™s lacklustre 
productivity performance in comparison with that of the United States has been a matter of concern 
to policymakers for the best part of two decades.
75 Charts C and D use 
a 
standard growth 
accounting framework to 
decompose
 euro area and US labour productivity growth over the course 
of Economic and 
Monetary 
Union (
EMU
) 
into the respective contributions stemming from capital 
deepening and total factor productivity. These show that, in the post
-crisis period, a marked decline 
in capital deepening has contributed significantly to the slowing in productivity growth in both 

economies compared with
 pre
-crisis rates.

  Drivers of investment
 In the most common economic th
eories
76, the level of firms™ desired capital 
stock is determined by expectations of returns or planned production levels, 
the cost of financing and the availability of funding, but also industrial 
structure and business frien
dliness.
 In reality, business investment is determined 
by a range of factors with complex and multiple interactions, which are not easy to 
disentangle.
 In this section we will review some of these factors, notably growth 
expectations, capacity utilisation, profits, uncertainty, financing conditions and 
institutional and regulatory variables, and the extent to which they have contributed 
to the recovery
 in business investment.
 The cyclical upturn in demand, shrinking spare capacity and improving 
corporate profits are supporting business investment. 
The decline in expected 
long
-term GDP growth in the euro area 
Œ 
which accelerated during the crisis and is 
likely to have contributed to the decline in investment 
Œ 
seems to have come to a halt 
in recent years (see Chart 9). Demand conditions, as reflected in overall activity and 
capacity utilisation, also matter significantly for investment decisions throughout the 

business cycle. The perceived large spare capacity during the crisis has gradually 
shrunk, particularly in the manufacturing industry (see Chart 10). In addition, 
                                                                    76 For instance, a
ccording to Keynes, inve
stment
 decisions are driven by 
firms™ expectations of the 
profitability of investment
. The accelerator model predicts that investment is proportional to the
 increase 
in output in the coming period
. T
he financial accelerator model
 features capital markets o
perating 
under imperfect
 information, resulting in firms
™ 
prefe
rring
 to 
retain funds to finance investment
 projects.
 Tobin argued that firms™ investment level
s 
should depend on the
 ratio of the present value of installed 
capital to the replacement cost of 
capital

to finance investment with internal means (see Chart 11). Such increases are 
widespread across the largest euro area

77 Higher retained earnings have been

 Notes: The light

CEPR classifications. The solid blue line represents the median of the measures and the 
grey
 area represents the range of macroeconomic uncertainty indices. The latest 
observation is for 
September
 2016. Fin
ancing costs for euro area non
-financial 
corporations (NFCs) have become increasingly 
supportive of
 business investment since the crisis, 
largely as a result of expansionary monetary policy 
measures. 
The overall nominal cost of external 

financing for euro 
area NFCs has trended downwards 
since 2012 and is currently standing at a historically low 
level (see Chart 13). Initially, the fall was mostly driven 
by a decline in the cost of equity financing, mirroring 
lower risk premia and the recovery in equity prices, but 

costs of equity have become more volatile since 2015. 
In addition, supported by the ECB™s monetary policy, 
the cost of bank lending and market
-based debt 
financing has continued to decline until very recently. 
The fall in the cost of debt financing
 has been broad
-based across euro area countries (see Chart 14). 

However, despite very low interest rates, the monetary 
transmission channel has been impeded during the 
crisis period, as firms have not been able to take full 

advantage of low interest rates
 to invest more. Indeed, 
banks tightened credit standards markedly between 

mid
-2007 and early 2009
, and again 
between mid
-2011 
and early 2012 (see Chart 15). The results from Bayesian VAR models and a time
-varying VAR model also suggest that restrictions in bank loan supply were 

responsible for reducing NFC credit growth significantly in 2009 and 2010, as well as

applying for a bank loan although it needed it. 
The
 indicator fell to 11% of SMEs and 6% of large 
firms in March 2016, from 16% and 8%, respectively, two years before.
 Survey evidence suggests that a lack of financing may still act as a drag on investment.
 Among firms that have
 increased investment during the preceding six months, financiall
y unconstrained non
-financial corporations (NFCs) report increasing investments almost twice as 
often as enterprises facing constrained access to credit (see Chart A).

are

 (i) applied for a bank loan or 
credit line and their application was (either wholly or partly) denied, (ii) refused the loan because the associated costs were too high or (iii) were discouraged 
from applying for a bank loan although they needed it.
 Econometric analysis provides further insights on the determinants of investment.
 To 
analyse the determinants of investment, a dummy variable, which takes the value 1 if the firm has 
reported increases in investment in the preceding six months or 0 if not, is regressed on a set of 
factors. These are firm
-specific factors related to the company™s financial s
ituation, capital structure 
and demographics, as well as factors related to its business environment
83. Furthermore, the credit 
constraints indicator is added as an explanatory variable, while a set of other variables control for 

the intensity of problems encountered by firms in their daily business activity, for instance finding 

customers, competition or regulation
84. The analysis only considers firms that either applied for a 
bank loan or were discouraged from applying.
                                                                     83 A first set of variables controls for size, age, turnover classes and whether firms ar
e independent or 
family-
owned. A second one controls for the financial situation of firms in terms of sales, profitability and 
own capital, as well as for firms™ perceptions related to the general economic outlook and credit 

availability. All these variabl
es are binary and set equal to 1 if there is an improvement in the factor. In 
addition, a third set of variables takes into consideration various sources of finance 
Œ either internal or 

external, such as retained earnings, grants, bank products, trade cred
it and market
-based instruments 
Œ used by firms to run their business.
 84 Firms are asked to rate factors 
that they see causing concerns for their businesses 
on a scale from 1 
(not at all important) to 10 (extremely important).
 Such factors include ﬁFinding
 customersﬂ, 
ﬁCompetitionﬂ, ﬁAccess to financeﬂ, ﬁCost of productionﬂ, ﬁAvailability of skilled labourﬂ and ﬁRegulationﬂ.

 60 Chart B
 Factors affecting the likelihood of euro area NFCs increasing investment 
 (marginal effects based on probit regressions)
 Sources: ECB and European Commission Survey on the access to finance of enterprises and ECB 
calculations
. 
Notes: The dependent variable is a binary one that takes
 the value 1 if the firm has reported increases in investment in the preceding six months or 0 if not. 
Only statistically significant coefficients are reported, with the exception of the various sources of finance, which are not
 reported in the chart. Esti
mates are 
based on weighted probit regressions (see
 the
 Survey on the access to finance of enterprises
 for an explanation of the weights used). The regressions include 
country/industry fixed effects and time fixed effects, and errors are clustered at the regional level. The estimation period is from April 2014 to March 2016 for 
12 euro area countries.
 Generally, very young firms, as well as firms with better growth perspectives and more own 
capital, are more likely to report increased investment.
 This follows from Chart B, whe
re the 
bars indicate the marginal increase in the predicted probability of a representative firm increasing 

investment due to a given factor. For example, the chart shows that young firms (less than two 

years
 old
) signal increases in investment with an 11%
 higher probability. This probability of 
increased investment is 10% higher for firms with a better economic outlook. Moreover, the 

availability of bank loans raises the probability of increasing investment by 5%, while the impact of 

improvements in the general economic environment is somewhat smaller (3%). By contrast, being 
credit constrained has a large negative impact on investment, reducing the probability of increases 
in investment by 7%. There is also evidence that firms signal increases in investment with a 11% 

higher probability when they report problems in the availability of skilled labour forces, while for 

firms facing problems in finding customers this probability is reduced by 8%.
 Overall, survey evidence suggests that financial constraints have a negative impact on the 

investment behaviour of euro area NFCs. At the same time, the credit constraints indicator, 

and therefore also the negative impact on investment, has declined somewhat over recent 
years.
 Consistently, other data in the Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (see Chart C) 
show that restrictions in bank loan supply have gradually receded and have led to improvements in 

the availability of bank financing (loans and bank overdrafts).

   Business investment should also be supported by firms™ increasing recourse 
to external sources of financing as a result of
 lower costs and fewer credit 
supply restraints.
 The annual flow of bank and market
-based financing to euro area 
NFCs has continued to
 increase in recent quarters and has reached levels similar to 

those seen in autumn 2011 (see Chart 16). Overall, the recovery in external 

financing has been supported by the strengthening of economic activity, further 
declines in the cost of bank lending and market
-based debt, the easing of bank 
lending conditions, as well as 
a 
larger number of mergers and acquisitions. At the 
same time, NFCs™ record high liquid asset holdings (which include cash and 
deposits) have reduced the need for external financing.

 62 The measures of the marginal value of capital 
(Tobin™s q) have increased significantly from their 
post
-Lehman and mid
-2012 levels (see C
hart 17).
85 This signals increased incentives for capital investment.
 The Tobin™s q measures have moderated somewhat 

since early 2015, but remain significantly above their 
post
-Lehman and mid
-2012 levels and should still be 
supportive of
 business investment. This is confirmed by 
the results from a VAR model that includes, as 

variables, real business investment, real gross 

operating surplus of NFCs, corporate bond spreads and 
Tobin™s q. The results show that, since early 2014, 
Tobin™s q
-driven shocks have increasingly supported 
business investment growth.
86 This reflects the positive 
impact of monetary policy, which has reduced macro 

risk
, and thus also corporate default risk in an uncertain 

environment
, and has translated into higher corporate 
stock prices and improvements in the Tobin™s q 

measures. The fall in the macro and corporate default 

risk is visible in the observed declines in the expected 
default frequencies of euro area listed firms and in 
corporate bond spreads after early 2009 and again after mid
-2012. In recent 
quarters, the positive contribution from the Tobin™s q
-driven shocks has declined
, following the observed decline in stock pric
es in the first 
half
 of 2016 and the gradual 
strengthening of debt financing growth.
 The average euro area corporate gross debt ratio remains historically high, 
which may weigh on investment decisions (see Chart 18).
 From a medium
-term 
perspective, high gross debt levels in a number of countries, in combination with 
possibly higher interest rates, may warrant further deleveraging since a large share 

of corporate debt is at variable rates. Meanwhile, among the largest euro area 
countries, the gross debt ratio of NFCs in Spain has fallen considerably since mid
-2012 and has reached
 the average euro area level, benefiting from significant debt 

write
-offs and net redemptions in bank loans. Under severe financial distress 
conditions 
Œ 
high gross debt levels combined with high perceived default 
probabilities 
Œ 
NFCs tend to reduce their investment spending significantly. However, 
firms™ record high liquid asset holdings and historically low debt servicing costs 
should mitigate the possible negative impacts of high debt levels on the economy in 
the current climate (see Chart 19).
                                                                     85 Tobin™s q is defined as the equity

 Box 4
 Drivers of business investment through the lens of a VAR model
 Additional insights on the impact of various factors on investment may be gained with the 
help of
 a model bringing the main factors together. 
This box presents evidence from a VAR 
model on 
drivers of 
business investment
, such as real factors
 and uncertainty.
87 While real factors 
are found to have supported the recent investment recovery, uncertainty 
is still weighing on 
investment growth. For the purposes of the model, 
ﬁbusiness investment
ﬂ 
refers to year
-on-year 
growth in total investment net of housing investment and 
net 
of interpolated annual government 
investment
, the latter
 taken
 from the AMECO 
database. ﬁDemandﬂ is GDP
 adjusted for business
 investment, ﬁprofitsﬂ refer
s 
to year
-on-year growth in total economy gross operating surplus and 
ﬁinvestmentﬂ represents investment
-specific shocks. ﬁInterest rateﬂ refers to NFCs™ lending rates and 
the ﬁuncertaintyﬂ measure is the financial volatility index VIX. Shocks are orthogonal and the 
identification uses Choleski decomposition, where uncertainty is ordered first.
                                                                     87 The impulse responses of investment to the variables used in the VAR

 Business investment developments in the euro area since the crisis
 64 According to the model, the current 
business investment recovery in the euro 
area is being driven by profi
t growth and 
improving demand. 
The results suggest that 
the investment recovery has been driven by a 

number of factors that have positively influenced 
investment at different stages, while some 

factors have 
continued to exert a drag. Profit 
growth seems to
 be the main driver (
see Chart 
A). A declining negative impact in 2013, followed 
by an increasingly important positive 
contribution from improving demand, also 
supported business investment during the 

recovery. Reduced uncertainty and falling 
interest rates, together with the impact of the 
investment
-specific shock, have also 
periodically been factors supporting the 
recovery, although uncertainty in this 
specification 
has
 weighed on investment more 
recently. Some caveats are attached to this type 
of estimate, as 
it is
 dependent on the choice of data and combination of variables. Still, it is a useful 
way to describe the time
-varying impact of various factors and their relative importance during the 
investment recovery.
  Long-term business investment decisions are affected by several institutional 
and regulatory factors.
 Regulatory and institutional factors describe the overall 
country
-specific attractiveness of doing business and cover labour market 
institutions, product market regulations, tax systems, debt restructuring mechanisms 

and contract enforcement
 frameworks
, as well as the overall quality of the public 
administration and the judicial system.
88 Not only can regulatory burdens and poor 
institutions affect the actual costs of investment projects, but they can also 

exacerbate the effects of uncertainty for any given future revenue and spending 
stream.
89 In particular, the creation of new firms can be affected by barriers to entry, 
for example owing to cumbersome licencing procedures. Additionally, administrative 
procedures can substantially affect the timing of the authorisation process and the 
expected costs of the investment. Moreover, highly rigid labour market institutions, 
which prevent an optimal allocation of labour, can discourage more innovative and 

risky investments
, increase expected project costs and 
lower 
the capacity to 
reallocate and adjust firms™ output. Firms™ decisions are also very sensitive to the 

degree of irreversibility of their capital plans. In this respect, an efficient judicial 
                                                                    88 A review of the importance of sound institutions for increasing economic resilience and thus influencing 
investment decisions can be found in the article entitled ﬁ
Increasing resilience and long
-term growth: 
the importance of sound institutions and ec
onomic structures for euro area countries and EMU
ﬂ, 
Economic Bulletin
, Issue 5, ECB, 2016.
 89 In Bloom et al (2007), factors which increase the irreversibility of capital accumulation tend to make 

firms more cautious.

 Business investment developments in the euro area since the crisis
 65 system and an effective debt restructuring procedure further increase the resilience 
of the economy by supporting a business environment in which it is easier to 

reallocate capital should 
an investment project become unpr
ofitable.
 Despite significant reforms in recent years, several 

regulatory and institutional factors contin
ue to drag 
on business investment.
 Chart 20 shows the 
relationship between an index that measures the overall 

capacity of a country to compete in international 

markets, based on the rule of law, size of government 
and regulatory efficiency and open market 
policies 
(Heritage Foundation™s Index of Economic Freedom) in 
2008 and the investment performance five years 
later. 
The chart shows that there is a clear positive correlation 

between a more business
-friendly environment (higher 
value in the economic index)
 and higher business 
investment growth over five years.
 The interaction between regulatory and institutional 

factors and other drivers analysed above may lead 

to non
-linear effects on business investment (see 
Box 5).
 In some euro area countries, an example
 is the 
interplay between a high level of indebtedness across 
firms and inefficient debt restructuring frameworks, 
which can slow down the deleveraging process and 
therefore postpone new investment projects.
 Box

Investment growth and structural reforms
 This box looks at the link between country
-specific structural characteristics and business 
investment performance.
 Informed by the firm
-based evidence reported in Box 3, the exercise 
described in this box aims to test, at the macro level, the relevance of
 structural variables for 
investment decisions. Based on the data available for ten euro area countries, a panel data model 
is estimated for the period 2002
-14, which links business investment growth to a set of macro and 
structural variables.

 Business investment developments
 in the euro area since the crisis
 66 Regulatory and in
stitutional indicators are 
found to be significant in explaining 
business investment growth.
 Table A shows 
the results of the estimated empirical panel 
model, where real business investment growth 
is the dependent variable and real GDP growth, 
the real lon
g-
term lending rate, a measure of 
uncertainty based on stock market volatility, an 
indicator of credit supply restrictions based on 
the euro area bank lending survey, the cyclical 

component of NFCs™ debt
-to
-asset ratio as a 
measure of excess leverage (leverage cycle) 

and the World Bank™s Doing Business indicator 

as a variable measuring the business 
environment are the explanatory variables.
90 Column (1) shows that higher real GDP growth 
and a more business
-friendly environment have 
a positive effect on busin
ess investment growth, 

while higher uncertainty, tighter credit supply 

conditions and excess leverage tend to depress 

business investment growth.
91  Model estimates suggest that the interaction 

between structural and certain cyclical 

factors may exacerbate business investment 
dynamics
 in crisis times.
 This effect is 
captured by including an interaction term 
between excess leverage and the business environment indicator (see Table A, column (2)). The 

additional interaction term is significant and suggests that the interplay between countries with 
overly
 indebted firms and a weaker business environment would negatively affect business 
investment growth.
                                                                     90 Estimation results and economic 
implications are robust to the choice of other structural indicators such 
as the Heritage Foundation™s Index of Economic Freedom, the OECD™s Employment Protection index 

and the World Bank™s Insolvency Framework index. All variables but the structural indic
ators and the 
bank lending survey indicator are lagged.
 91 The lending rate is significant in a panel regression without uncertainty. After introducing uncertainty, 

the lending rate loses significance in our estimation sample.

 67 Achieving a more busi
ness
-friendly 
environment can significantly boost 
business investment growth.
 Based on the 
empirical model, it is possible to simulate the 
effect of countries aiming to improve their 
relative ranking in the World Bank™s Doing 
Business indicator vis
-à-
vis t
he best three 
OECD performers. Chart A shows that such a 
reform effort would lead, on average, to an 
increase in business investment growth of 

approximately 1 percentage point per year, with 
the highest gains achieved in the countries that 
are furthest away from best OECD practices. 

While these results are in line with existing 
empirical evidence showing the importance of 
the quality of institutions to capital accumulation, 

productivity and growth (Alesina et al., 2005),
92 they should be interpreted with caution, given 

the partial equilibrium nature of the exercise, the 
relatively limited time span used
, the proxies used for measuring uncertainty (which only rely on 

stock market volatility) and the leverage cycle, which is based on an HP filter.
  Structural policies fostering investment
 There is a wide range of structural policies that are expected to be investment
-enhancing.
 These policies generally aim to improve the regulatory environment and 
credit conditions, reducing entry barriers and increasing the ove
rall flexibility of 

labour and product markets. Investment
-enhancing policies are expected to affect 
investment via many channels: by affecting firm
s™ cost of adjusting capital stock, 
easing the expansion of productive capacity, altering the rate of return
 on capital, 

increasing the availability of credit to the economy, lowering administrative burdens 

and influencing expectations and confidence and thus reducing uncertainty. Many 
euro area countries have embarked on a number of investment
-enhancing reforms
 since 2011; however, the pace of implementation has significantly slowed in recent 
years.
93 Policies that increase competition, reduce administrative burdens and favour 
business
-friendly regulations 
provide 
positive support 
to 
investment.
 In this 
respect, 
three classes of policy seem particularly important: (i) reforms that affect 
market efficiency and improve corporate governance structure

 68 owned enterprises, which can alter the provision of goods and services in specific 
market segments
; 94 (ii) reforms of licensing and administrative procedures that may 
significantly reduce the burdens 
of establishing a new firm, especially for non
-domestic investors; and (iii) reforms that can reduce or eliminate barriers to entry 

with a focus on the services sector, including professional services and network 
industries. With the deleveraging process still ongoing across euro area countries, a 
way forward to 
generate
 additional business investment is to implement policies that 
can back the creation of new firms and new investment projects. This would also 
contribute to sectoral reallocation from crisis
-hit sectors to more productive and 
innovative industries. These policies are particularly important to foster the Single 
Market and thus to increase the positive spillovers 
to
 investment resulting from more 
integrated and highly efficient economies. In the above areas, the pace of reform in 

recent years has remained relatively limited compared with country
-specific needs 
and the overarching objective of enhancing economic integration within the Single 
Market. The importance of these reforms has also been emphasised in the context of 
the 2016 country
-specific recommendations, where the Commission has significantly 
increased the number of recommendations addressing the need for policies to 

support investment through the enhancement of framework conditions.
95 High
 efficiency and flexibility in the labour market is also conducive to higher 

investment growth.
96 A comprehensive approach to labour market reforms should 
include measures that can support the reallocation of unemployed people away from 
crisis
-hit sectors, limit the negative effects of the depreciation of labour skills and 
avoid hysteresis effects on long
-term unemployment dynamics. Increasing labour 
market flexibility may also favour more innovative investment projects, as they tend 

to be riskier and usually require more job reallocation. Significant labour market 
reforms have recently been implemented across the most vulnerable euro area 
countries and their effects need to be continuously monitored.
 Measures to address the high level of indebtedness and the
 lack of an efficient 
debt restructuring fr
amework are particularly important to support investment 
across some euro area countries.
 An efficient system to restructure indebted 
corporates (e.g. by facilitating out
-of-court settlements, reducing time for in
solvency 
proceedings and facilitating the repossession of collateral) and to avoid a sudden 
increase in the level of non
-performing loans 
(NPLs) 
can positively contribute to the 
recovery. These policies would reduce the rigidity and complexity of the busin
ess 
environment and support the reallocation of firms towards more innovative and 
productive sectors. A stronger institutional infrastructure and supportive regulatory 

policies for the banking sector could provide further incentives for debtors and 
credito
rs to engage in debt restructuring. Policies to facilitate the transfer of non
-performing assets to new owners would also support the repair of bank balance 
                                                                    94 Corporate governance can shape firms™ balance

as well as their risk

 69 sheets (e.g. by fostering a market for NPL
-backed securities). These actions would 
strengthen the capacity of the banking sector to provide loans to the economy. They 
would strengthen the balance sheet of banks and at the same time help distressed, 
but viable, borrowers to start receiving new credit. In recent years, some countries 

have modernised their
 legislative frameworks for debt restructuring, but more effort is 
needed to make the new frameworks more effective and to increase their 
harmonisation across European countries.
 Finally, targeted and efficient infrastructure 
inves
tment can support business investment.
 A considerable volume of empirical literature in the early 

1990s has highlighted the importance of physical 

infrastructure as a determinant of economic growth 
(e.g. Easterly and Rebelo).
97 Infrastructure investment 
enhances the productivity of private capital, raising its 
rate of return and encouraging more investment. The 
availability of good quality physical infrastructure is also 
an important consideration for multinational enterprises 

in their locational choices for
 foreign direct investment. 
Infrastructure investment is generally provided by the 

public sector, public
-private partnerships or regulated 
private entities, in view of the fact that this type of 
investment tends to have significant up
-front costs, 
while the benefits or returns accrue over very long 
periods of time. The longevity (and the associated 
difficulty of ascertaining adequate returns over such a 
long horizon) can pose a challenge to private financing 
and provision. In deciding which infrastructure projects to undertake, governments 
must carefully weigh broader social returns against funding costs and fiscal 
consequences. Some euro area countries have witnessed a significant decline in 

public investment over recent years, while others have continued to see relatively 
low levels during the past 15 years.
98 At the same time the quality of the existing 
stock of infrastructure has been declining (see Chart 21). With a view to having a 
comprehensive strategy to stimulate investment and to create new jobs in 
Europe, 
the EU Investment Plan was launched in November 2014,
99 financed by the newly 
established (June 2015) European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).
100 By August 2016,
 the EFSI ha
d 
supported one

investment proj
ects
,101 which targets both small
-medium enterprises and larger 
projects. Over the longer term, the effects of the Plan may be sizeable provided that

 Conclusion
 Cyclical and structural factors supporting the investment recovery have 
improved over recent years. 
The recovery, underway since 2013, has been driven 
by improving demand and profit conditions and, for some euro area countries, good 
progress in the deleveraging process and improved financing conditions.
 In the years ahead, improving cyclical factors should continue to support 
business investment, while a slower underlying growth potential and 
remaining elevated debt may hold back investment decisions. 
Looking forward, 
business investment is expected to continue to grow. Recovering demand, 
accommodative monetary policy and improving financing conditions should boost 
investment. Improving profits and the need to replace capital after year
s of subdued 
fixed capital formation should also support total investment going forward. However, 
deleveraging needs and a still unfriendly business environment in some countries, as 
well as subdued potential growth prospects, may dampen investment growth.
 In 
addition, uncertainty related to the European Union™s future relations with the United 
Kingdom and its potential implications for the euro area economy might weigh on the 

investment outlook.
 Looking forward, the role of structural policies in fostering
 investment remains 

crucial.
 Policies affecting the regulatory environment, improving competition in 
product market
s, favouring labour flexibility and supporting debt deleveraging and 
credit growth via more effective insolvency frameworks are critical to provide a long
-term boost to business investment.
