 2 Economic and monetary
 developments
 Overview
 At its monetary policy meeting on 2 June 2016, the Governing Council 
assessed that the comprehensive package of decisions taken in early March 
underpins the momentum of the euro area™s economic recovery and foste
rs 
the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2%. 
The ECB
™s 
measures 
continue to ease the cost of credit and contribute to a strengthening in credit 

creation. The economic recovery
 in the euro area
 is proceeding
 gradually. Additional 
monetary 
stimulus, beyond the impetus already taken into account, is expected from 
the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, namely the corporate sector 

purchase programme (CSPP) and the new series of targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO II
), and will contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the 
outlook for growth and inflation. In the current context, it is crucial to ensure that the 

very low inflation environment does not become entrenched in second
-round effects 
on wage and price setting. The Governing Council will closely monitor the evolution 
of the outlook for price stability and, if warranted to achieve its objective, will act by 
using all the instruments available within its mandate.
 Economic and monetary assessment at the time of the Governing 
Council meeting of 2 June 2016
 Global growth remained subdued in the
 first quarter of 2016. 
Looking ahead, 
global activity is expected to continue to expand at a modest pace. Low interest 
rates, improving labour markets and growing 
confidence support the outlook for 
advanced economies. By contrast, the outlook for emerging market economies 
remains more uncertain as growth in China decelerates and commodity
-exporting 
countries adjust to lower commodity prices.
 Between early March and early June euro area and global financial markets 
returned to more stable conditions.
 A better than expected
 global economic 
performance
, a further recovery in oil prices and additional monetary stimulus in the 

euro area supported the valuations of risky assets. Consequently, euro area equity 

prices increased moderately over the review period, while the announcement of
 the 
Eurosystem
™s corporate sector asset purchases significantly reinforced the decline in 
spreads on bonds issued by non
-financial corporations. Long
-term euro area 
sovereign yields declined somewhat, closely mirroring movements in global long
-
term yields. In foreign exchange markets, the euro strengthened mildly.
 The economic recovery in the euro area is continuing. 
Euro area real GDP 
increased significantly
 in the first quarter of 2016. Growth continues to be supported 
by domestic demand, while being dampened by weak exports. The latest data point 
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 3 
to ongoing growth in the second quarter, though possibly at a lower rate than in the 
first quar
ter.
 Looking ahead, the Governing Council
 expect
s 
the economic recovery to 
proceed at a moderate but steady pace.
 Domestic demand remains supported by 
the pass
-through of 
the
 monetary policy measures to the real economy. Favourable 
financing conditions and
 improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote 
investment. Moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from 
past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil prices provide additional support for 

households™ real disposable income and private consumption. In addition, the fiscal 
stance in the euro area is slightly expansionary. However, the economic recovery in 
the euro area continues to be dampened by subdued growth prospects in emerging 

markets, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and a 

sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.
 The June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 

foresee annual real GDP 
to 
increas
e 
by 1.6% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017 and 
2018. Compared with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2016 and has remained broadly 

unchanged for 2017 and 2018.
 In the Governing Council™s assessment, 
the risks to 
the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but the balance of risks 
has improved on the back of the monetary policy measures taken and the stimulus 
still in the pipeline. Downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global 

economy, to the upcoming British referendum on EU membership and to other 
geopolitical risks.
 According to Eurostat™s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation in May 

2016 was 
-0.1%
. This low level of inflation reflects past falls in energy prices. 
Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely 
to remain very low or negative in the next few months before picking up in the 
second half of 2016, in large part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change 

in energy prices. Supported b
y the ECB
™s 
monetary policy measures and the 
expected economic recovery, inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018.
 The June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area 

foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3%
 in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.
 In 
comparison with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook 
for HICP inflation has been revised slightly up for 2016, reflecting recent oil price 
increases, and has remained unchanged for 2017 and 2018.
 The
 monetary policy measures in place since June 2014 have clearly improved 
credit flows across the euro area.
 Broad money growth decreased somewhat in 
April, but remained robust. 
Loan growth continued to recover gradually. Domestic 
sources of money creation were again the main driver of broad money growth. Low 
interest rates, as well as the effects of the ECB™s targeted longer
-term refinancing 
operations (TLTROs) and the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), continue 

to support money and credit dynamics. Banks have been passing on their favourable 

funding conditions in the form of lower lending rates, and the recovery in loan growth 
is still drawing strength from improved lending conditions. The total annual flow of 
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 4 
external financing to non
-financial corpo
rations is estimated to have increased 
moderately in the first quarter of 2016.
 Overall, the monetary policy measures in 
place since June 2014 have improved borrowing conditions for firms and households 
substantially
 and the comprehensive package of new monetary policy measures 
adopted in March this year underpins the ongoing upturn in loan growth, thereby 

supporting the recovery of the real economy.
 Monetary policy decisions
 The Governing Council assessed that a cross
-check of the outcome of the 
economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis 

confirmed the need to preserve an appropriate degree of monetary 

accommodation in order to secure a return of inflation rates towards levels 
that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay
. Th
e Governing Council 
decided to keep the
 key ECB interest rates
 unchanged
 and continue
d 
to expect 
these 
rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and 

well past the horizon of the Eurosystem
™s 
net asset purchases. Regarding
 non-standard monetary policy measures, 
the Governing Council confirm
ed that the 
monthly asset purchases of •80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 

2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a 
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. 
On 8 June 
the Eurosystem
 started
 making purchases under 
the 
CSPP. Moreover, on 22 
June 
the Eurosystem
 will conduct the first operation of
 TLTRO II
.

1 External environment
 The subdued
 glo
bal growth 
recorded
 towards the end of last year persisted into the 
first quarter of 2016.
 Looking ahead, global activity is expected to continue to expand 
at a
 moderate
 pace. Low interest rates, improving labour market
 conditions
 and growing confidence support the outlook for advanced economies. By contrast, the 

outlook for emerging market economies remains more uncertain
 as growth in China 
decelerate
s and commodity
-export
ing countries
 adjust to lower commodity prices. 
 Global economic activity and trade
 The global 
economy continues to expand at a moderate pace
. 
Activity indicators 
have stabilised, suggesting a continued 
steady
 trajectory for the global economy. In 
financial markets, sentiment has rebounded. Nonetheless, uncertainties continue to 
cloud the horizon as countries navigate the effects of a number of
 developments
 currently
 shaping
 the international environment, such as
 low commodity
 prices 
adversely impacting commodity exporters; the tightening of financial conditions, 

mostly in emerging market economies, partly associated with the normalisation of 
US monetary policy; the gradual rebalancing of the Chinese economy;
 and geopolitical risks, including the upcoming British referendum
. 
 Commodity prices have rebounded
 over the last three months
. The
 price of
 Brent crude oil has bottomed out 
following
 the 12
-year low 
recorded
 in January. Non
-oil commodity prices have also increased in the same period. The recent 
rise
 in oil 
prices reflects a combination of weaker supply and stronger demand. 
Global
 oil 
supply remained rather flat in March and April as OPEC output increased, 
while non
-OPEC output declined, particularly in the United States. At
 the same time, the 
International Energy A
gency
 raised its forecast for
 growth in
 global oil demand in 
the 
first quarter of 
2016, but
 left the growth estimate
 for 2016
 unchanged.
 From a longer
-term perspective, however, oil prices remain substantially below the peaks of 2014. 
As 
Box 1
 discusses, the anticipated boost to global activity from the pronounced 
slump in oil prices has been more muted than expected. One factor behind this 

outcome is that the drivers of the oil price decline have changed over time.
 While 
most of the early oil price decline in 2014 was explained by the strong rise in oil 
supply, 
subsequent falls appear to have reflected weakening
 global demand.
  Monetary policies in advanced economies 
remain highly accommodative.
 Having flattened during January, the Federal Funds Futures curve has shifted 
upwards
. With interest rates expected to remain low for an extended period of time in 
other major economies, the prospect of policy divergence among advanced 
economies has increa
sed.
 The subdued
 global growth towards the end of last year persisted into early
 2016. GDP growth 
moderated 
in the first quarter in the U
nited 
States
 and the 
United 
Kingdom
, although it rebounded somewhat in Japan. On average, activity in other 
non-euro area European economies also weakened. The data
 for emerging market 
economies
 have been more mixed. 
In China, macroeconomic data remain consistent 
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016

with a gradual slowdown, with activity
 supported by a rebound in the property sector 
and robust infrastructure 
spending 
in the first quarter. Russia has remained in deep 
recession, although there are signs that the economy 
is bottoming
 out as it benefits
 from higher oil prices. By contrast, the strong downturn in Brazil has continued
 amid 
high political uncertainty
. While s
urvey indicators 
of 
global economic activity have
 stabilised, trade 
growth has lost significant momentum
. 
Following its lowest reading in more than 

four years in February, the global composite output
 Purchasing Managers' Index
 (PMI
), excluding the
 euro area, recovered somewhat in April
 (see Chart 1)
. However, 
OECD composite leading indicators also point to a loss of growth momentum in 
advanced and emerging economies. Global trade growth turned negative again at 

the start of 2016. 
The volume of 
glob
al imports of goods 
fell
 by 1.8% in the first 
quarter of the year. Estimates of 
trade 
volumes were revised sharply downwards for 
January and
 February (see Chart 2)
. 
Although advanced economies still reported 
positive import growth, trade was very weak in emerging market economies
, 
particularly in 
emerging Asia. The negative reading for the first quarter of 2016 
followed two consecutive quarters of relatively strong import growth. 
Base effects 
related to a particularly weak figure 
for
 January may point to i
mproved
 momentum in 
the coming months, but surveys continue to suggest a subdued outlook for global 
trade, with the global PMI for new export orders decreasing in April.

economies and the progressive easing of the deep recessions in some large 
emerging market economies
. Continued low interest rates, improving labour

 conditions
 and growing
 confidence are expected to support

advanced economies. By contrast, the outlook for emerging market economies
 remains more uncertain. 
The gradual deceleration of the Chinese economy is likely 
to weigh on growth in other emerging market economies, particularly in emerging 
Asia. 
Nevertheless, the gradual recovery of Russia and Brazil from deep recessions 
should support global growth
. Looking at individual countries in more detail, a
fter 
moderating
 in the first 
quarter of the year, economic activity in the United States is expe
cted to 

rebound.
 Domestic fundamentals remain supportive 
Œ 
reflected in strong job growth, 
rising nominal wage
s 
and an increase in
 real disposable income 
Œ 
with
 domestic 
demand expected to continue as
 the main driver of 
the 
US growth outlook. 
Activity 
shou
ld gradually gain traction
, supported by more robust consumption and the end of 

the adjustment in the energy sector. On the other hand, net exports are likely to 
remain a drag on activity 
given
 the past strengthening of the US dollar and weak 
growth in foreign demand. At the same time, although credit spreads have declined 
somewhat, interest rates have risen. 
 Economic activity in the United Kingdom continues to grow 
steadily
. A moderate recovery in activity is expected, driven primarily by consumption as l
ow 
energy prices continue to 
raise
 real disposable incomes. Although lower than in 
previous years, investment growth remains positive, supported by easing credit 
conditions
. However, growth is
 potentially constrained
 by the uncertainty surrounding 
the referendum on 
EU m
embership. 
 The 
outlook for 
Japan remain
s 
subdued
. F
ollowing the 
decline
 in activity in the 
final quarter of 2015, GDP rebounded in the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead
, 

activity should benefit from accommodative monetary policy and the boost to 
incomes from lower oil prices. A gradual rise in real wages, reflecting the tightening 
labour market, should also 
support
 household spending. Exports are expected to 
benefit from gr
adually improving foreign demand, but this will be tempered by the 
recent rebound of the yen.
 Moreover, f
iscal consolidation 
will weigh 
on demand
.  Real economic activity in central and eastern Europe 
Œ 
albeit uneven across 
countries 
Œ 
is projected to rema
in robust
. The main drivers of growth in the region 
continue to be dynamic private consumption
 Œ 
reflecting
 higher real disposable 

income in 
the low inflation environment
 Œ 
and strong investment growth supported by 
EU structural funds
. 
 The Chinese economy
 is 
expected to slow in the medium term
. 
Activity 
continues to be supported by low oil prices, robust consumption and
 a marked 

improvement in the housing market. Greater stability in financial markets and the 

renminbi (effective) exchange rate have helped to alleviate some of the uncertainty
, which was particularly high at the start of the year. In the near term, 
monetary 
accommodation and fiscal stimulus is expected to provide some support for the 

economy. 
In the medium term, 
however, 
increasing emphasis on reducing 
overcapacity in some heavy industries and dealing with the related non
-performing 
loans 
are expected to slow the pace of expansion
. 
ECB Economic Bulletin,

Commodity
-export
ing countries
 continue to 
adjust to 
the sustained decline in 
commodity prices
. In Russia, still in the midst of a deep recession, funding costs 
remain elevated despite the easing of financi
ng conditions during 2015. Uncertainty 
is high
, business confidence 
is weak and
 lower oil revenue continues to keep public 
expenditure depressed. Looking 
ahead, weak positive growth is expected to return 
only in the second half of 2016, while in 2017 the economy is projected to grow 
at 
around its potential rate. In Brazil, political uncertainty, deteriorating terms of trade, 
and tightening monetary policy and financing conditions are weighing heavily on 
economic activity. L
ooking ahead,
 growth is projected to recover 
somewhat
 from the 
deep recession
, as commodity prices stabilise and the drag on investment in 
commodity sectors moderate
s.  
Overall, the outlook for 
global growth remains one of a gradual and uneven 
recovery
. According to the 
June
 2016 Eurosystem
 staff 
macroeconomic projections, 
world real GDP growth excluding the euro area is projected to accelerate from 3.1% 
in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017 and 3.8% in 2018. 
Euro area foreign demand is expected to 
increase from 2.0% in 2016
 to 3.5% in 2017 and 4.0% in 2018
. 
The modest pick
-up in activity and trade foreseen in the baseline
 scenario
 reflects resilient growth in 
advanced economies and 
a progressive easing of the deep recessions in large 
emerging market economies, namely Russia and Brazil,
 over the projection horizon, 
offset
ting
 the gradual 
slowdown in the Chinese economy. Compared 
with
 the March 
projections
, the outlook for
 world
 growth has 
been revised 
slightly 
downwards.
 Revisions to euro area foreign demand are broadly in line with those to world growth.
 Risks to the outlook for global activity remain on the downside, most 
prominently for 
emerging market economies
. 
A k
ey downside risk 
is a stronger 
slowdown in 
emerging market economies, including China. Tightening 
financing
 conditions and heightened political uncertainty may exacerbate existing 

macroeconomic imbalances, denting confidence and slowing growth more than 

expected. Policy uncertainty 
surrounding
 the economic transition in China may lead 
to an increase in global financial volatility. Geopolitical risks also continue to weigh 

on the outlook, including the upcoming British referendum. Finally, persistently low 
oil prices 
may 
aggravat
e 
fiscal 
or financial 
imbalances in some oil
-exporting 
countries.
 Global price developments
 The effects of past oil price declines continue to weigh on global headline 
inflation.
 Annual consumer price inflation in the OECD area fell to 0.8% in March
, from 1.0% in February
, as the drag from falling energy prices increased
 (see Chart 
3). Excluding food and energy, OECD annual inflation has remained unchanged at 
1.9% since December. Among large emerging market economies, inflation remains 
high in Brazil but has fallen in Russia
, as the effects of past depreciation
 of the 
rouble
 have waned. In China, inflation has risen slightly on the back of a temporary 

increase in food prices.
 ECB Economic Bulletin,

Global inflation is expected to remain subdued in 
the short
 term, before rising slowly from the second 
half of 2016 onwards.
 The fall in the prices of oil and 
other commodit
ies
 at the start of the year 
Œ 
the recent 
rebound notwithstanding 
Œ 
should dampen inflation 
rates further in the short term. 
Looking
 ahead, the 
upward sloping oil futures curve 
implies
 increases in oil 
prices over the projection horizon. At the same time, 
abundant spare capacity at the global level is expected 
to weigh on underlying inflation over the medium term.

 10 2 Financial developments
 Between early March and early June euro area financial markets returned to more 
stable conditions relative to those prevailing at the beginning of 2016, just like their 

counterparts at the global level. Better than expected global economic 
conditions
, a 
further recovery in oil prices and additional monetary stimulus in the euro area 

supported market 
valuations of risky assets. 
Euro area equity prices increased 
moderately over the review period, i.e. 
between
 9 March 
and
 1 June
 2016, 
while the 
announcement of corporate sector asset purchases by the Eurosystem significantly 

reinforced the decline in spreads on bonds issued by non
-financial corporations
 (NFCs)
. 
Yields on long
-term euro area sovereign 
bonds 
declined somewhat, closely 
mirroring movements in global long
-term yields. In foreign exchange markets, the 
euro strengthened 
modest
ly.  In contrast to the developments observed at the 
beginning of the year, financial markets across the 
euro area 
Œ 
and the world as a whole 
Œ 
experienced 
a period of relative tranquillity between early Marc
h and early June 2016, following improvements in the 
global economy and further increases in the price 
of oil. 
These improvements continued a trend that had 
started in the middle of February on the back of positive 
economic data releases in the United States, a 
recovery in oil prices, and expectations of further 

monetary stimulus in the euro area. The concomitant 
improvement in global financial market sentiment and 
decline in financial market volatility continued after the 

Governing Council announced additional easing 
measures at its meeting in March. Overall, these 
developments helped stock markets in most advanced 

economies to recoup the losses incurred since the start 
of the year, while corporate bond spreads narrowed. In 
emerging markets, sovereign bond spreads became 

smaller, with most countries experiencing an 
improvement in external financing conditions (see 
Chart
 4).
 The euro overnight index average (EONIA) declined during the review period
, following 
the Governing Council
™s 
decision to 
cut the deposi
t facility rate by 10 
basis points to 
-0.40% 
on 10 
March. 
The
 EONIA fell by 
9.7
 basis points during 
the
 review period
 (9 March to 1 June), reflecting a complete pass
-through of the 
decrease in the deposit facility
 rate. Since the start of the second 
reserve 
maintenance period
 of 2016, when the rate cut took effect, the EONIA has remained 
in a range between 
-32 
and -36 
basis points
, except 
for 
at the end of the first quarter
, 
when it temporarily rose to 
-30 basis points. Excess liquidity increased by •
144 billion
, to
 around
 •845 billion
, in the context of
 Eurosystem purchases 
under the 
expanded asset purchase programme

 Notes: The item ﬁeuro areaﬂ denotes the GDP
-weighted average of ten
-year sovereign 
bond yields. The item "United States" denotes the ten
-year Treasury yield. The latest 
observation is for 
1 June 2016.
 Amid the low overall volatility, changes in the EONIA f
orward curve were 
limited, with some declines in the middle segment of the curve.
 At the short 
end, the curve moved marginally upwards over the review period, largely reflecting 
financial markets
™ 
upward revision of short
-term forward rates in the euro area on the 
day of the Governing Council
™s meeting in March. In the middle segment, the curve 
shifted downwards somewhat, suggesting that market participants were expecting 

the key ECB interest rates to stay lower for longer. By contrast, longer
-term EONIA 
forward rates were virtually unchanged between early March and early June (see 
Chart 5).
 Yields on long
-term euro area government bonds declined somewhat over the 
review period, closely mirroring movements in global long
-term yields. 
In 
March sovereign yields were on a downward trajectory, with the GDP
-weighted 
average of ten
-year euro area government bond yields reaching an all
-time low of 
0.75% on 1 April 2016. Euro area long
-term yields increased thereafter, but repeated 
declines set in from late April. These declines in long
-term spot rates were consistent 
with the decrease in medium
-term EONIA forward rates and saw the GDP
-weighted

Greece. While euro area long

the monetary policies of the two economies.

 12 Following the Governing Council
™s announcement 
of the corporate sector purchase programme 
(CSPP),
 spreads on bonds issued by non
-financial 
corporations declined significantly. 
The 
announcement of the CSPP in March reinforced a 

narrowing of NFC bond spreads that had been ongoing 
amid the improvement in global market sentiment from 

mid
-February. Spreads
 then continued to decline 
gradually, including after the release of the CSPP 

implementation details at the Governing Council
™s meeting in mid
-April, before widening slightly in the 
course of May. On balance, NFC bond spreads in early 

June were significantly lower than in early March (see 

Chart 7). While spreads on bank bonds followed a 
similar pattern, their reductions were relatively more 
muted.
 Euro area stocks recorded moderate gains amid 
low market volatility.
 The broad EURO STOXX index 
increased by around 2% between 9 March and 1 June 
2016. This compares with the circa 6% rise made by the S&P 500 index in the 

United States (see Chart 8). Euro area bank equity prices decreased by around 2%. 
Moreover, the prices of euro area bank stocks experienced more pronounced swings 
in both directions than the wider market as profitability concerns, as well as country 
and bank
-specific events, continued to weigh on the sector.

 14 3 Economic activity
 Euro area real GDP increased 
significantly 
in the first quarter of 2016
 and growth 
continues to be supported by domestic demand, while being dampened by weak 
exports. The latest data point to ongoing growth in the second quarter, though 
possibly at a lower rate than in the first quarter. Looking ahead, the economic 
recovery is expected to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. Domestic demand 

remains supported by the pass
-through of the 
ECB
™s monetary policy measures to 
the real economy. Favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate 

profitability continue to promote investment. Moreover, sustained employment gains, 

which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, and still relatively low oil 
prices provide additional support for households™ real disposable income and private 
consumption. In addition, the fiscal stance in the euro area is
 slightly expansionary. 
However, the economic recovery in the euro area continues to be dampened by 
subdued growth prospects in emerging markets, the necessary balance sheet 
adjustments in a number of sectors and a sluggish pace of implementation of 

struct
ural reforms. The June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections 
foresee euro area real GDP growing by 1.6% in 2016 and by 1.7% in 2017 and 
2018. Economic 
growth in 
the euro area
 strengthened in 
the first quarter of 2016 and the level of real GDP 
has now surpassed its peak in 2008 (see Chart 10).
 Real GDP growth came out stronger than in the 
previous quarter in many euro area countries and 
seems to have been supported by continued positive 
contributions from private consumption
 and also 

investment, which nonetheless remains far below its 
peak level seen before the crisis. Net exports are likely 
to have continued to be a drag on growth in the first 

quarter of 2016, on account of the subdued growth in 

global trade.
  Private consumption dynamics seem to have held 
up in the first quarter of 2016 and this component 

remains the main driver of the ongoing recovery. 

Despite a fall in March, retail sales and car registrations 

rose by 1%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter, 

following a temporary slowdown in the fourth quarter of 
2015, reflecting lower sales of seasonal clothing and 
lower energy consumption due to the mild winter, as well as adverse impacts 
stemming from the November terrorist attacks in Paris. From a longer perspective, 
consumer spending has benefited from rising real disposable income among 
households, which in turn primarily reflects rising employment but also lower oil 
prices 
(see Chart 11) and a fairly stable savings ratio. Moreover, while euro area 
households
™ 
interest earnings have declined since 2008,
 their net interest earnings 
have been fairly stable. With redistribution from net savers to net borrowers, interest 
income should continue, on balance, to support private consumption (see Box 3

 households
™ 
balance sheets have gradually become less constrained and consumer 
confidence has 
regained strength
 on the back of the continued decline in the 
unemployment rate.
 Further improvements in euro area labour markets 
lend support to private consumption via aggregate 
labour income. 
Employment increased further, rising 
by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 
2015. As a result, employment stood 1.2% above the 
level recorded one year earlier, which represents the 
highest annual increase since the second quarter of 

2008. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stood at 
10.2% in April, the lowest rate since August 2011, 
having declined consistently since mid
-2013. More 
timely information such as surveys point to ongoing 
moderate improvements in euro area labour markets.

Roughly 
4% of the
 labour force 
is currently involuntarily

 owing to a lack of full

 a similar proportion is discouraged and is not actively

 Thus, 
the euro area labour market is likely to be characterised by 
substantially more slack
 than suggested by the unemployment rate alone. 
 Following
 an increase in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector and 
overall 
strong growth in capital goods production
, investment growth
 is likely 
to have continued at the robust pace seen at the turn of the year
. 
Demand 
conditions have also improved and are thus supporting business investment. Since 

2013, for example, demand has become less frequently mentioned in the European 
Commission
™s survey as a factor limiting production (see Chart 12). Resi
dential 
investment, on the other hand, was likely to have been supported by favourable 
weather conditions in the first quarter, but also by the
 strengthening
 of housing 
market
s more generally as evidenced by 
increase
s 
in ap
plications for building 
permits and demand for mortgages. Looking ahead, demand for residential property 

should be further bolstered by low mortgage rates and growth in households

disposable income
, as well as by some search for yield in an environment where the 

return on alternative assets is low. Improving f
inancing conditions
, rising profits and 
ample
 cash reserves 
among euro area firms
, combined with gradually improving 
domestic and external demand, are also expected to support business investment 

going forward.
 Nevertheless, 
the recovery in total investment may be dampened by 

the further need for corporate deleveraging in some countrie
s,

 The downward trend in goods export growth seems to have continued in the 
first q
uarter of 2016
 following subdued global trade developments 
(see 
Chart
 13). Important export destinations such as the United States, but also 
Switzerland and Japan contributed negatively to export growth and exports to the 

United Kingdom grew less than in the last quarter of 2015. Among the large 
emerging market economies, weak demand in Brazil and Russia remained a drag on 

goods export growth, while the contribution of China was broadly neutral
 after having 
been negative during 2015. 
 Export
 growth
 is expected to increase only modestly in the short term,
 amid
 continuing
 weak global trade dynamics
. Export orders as well as sentiment 
among exporters point to 
continued
 subdued external trade developments in the 
near term and recent movements in the effective exchange rate of the euro are not 

providing any relief. However, export market shares are expected to remain elevated 

owing to the lagged effects of previous gains in competitiveness. Looking further 
ahead, euro area export growth is expected to gradually pick up in line with euro 
area foreign demand.
 Overall, available

 point to
 ongoing moderate 
growth in

with

 18 4 Prices and costs
 According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 
-0.1% in 
May. This low inflation 
rate 
reflects past falls in energy prices. Looking ahead, on th
e basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are likely to remain very low or 
negative in the next few months before picking up in the second half of 2016, in large 
part owing to base effects in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Sup
ported 

by the ECB™s monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery, 
inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018. This broad pattern is also 
reflected in the June 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro 

area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 0.2% in 2016, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 
2018. Compared with the March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the 
outlook for HICP inflation remains broadly stable.
 Headline inflation increased slightly in May, but remained in negative territory. 
According to Eurostat's flash estimate, the annual rate of HICP inflation increased to 
-0.1% in May, from 
-0.2% in April, driven mainly by higher 
energy price inflation
 and somewhat higher serv
ices 
price inflation
 (see Chart 16). Owing
 to 
the increase 
in 
services 
price inflation
 from 0.9% in April to 1.0% in May, HICP inflation excluding

increased

 19 containing 
the negative contribution of
 energy prices to headline inflation, as 
HICP 
energy price inflation
 still 
stood at a very low level of 
-8.1% in 
May 
2016. The impact 
of the recent upward movement in oil prices 
will 
become clearer once the earlier 
strong declines drop out of the annual inflation rate calculation
. The associated 
upward impacts of the resulting base effects explain most of the expected rise in 

headline HICP inflation over the coming period until early 2017 (see Chart 17).
 Underlying inflation 
fails to show any clear upward 
trend.
 This is corroborated by a broad range of 
alternative measures of underlying inflation 
(see 
Chart 
18). 
Following an upward movement in the first half of 
2015, HICP inflation excluding food and energy 
hovered between year
-on-year rates of 0.8% and 1.1% 
from July 2015 to March 2016. Its movement recently 

has been quite volatile, with the annual rate of change
 
increasing from 0.8% in February to 1.0% in March but 
then falling back to 0.7% in April. This movement 
resulted primarily from developments in services price 

inflation, which increased from 0.9% in February, to 
1.4% in March 2016, but then returned to 0.9% in April. 
The recent volatility in HICP inflation excluding food and 

energy 
can therefore
 largely 
be explained by a calendar 
effect. 
Easter occurred in March this year and in April 
last year, pushing the annual 
services price 
inflation 
rate up in March
 2016 and down in April 
2016, 
particularly for travel
-related 
items such as package 
holidays.

which can be 
strongly affected by
 calendar effects 
Œ 
the 
underlying inflation
 trend
 is far more 
stable but 
show
s 
no clear signals of upward momentum
. 
The import price inflation 
rate 
turned negative and 
producer price pressures 
have remained subdued
. In 2015 import price inflation in consumer goods 
excluding food and energy was buoyant, reaching a record high of 5.6% in April of 
that year. Due to the recent appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro 
and also to the impact of global disinflationary pressures stemming from lower 
oil 
prices, this rate has since fallen and, at 
-0.5%
, entered
 negative territory in March 
(see Chart 
19). The impact of decelerating import prices is evident in the 
durable 
goods 
component of HICP inflation, which saw strong upward momentum that is now 
continuing
 to lose its vigour. 
Inflation rate
s 
in 
other components of the HICP 
consumer goods sub
-indices 
with relatively high import content, such as semi
-durables, have also declined 
recently
. This direct impact of the effective exchange 
rate of the euro via imported consumer goods should be distinguished from the 

overall effects of exchange rate movements working through the production and 
pricing chain. As these take several quarters to fully materialise, the past 
depreciation of the euro exchange rate is also still passing through. However, for the 

time being, the annual inflation rate of

-term inflation 
expectations have continued to stabilise, but 
remain at levels substantially below 
those of 
survey
-based expectation meas
ures
. The five
-year 
forward inflation 
rate five years ahead has increased 

recently 
to stand somewhat higher than its all
-time low 
at the end
 of February
 (see Chart 20). However, 
looking 
at a longer historical 
period
, market
-based measures of inflation remain at low levels. 
This partly reflects an indication
 that market participants consider inflation unlikely to
 pick up soon
. At the same time, it also reflects current inflation risk premia that are 

most likely slight
ly negative, suggesting that market
-based indicators of inflation tend 
to underestimate future inflation somewhat. 
Despite 
the low level of actual inflation
 and of market
-based inflation expectation indicators, the deflation risk priced in by 
the market continues to be very limited. In contrast to market
-based measures, 
survey
-based measures of long
-term inflation expectations
, such as those 
included 
in the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters 
(SPF) 
and in 
Consensus Economics
 surveys,
 have been far more stable and resilient to the downward adjustment of 
shorter
-term expectations. According to the results of the 
latest 
SPF, the 
average 
point forecast for inflation
 five
 year
s 
ahead stands at 1.8%, unchanged from the 
previous survey, and the downside risk to this mean expectation appears to have 

decreased slightly
.                                                                     1

 21 Looking forward, HICP inflation for the euro area is 
projected to 
be low in 2016 but to pick up in 2017 
and 2018.
 Based on
 the information available in mid
-May
, the 
June 201
6 
Eurosystem 
staff macroeconomic 
projections for the euro area 
foresee
 an HICP infl
ation 
rate of 0.2% in 2016, ris
ing
 to 1.3
% in 2017 and 
1.6
% in 
2018 (see Chart 17)
.2 Over the projection horizon, 
developments in
 energy
 price
 inflation 
are
 expected to 
play a major role in shaping the profile of HICP inflation. 
The contribution of energy 
price 
inflation is 
forecast
 to
 turn positive in 2017 as a result, in particular, of
 strong 
upward base effects. Underlying inflation 
(as measured
, for example
, by HICP 
inflation 
excluding food and 
energy
) 
is expected to increase gradually in the coming 
yea
rs as improving labour market conditions and 
declining economic slack translate into higher wages 

and profit margins. This 
increase will be
 supported by 
the effects of the ECB™s monetary policy measures and 

the continuing pass
-through of
 previous
 declines 
in the 
effective 
exchange rate
 of the euro. Compared 
with
 the 
March 2016 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, the outlook for 
HICP inflation 
remains
 broadly stable.

 22 5 Money and credit
 Money growth decreased 
somewhat 
in April, but remained robust. At the same time, 
loan growth
 continued to recover gradually. Domestic sources of money creation 
were again the main driver of broad money growth. Low interest rates, as well as the 
effects of the ECB™s targeted longer
-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and the 
expanded asset purchase programme (APP), continue to support
 money and credit 
dynamics. Banks have been passing on their favourable funding conditions in the 

form of lower lending rates
, and the recovery in loan growth is still drawing stre
ngth 
from improved lending conditions. The total annual flow of external financing to 
non-financial corporations (NFCs) is estimated to have increased moderately
 in the 
first quarter of 2016.
 Broad money growth decreased
 somewhat
, but remained 
robust
. The annual 
growth rate of M3 
moderated
 to 
4.6
% in April 2016, after having hovered around 
5.0% since May 2015 (see Chart 2
1). 
Broad money 
growth was once again 
supported by the most liquid components. M1 has recently been showing signs of 

deceleration as its
 annual growth rate 
also decreased
 in April 2016, 
though remains 
at a high level. Overall, recent developments in narrow money
 still confirm that the 
euro area remains on a path of gradual economic recovery.

 Note: The latest observation is for

  Overnight deposits, which account for a significant proportion of M1, 
continued to boost M3 growth (see Chart 2
2). 
The very low interest rate 
environment is providing incentives for holding the most liquid components of M3. 
This development reflects inflows relating to the sale of public sector bonds, covered 
bonds and asset
-backed securities by the money
-holding sector in the context of the 
APP. By contrast, short

 23 M1) contracted further
 in the first quarter of 2016 and in April
. 
In addition, the growth 
rate of marketable instruments (i.e. M3 minus M2), a small component of M3, 
continued to decline in the first quarter of 2016 and 
in 
April, despite the ongoing 
recovery in money market fund shares/units. 
 Domestic sources of money creation were again the main driver of broad 
money growth. 
Among 
these, credit to general government remained the 
most 
important factor behind
 money creation, while credit to the private sector displayed a 
gradual
 recovery
. The former 
trend 
reflects the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy 
measures
, including the public sector purchase prog
ramme (PSPP). 
A significant 
percentage of the assets acquired 
under 
the PSPP were purchased from 
monetary 
financial institutions (
MFIs
) 
(excluding the Eurosystem). MFIs™ longer
-term financial 
liabilities (excluding capital and reserves)
 Œ 
the 
annual rate of change of which 
has 
been negative since June 2012
 Œ 
decreased 
at a slightly lower rate in April
 2016. 
This reflects the flatness of the yield curve, linked to the ECB™s non
-standard 
measures, which has reduced incentives for investors to hold longer
-term
 bank 
instruments
. The attractiveness of the TLTROs as an alternative to longer
-term 
market
-based bank funding is a further explanatory factor. 
Meanwhile
, the MFI 
sector™s net external asset position remained a drag on
 annual M3 growth, partly 
owing to 
cap
ital outflows from the euro area and the ongoing portfolio rebalancing in 
favour of non
-euro area instruments; a trend which can be explained by euro area 
government bonds sold by non
-residents 
via 
the PSPP.
 Loan dynamics recovered gradually, but bank lend
ing was still weak.
 Credit
 growth
 improved moderately 
for
 both firms and households. The annual growth rate 
of MFI loans to the private sector increased in the first quarter of 2016 and 
remained 
stable in April (see Chart 2
1). While the annual growth rate of loans to NFCs
 stayed 
subdued (see Chart 2
3), it has recovered substantially from the trough of the first 
quarter of 2014. This improvement is broadly shared by the largest countries, 
though 
loan growth rates 
are 
still negative in some jurisdictions. 
In 
comparison, the annual 
growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for sales and securitisation) picked up 
slightly in the first quarter of 2016 and remained broadly unchanged in April (see 

Chart 2
4). The significant 
decreases
 in bank lending rates seen across the euro area 
since summer 2014 (notably owing to the ECB™s non
-standard monetary policy 
measures) and improvements in the supply of
, and demand for
, bank loans have 
supported these 
trends
. However, the ongoing consolidation of bank balance sheets 
and persistently high levels of non
-performing loans in some countries continue to 
curb 
loan growth.
 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 24 Changes in credit standard
s and loan demand once again contributed to 
improving 
loan growth. 
The April 2016 euro area bank lending survey identified 
a number of important factors behind increasing loan demand, including 
the low 
general level of interest rates, financing needs for fixed investment and 
favourable 
housing market prospects (see survey at: 
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/surveys/lend/html/index.en.html
). In this 
context, the 
expan
ded asset purchase programme had a net easing impact on credit 
standards and particularly on credit terms and conditions. Banks also reported that 

the additional liquidity from the APP and the TLTROs was mainly used to grant 

loans. At the same time, euro area banks reported that the APP 
has 
had a negative 
impact on their profitability. Despite the positive developments
 mentioned
, loan 
growth
 remained weak
, again reflecting
 factors such as subdued economic 
conditions and the consolidation of bank balance sheets. Moreover, in some parts of 

the euro area, tight lending conditions are still weighing on loan supply.

 25 Banks™ funding costs have stabilised close to their 
historical lows. 
The composite cost of bank funding 
has been declining for a number of years (see Chart 

25
) against the backdrop of net redemption of MFIs™ 
longer
-term financial liabilities. In general, the ECB™s 
accommodative monetary policy stance, a 

strengthening of balance sheets and receding 

fragmentation across financial markets have supported 
the decrease in banks™ c
omposite funding costs. 
Meanwhile, as regards banks™ access to funding, the 
April 2016 euro area bank lending survey shows that, 
with the exception of securitisation, no further 
improvements were noticeable in the first quarter of 
2016 for the other major market instruments
. 
 Bank lending rates for the private sector have 
declined further (see 
charts 2
6 
and 2
7). Composite 
lending rates for NFCs and households have de
creased 
by significantly more than market reference rates since 
June 2014. 
Receding fragment
ation in euro area 
financial markets and the improvement in the 
pass
-through of monetary policy measures to bank lending rates
 have played a 
positive role here. Furthermore, the decrease in banks™ composite funding costs has 
supported the decline in composite lending rates. Since
 June 2014, banks have 
been progressively passing on the decline in their funding costs in the form of lower 
lending rates. Between May 2014 and March 2016,
 composite lending rates on loans 
to both 
euro area NFCs and households fell
 by more than 80 basis points
 Œ 
vulnerable 
euro area countries have seen particularly strong reductions in bank 

lending rates. Over the same period, the spread between interest rates charged on 
very small loans (loans of up to •0.25 million) and those charged on large loans 

(loans of above •1 million)
 in the euro area followed a downward path. 
This 
generally 
indicates that small and medium
-sized enterprises are benefiting to a 
greater
 extent 
than large 
companies
 from the decline in
 lending rates.

The cross

countries. The latest observation is for March
 2016. The total annual flow of external financing to euro area NFCs is estimated to 
have increased
 moderately 
in the first quarter of 2016. 
NFCs™ external financing 
still 
stands below the levels observed in early
-2012 (the post
-financial crisis peak) 
and end
-2004 (before the period of excessive credit growth). The recovery in NFCs™ 
external financing seen since early
-2014 has been supported by the improvement in 
economic activity, further
 declines in the cost of bank lending, the easing of bank 
lending conditions and the very low cost of market
-based debt. Meanwhile, NFCs 
further increased their cash holdings in the first quarter of 2016
, bringing these to a 
new historical high 
Œ 
a development related to 
remaining
 concerns about the 
strength of the global recovery and low opportunity costs.
 NFCs™ net issuance of debt securities rose strongly in March 2016
, after 
contracting in January and February. 
The March increase 
was 
mostly 
a product of
 special factors and resulted in a positive flow for the quarter as a whole. Market data 
show that issuance activity 
grew
 modestly in April and May, being supported
, inter 
alia
, by the ECB™s 
monetary 
policy package
 of March 2016. The net issuance of 
quoted
 shares by NFCs remained subdued in the first quarter of 2016.
 The overall nominal cost of external financing for euro area NFCs has 

decreased slightly since March 2016, reaching a new historical low. 
This 
decline 
is mainly explained by the fall in the cost of equity financing and, to a lesser 
extent, 
by 
the reduction 
in the cost of market
-based debt financing. These 
developments were supported by positive economic news, the announcement of the 
ECB™s
 March 
monetary policy 
package,
 as well as 
the 
global
 phenomenon of 
declining yields.

 27 6 Fiscal developments
 The euro area budget deficit is projected to further decline over the projection 
horizon (2016
-18) mainly
 as a 
result of 
improving 
cyclical conditions and decreasing 
interest payments. The aggregate f
iscal s
tance for the euro area is projected to be 
expansionary in 2016, but to tighten somewhat in the period 
2017-18, 
notwithstanding large cross
-country differences. 
In a number of
 Member States 
the expected 
fiscal stance 
implies
 risks of non
-compliance with the Stability and Growth 
Pact (SGP). In particular the countries with high debt levels
 would need
 additional 
consolidation efforts to set their public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
 The euro area general government budget deficit is projected to decline over 

the projection horizon
. Based on the 
June
 2016 Eurosystem
 staff macroeconomic 
projections
3, the general government deficit ratio for the euro area is expected to 
decline from 2.1% of GDP in 2015 to 1.4% of GDP in 201
8 
(see 
the t
able).
 The
 fiscal 
outlook has 
improved
 slightly 
over the projection horizon, 
compared with the 
March
 2016 
projections
. The improvement is mainly due to a better macroeconomic outlook 
and lower interest payments, while changes to discretionary f
iscal policy are 
expected to be limited.
 The projections are less optimistic than what the euro area 
countries outlined in their 2016 updates of the stability programmes, which also 
include fiscal measures that are not yet legislated for nor fully specifie
d. 
 The euro area fiscal stance is projected to be expansionary in 2016, but to tighten 
somewhat in the period 2017
-18.
4 The loosening of the aggregate fiscal stance in 
2016, which can be viewed as broadly appropriate in the light of the remaining amount o
f 
slack in the economy, reflects the impact of discretionary fiscal measures, such as cuts in 

direct taxes and social security contributions in a number of euro area countries. The 
slightly tighter fiscal stance in the period 2017
-18 is expected to result from restraint in 
government spending, which will outweigh deficit
-increasing measures on the revenue 
side. In particular, compensation of employees and intermediate consumption are 

projected to grow below nominal trend GDP growth. By contrast, social tran
sfers and 
government investment are expected to grow above potential. 
The projected euro area 

fiscal stance masks large cross
-country differences. In the case of
 those countries for 
which a 
fiscal loosening has been projected,
 the driving factors vary from
 country to 
country, ranging from the strong impact of the refugee influx to the impact of tax cuts and 
budgetary measures affecting the expenditure side.
 Euro area government debt will 
continue to decline
 from its elevated level.
 The 
euro area debt
-to
-GDP
 ratio
, which peaked in 2014, declined to
 90.7% of GDP in 
2015 and
 is projected to
 gradually decline further 
to 8
7.4
% of GDP by the end of 
2018. The projected reduction in government debt is supported by favourable 
developments in the interest rate
-growth 
differential, in 
the 
light of the 
better 
                                                                    3

The fiscal stance is measured as the change in the structural balance, i.e. the cyclically adjusted 

balance net of temporary measures
, 
such as government support to the financial sector
. For a 
discussion of the concept of the euro area fiscal stance, see the article entitled ﬁThe euro area fiscal 

stanceﬂ in this issue of the Economic Bulletin.

 28 macroeconomic outlook
 and assumed low interest rates. In addition, small primary 
surpluses and negative deficit
-debt adjustments, inter alia reflecting privatisation 
receipts, will also contribute to the better debt
 outlook. 
Compared with the March
 2016 
projections, the decline in the aggregate debt
-to
-GDP ratio
 for the euro area 
is expected to be slightly higher, mainly as a result of higher primary surpluses and a 
more favourable interest rate
-growth differential. From a cross
-country perspective, 
while the debt
-to
-GDP ratio is projected to decline in the majority of euro area 
countries, there are a few countries for which the government debt ratio is expected 

to increase over the projection horizon.
 In particular for the high debt countries, 
further consolidation efforts 
are 
needed to set the public debt ratio firmly on a 
downward path, as their
 high debt levels make them particularly vulnerable 
should 
there be
 renewed financial market instability
 or a rebound in interest rates.

 Risks of non
-compliance with the SGP are high in a number of countries.
 Governments need to strike a balance in their fiscal policy stance between reducing high 
debt levels and not impairing the recovery, while fully complying with the SGP 
requirements. For countries with fiscal space, it is welcome that they have used it. Yet 
countries without fiscal space should continue to implement the measures necessary to 
ensure full compliance with the SGP, thereby addressing debt sustainability risks and 
increasing resilience to future shocks. The European Commission released on 18 May its 
proposed country
-spe
cific recommendations for economic and fiscal policies for the EU 
Member States. It also identified risks of non
-compliance with the structural consolidation 
requirements of the SGP for many countries and published recommendations regarding 
the implementation of the SGP.
5 To ensure credibility, it is crucial that the fiscal 
governance framework is applied in a legally sound, transparent and consistent manner 

across time and countries.
 Moreover, to increase their room for fiscal manoeuvre, 
countries should s
trive for a more growth
-friendly composition of fiscal policies.

Global implications of low oil prices
 This box looks at the impact on global activity of the oil price declines during 
the last two years. 
Oil prices have fallen sharply since mid
-2014 and reached a ten
-year low
 in early 2016. F
rom 
their 
peak in June 2014 to 
the 
trough in January 2016
, 
Brent crude oil prices dropped by USD 82 per barrel (70%). Since then, they have 

recovered modestly by
 around
 USD
 17 per barrel
 and, based on oil futures
 contracts, are expected to rise only gradually in the medium term. 
 The drivers of the 
recent 
oil price decline have changed over time. 
While most 
of the oil price decline in 2014 could be
 explained by the 
significant
 increase
 in the 
supply
 of oil
, more recently the lower price has reflected weaker global demand. 
On 
the supply side, significant investment and technological innovations 
Œ 
particularly in 
shale oil extraction 
Œ 
caused oil production to surge at a time of weakening growth, 
particularly 
in energy
-intensive emerging market economies, putting downward 
pressure on oil prices
. Meanwhile, 
OPEC
™s decision in November 2014 to keep 
production quotas unchanged intensified the downward pressures on 
oil price
s amid 
rising oil inventories
. More recently, however,
 concerns
 have arisen that weaker
 global growth has been the main driver of the 
oil price falls. 
 The changing nature of the oil price shock has different implications for the 
global economy.
 In early 2015 the largely supply
-driven fall
 in oil
 prices
 was 
expected to have a
 significant 
net positive impact on global 
activity
, mainly via two 
channels: (i) income redistribution from oil
-producing
 to oil
-consum
ing countries, 
which
 were expected to have a larger marginal propensity to spend
; and (ii)
 profitability gains from lower energy
-input costs, which
 could stimulate
 investment 
and thus total supply in net oil
-import
ing countries. However, a more demand
-driven 
oil price fall 
since 
the second half of 
2015 suggests a less positive impact 
on the 
glo
bal economy. Although the low oil price may still support domestic demand 
through
 rising real incomes in
 net oil
-import
ing countries
, 
it would not necessarily 
offset the broader effects of 
weaker global demand.
 Model estimates underscore how the impact on the global economy depends 

on the underlying nature of the shock.
 Simulations
6 suggest that a 10% decline in 
oil prices that is entirely supply
 driven increase
s 
world GDP by between 0.1% and 
0.2%, whereas a 10% decline in oil prices that is entirely demand
 driven 
is typically 

associated with a 
decrease 
in 
world GDP 
of more than
 0.2%. Assuming
 that, for 
example, 60% of the oil price decline since mid
-2014 has been supply
 driven and the 
remainder demand
 driven, the 
models suggest that the combined impact of t
hese 
two shocks on world activity would be close to zero 
(or even slightly negative
). 
                                                                    6  
The models that are used for the simulations are 
the
 National Institute Global Econometric Model
 (NiGEM)
, the six
-mod version of the IMF™s Flexible System of Global Models
, 
and a structural vector 
auto
-regressive
 (SVAR) model with sign restrictions to iden
tify supply and demand oil price shocks
. 
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 30 The e
xperience 
of 
the past year also suggests that changes in the 
transmission channels may have dampened the
 expected positive
 impact of 
lower oil prices on global activ
ity. 
Compared with previous episodes of oil price 
declines
 in the 1980s and 1990s, the combined effect of several countervailing 
factors may have altered the propagation mechanisms of the recent oil price 
shock.

  On the one hand, the 
adverse 
impact on net oil
-exporting
 countries
 appears to 
have been 
rather severe, 
and has been 
accompanied by negative spillovers to 
other 
emerging market economies
. In several net oil
-exporting countries, the 
oil 
price decline has interacted with other shocks (including fallout from geopolitical 
tension) to generate a significant macroeconomic adjustment. 
Major net oil exporters 
have 
managed to cushion, to some extent
, the initial adverse impact on their output 
fro
m the recent oil price decline by running substantial and rising fiscal deficits
. 
Nonetheless, GDP growth in these countries has still 
decline
d significantly
 compared 
with 
the rest of the world (see Chart A).
 With spot crude 
oil prices 
falling
 well below 
fiscal breakeven prices, i.e. the prices required to balance government budgets (
see 
Chart B)
, 
the fiscal situation has become increasingly more 
challenging in several
 major oil producers, particularly 
those
 with currency pegs to the US dollar or other 
tigh
tly 
managed
 exchange rate arrangements (e.g. Iran, Iraq, Nigeria
, Saudi Arabia,
 the United Arab Emirates
 and Venezuela). Monetary policy has also been 
constrained in commodity
-exporting
 countries with more 
flexible exchange rates (
e.g. 
Canada, Mexico
, Norw
ay and Russia). As the currencies 
of these countries 
have 
(sharply) 
depreciated, inflationary pressures have risen, thereby limiting the room for 

monetary policy easing in response to slowing growth. Finally, financial strains have 
exacerbated the downturn in prices, particularly in countries with foreign currency

s. 
While 
the share of 
major oil
-exporting
 countries
 in the global economy is 
relatively small (
roughly 15% of 
global 
GDP 
based 
on purchasing power parity
), 
negative 
spillovers to countries with close trade or financial links
, and global 
confidence effects
, have weighed on global economic
 activity.
 On the other hand, the pickup in demand in 
several net 
oil
-importing
 countries 
as a result of income windfalls from lower oil prices has so far been 
rather 
limited
. From a longer
-term perspective, this could reflect lower energy intensities 
compared with earlier episodes of oil price declines in the 1980s and the 1990s
. 
In a 
more recent context,
 other factors may have restricted the responsiveness of 
consumption
 to the oil price decline in some countries, although such effects are 
often difficult to disentangle empirically. For example, an increase in personal 

savings in some countries could be related to continued needs for 
deleveraging
 that 
may have prompted households to save more of the windfall gains from lower
 oil 
prices 
than might
 otherwise have been the case. In addition, expectations may
 have 
played a role: spending may
 build up only gradually if it takes time for households to 
believe that the 
lower oil 
price 
level will persist
. Meanwhile, a
mong emerging market 
economies, 
government savings from lower energy subsidies
 have been used for 
fiscal consolidation rather than additional economic stimulus
. Finally, other factors
, such as exchange rate developments and downward adjustments in
 equity and other
 asset
 prices amid increased global economic uncertainty
, 
may
 have dampened the 
positive impact of lower oil prices on consumption. 
 Taking the example of the United States
 as one of 
the largest net oil importer
s, the benefits 
for
 consumption 
of lower oil prices have been smaller
 than initially anticipated and largely offset by sharp 

falls in energy
-related investment
. The oil price 
decline has supported consumption, but uncertainty 
about the persistence of low oil prices may have 
weighed on 
confidence
, implying that the impact of the 

oil price
 drop was smaller than initially expected.
 Meanwhile, the impact of lower oil prices on US shale 
oil investment was significant, and amplified by the high 
degree of leverage of shale oil producers and their 

vulnerability to funding constraints. Since the start of 
th
e oil price decline in mid
-2014, energy
-related 
investment has dropped 
cumulatively 
by 65%,
 making a 
negative contribution to GDP growth (see Chart C),
 while the number of oil rigs has declined to almost one
-third
 of the original number
. 
Yet, in net terms, the 
estimated impact of the oil price decline on 
US 
GDP so 
far 
is judged to be modestly positive. 
 In sum, compared with a year ago, when oil price falls were dominated by 

supply factors, recent developments suggest that low oil prices have 

in
creasingly reflected weakening global demand.
 While a largely supply
-driven 
fall in oil prices was expected to have a net positive impact on global GDP, a more

-driven oil price decline is less likely to provide significant support to global 
activity
. Moreover, the assessment of the role of lower oil prices is clouded by a high 
degree of uncertainty. One factor driving this uncertainty is possible financial stability 
and fiscal challenges in some commodity
-exporting countries. Another factor is 
concer
ns of a more general economic slowdown in emerging market economies, 
fuelled by widening domestic imbalances and tighter financial conditions in some 
countries.

Liquidity conditions and monetary policy 
operations in the period from
 27 January 2016 to 26 April 2016
 This box describes the ECB™s monetary policy operations during the first and 
second reserve maintenance periods of 2016, which ran from 27 January to 15 
March and from 16 March to 26 April respectively. 
On 10 March 2016, the 
Governing 
Council announced a comprehensive package of monetary policy 
decisions, which included a cut in all key ECB interest rates, an expansion of the 
asset purchase programme in terms of monthly volumes and asset eligibility, plus
 a series of four new targeted l
onger-term 
refinancing operations (TLTROs)
7. Thus, 
during the second maintenance period the interest rates on the main refinancing 

operations (MROs), the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were lowered 

to 0.00%, 0.25% and 
-0.40% respectively as of 16 March
8. On 30 March 2016 the 
seventh TLTRO was settled for •7.3 billion, compared with •18.3 billion in the 

previous TLTRO in December 2015. This brought the total allotted amount in the first 

seven TLTROs to •425.3 billion.
9 In addition, the Eurosystem continued buying 
public sector securities, covered bonds and asset
-backed securities as part of its 
asset purchase programme (APP)
10, with a targeted purchase amount that increased 
from •60 billion to •80 billion per month in the second maintenance
 period.
 Liquidity needs
 In the period under review, the average daily liquidity needs of the banking 

system, defined as the sum of autonomous factors and reserve requirements, 
stood at •778.6 billion, an increase of •72 billion compared with the previous 
review period (i.e. the seventh and eighth maintenance periods of 2015).
 This greater liquidity need is almost exclusively attributable to an increase in autonomous 

factors, which rose on average by •71.1 billion to stand at •664.5 billion (see table).
                                                                     7

 8  
MROs continued to be conducted as fixed
-rate tender procedures with full allotment. The same 
procedure remained in use for the three
-month longer
-term refinancing operations (LTROs). 
The 
interest rate in
 each LTRO was fixed at the average of the rates on the MROs over the 
relevant 
LTRO™s 
lifetime.
 TLTROs continued to be conducted as fixed
-rate tender procedures with an interest rate equal 
to the MRO rate.

 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 35 The increase in autonomous factors was mainly a result of an increase in 
liquidity
-absorbing fac
tors.
 The main contributor to this increase was government 
deposits, which increased on average by •42.7 billion to stand at •130.3 billion in the 

period under review. This increase was equally divided between the first and second 

maintenance period
s. The increase in government deposits reflects the reluctance of 
some treasuries to place their excess liquidity at negative rates in the market, owing 

to both demand and rate constraints. Other autonomous factors averaged •573.7 

billion, up •10.7 billion from the previous review period, mainly reflecting an increase 
in other liabilities to euro area residents denominated in euro. In addition, banknotes 
averaged •1,066.1 billion, up •0.9 billion compared with the previous review period, 
contributing the least to the overall increase in autonomous factors.
 Liquidity
-providing factors declined over the period on the back of lower net 
assets denominated in euro.
 Net assets denominated in euro averaged •489.0 
billion, down •22 billion from the previous review period. Most of this fall occurred
 during the first maintenance period on account of a decline in financial assets held 
by the Eurosystem for purposes other than monetary policy, together with a small 
increase in liabilities held by foreign institutions with the national central banks. 

Foreign institutions increased their holdings despite the further cut to the deposit 
facility rate, possibly owing to
 fewer attractive investment alternatives in the market. 
In addition, net foreign assets increased by •5 billion to stand at •616.8 billion. This 

increase occurred exclusively in the second maintenance period, while the first 
maintenance period saw a marginal decline. This appreciation of net foreign assets 
was mainly driven by an increase in the US dollar value of gold, which was only 
partially offset by an appreciation of the euro in the first quarter of 2016.
 The volatility of autonomous factors remained elevated during the period 
under review.
 Such volatility primarily reflected strong fluctuations in government 
deposits and
, to a lesser extent
, the quarterly revaluation of net foreign assets and 
net assets denominated in euro. The level of volatility remained broadly unchanged 

compared to the previous review period, while the level of autonomous factors 
continued its
 upward trend. Still, the
 average absolute error in weekly forecasts of 
autonomous factors declined by •1.4 billion to •6.0 billion in the period under review
, 
due to lower forecast errors for government deposits.

by •10.6

during the period unde

The increase in average liquidity 
provided by the TLTROs was more than offset by a 
decrease in liquidity provided by regular operations. 
More specifically, the liquidity provided in MROs and 

the three
-month LTROs decreased by •8.4 billion and 
•14.3 billion respectively, while the outstanding amount 

of TLTROs increased by •12.1 billion over the review 

period. As the 
only 
TLTRO 
so far in 2016 was allotted 
in March, the overall decline in liquidity provided 

through tender operations was less pronounced in the 
second maintenance period than in the first.
 The average liquidity amount provided through the 
asset purchase programme increased by •175.9 
billion to stand at •950.3 billion, mainly on account 

of the public sector purchase programme. 
The 
average liquidity provided by the public sector purchase programme, the third 

covered bond purchase programme and the asset
-backed securities purchase 
programme rose by •155.7 billion, •21.1 billion and •3.4 billion respectively. The 
redemption of bonds held under the securities markets programme and the previous 
two covered bond purchase programmes amounted to •4.3 billion.
 Excess liquidity
 As a consequence of the developments detailed above, average excess 
liquidity rose by •93.3 billion to stand at •693.6 billion in the period under 

review (see 
chart). 
The increase in liquidity was more noticeable in the second 
maintenance period, when average excess liquidity rose by •44.4 billion on account 

of increased purchases and slightly smaller
 increases in autonomous factors 
compared with the first maintenance period. The relatively small increase during the 
first maintenance period was mainly driven by the larger rise in autonomous factors, 
which partially absorbed the increase in the asset purchase programme.
 The rise in excess liquidity was mostly reflected in higher average recourse to
 the deposit facility, which increased by •59.3 billion to stand at •245 billion in 
the period under review. 
Average current account holdings also increased, albeit to 
a lesser extent, by •34.9 billion, to stand at •562.7 billion.
 Interest rate developments
 In the review period, money market rates decreased further on the back of the 
cut in the deposit facility rate to 
-0.40%.
 In the unsecured market, the EONIA 
(euro overnight index average) averaged 
-0.286%, down from an average of

Low interest rates and households™ net 
interest income
 The ECB™s accommodative monetary policy stance has substantially lowered 
borrowing costs for firms and hou
seholds, while also lowering the returns on 
savings. 
As households do not only borrow, but also save, this raises the question 
about the extent to which lower interest rates have affected households™ net interest 
income. This is particularly relevant when assessing the impact of lower interest 

rates on aggregate consumption.
 Households™ interest earnings have decreased by 3.2 percentage points as a 

share of disposable income since autumn 2008. 
Chart 
A 
shows the evolution of 
household income from holding int
erest
-bearing assets such as deposits, bonds and 
loans.
12 However, this excludes the effect of lower interest rates on households™ 
income and wealth via the investments of pension funds and life insurance
 providers, 
and the
 capital gains on long

 39 interest payments
 fell by about 3 percentage points
 relative to disposable i
ncome
. The drop in interest earnings is comparable
 to the drop in interest
 payments, 
meaning that the average euro area household™s net interest income has been 
largely un
affected.
 At the same time, to the extent that individual households are net 
savers or net borrowers, in terms of net interest income some households have 

gained from lower interest rates while others have lost.
 The net interest income of the household sector has remained fairly stable
 in 

Germany and France
, but less so in Italy and Spain
. Chart B shows that, in 
Germany and France, the drop in interest earnings and payments is comparable
, 
meaning that lower interest rates have had a minimal effect on the net interest 
income of the household sector as a whole. Conversely, in 
Italy
, the drop in 
household interest earnings is more than twice as large as the drop in household 
interest payments, with a negative impact on households™ overall net interest income. 
The reason for this is that Italian households hold a relatively large amount of 

interest
-bearing assets
 (see 
Chart C), whereas they are relatively less indebted 
(see
 Chart
 D). In Spain,
 the drop in interest payments is significantly larger
 than the 
fall in interest earnings, with a positive impact on households™ overall net interest 

income. The larger decline in interest payments
 in Spain is explained by both the 
high
 stock of
 household debt 
(Chart D) 
and the fact that the interest rates paid on a 
large share of mortgages are indexed to money market rates
. Th
e stronger impact 
on interest payments in Spain 
is also 
in line with evidence that monetary policy 
has 
relatively large effects
 in countries with adjustable

 40 Despite lower interest earnings for net savers
, low interest rates continue to 
support
 private
 consumption.
 Lower
 interest rates typically support consumption 
today through intertemporal substitution for future consumption
, as borrowing 

becomes cheaper and saving becomes less rewarding. In addition, as
 average
 euro 
area household net interest income has been 
largely
 unaffected, 
lower interest rates 
have mainly redistributed resources from net savers to net borrowers.
 As net 
borrowers typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume than net savers, 

this redistribution channel of lower interest rates further supports aggregate 

consumption
.14 Lower interest rates also support the wealth and income of households 

through other channels
. 
Households tend not only to be savers; they also invest in 
other assets for which they do not necessarily receive interest payments. There is 
evidence that the positive impact of lower interest rates on the prices of euro area 
stocks and bonds has been significant.
15 Moreover, lower borrowing costs have not 
only stimulated investment and consumption; they have also supported households™ 
income through higher employment. By holding interest rates low, the ECB has 
encouraged the demand that is needed to bring the economy back to potential, so 
that
, ultimately
, interest rates can rise again.

Improved timeliness of the euro area 
quarte
rly GDP flash estimate:
 first experiences
 On 29 April 2016, Eurostat published for the first time a preliminary flash 
estimate for euro area and EU GDP with timeliness of 30 days after the end of 
the reference quarter (first quarter of 2016). 
This new development meets a long
-standing request from users for more timely information about economic growth in 
Europe. It aims at establishing 
a release 
calendar of 30, 60 and 90 days after the 
end of the reference quarter for national accounts statistics. Moreover, it aims to fulfil 
the commitment made by the European Statistical System (ESS) to provide 
policymakers with reliable, comparable and timely statistics.
16 The GDP flash 
estimate released 45 days after the end of the reference quarter (published since 
May 2003) has been considered to be an intermediary step towards that aim.
17 This 
flash estimate is used to analyse the conjunctural developments in the euro area and 

provides important input for the ECB's economic analysis, macroeconomic 

projection
s and short
-term forecasting. It will continue to be published by Eurostat in 
parallel until the new preliminary GDP flash estimate is better established and more 

countries start publishing their national preliminary flash estimates. Neither flash 

estimate
, however, provides information on revisions to the previous quarters' 
results, although revisions to the preliminary GDP flash estimate can be observed 
with each subsequent release. 
 The underlying methodology 
for
 the preliminary 
GDP 
flash estimate for th
e euro area (and the EU) is the same as 
that
 applied for compi
ling
 the 
GDP 
flash 
estimate at 45 days
.18 The quarter
-on-quarter growth rate
 of euro area 
GDP is
 estimated
 from national data by aggregating the 
national 
seasonally and calendar 
adjusted
 quarter
-on-quarter 
growth rates
 using the 
annual 
weights of 
country
 GDP in 
current prices for the previous 
year.
 The euro area GDP is then derived by applying 
the estimated euro area growth rate for the current quarter to the level of GDP for the 
previous quarter, thus also allowing the year
-on-year GDP growth rate to be 
compiled. 
The main difference with regard to the GDP flash estimate at 45 days
 is in 
the availability of national data to users. Most euro area countries do not yet publish 
                                                                    16  
See 
The ESS Vision 2020
, p. 5.
 17  
Initially only four euro area countries (Germany,
 Greece, Italy and the Netherlands) provided Eurostat 
with national GDP flash estimates at 45 days. Eurostat used related indicators to estimate GDP for the 
missing large euro area countries. To some extent, this served as the basis for countries to develo
p 
national flash estimates themselves. Although the GDP flash estimates are not part of the ESA 2010 

legal framework, nor were they under ESA 95, the increased use of statistical methods and the sharing 

of experience between countries have also played a ro
le.
 18  
The methodology is explained in Eurostat's paper "
Euro area and European Union GDP flash 
estimates at 30 days
", Statistical working papers
, 2016 edition. This methodology replaced that for 
compiling the 
GDP flash estimate
 at 45 days after the end of the reference quarter in 2013.
 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 42 the GDP flash estimates at 30 days but provide them to Eurostat on a confidential 
basis as input for compiling the euro area and
 EU preliminary GDP flash estimates. 
At present only six euro area countries: Belgium, Spain
, France, Latvia, Lithuania
 and Austria (representing 39% of euro area GDP in 2015) publish GDP flash 

estimates at 30 days. The euro area GDP preliminary flash estimate for the first 
quarter of 2016 was based on 11 euro area countries and covered 94% of total euro 
area GDP, of which 55
% 
was provided on a confidential basis.
19 The table below 
provides an overview of the national GDP release practices, as well as the extent of 
compliance with the ESA 2010 legal requirement to provide data at 60 days after the 
end of the reference quarter. This overview suggests that there are some trade
-offs 
in terms of timeliness, level of detail and quality for compiling quarterly nati
onal 
accounts which need to be considered when analysing the data.

 Notes: GDP flash releases refer to Q1 2016 data. Second GDP release
s refer to 
Q4 
2015 data.
 Beyond the releases listed in the table, some euro area countries (e.g. Belgium and 
France), as well as some non
-euro area countries (e.g. the United Kingdom) publish third GDP releases about three months after the end of the reference qu
arter. 
They include 
revisions to the previous estimates for GDP and 
the 
main aggregates. Eurostat discontinued the third euro area 
GDP 
database update
 in September 2014
, 
when ESA 2010 entered 
into force. In addition, 
quarterly 
sectoral
 a
ccounts (early release published at about 1
10 days
 and final release 
two week
s later
) might provide revision
s to the second euro area 
GDP 
release; however these are currently not aligned with the quarterly national accounts for the euro area
. 
The main difficulty
 in the 
national est
imation of 
GDP 
flash estimates at 30 days 
arises
 from the limited availability of source data 
for the third month
 of the

 43 GDP flash estimates, the third month is usually estimated or partially estimated by 
applying statistical modelling techniques that make use of available monthly 
information (e.g. short
-term statistics, business surveys, price statistics and 
preliminary estimates of the source data). Several estimation methods are applied at 
the national level
 for the GDP flash estimate: direct approaches (e.g. autoregressive 
distributed lags, dynamic factor models), indirect approaches (temporal 

disagg
regation techniques), pure forecasting models (autoregressive integrated 

moving average (ARIMA) models, structural time
-series models) or multivariate 
models (vector autoregression (VAR), structural models). The choice depends on the 

national source data availability for the third month 
Œ 
at about 28 days 
Œ 
after the end 
of the reference quarter while, at the same time, applying the same 
compilation
 practices as in the 
regular
 quarterly national accounts 
(i.e. non
-flash estimates) to
 ensure closeness
 or a high level of consistency with
 the 
final results.
  
While it is still 
too 
early to 
assess the reliability of the newly available euro 
area preliminary 
GDP 
flash estimate, according to Eurostat
's
 test
s20 it
 has met
 predefined recommended
 quality acceptance criteria.
 They showed the following 
results for the euro area preliminary GDP flash estimate
21: 
  Unbiased estimate
 of the euro area GDP growth at 45 days with an average 
revision within +/
-0.05 percentage point and no more than 66.7% of revision in 
the same direction. Against this criterion, the results for the euro area were 
0.0
 percentage point of average revision and equal distribution of the upward 
and downward revisions, accordingly. 
  Maximum average absolute revision
 for the euro area of 0.1 percentage point 
in comparison to the flash GDP growth at 45 days
 and 0.13 percentage point in 
comparison to the GDP growth published around 65 days
 after the end of the 
reference quarter. The actual results for the euro area were
 in both cases 
0.06
 percentage point.
  Sufficient coverage
 defined as 70% of total GDP for the euro area. For the 
quarters used for the test estimates, the coverage was on average 83% of total 

GDP for the euro area, consistently reaching 94% in the last three quarters.
 Whe
n examining
 the data for the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary 
GDP 
flash estimate for the euro area indicated quarter
-on-quarter growth of 0.
55%, 
which was revised 
down 
by 
0.03
 percentage point to 
0.52
% with the release of 
the GDP 
flash 
estimate at 45
 days.
 This could be attributed to two main factors: 
first, revisions attributable to better national source information and, second, a 

marginally larger coverage of the euro area (97% of the euro area GDP). 
                                                                     20  
The euro area test estimates were performed over the past two years for both the quarter
-on
-quarter 
and year
-on
-year growth rates based on eight quarters of real
-time tests for Q1 2014 
- Q4 2015 and

 The improved timeliness of the estimates of quarterly GDP growth for the euro

 projections and analytical assessments 

will benefit.

Country
-specific recommendations for 
fiscal policies under the 2016 European 
Semester
 On 18 May 2016 the European Commission announced its proposed 
country
-specific recommendations for economic and fiscal policies for all EU 
Member States except Greece, including recommendations for implementing 
the EU™s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
 The country
-specific 
recommendations 
are scheduled to be approved by economic and 
finance 
ministers on 1
7 
June and to 
be endorsed thereafter by the European Council on 28
-29 June.
22 The Council™s 
fiscal policy 
recommendations aim to ensure that countries comply with the SGP. 
Hence, they give opinions on the 201
6 
updates to
 stability and convergence 
programmes, which governments had to submit to the European Commiss
ion and 
the Council 
by mid
-April. In terms of follow
-up, the country
-specific recommendations 
for fiscal policies issued under the 
2016 European Semester will need to be reflected 
in the draft budgetary plans for 2017
 which 
euro area countries have to submit to the 

Eurogroup and the European Commission
 by mid
-October. 
Against this background, 
this box reviews the recommendations for fiscal policies that were addressed to the 
18 non
-programme euro area countries. 
 According to the European Commission™s sprin
g 2016 
forecast, the aggregate 
fiscal stance of the euro area is expected to be slightly expansionary in 2016 
and 2017
.23 On the one hand, this indicates that euro area countries which have 
achieved their medium
-term budgetary objective (MTO), most notably Germany, are 
using part of their fiscal space. On the other hand, it also reflects the fact that a 
sizeable number of countries, including those with high government debt levels, are 
falling short of their structural consolidation commitments under the Pact (see the 
table). 
 Consequently, t
he Co
mmission
™s country
-specific recommendations identify 
risks of non
-compliance wit
h the structural 
consolidation
 requirements of the 
SGP in 
many

 46 adjustment requirements are anticipated in countries that are currently under the 
Pact™s preventive arm, even though for some countries these requirements have 
been lowered markedly. In concrete terms, following a recent agreement on how to 
operationalise the flexibility that the SGP includes for structural reforms
24, countries 
that have not achieved their MTOs can progress towards them more slowly by 
delivering smaller structural consolidation efforts if they implement structural reforms, 
addit
ional investment and pension reforms.
25 The structural adjustment requirements 
have for some countries been further reduced to accommodate the costs they incur 
for hosting refugees and for additional security spending. Overall, the granting of this 
flexibil
ity has lowered the requirements for progressing towards the MTO from, on 

average, 0.5% of GDP to 
-0.1% of GDP in 2016.
26 This notwithstanding, the 
countries under the SGP™s preventive arm which have not yet achieved their MTO 

are expected to fall short of the reduced requirements by conducting expansionary 

fiscal policies corresponding, on average, to 
-0.3% of GDP. This further 
delay
s 
the 
achievement of MTOs by Member States and thus hinders a return to robust public 

finances during 
the
 unique window of opp
ortunity 
provided by
 favourable financial 
conditions.
27  The fiscal policy recommendations for countries 
therefore 
vary 
according to 
the 
existing room for budgetary manoeuvre
. They call on Member States whose 
structural efforts are expected to fall short of
 their commitments under the SGP to 
implement further measures to ensure the required compliance. Furthermore, 
countries that have not yet achieved their MTOs and are expected to maintain 
general government debt at a level that exceeds the 60% of GDP thres
hold 
(Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Finland) are recommended to 
use any so
-called windfall gains, i.e. savings from lower than anticipated interest 
payments, for deficit reductions. At the same time, among the euro area countries 
tha
t have already reached their MTOs, Germany is recommended to achieve a 
sustained upward trend in public investment, especially in infrastructure, education, 
research and innovation. The Netherlands are recommended to prioritise public 
expenditure towards supporting more investment in research and development.

s: 
In this table, requirements of zero reflect that countries were at the MTO at the beginning of the respective year. Structural effort commitments under SGP (second and last 
column) reflect the requirements which for some countries have been reduced to account for flexibility granted vis
-à-
vis the implementation of structural reforms, government 
investment and pension reforms and for the costs of hosting refugees and additional security spending
. EDP refers to excessive deficit procedure.
 On 18 May the 
Euro
pean 
Commission also released 
recommendations
 regarding the implementation of the Stability and 
Growth 
Pact. The Commission 
recommended abrogating the excessive deficit procedures (EDPs) for Ireland and 
Slovenia by their 2015 deadlines as well as the abrogation of the EDP for Cyprus 

one year ahead of its 2016 EDP deadline. In reports prepared under Article 126(3) of 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission 
examined the breach of the debt criterion in Belgium, Italy and Finland in 2015 and 

decided against opening an EDP. In the case of Finland, the breach of the 
government debt reference value by 3.1% of GDP is explained by mitigating factors, 
including financial support to other euro area countries to safeguard financial sta
bility 

and also the negative impact of the economic cycle. As regards Belgium and Italy, 
the Commission reports accounted for relevant factors, including (i) compl
iance
 with 
the 
structural effort requirements under the preventive arm of the SGP
, (ii) 
unfavourable economic conditions (i.e. weak
 growth and low inflation
) which make 
compliance with the debt rule 
more
 difficult,
 and (iii) implementation of growth
-enhancing structural reforms. For both countries, the assessment of compliance with 
the SGP™s preventive arm over 2016
-17 took account of reduced requirements 
resulting from the flexibility granted to cope with the costs of hosting refugees and

 48 additional security spending. Moreover, in the case of Italy, additional flexibility was 
granted for structural reforms and investment which 
Œ 
on top of the above
-mentioned 
flexibility 
Œ 
reduced the structural effort requirement in 2016 from 0.5% of GDP 

to 
-0.35% of GDP, in the light also of the authorities™ commitment to broad 
compliance with the SGP in 2017. In the autumn the Commission will revisit the 
resumption of the adjustment path towards the MTO, based on the draft budgetary 
plan for next year. T
he 
assessments of compliance with the debt rule did not 
consider previous 
shortfall
s 
in fiscal consolidat
ion 
as an aggravating factor or 
quantify the impact of relevant factors in a comprehensive manner to ensure that any 
discrepancies with the debt rule were explained in full
.28  Furthermore, the European Commission™s country
-specific recommendations 
advised 
extending the EDP deadlines for Portugal and Spain by one year to 2016 
and 2017, respectively, with structural effort requirements of 0.25% of GDP this year. 
Notably, while the country
-specific recommendations are
 based on Articles 121 and 
148 TFEU, the Council has to take decisions under the excessive deficit procedure 
as laid out under Article 126 TFEU. Moreover, while Article 10(3) of Council 
Regulation (EC) No 1467/97
29 asks the Council to act immediately in the event that 
an excessive deficit has not been corrected, the assessment of whether the deadline 
extensions should be associated with a stepping up of the EDP and possible 
sanctions was postponed to early July. Apart from this, the recommended structural 

effort of 0.25% of GDP compares with an adjustment of ﬁat least 0.5% of GDPﬂ 

envisaged in Article 3(4) of Regulation No 1467/97. 
 Finally, the Commission did not recommend opening a significant deviation 

procedure for Malta, which under the SGP™s preventive arm was found to have 

deviated significantly from both the structural effort requirement and the expenditure 

benchmark in 2015 under the Commission™s spring 2016 forecast. 
 To ensure credibility, it is important that the governance framework is applied 

in a legally sound, transparent and consistent
 manner across time and 
countries.
 Learning the lessons from the crisis, major improvements 
were
 made to 
the EU™s fiscal governance framework in 2011 and 2013. The introduction of the debt 

rule to the corrective arm of the SGP and the establishment of the 
significant 
deviation procedure for the preventive arm (to help ensure sufficient progress 
towards the MTOs) are of particular significance here. The same holds for changes 
to the decision
-making process intended to shield the European Commission from 
poli
tical pressure with the aim of increasing automaticity in the application of rules 
and sanctions. For these improvements to be effective, the full, transparent
 and consistent implementation of the SGP is essential. The approach 
to
 the 
implementation of the
 SGP under the 201
6 
European Semester has raised a number 

of questions, which 
will
 need to be examined.

 The role of euro area n
on-monetary 
financial institutions in financial 
intermediation
 With bank lending staging a slow and protracted recovery
 in the wake of the global 
financial crisis, non
-monetary financial institutions (non
-MFIs) 
have 
expanded their
 share of financial intermediation in the euro area. In doing so, they have helped to 
mitigate the effects of the financial and sovereign debt crises on the euro area 
economy. At the same time, the observed shift in intermediation towards institutions 
other than banks may have implications for monetary policy transmission. 

Differences in regulation and supervision, in particular, appear to motivate
 some 
non-MFIs to adjust their risk exposures more quickly than banks in response to 
changes in the business and financial cycle
s, thereby accelerating the transmission 
of monetary policy, while other sectors, like long
-term institutional investors, may 
have a stabilising impact
. In this respect
, 
the rising role of non
-MFIs that are subject 
to less regulation and supervision has to be assessed for its possible repercussions 
on monetary policy transmission. In addition, the interplay of all financial 

intermediaries needs to be monitored from a monetary policy perspective.
 1 Introduction
 With lending by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) recovering 
only 
slowly, 
financial institutions outside the MFI sector have accounted for a rising share 

of financia
l intermediation in the euro area since the global financial crisis.
30 Between the end of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2015, non
-MFIs expanded their 
share of financial assets held by euro area financial corporations from 42% to 57%.
31 They have thus helped
 channel funding to the various sectors of an economy whose 

financial intermediation has traditionally mainly relied on banks.
32  The interaction of several factors, both cyclical and structural in nature, can be 

identified as being among the key drivers of this shift. 
On the side of euro area 
banks, lending has languished as they 
have 
dealt with the fallout from the global 
financial
 crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. This
 reduced 
supply of 
finance from banks is one cause of the rise of intermediation by non
-MFIs. At the 
same time, the rise of non
-MFIs has been supported by the low level of interest rates 
                                                                    30  
Euro area MFIs include credit institutions, money market funds and the Eurosystem.
 31  
The reported shares are based on the outstanding amounts of total financial assets held by the 
financial sector as a whole and its sub
-sectors, thus reflecting not
 only genuine growth but also 
revaluation effects and statistical reclassifications between the two comparison points. Assets held by 

the Eurosystem are excluded from the figures.

 50 in the wake of the financial crisis, as well as longer
-term structural factors, including 
demographic trends and population ageing. These have
 led to a
n 
increase
 in 
purchases of products
 offered by insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs) 
and to higher investment flows into non
-money market fund investment funds 
(non
-MMF
 IFs
), as returns on existing pension schemes have lagged behind objectives. In 
addition, regulatory arbitrage may have transferred some intermediation activities 
from banks to non
-MFI sectors. 
 Str
uctural change in euro area financial intermediation, such as the shift from 
MFIs to non
-MFIs, has implications for monetary policy transmission. 
Most of 
the transmission channels of monetary policy work by influencing
 the 
way in which 
financial intermedia
ries 
provide funding
 to the economy.
 In this setting, banks retain 
a major role in the euro area. However, the growing importance of 
non-MFIs
 makes 
them increasingly relevant for the propagation of monetary impulses. In this role, 

non-MFIs may react differently from banks to changes in the monetary policy stance, 
thereby altering the way monetary policy is transmitted through financial markets and 

intermediaries' balance sheets to the real economy.
 In particular, some non
-MFIs 
may accelerate the transmissio
n of monetary 
policy. 
Specifically entities in the other financial institution (OFI) sector may react 
faster than banks to monetary policy impulses and changes in the economic and 
financial outlook. This means that they also retrench more rapidly in times 
of crisis. 
Part of this is associated with the less stringent regulation and supervision some 
non-MFIs are subject to. By contrast, banks
 as deposit
-taking institutions hold 
reserves with central banks and act as their direct counterparties in monetary policy 

operations. For this reason they also generally enjoy a public sector backstop 
associated with extensive regulation and supervision
. 
Consequently, understanding trends and developments in the euro area non
-MFI sectors is crucial for monetary policy.
 Against this background, Section 2 of 
this article provides a brief overview of academic findings on the role of the non
-MFI 
sectors in monetary policy transmission. S
ection
 3 describes and analyses the role 
of non
-MFIs within the financial system of the euro area, while Section 4 focuses on 
the trends observed for the individual constituents 
of 
the euro area non
-MFI
s. 
Sections 3 and 4 both provide examples of developments that have implications for 
monetary policy transmission stemming from the findings presented in Section 2
. 
Section 5 concludes. 
 2 The role of non
-MFIs in monetary policy transmission 
Œ a 
review of the literature
 Monetary policy affects the economy through several sectors and channels of 
transmission.
 Most of these channels work by influencing the decisions of financial 
intermediaries, which provide funding and investment opportunities to financial and 

non-financial sectors of the economy. In the euro area, MFIs, which comprise banks 
and money market funds (MMFs), are the main providers of financial services in the 
economy and therefore play a major role in the transmission of monetary policy. 
ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 51 However, owing to their increasing relevance in the financial sector, non
-MFIs have 
now also become more important for the transmission of monetary policy impulses. 
Non
-MFIs 
include non
-MMF IFs
, other financial intermediaries
 except 
ICPFs
 (including 
financial vehicle corporations
, FVCs)
, financial auxiliaries, captive financial 
institutions and money lenders, 
and ICPFs 
(see Box 1 for a detailed description of 
non-MFIs according to the European System of Accounts 2010).
 Owing to differences in business models and associated legal and regulator
y requirements, non
-MFIs respond differently from banks to monetary policy 
impulses.
 Banks, as deposit taking institutions, are typically highly regulated 
financial intermediaries subject to capital and liquidity requirements. Together with 
money market funds (seen as providing close substitutes for deposits) and central 

banks they comprise the MFI sector, as the creator of inside and outside money 
respectively. The MFI sector has thus traditionally been seen as the natural starting 
point for analysing monetary transmission in bank
-based financial systems. At the 
same time, banks, as depository institutions subject to minimum reserve 
requirements have, in times of stress, access to emergency liquidity assistance from 
central banks and, if they become insolvent, they are subject to an orderly resolution 

process that can involve public backstops. Non
-MFIs are financial intermediaries that 
can also be involved in maturity and liquidity transformation and credit risk transfer, 
but they generally do not have access to public backstops or central bank liquidity. 
 The mechanisms through which monetary policy is transmitted have been the 
focus of extensive analysis and empirical investigation over the last few 
decades.
 The main focus of this effort, especially in the early years, has been on the 
role of the assets and liabilities of banks, which provided the primary source of debt 
financing for the non
-financial corporate (NFC) sector and for households in the euro 
area. However, some of the mechanisms featured in this
 research can also provide 
insight into the processes involving non
-MFI sectors to different degrees. 
 Broadly speaking, the channels of monetary transmission comprise an interest 

rate (or cost
-of-capital)
 channel, a broad credit channel and a risk
-taking 
channel.
33 While these three channels can potentially work for MFIs and non
-MFIs 
alike, there may be differences in terms of speed and amplitude in the transmission 

of monetary policy impulses. This is due, for example, to the possible interactions 
with the
 different regulatory and supervisory frameworks in which financial 
intermediaries operate. In particular, the presence of less regulated 
Œ 
and therefore 
more flexible 
Œ 
non-bank intermediaries can make monetary transmission faster.
34                                                                     33  
For a detailed characterisation of these channels, see the article entitled "Monetary policy and loan 
supply in the euro area", 
Monthly Bulletin
, ECB, October 2009.
 34  
ICPFs and investment funds are subject to regulatory requirements to protect policy hold
ers. The main 
difference between them and the banking sector remains access to central bank liquidity and the 

government guarantee for bank depositors.
 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 52 This is because they can adapt their risk exposure to changes in financing conditions
 more quickly
.35  In particular, some non
-MFIs seem to respond faster to changes in the 
business and financial cycles than banks.
 Indeed, some studies have shown that 
the leverage of security brokers and dealers is pro
-cyclical and linked to monetary 
policy changes. Tighter monetary policy tends to lower the risk
-taking of broker
-dealers, leading to an increase in the pricing of risk.
36 Concerning other 
intermediaries, some studies have shown that
 ICPFs, as long
-term investors, are in 
principle better placed to look through short
-term market volatility and play a counter
-cyclical role.
37 At the same time, such institutional investors strongly depend on 
stable returns from fixed income and have been shown to react relatively strongly to 
interest rate changes. For example, insurance corporations, which are large holders 
of securities, tend to engage in a search for yield, as they systematically choose 
riskier investments from among the assets fulfilling their regulatory requirements.
38 This seems to be intensified when interest rates are low. In parallel, however, their 
long investment horizons increase their resilience to sudden changes in monetary 
policy rates. When looking at investment
 funds, the available evidence generally 
supports the notion that lower
 real interest rates shift portfolio investment 
towards 
riskier assets 
Œ 
out of the money market and into the riskier equity market 
Œ 
causing 
significant 
increases in stock prices 
in countries where 
investment home bias is 
strong.
39  Overall, existing research suggests that the increasing role of non
-MFIs in the 
financial sector may imply a somewhat faster transmission of monetary 

shocks, notably through the risk
-taking channel.
 At the same time, recen
t 
historical analysis has shown that the relationship between credit and broad money 
began to decouple after the early 1970s, when financial intermediaries other than 
banks started to become important contributors to credit intermediation in a number 

of countries, but to a lesser extent in the euro area.
40 In line with this, it is found that 
                                                                    35

Financial institutions 
according to the European 
System of 
Accounts
 2010
 The financial accounts are the framework for the analysis of the financial sector
 as they 
provide a comprehensive presentation of the financial positions, financial transactions and other 
flows in
 the economy. In the European Union, the financial accounts are compiled according to the 
conc
epts and definitions laid down 
in 
the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010)
 and the 
ECB Guideline on quarterly financial accounts, which ensure consistent recording for the euro area 
and comparability across countries.
42  The ESA 2010 defines the financial sector 
broadly
 as all institutional units whose principal 
activity is the production of financial services.
43 In addition to financial intermediaries
, this 
definition includes financial auxiliaries
, captive financial institutions and money lenders. Financial 
auxiliaries facilitate financial transactions, e.g. as brokers or consultants, between third parties 

without becoming the legal counterpart
y. 
Thus they do not put themselves at risk and their fin
ancial 
positions tend to be small. Captive financial institutions and money lenders are defined as 
institutional units most of whose
 assets or liabilities are not transacted on open markets. 
One 
example of such a 
unit 
is a 
special purpose entit
y 
(SPE) that

 Financial intermediaries are divided into sub

financing.
 Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise the ECB and national central bank
s, 
which issue currency and deposits, deposit
-taking institutions and money market funds (MMF
s). MMFs belong to the MFI sector, as they issue fund shares or units which are considered close 
substitutes for bank deposits.
 Non
-monetary financial institutions (non
-MFIs) cannot issue deposits or money market fund 
shares or units.
 As they
 do not offer deposits or close substitutes to deposits to the public, non
-MFIs
 are not subject to the same regulatory framework as
 MFIs. Three

 Exceptions from this simple financing

financial derivatives.
 Insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs) collect funds by offering insurance and 
pension schemes.
 Insurance corporations may offer insurance products to the public, as well as 
pension schemes to groups of employees. Pension funds are restricted by law to offer
ing
 pension 
schemes to specified groups of employees and self
-employed
 persons
. The liabilities of 
ICPFs 
consist mainly of insurance technical reserves
, which are recognised in
 the financial accounts as 
life insurance and annuity entitlements and pension entitlements. Mandatory social (health or 
pension) security funds managed by general government are not included in this definition. 
 A fourth group of financial intermediaries is determined residually as 
ﬁother financial 
intermediaries
ﬂ, which together with financial auxiliaries and captives are referred to as 
ﬁother financial institutions excluding non

ﬂ. 
This sub

includes,
 for example
, FVCs
 engaged in securitisation transactions, security and derivative
s 
dealers, financial corporations engaged in lending (mainly financial leasing or factoring companies) 

and other specialised financial corporations. These institutions are less regulated and their 
ECB Economic Bulletin,

 55 economic and financial importance 
varies 
widely between countries. Euro area statistics for these 
institutions are typically based on indirect information
, e.g. from
 securit
ies
 markets or counterpart
y 
sector information (e.g. MFI loans to other financial institutions). 
Euro area
-wide data collection 
exists
 only for FVCs and is based on an ECB regulation
. 
FVCs are created to purchase assets, 
such as portfolios of loans
 originated by an MFI or other lender. FVCs finance the purchase of such 
assets from the original holder by 
issuing
 asset
-backed
 securities 
(ABSs).
44 FVCs thus increase the 
liquidity of the original holder and allow the purchasers of the ABSs to invest in 
a 
specified pool of 
assets.
 Owing 
to the lack of harmonised data sources that would allow 
the 
separate identification of 
these sub
-sectors, other financial intermediaries are
, for the purpose of the euro area financial 
accounts,
 grouped together with financial auxiliaries and captives
. 
 3 The role of non
-MFIs within the euro area financial 
system
 In the years preceding the crisis, both bank and 
non-bank financial intermediaries boosted risk 
taking and credit growth and facilitated a rapid 
expansion of the financial sector
 (see Chart 1). 
Financial intermediaries exploited securitisation as a 
means of managing their balance 
sheets 
more flexibly 
and thereby increased overall credit supply. At the 

same time, (risky) illiquid loans were transformed into 

short
-term
, money
-like 
marketable instruments
, which 
were perceived to be almost risk
-free and were held by 
banks or sold on to
 households, firms and institutional 

investors.
 The outbreak of the sub
-prime crisis in the 
United States in 2007 revealed that these 
developments were unsustainable. In the years that 

followed, the collapse of securitisation via non
-MFI 
conduits, often sponsored by banks, contributed, 

among other factors, to the sharp contraction in the flow 

of bank credit. Banks were no longer able to transfer 
risk off their balance sheets, a process that had 
facilitated further loan origination, or even had to bring 

risk
s that had been moved off their books back onto 
their balance sheets. This experience illustrates the 
capacity of accounting and regulatory changes to blur 
                                                                    44

 56 the line between bank and non
-bank lending, boosting the risk
-taking channel and 
altering the transmission of monetary policy.
45  The size of the euro area financial sector has continued to increase since the 
global financial crisis, but at a slower pace and with diverging developments 
across MFIs and non
-MFIs
. Between the end of 2008 and the end of 2015,
 financial assets held by euro area financial corporations increased from •51 trillion 
(528% of GDP) to •64 trillion (613% of GDP). The share of these assets held by 
MFIs fell from 58% to 43% over this period. By contrast, the share held by non
-MFIs 
rose from 42% to 57%. Of this, non
-MFIs other than ICPFs accounted for a 42% 
share (up 11.8 percentage points when compared with the end of 2008), with ICPFs 
accounting for 15% (up 2.7 percentage points).
 Banks have experienced a
 slowdown in balance 
sheet growth or 
a shedding of assets as a result of 
the global financial crisis and the euro area 
sovereign debt crisis and associated regulatory 

changes.
 In particular, on the credit supply side, the 
fragile economic environment triggered a surge in non
-
performing loans and a marked deterioration in the 

balance sheets of banks. At the same time, stricter 
regulation and supervision, coupled with feeble growth 
and low interest rates, have challenged the existing 

business models of banks, forcing them to adapt. 
However, the ECB's non
-standard measures have 
provided liquidity and supported credit, mitigating the 

risks of disorderly deleveraging in the banking sector as 
a whole. On the credit demand side, economic 
weakness and depressed asset prices lowered the 

collateral value underpinning loans to the non
-financial 
private sector. Together, this resulted in a net tightening 

of credit standards and a restriction of bank credit 
to 
NFCs and households in 2008 and 2009, and again in 

2011 and 2012.
 While the net flow of finance from MFIs to NFCs 
contracted in 2009 and 2010
, and again between 
2012 and 2014, the flow of finance from non
-MFIs remained positive
 (see
 Chart 
2). Over this period, the primary form of financing offered by non
-MFIs took the form 
of 
market and non
-market
-based equity financing, the issuance of debt securities 
and the provision of loans. The sustained provision of funding from non
-MFIs after

 57 the crisis hit was supported by a range of factors and has had a stabilising impact on 
the euro area economy.
46   First, very low interest rates and the associated search for yield by 
investors have supported financial intermediation by non
-MFIs
. Specifically, the activities of non
-MFIs were helped by factors impacting the 
portfolio choices on the asset side of the non
-financial sectors, such as lower 
returns on bank deposits, falling risk premia and a recovery in a range of asset 

markets. On the liability side, progress on repairing balance sheets allowed 

firms in the euro area to tap financing sources other than bank credit, such as 
equity and corporate debt issuance. Insofar as these developments were 
related to the low interest rates resulting from the ECB's monetary policy, they 

provide another illustration of the mechanics of the risk
-taking channel for 
monetary policy transmission.
  Second, structural factors, such as demographic trends, have also 

benefited financial intermediation by non
-MFIs.
 Population ageing has led to 
a rise in purchases of life insurance and pension investment products, 
partly 
reflecting households' increased concerns about the sustainability of 
both public 
and private pension schemes in view of lower potential growth
, high sovereign
 debt levels
 and low returns on existing pension schemes.
  Third, some non
-MFIs have been less exposed to regulatory tightening 
than banks, opening opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.
 However, large 
parts of the non
-MFI sector
 in the euro are
a, such as 
ICPFs
, are in fact subject 
to extensive regulation and supervision. As a result, regulatory arbitrage 
is likely 
to have played at best a secondary role in
 the observed shift of financial asset 

holdings from 
banks
 to non
-MFIs
 in these cases
. 
 Fourth, the rising share of non
-MFIs in the euro area financial sector also 
reflects methodological changes. 
The transition to the ESA 2010 implied the 
assimilation of a large set of entities, such as financing SPEs, into the group of 
non-MFIs
, having previously been classified in the NFC sector alongside the 
firms they are typically serving. In fact, the rapid expansion of financing SPEs 
explains some 15% of the overall increase in the size of the financial sector 
between the end of 2008 and the end of 2015.
 Data improvements over time will make it possible to isolate and analyse in 
greater detail financial flows across sectors. 
In future, a more conclusive 
assessment might be feasible once longer time series of new data providing a "who
-
to
-whom" breakdown of marketable instruments become available. The ECB began 
publishing such data in April 2016 (see Box 2). These statistics may be used, for 
instance, to conduct detailed analyses of the role of various institutional sectors in 
providing direct and indirect financing to the different parts of the economy. Together 

with macroeconomic, financial market and confidence indicators, these data can also 
                                                                    46 See also

 Box 2
 Extension of the euro area accounts (EAA) with new data on a 
ﬁwho
-to-whom
ﬂ 
basis for 
marketable securities 
 In April 2016, the ECB began publishing quarterly data on securities on a 
ﬁwho
-to-whom
ﬂ 
basis as part of the financial accounts within the euro area accounts (EAA)
 framework.
47 Data on a 
ﬁwho
-to
-whom
ﬂ 
basis refer to financial transactions and positions for which both the 
creditor sector (asset holder) and debtor sector (issuer of the corresponding liability) are 
simultaneously identified. They represent an important extension of the traditional presentation of 

the financial accounts. In the traditional presentation, the financial portfolio of a sector is presented
, distinguishing instrument type and maturity where applicable, but without detail regarding the 
counterparty issuing sectors (i.e. the sectors for which the financial claims in the portfolio are 

liabilities). Similarly, the liabilities of each sector are broken down by instrument and maturity where 
applicable, but no detail is offered as to which counterparty sectors are the creditors of those 
liabilities. The 
ﬁwho
-to
-whom
ﬂ 
presentation, therefore, enhances the information provided 
in the 
financial accounts by revealing the full web of linkages between holders and issuers at the 

institutional sector level. 
 The data are available as quarterly time series for the euro area
, starting in the fourth quarter 

of 2013, and comprise outstanding amounts, financial transactions and revaluations.
 Three 
instrument types are distinguished, namely debt securities (differentiating short
-term from long
-term, based on their maturity at issuance), listed shares and investment fund shares/units (which 

combine shares/units issued by MMFs and those issued by non
-MMF 
IFs
). Euro area residents are 
categorised into eight institutional sectors (
households, 
NFCs
, MFIs, 
non-MMF 
IFs
, 
other financial 
intermediaries, 
insurance 
corporations, 
pension 
funds and 
general 
government), both as holders 
and as issuers of securities. Non
-euro area residents are then added as holders of securities issued 
by the 
various 
resident sectors. N
on-residents are also considered with regard 
to
 securities they 
have issued if the securities are held by any of the resident sectors. 
                                                                     47  
The data will be published every quarter as part of the second and complete press release on e
uro 
area economic and financial developments by institutional secto
r.

 59 Data on a 
ﬁwho

compiled in an analogous way to other 
financial accounts data. 
This means that 
different source statistics are prioritised and 
combined, filling any coverage gaps in the
m 
and ensuring that the classification and valuation of 
all transactions and positions is consistent with 

the ESA 2010. Data on a 
ﬁwho

ﬂ 
basis 
for loan
s 
and deposits have been available 

within the EAA since 2010. For marketable 

securities, various ECB source statistics have 
for some time already contained sufficient detail 
on counterparties to also allow a derivation of 

ﬁwho

ﬂ 
data for several combinations of 
holder and issuing sectors.

 existed

 Notwithstanding the central role of the MFI 

sector in the financing of all sectors in the 

euro area economy, non
-MFI financial 
institutions are also an important source of 

direct funding, especially for the government 

and NFC sectors.
 This is evide

The 
significant funding of MFIs by non
-MFIs 
also hints at an indirect role for non
-MFIs 
in the provision of 
credit to other sectors. Finally, 
non-MFIs 
are pivotal in the channelling of credit between the euro 
area and the rest of the world.

 Note: The latest observations
 are for the
 fourth quarter of 
2015.  Possible reasons for the increased role of the non
-MMF IF 
sector since the 
global financial crisis include the low interest rate environment and 
demographic dynamics.
 In particular, low deposit rates have enhanced the 
attractiveness of investing in securities, thereby benefiting the business of 
non-MMF 
IFs. Simil
arly, monetary policy measures have facilitated a reduction in risk premia, a 

rise in investor confidence and a decrease in investor risk aversion, all of which 
support stronger inflows into 
non-MMF 
IFs. This would seem to be in line with the 
mechanics of the risk
-taking channel of monetary policy transmission that was 
discussed in Section 2. Finally, 
non-MMF 
IFs have profited from concerns among 
euro area households about their future pension benefits. Such concerns have led to 

higher savings which, in the
 face of low interest rates, have been channelled towards 
riskier assets to achieve the level of return that enables households to accomplish 
the desired degree of lifetime consumption smoothing.

Since the peak of the global financial crisis at the 
end of 2008, non
-MMF IFs' holdings of equity 
securities have risen more than the
ir holdings of 

debt securities 
(see Chart 5).
 Valuation effects, 
specifically the sharp recovery in stock prices since the 
lows seen after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, are 
the main explanation for the strong increase in equity 

holdings. In fact, net purchases of debt securities by 
non-MMF 
IFs have been considerably larger than net 
purchases of equities (see Chart 7).
 Moreover, non
-MMF IFs have tended to favour 
foreign investments 
(see
 Chart
 7), possibly in relation 
to some waning of euro area investors' home bias 
during the peak of the sovereign debt crisis. They have 

also modestly scaled back their exposure towards the 
euro area banking sector. To some extent, this can be 
explained by the declining financing needs of euro area 

banks owing to their deleveraging efforts and their 
ability to obtain funding through customer deposits and 
central bank facilities. 
 4.2
 Financial vehicle corporations (FVCs) 
 The financial asset holdings of FVCs have fallen
 steadily since the global 
financial crisis, reflecting the decline in securitisation transactions that 

previously allowed banks to shift risk 
off
 their balance sheets 
(see
 Chart
 8).
51 Primarily involved in the securitisation of loans to households, FVCs hold 12% of the 

total loan claims on euro area households. For loan claims on euro area NFCs, the 
share of FVCs is smaller at 3%.
52                                                                      51

 63 Possible drivers of the decline of FVCs include 
deleveraging pressures and the stigma attached to 
these instruments in the wake of the global 
financial crisis.
 As banks and the non
-financ
ial private 
sector consolidated their balance sheets, the credit 
growth necessary to sustain the continued 
securitisation of loans evaporated. At the same time, 

the prominent role of FVCs in the financial market 
turmoil of 2008 and 2009, regulatory developments and 
other structural factors triggered a decline in securitised 

products, irrespective of the potential of simpler, more 
transparent and more robust 
securitisation 
to enhance 
financial intermediation.
53   
 
 
 4.3
 Other OFIs
 Among non
-MFIs in the euro area,
 financial assets of other OFIs have grown 
significantly in recent years, accounting for 41% of the total, with about a 
quarter of this share attributable to financing SPEs.
54 In order to benefit from a 
favourable tax regime and financial technology, financ
ing SPEs
 Œ 
which are 
subsidiaries
 of another company
 Œ 
are
 typically 
located in a country, within or outside 
the euro area, which is different from the domicile of their parent.
55 Bond market 
financing obtained by financing SPEs and returned to their parent
 in the form of 
loans account for close to one
-third of the increase in total financial assets held by 
other OFIs since the global financial crisis.
 Other OFIs mainly hold equity and loan claims on their asset side
 (see Chart 9). 
This is due to the fact that the other OFI sector is generally dominated by highly 

specialised business models. Venture capital corporations, development capital 

companies and holding companies provide risk capital to firms, whereas f
inancial 
leasing companies
 and financing SPEs provide loans. 
                                                                     53

 64 As more granular data on other OFIs are scarce and 
the category encompasses a very heterogeneous 
set of entities, comprehensive analysis is 
challe
nging.
 However, it is likely that reductions in risk 
aversion and improvements in investor confidence 
since the global financial crisis have bolstered the 
business of at least some other OFIs, such as venture 

capital corporations, as was highlighted in Sec
tion 2. In 
addition, in the same way that tax arbitrage is one of 

the motives for the establishment of financing SPEs, 

regulatory arbitrage might be one of the factors shaping 
trends in the other OFI sector, although firm evidence of 
this is not easily ava
ilable. 
   
 
 
 4.4
 Insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)
 The financial assets of ICPFs account for 25% of total assets held by euro area 
non-MFIs. 
The portfolios of ICPFs are primarily invested in debt securities, 
particularly of governments, and equities (see Charts 10 and 11). 
This 
reflects their 
attempts to match 
their 
assets with their liabilities
, which mostly consist of life 
insurance and pension claims with a long residual maturity
. The preference of ICPFs 
for government bonds is largely due to
 their institutional asset allocation policies and 

the relatively small size of the euro area corporate bond market.
 ICPFs are also an important source of funding for the private sector.
 They hold 
19% and 15% of the debt securities issued by euro area NFCs
 and banks, 
respectively, in addition to around 3% of the quoted shares issued by these sectors. 
At the same time, ICPFs hold 20% of the debt securities issued by euro area 
sovereigns. By contrast, loans by ICPFs to households and NFCs in the euro area 

are
 relatively marginal, accounting for a mere 3% and 1%, respectively, of the total 
loan claims against these borrowers.
56 However, in some euro area countries 
insurance corporations have started to compete with banks in the household 

mortgage market, as new legislation and technological innovation have enabled the 

provision of loans via specialised internet platforms.
                                                                     56

.  Note: The latest observations
 are for the
 fourth
 quarter of 
2015.  After declining modestly in the immediate aftermath 
of the global financial crisis, the financial assets of 
ICPFs have significantly expanded in recent years.
 The drivers of this development are likely to be similar 
to those mentioned in the case of 
non-MMF 
IFs and 
include factors related to population ageing and the 

positive effects of an accommodative monetary policy 

on confidence, risk taking and the prices of securities. 
In this environment, ICPFs have increased their risk 
exposure 
Œ 
within the limits posed by statutory 

requirements 
Œ 
by investing in equities and the 
shares/units of
 non-MMF 
IFs rather than in debt 
securities (see Chart 12). In fact, annual flows from 
ICPFs into these instruments in 2014 and 2015 reached 
levels similar to those observed in 1999 and 2000. 
Again, this exemplifies the functioning of the monetary 
policy t
ransmission channels described in Section 2. 
 A look at the period before the global financial 
crisis provides further evidence that the portfolio 
choices of ICPFs respond to financial cycles.
57 In 
particular, between 2003 and 2008, ICPFs increased 
                                                                    57  T

 66 their 
debt securities holdings significantly more than their exposure to equities, in 
spite of favourable stock markets and a flattening of the yield curve (see Chart 12). 
This behaviour reflected a change in risk appetite among ICPFs after the losses 
incurred in the wake of the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 forced them to 

repair their balance sheets. In addition, the response of ICPFs to a variety of 

regulatory, valuation and accounting changes also played a role.
58 5 Concluding remarks
 With euro area banks cutting back the supply of credit in the wake of the 

global financial and the euro area sovereign debt 
cris
es, the role played by the 
non-MFI sectors in financial intermediation has increased and has helped to 
mitigate the effects 
of t
he crises 
on the euro area economy.
 This trend was 
facilitated by very low interest rates leading to a search for yield by investors, 

structural factors, such as an ageing population in the euro area, and some scope for 
regulatory arbitrage. In this enviro
nment, non
-MMF 
IFs 
and ICPFs have been 
particularly prominent in increasing their role in euro area financial intermediation in 
recent
 years. As large holders of debt securities and equity
, these entities have 
provided a significant amount of financing 
to 
the real economy, although not 
exclusively to the benefit of the euro area
, as they are generally holders of globally 

diversified portfolios. Among other OFIs, venture capital corporations are likely to 
have profited from a search for yield, while the activities of financing SPEs are often 
related to tax arbitrage by sponsoring corporations. 
 These developments have implications for monetary policy transmission. 
As 
Section 2 has shown, the channels of monetary policy transmission to the real 
economy apply 
Œ 
in different forms 
Œ 
to MFIs and non
-MFIs alike. However, 
differences in the business models between these two groups of euro area financial 
intermediaries, also reflected in terms of regulation and supervision, imply that 
the 
generally larger role for no
n-
MFIs may speed up the 
Œ 
indirect 
Œ 
transmission of 
monetary policy
. The increased role of non
-MFI
s 
calls for a more integrated analysis of the 
interplay between different financial intermediaries and transmission channels
 that
 complement or substitut
e 
the traditional bank lending and interest rate 
channels. 
As regards individual sectors among non
-MFIs, non
-MMF IFs and ICPFs 
may have less significant implications for monetary policy transmission. Like MFIs, 

they are subject to regulation and supervision, implying that impulses from monetary 
policy are likely to find their way to the real economy in a manner similar to MFIs, 

albeit via different channels. By contrast, the same is not necessarily true for the 
other OFI sector. As some other OFIs are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as 
banks, they warrant special monitoring, because the financing they provide has the 
                                                                    58

 68 The euro area fiscal s
tance
 This
 article discusses the concept of an appropriate
 euro area 
aggregate 
fiscal 
stance in the context of the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary 
Union (EMU). To this end, it assesses recent initiatives towards a better coordination 

of national fiscal policies with a view to ensuring an appropriate euro area
-wide 
fiscal 
stance which balances
 the objectives of 
sustainab
le public finances 
and macroeconomic stabilisation
.  
There is widespread agreement that national fiscal policies need to ensure that 
public debt is sustainable, while automatic stabilisers can operate freely to cushion 
country
-specific shocks. At the same time, in the event of a very severe crisis, such 
as the deep recession in 2008
-09, automatic fiscal stabilisers alone may not be 
sufficient to absorb the shock, and additional discretionary action may be required, 

provided this does not endanger medium
-term fiscal sustainability. These elements 
are all embedded in the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). However, there 
are no rules in the SGP for countries that have over
-achieved their targets. 
 There may be circumstances in which the independent conduct of national fiscal 
policies does not result in
 an appropriate aggregate euro area fiscal stance. This 
article reviews the proposals of the Five Presidents™ Report
59 in this respect, 
including
 the setting
-up of a European Fiscal Board 
Œ 
which is expected to become 
operational by September 2016 
Œ 
to advise the European Commission on
 an 
appropriate fiscal stance both at national and European level within the rules of the 

SGP
. In the longer run, the report envisages the creation of a euro area treasury to 
improve joint decision
-making regarding economic and
 fiscal policies and the setting
-up of a euro area macroeconomic stabilisation function
. 
1 Introduction
 In Economic and 
Monetary Union
, 
fiscal policies are a national responsibility. 
In this respect, they need to 
ensure 
the sustainability of 
government debt 
and 
cushion country
-specific shocks
. Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite 
for ensuring price stability within the euro area. At the same time, in a monetary 

union, fiscal policy remains a major tool available to national governments to deal 
with country
-specific circumstances. In the absence of a fiscal authority at the centre, 
national fiscal policies are governed by the EU™s common fiscal framework, the 
Stability and Growth Pact, which was agreed in 1997 to operationalise the Maastricht 
Treaty™s
 budgetary rules.
60 Within the SGP, national fiscal policies are considered a 
                                                                    59

 69 matter of common concern 
Œ 
they should be coordinated and should not be allowed 
to impose disproportionate costs on other EMU participants.
61  The SGP framework guides Member States towards achieving sound fiscal 
positions and provides room to cushion normal cyclical fluctuations via 
automatic stabilisers. 
Member States set 
medium
-term budgetary objectives 
(MTOs) 
which 
are intended to anchor
 progress towards sustainab
le public finan
ces, 
while allowing 
budgetary 
room for manoeuvre.
 Adjustments required to meet the 
MTO are defined in structural terms (i.e. net of the impact of the cycle and one
-off 
measures) and therefore generally allow the full operation of automatic stabilisers. 

The
se should be sufficient to deal with normal cyclical developments at national 
level. Under such circumstances, discretionary fine
-tuning of the cycle via active 
fiscal policy measures is typically regarded as not very effective.
62 At the same time, 
the SGP does not contain any rules on the conduct of fiscal policy for countries that 
have over
-achieved their minimum requirements. In this regard, it is asymmetric.
 The EU™s current fiscal governance framework contains no rules or 
instruments to directly manage 
the aggregate euro area fiscal stance, which is 
a key difference when compared to fiscal federations such as the United 

States. 
In fact, in the absence of fiscal policy instruments at the central level, the 
euro area
-wide fiscal stance is merely the sum of
 individual euro area countries™ 
fiscal stances. However, in some situations, a more active management of the euro 
area
-wide fiscal policy stance may appear warranted from an aggregate perspective. 
The SGP does contain provisions permitting countries to pr
ovide fiscal stimulus in 
exceptional circumstances, provided that this does not endanger medium
-term fiscal 
sustainability. At the same time, the SGP does not oblige those countries with fiscal 
room for manoeuvre to make use of it. There is therefore no guarantee that the 
coordination of national fiscal policies through the SGP results in an appropriate 
aggregate euro area fiscal stance. In the light of this, the Five Presidents™ Report, 

ﬁCompleting Europe™s Economic and Monetary Unionﬂ, released in mid
-2015, 
highlights the need to reflect on ways to ensure that ﬁthe sum of national budget 

balances leads to an appropriate fiscal stance at the level of the euro area as a 
whole
ﬂ.
63  The Five Presidents
™ Report contemplates
, as steps within a comprehensive 
overhaul of the 
institutional architecture of EMU, a more active steering of the 
euro area
-wide fiscal stance
. In this context, it envisages the setting
-up of a euro 
area treasury to achieve more collective decision
-making 
on fiscal policy. The report 
also proposes the creation of a central macroeconomic stabilisation function to 
                                                                    61  
See Article 121 of the Treaty
 on the Functioning of the European Union, which states that ﬁMember

states 
that ﬁMember States shall avoid exce

Article 126 goes on to say

and the euro area level, 
the European Commission

According to the Five Presidents™ Report, the European Fiscal
 Board

64  Against this background, t
his article discusses the concept of
 an appropriate

™s institutional 
framework

the 
recent initiatives towards better coordination 
of national fiscal policies with a view to ensuring an appropriate euro area

stance which balances
 the objectives of 
sustainab

 The 
article is structured as follows
. Section 2 briefly reviews developments in the 
euro area fiscal stance over the last decade. Section 3 then
 discusses the concept of 

an appropriate euro area aggregate fiscal stance. Section 4 reflects on the limits on 
coordinating the euro area fiscal stance within the current EU fiscal framework. F
rom 
this analysis
, Section 5 derives institutional considerations relating to the work of the

Two 
principal ways
 of measuring 
the fiscal stance are used in practice
 (see Box 1).

  As Chart 1 shows, f
ollowing several 
years of tightening, the euro area 
aggregate fiscal stance appears
 now 
to have turned mildly expansionary.
 The 
chart depicts
 the fiscal stance for the period 2007
-16 as measured by the
 change in 
the cyclically adjusted primary budget balance. It shows that the fiscal stance was 
loosening in 2008

 of several stimulus measures, including 
the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), which the Commission launched in 
November 2008 and which amounted to about 1.5% of GDP for the euro area. This 
was followed by a tightening euro area aggregate fiscal stance over the period 
2011-13, reflecting comprehensive consolidation packages in euro area 
countries to 
restore debt sustainability and correct the excessive deficits that had emerged during 
the sovereign debt crisis. 
In 
2014 the fiscal stance was broadly neutral in the 
                                                                    64

 Box 1
 Measuring the fiscal stance 
 The initial 
impulse
 that 
fiscal policies 
provide to the economy is transmitted through 
several 
channels, 
which differ according to the government
™s ability to influence budgetary 
outcomes in the short term
. A major channel operates via ﬁautomatic fiscal stabilisersﬂ, which 
provide an automatic buffer to private demand through built
-in features of government budgets. 
Notably, 
during a downturn, without the government taking any action, unemployment and social 
security benefits increase, while tax revenues tend to fall, thereby contributing to a smoothing of the 
business cycle. The magnitude of these automatic stabilisers is closely related to the size of the 

welfare system and the tax system.
65 Furthermore, fiscal policies can impact on economic activity 
through the implementation by governments of discretionary budgetary measures that affect public 
expenditure and revenues.
66 The 
concept of the 
fiscal stance 
aims
 to capture only that part of the initial fiscal impulse 
to 
economic activity 
that stems 
from 
the 
discretionary policy action
s of governments
. 
Two 
principal ways of measuring the fiscal stance are used in practice. First, the change in the cyclically 
adjusted primary balance,
67 which removes the cyclical component and interest payments from the 
                                                                    65  
Another impact relates to governments paying interest on public debt, which presents a financia
l flow 
between the government and the economy. However, in the short term, the ability of governments to 

influence the size of the interest payments is limited and works mainly via debt management strategies.

 72 headline balance. Second, bottom
-up estimates of discretionary policy measures, which sum up the 
outcomes of policy measures included in national budgets. 
 The 
fiscal stance as measured by the cyclically adjusted primary balance is
 difficult to 
gauge in real time.
 First, the separation of policy
-induced changes in the headline budget balance 
from the impact of the business cycle requires the size of the output gap to be captured, i.e. actual 
output relative to its potential. Real
-time estimates of the latter 
Œ 
an unobservable variable 
Œ 
are, 
however, subject to frequent ex post revisions. This distorts the proper measurement of the fiscal 

stance in real time, attributing too much or too little of the fiscal impulse to discretionary policy 

action.
68 Second, the fiscal stance may be distorted in real time through developments in 
government revenues which result from their response to economic growth that is not in line with 

standard elasticities. In an economic upswing, for example, the fiscal stance being measured may 

signal an increase in government revenues, which in real time is assessed to have resulted from 
discretionary policy action. Ex post, however, this may turn out to have been due to revenue 
windfalls related to transitory developments in tax bases connected with temporary fluctuations in, 
for e
xample, asset prices and oil prices.
 By contrast, bottom
-up estimates of discretionary policy measures aim to identify the impact 
of individual tax and spending measures
. On the revenue side, identifying a measure and 
gauging its impact against a no
-policy
 baseline is relatively straightforward. On the expenditure 
side, distinguishing a spending measure from the impact of other economic developments (e.g. 
unemployment, demographic developments) is less clear cut and requires expenditure 
developments to be measured against a benchmark, which should ideally be exogenous. For 

example, under the SGP™s preventive arm, the expenditure benchmark is based on a long
-term 
average of potential output growth, while the bottom
-up approach under the corrective arm is base
d on trend growth. These growth variables are also non
-observable.
69  Overall, policy recommendations regarding the fiscal stance need to acknowledge the 

caveats surrounding its measurement.
 Not only is the ﬁexactﬂ size of discretionary fiscal policy 
measur
es difficult to capture in real time, but so is the direction of the fiscal stance. In fact, whether 
the stance is tightening or loosening, and whether it is doing so in an economic environment that is 

improving or deteriorating, cannot be concluded with certainty given the difficulties surrounding the 

determination of a country™s position in the cycle.

 73 3 What is an appropriate euro area 
fiscal stance
? 
3.1
 The fiscal stance and the trade
-off between sustainability and 
stabilisation
 Discretionary fiscal policies
 are
 generally considered 
a weak 
macroeconomic 
stabilisation 
tool
 during normal economic cycles
. First, it takes time to adopt and 
implement a fiscal measure, especially major new programmes (ﬁimplementation 
lagﬂ). Second, fiscal measures in support of the economy tend to be difficult to 

reverse 
once implemented, facing resistance from benefiting groups. Third, it is 
difficult to get the size, timing and economic mechanism of a fiscal impulse
 measure 
exactly right.
 Consequently, there is, for example, a risk
 that the economic impact of 
a discretionary fiscal stimulus will start to be felt only once the economy is already 

picking up, rendering the instrument pro
-cyclical rather than counter
-cyclical.
70  There is 
therefore 
broad consensus that automatic fiscal s
tabilisers represent 
ﬁthe first line of defenceﬂ by being a predictable and systematic response to
 normal asymmetric shocks
.71 In particular, during a downturn, without the 
government taking any action, unemployment and social security benefits increase, 

while tax revenues tend to fall, thereby contributing to a smoothing of the business 
cycle. 
Within the euro area, the magnitude of such automatic fiscal stabilisers varies 
across countries, but is relatively large on average when compared to, for example,
 the United States, given the euro area countries™ more extensive welfare and tax 
systems.
72  Under exceptional circumstances, automatic stabilisers alone may be 
regarded 
as insufficient to cushion the very detrimental and prolonged impact 
of deep swings in
 the cycle
.73 At the same time, the effectiveness of a 
discretionary fiscal stimulus is generally larger in such circumstances. While there is 
considerable uncertainty surrounding the size of short
-term fiscal multipliers
, recent 
evidence indicates that mul
tipliers m
ay be larger in deep recessions
 or 
financial 
crises
 or when monetary policy is constrained. In times of severe and extended 
                                                                    70

, Taylor 
(op. cit.)
 points out that fiscal policy could play a role in situations where monetary policy is constrained at the 
zero lower bound. In this case, one would need to state explicitly how fiscal policy would be used, such 

rules being more diffic

 74 crisis, the risks of misidentifying the occurrence of a shock and its depth are more 
limited and the risk of a policy mistake is therefore lower. At the same time, fiscal 
multipliers may be small (or even negative) when government debt levels are high 
and concerns about debt sustainability are increasing.
74  The 
fiscal stance impact
s 
on both 
fiscal sustainability and stabilisa
tion
, implying a trade
-off
 for expansionary policies
. For example, while a fiscal 
stimulus would tend to raise output in the short run, it would at the same time add to 
debt and thereby increase sustainability risks. The size of these individual effects 

depends on the nature of the fiscal stimulus (e.g. whether it is permanent or 
temporary and the types of instrument applied), the starting fiscal position and the 
observed financial and macroeconomic conditions, etc.
75 A fiscal stance is usually assessed as appropriate if it provides a suitable 
balance between the sustainability and stabilisation objectives of fiscal policy. 

There is thus usually not just 
one ﬁappropriateﬂ fiscal stance, but rather a range 
thereof, all of which balance stabilisation and sustainability objectives, but with 

different weights on each objective. The theoretical and empirical literature does not 
provide clear guidance on where the optimal balance lies. It does, however, indicate 
that governments should respond more forcefully to sustainability constraints when 

their debt levels are high. Indeed, in such regimes, the impact of fiscal adjustment on 
output stabilisation is mitigated through confidence effects via the interest rate 
channel. Consequently, any recommendation regarding an ﬁappropriateﬂ fiscal 

stance requires an operationalisation of the sustainability and stabilisation objectives, 
which means taking into account the debt level of the country (see Box 3 for an 
evaluation of the European Commission™s metric to assess the appropriateness of 
the fiscal stance). 
 Gauging stabilisation needs 
is
 not straightforward
. Generally, a government™s 
decision to increase or reduce support to the economy depends on its assessment of 
the state of the economy as measured, for example, by the level of the output gap 

and on the speed at which the government wishes to close it. However
, 
as explained 
in Box 1, output gap
 estimates are 
subject to a high degree of uncertainty
 and may 
therefore give wrong signals in real time regarding stabilisation ne
eds.
76 For this 
reason, monetary policy has for a long time reduced the emphasis on unobserved 
indicators, such as the output gap, whose mismeasurement was one of the main 
driving factors behind the Great Inflation of the 1970s.
77 There is 
also 
no simple 
indicator
 for 
assessing
 whether a government
™s debt is 
sustainable.
 Sustainability of government debt means that the accumulated debt 
                                                                    74

 75 can

78 At the same time, any sovereign debt 
sustainability analysis 
(DSA) 
is sensitive 
to 
the assumptions applied
.79 A comprehensive DSA framework should generally consider both debt dynamics and 
the level at which debt stabilises, test the resilience of the debt path under various 

adverse scenarios and account for other relevant indicators (e.g. a government™s 
gross financing needs, the structure of government debt, the scope for contingent 
liabilities, the quality of institutions and political risks). In its sustainability 

assessments under the European governance framework, the European 
Commis
sion uses three indicators, aimed at summarising short, medium and long
-term risks, alongside a more comprehensive DSA framework. Against this 
background, Box 2 provides a literature overview of how past (estimated) fiscal 
reaction functions have dealt empirically with the response to the stabilisation and 
sustainability objectives.
 Box 
2 
Fiscal reaction functions
 The literature on fiscal reaction functions can shed some light on the past behaviour
 of 
fiscal policies
 across euro area countries
 with respect to both sustainability and 
stabilisation
. While not sufficient to guarantee appropriate policies in the future, p
ast fiscal 
behaviour can provide useful indications 
of 
the extent to which 
governments
 have
 given 
consideration to sustainability and/or stabilisation objectives. The fiscal reaction f
ramework 
is commonly used as a weak test for fiscal sustainability following Bohn
.80 Accordingly, governments 
are considered to abide by sustainability constraints
 if they react systematically to increases in the 
debt-to
-GDP
 ratio 
by r
aising the
ir primary surplus
 ratio.
81 The literature covers related research 
objectives, including the estimation of ﬁfiscal reactionsﬂ following the literature on monetary policy 
rules 
(Taylor)
82 or the work on active and passive fisca
l policy regimes 
(Leeper)
.83 Most empirical 
studies on 
fiscal reaction functions 
test the sustainability condition by estimating the response of 
fiscal policy (usually the primary balance, but also the cyclically adjusted primary balance) to the 

(lagged) debt ratio and controlling for cyclical conditions (current output gap), in addition to other 

factors.

a fiscal reaction function in terms of both debt and

As pointed out in several studies, this can be considered only a weak test of sustainability as, inter alia,
 there is 
likely to be 
an upper
 limit for 
primary surpluses as a share of GDP. At very high debt ratios, the 
probability of fiscal fatigue is higher. See

™ 
efforts (or the lack thereof) to stabilise 
both 
public debt and 
output
.84 While a monetary policy rule, such as the Taylor rule, has been considered closely in 
practice, with good performance over past periods
,85 the fiscal reaction function literature 
does not provide ﬁbenchmarkﬂ reac
tion coefficients to set a normative behaviour.
 Instead, a 
statistically significant, positive reaction coefficient for the lagged debt is taken as a sufficient, but 

not necessary, condition for sustainabi
lity
. 
The larger the coefficient, the stronger is the reaction to 
increases in debt. Particular caution is warranted when drawing inferences about debt sustainability 
solely from fiscal reaction function
 estimates based on past behaviour. As regards the fiscal 
reaction to the output gap
, a statistically si
gnificant, positive 
(negative) coefficient 
is generally 
interpreted as evidence of a 
counter
-cyclical 
(pro
-cyclical) 
fiscal policy. 
 For the euro area countries, the fiscal reaction function
 literature generally finds that 
governments have, on average, 
given 
(some) consideration to sustainability constraints.
 The 
responsiveness seems to have been much 
stronger during
 the recent
 euro area sovereign debt 
crisis with its onset in the economic and financial global crisis of 2008.
86 Overall, there is evidence 
of non
-linearities in the government response to debt, with greater attention paid to the 
sustainability objective when the debt level is high.
87 The evidence with respect to responsiveness 
during the 
post
-Maa
stricht and euro area period
s 
is more mixed
, but some recent studies point to 
stronger average responsiveness
 after the Maastricht Treaty, followed, however, by weaken
ing 
responsiveness 
during the 
pre
-crisis 
euro area 
period.
88  As regards the stabilisation role of fiscal policy, most evidence points to a significant 
counter
-cyclical role through automatic stabilisers and less through discretionary fiscal 
policy.
 For instance, some earlier studies conclude that there 
was
 no evidence that the Maastricht 
Treaty and the SGP prevented automatic stabili
sers from doing their job
 in euro area countries. On 
the contrary, these countries appear to have strengthened the counter
-cyclical nature of fiscal policy 
(up to 2002)
.89 These 
and other studies conclude that both the overall fiscal policy and the 
discretionary component have been responding in a counter
-cyclical manner 
since 
the adoption of 
the Maastricht Treaty. However, the evidence for the discretionary fiscal policy, as well as for the 
responsiveness during the euro area period,
 is weaker.

 77 Overall, there is evidence that, on average,
 governments in the euro area respond to both 
stabilisation and sustainability objectives.
 Several studies
 point to improvements in the conduct 
of fiscal policy from 
the perspective 
of both of these objectives after Maastricht and 
to 
a weakening 
of responsiveness during the early euro area period
. 
The crisis acted as a disciplining device for 
sustainability, with a stronger 
reaction 
than before to the increasing debt levels seen in many 
euro 
area countri
es 
during the crisis (at least until 2012
-13, which is as far as the studies go
).   3.2
 Specific elements of an appropriate fiscal stance at the euro area 
level
 As at the national level, an appropriate aggregate fiscal stance for the euro 
area would seek a balance between the sustainability and stabilisation 

objectives.
 Notably, macroeconomic stabilisation needs would be gauged with 

respect to the size of the output gap for the euro area as a whole, while an 

assessment of debt sustainability risks would start by capturing developments in 
aggregate public debt.
 However, the euro area aggregate fiscal stance is currently a purely 
mechanical concept, aggregating the fiscal stances at 
individual 
country level.
 In the absence of a centralised fiscal policy instrument, the euro area fiscal stance 
merely captures the sum of discretionary 
national 
policies. The direction of the euro 
area fiscal stance may therefore reflect very different developments at individual 

country level with, for example, fiscal tightening in some countries and fiscal 
loosening in others. The outcome may not always be optimal. 
 Inconsistencies between the assessment of the fiscal stance at the euro area
 and national 
level may arise for various reasons.
 Such inconsistencies can be 
caused by heterogeneous preferences at the central euro area level and the various 
national levels regarding the relative importance of the two policy objectives, i.e. 
ensuring fiscal sustainability and providing macroeconomic stabilisation. Therefore, 
the pursuit of national policies does not necessarily lead to an ﬁoptimalﬂ outcome at 

the euro area level. In addition, problems may arise if previous shortfalls vis
-à-
vis 
SGP requirements and related fiscal sustainability concerns require a pro
-cyclical 
fiscal tightening in some euro area countries, while other countries with fiscal 
room 
for manoeuvre
 are enjoying favourable macroeconomic conditions and do not 
therefore 
have an incentive to pursue expansionary policies.
 Indeed, in the context of 
the reviews of euro area countries™ draft budgetary plans, the Eurogroup has 

repeatedly stressed that, while the aggregate stance implied by the plans could be 
viewed as broadly appropriate, its composition across euro area count
ries was 
problematic because countries with remaining fiscal imbalances were falling short of 
SGP commitments, while countries with fiscal room for manoeuvre
 were not making 

full use of it.

 78 In addition
, 
a 
mechanical aggregation may not 
adequately 
capture the impact 
of 
national 
policies on the euro area economy
. This is the case if 
a 
fiscal 
impulse 
in one euro area country spills over to other countries. 
Trade links between countries 
are the main transmission channel 
for 
such 
an impact.
91 For example
, if a
 fiscal 
expansion is conducted 
in 
a 
euro area country that has sizeable trade links with 
countries outside the euro area, the increase in
 domestic 
and euro area 
demand
 will 
be lower than if the same fiscal impulse were to occur in a euro area country
 whose 
trade links were mainly within the euro area
. 
The assessment of the euro area fiscal 
stance, as a purely mechanical aggregation of national fiscal stances
, and its 
macroeconomic impact on the euro area economy, may vary for a given fiscal 
impulse, depending on the magnitude of such spillover effects.
 Importantly, the euro area aggregate fiscal stance can only be deemed 
ﬁappropriateﬂ if it safeguards the sustainability needs of 
all 
euro area 
countries.
 Since fiscal policy in EMU remains a national responsibility, sovereign 
debt sustainability must be ensured in all euro area countries, as sustainability 

problems in one country can have adverse implications for others as well as for the 
conduct of common policies at the euro area level. Sustainability indicators applied 

to the euro area aggregate debt ratio can thus be used only as a reference or for 
indicative purposes. In particular, a desired euro area fiscal stance may not 
necessarily be attainable via the aggregation of national fiscal policies if s
ome 
countries face severe debt sustainability risks. In other words, the more divergent 
debt levels across euro area countries are, the greater is the likelihood that the 
aggregation of national policies will not lead to an appropriate stance for the euro 
area as a whole.

The European Commission™s metric to assess the appropriateness of the fiscal stance
 In its 2015 report on 
public 
finances 
in EMU
, the European Commission propose
d 
a framework
 to assess the appropriateness of the euro area fiscal sta
nce.
92 Based on t
his 
approach, the fiscal stance 
Œ 
as measured by the change in the structural primary balance 
Œ 
is assessed 
against dual criteri
a: on one hand
, the need to address long
-term sustainability risks and, 
on the other hand, the objective of prov
iding 
macroeconomic stabilisation in the short
 term. 
 The sustainability component of the Commission assessment is captured by a variant of the 
ﬁS1 indicator
ﬂ.
 Specifically, the S1 indicator quantifies the cumulative adjustment of the structural 
primary balance over the next five years that would be needed to reduce government debt to 60% 
of GDP in 2030,
 also taking into account 
implicit
 liabilities relat
ed to ageing. A quarter of this 
cumulative adjustment is then treated as the frontloaded adjustment effort required in a given year 
to satisfy the sustainability criterion. By spreading the adjustment effort, the S1 indicator is not in 
fact a pure sustainability indicator, but implicitly accounts for the stabilisation objective. From a pure 
                                                                    91  
The size of fiscal spillovers
 depends on 
various 
factors, 
e.g. 
trade elasticities and 
possible confidence 
effects in financial markets that 
affect
 sovereign risk premia
. For more details, see the box entitled

 79 sustainability perspective, it would be preferable to frontload the entire effort to the first year, since 
this minimises the total adjustment effort.
93 The macroeconomic stabilisation criterion of the 
Commission 
assessment is captured by 
the change in the structural primary balance 
that 
would be consistent with a closure of the 
output gap by 25% 
or 
50%, respectively, in a given year.
94 The sustainability and stabilisation 
component of the assessment are not linked via relative weights, but are assessed separately.
 The 
approach is thus intended to 
provide 
a 
positive 
rather than a normative analysis of budgetary 
developments
 by spanning ranges between the sustainability and stabilisation requirements
.95  Similar to the Commission analysis, Chart A 
presents an illustrative range for the appropriate 
fiscal stance using alternative specifications of 
the sustainability and stabilisation objectives.
 At present, the sustainability objective 
clearly calls for a tightening of the euro area 
fiscal stance.
 In its analysis, the Commission 
assumes that 25% of the total adjustment 
indicate
d by the S1 indicator would need to be 
carried out in 2016 to fulfil the sustainability 
criterion. Based on the Commission™s 2016 

winter forecast, such an adjustment for the euro 
area would amount to around 0.4% of GDP 
(see 
light blue circle
 in Chart A)
.96 This adjustment 
lies below the benchmark adjustment of 0.5% of 

GDP implied by the SGP (see green circle in 
Chart A) and also falls short of the adjustment of 

around 0.8% of GDP that would be needed to 
close the gap vis
-à-
vis the forward
-looking debt 
bench
mark of the SGP (see orange circle in 
Chart A). At the same time, a 0.8% of GDP 
structural adjustment would reduce the 
structural deficit of the euro area to around 0.5% 
                                                                    93  S

ﬁFiscal multipliers and the timing of consolidationﬂ, op. cit., and Warmedinger, T. et
 al., 
op. cit.
 94  
The change in structural primary balance that would be mechanically consistent with the considered 
changes in the output gap is calculated assuming a fiscal multiplier of 0.8.
 95  
For further details on the approach to assessing the 
appropriateness of the fiscal stance, see Annex 1 
(ﬁAssumptions underlying the assessment of fiscal stanceﬂ) in ﬁReport on Public Finances in EMU

2015ﬂ, op. cit.

Note that the computations for the S1 indicator are based on deterministic debt projectio
ns for the 
period to 2030. These projections are based on the Commission™s 2016 winter forecast. Beyond the 

forecast horizon, the projections assume a closing of the output gap by 2020 and a parallel increase in 

GDP deflator growth to 2%. Assumptions for potential growth are taken from the T+10 scenario of the 

Economic Policy Committee
's Output Gaps Working Group and extended by the assumptions from the 
Commission™s 2015 Ageing Report. Ageing costs are also taken from the Commission™s 2015 Ageing 

Report.

 80 of GDP, in line with the maximum level of the medium
-term objective implied by the Fis
cal 
Compact.
97 This would also roughly correspond to a 50% 
ﬁfrontloadingﬂ of the total adjustment effort 
implied by the S1 indicator (see middle blue circle in Chart A). A full closure of the ﬁsustainability 
gapﬂ implied by the S1 indicator would require a tightening of the euro area structural primary 

balance by around 1.7% of GDP in 2016.
 All in all, this sensitivity analysis suggests that the 
sustainability objective clearly calls for a tightening of the euro area fiscal stance, with the 
Commission™s pref
erred gauge providing a lower bound for the required adjustment. 
 The stabilisation objective, on the other hand, does not give a clear recommendation of the 
appropriate euro area fiscal stance at the current juncture. 
The European Commission
™s 2016 winter
 forecast expects the euro area output gap to decline by around 40% from a gap of 
-1.8% of 
GDP in 2015 to 
-1.1% of GDP in 2016. Therefore, the lower bound of the stabilisation component, 
which requires a reduction of the output gap by 25% in 2016, is consistent with a tightening of the 
fiscal stance by around 0.3% of GDP (see light yellow circle in Chart A). On the other hand, a 
targeted reduction of the output gap by 50% 
Œ 
the upper bound in the Commission analysis 
Œ 
would 
call for a loosening of the euro area fiscal stance by around 0.3% of GDP in 2016. 
 Overall, the analysis suggests that the projected loosening of the euro area fiscal stance by 
0.3% of GDP in 2016 is heavily tilted towards the stabilisation objective, while deviating 
significantly from both the sustainability objective and the benchmark requirement under 
the SGP.
  The assessment of the stabilisation 
objective based on output gap developments 
may suffer from a real
-time bias
. As explained 
above, a comparison of output gap estimates for 
the euro area with the respective estimates 
contained in real
-time forecast vintages 
sugg
ests a tendency to mismeasure output 
gaps in real time. This real
-time bias may result 
in very different assessments of the 
appropriateness of the fiscal stance against the 
stabilisation criterion based on ex post and real
-time data. Chart B provides an il
lustrative 
example for the year 2007. The European 

Commission™s spring 2007 forecast estimated a 
negative output gap of 0.4% of GDP for the euro 

area in 2007. Compared to 2006, this implied a 
closure of the gap by around 50%, implying that 
a broadly neutral fiscal stance would have been 

assessed as appropriate vis
-à-
vis the upper 
bound of the stabilisation component (see dark 

yellow circle in Chart B). A closure of the output 

gap by 25% would have been consistent with
 a                                                                     97

 81 slight tightening of the fiscal stance by around 0.3% of GDP. At the same time, the sustainability 
criterion would not have been a constraint since the debt ratio in the euro area stood at around 65% 
of GDP. Therefore, judged against the European Commission™s metric and based on real
-tim
e data, 
the slight tightening of the fiscal stance by 0.2% of GDP (see grey bar in Chart B) would have been 
assessed as broadly appropriate. However, the estimate contained in the European Commission™s 
2016 winter forecast suggests that the euro area output gap in 2007 was not somewhat negative 
but strongly positive (+2.6% of GDP).
98 Based on ex post data, a closing of the output gap from 
positive territory by 25% and 50%, respectively, would have been consistent with a strong 
tightening of the structural primary balance (see blue circles in Chart B). In hindsight, a stronger 
fiscal tightening in economic good times before the crisis would have seemed more appropriate. 

This exemplifies the great uncertainty involved in a reliance on output gaps in the real
-ti
me 
assessment of the fiscal stance. 
  4 Limits of the current fiscal framework on the setting of the 
euro area fiscal stance
 The EU™s current institutional framework entails no provisions or instruments 
to directly manage the aggregate euro area fiscal stance, which is a key 
difference between the euro area and federations such as the United States.
 In 
fact, fiscal policies are conducted in 19 euro area countries on the basis of national 
budgets and within different national fiscal frameworks. While the EU budget has 
common resources used, in particular, to promote economic and social cohesion 

among Member States, it is rather small in size (around 1% of the EU™s aggregate 
GDP), not specific to the euro area and not focused on macroeconomic stabilisation.
 At the euro area level, the institutional framework has been complemented by the 
European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a crisis management tool providing financial 
assistance to euro area countries experiencing or threatened by financing difficulties
. 
Overa
ll, however, the lack of common fiscal instruments at the centre stands in stark 
contrast to other federations such as the United States, where important policy 

instruments such as the setting of tax policies and important spending functions, e.g. 
defence 
and social and health insurance, operate at the federal level. 
 Notably, the SGP affects the aggregate fiscal stance indirectly rather than 
steering it directly. 
The euro area countries
™ 
decentralised fiscal policies are 
coordinated by the SGP, which 
takes
 the economic cycle
 into account
. 
As indicated 
in Box 4, the SGP contains a multitude of provisions for countries under both its 

preventive and corrective arms that modulate the required structural effort according 
to economic conditions and, to a lesser extent, the government debt ratio. 
Consequently, the SGP affects the aggregate euro area fiscal stance indirectly. 
 In addition, the SGP
 does not entail obligations for countries that have fiscal 
room for manoeuvre 
to contribute to a desirable aggregate fiscal stance
. As 
                                                                    98  
The same holds true for 2006, where the output gap was estimated at 
-0.8% of GDP in real time, while 
the latest Commission forecast suggests that it stood at +1.4% of GDP. 
 ECB Economic Bulletin, 
Issue
 4 / 2016
 82 indicated in Chart 1 above, the euro area aggregate fiscal stance is expected to be 
mildly expansionary in 2016. At the same time, while a number of euro area 
countries were assessed as being at risk of non
-compliance with the SGP and 
theref
ore required additional fiscal tightening measures,
99 others
 still have fiscal 
room for manoeuvre under the SGP rules. This notwithstanding, the SGP does not 

contain any provisions that incentivise these countries to use their existing fiscal 
room for manoe
uvre
 to provide support to the euro area economy. The logic of the 
SGP is that it sets minimum requirements rather than targets for national fiscal 
policies, leaving it up to individual Member States to set themselves targets going 
beyond minimum requireme
nts.
 Recent legislative 
developments tend towards 
stronger coordination of the 
euro area fiscal stance
. In particular, 
Regulation 
(EU) No
 473/2013
, which entered 
into force on 30 May 2013, includes common provisions for monitoring and 
assessing draft budgetary plans. Moreover, it requests the Council to issue policy 

recommendations for the euro area as a whole, including advice regarding the euro 
area aggregate fiscal stance. For example, to
 strengthen the scope of this advice, 
within the 2016 European Semester, i.e. the annual cycle of policy coordination and 

surveillance, the release of these recommendations for the euro area 
was 
frontloaded to November 2015.
100 Member States should take thes
e recommendations into account when defining their policy strategy. Thus, instead of 

actively steering the aggregate euro area fiscal stance, this frontloading enables the 
Commission and the Council to assess the draft budgetary plans of the individual 
euro area countries for the forthcoming year in 
the 
light of the recommended 
aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole.

 Provisions for accommodating the state of the economy 
in the SGP
 The provisions of the SGP 
take into 
account 
the state of 
the economy
. The 2005 reform of the 
SGP introduced
 the concept of the structural balance, which caters for cyclical impacts on the 

government budget balance. To this end, it enshrined the

which set

 At the same time, MTOs 
are aimed 
at ensuring sufficient fiscal 
room for 
manoeuvre
 to deal with cyclical downturns and preserve public investment.
101  The SGP foresees a significant role for the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers
. Such 
fiscal stabilisers are built into existing tax
-transfer systems and operate automatically over the cycle 
and thus around the countries™ paths of structural adjustment. At the same time, countries that have 
reached their MTOs can let their automatic stabilisers operate freely, thereby helping to smooth the 

business cycle.
 In addition, under it
s preventive arm, the SGP foresees a modulation of fiscal adjustment 
requirements according to the cyclical position and other factors. 
On 12 February 2016, the 
ECOFIN Council endorsed a commonly agreed position on how to take the economic cycle, 
structura
l reforms and investment into account within the existing rules of the SGP. Within a matrix, 
different states of the economy are defined and related to structural adjustment needs. Specifically, 

it distinguishes ﬁe
conomic good timesﬂ and 
divides 
economic developments that are worse than in 
ﬁnormal timesﬂ into ﬁbadﬂ, ﬁvery badﬂ and ﬁexceptionally badﬂ economic times. 
The matrix
 modulates 
the 
structural adjustment
 requirements needed in order to move towards the MTO according to 
the 
size of the output gap
, economic growth
 and the debt ratio. These adjustment requirements can be 
reduced if a country implements structural reforms or undertakes public investment, with the 
possible cumulative reduction being capped at 0.75% of GDP. Consequently, in an un
favourable 

economic environment, even countries with high debt
-to
-GDP ratios could be allowed to let their 
structural balance deteriorate without falling foul of the EU™s fiscal rules. 
 Under the SGP
™s corrective arm, excessive deficit procedure (EDP)
 dead
line
s can be set 
over horizons of several years and
 can be
 further
 extended. 
This allows a spreading of the 
required amount of structural adjustment over the medium term, thereby taking stabilisation 
considerations 
into account
. Furthermore, 
various relevant factors, such as low inflation
, 
are taken 
into account in the assessment of compliance with the requirements under the 
debt rule.
102  The SGP also contains a general escape clause, introduced with the ﬁsix
-packﬂ reforms
103 in 
2011, which can bring about bro
ad-based reductions in structural effort requirements
. This 
clause can be triggered for all or for individual euro area countries whenever an unusual event
 outside the control of Member States occurs that
 has a major impact on the financial position of the
 general government or in periods of severe economic downturn for the euro area or the Union as a 

whole.
104 In 
the event of such developments
, it is possible
 to depart from the adjustment 
requirements under the preventive arm. Similarly, the fiscal effort requirements under EDPs can be 
                                                                    101  
MTOs are set by Member States according to country
-specific circumstances. They must respect 
minimum values and
 are designed to serve three goals: (i) Member States maintain a safety margin 
that prevents them from breaching the 3% deficit reference value during cyclical downturns; 
(ii) Member States™ debts are sustainable taking into consideration the economic and budgetary impact 
of ageing populations
 (i.e. by in part frontloading projected ageing
-related increases in government 
spending, while ensuring long
-run convergence of the debt ratio to 60%)
; and (iii) Member States have 
room for budgetary manoeuvre, in particular when it comes to preserving public investment.

105   5 Institutional considerations surrounding the future setting 
of the euro area fiscal stance
 5.1
 The European Fiscal Board
 The newly created 
European 
Fiscal Board
 will advise the European 
Commission on the appropriateness of the fiscal stance at both national and 
euro area level w
ithin the 
rules o
f the SGP
. As a follow
-up to the Five Presidents™ 
Report, Commission Decision (EU) 2015/1937
106 established a European Fiscal 
Board which 
Œ 
once fully operational 
Œ 
will provide an evaluation of the 
implementation of the provisions of the SGP and of the implications of budgetary 

policies at national level for the aggregate euro area fiscal stance
. 
 The European Fiscal Board will not 
be equipped with policy tools to actively 

influence the 
setting of 
fiscal policies.
 It will rather contribute in an advis
ory 
capacity to multilateral surveillance in the euro area
. However, the Commission 
Decision does not specify how the Board will perform its advisory function. In 
particular, it remains unclear how it would be involved in the procedures of the 

European Semester, the EU™s annual cycle of economic and fiscal policy 

coordination.
 Given the envisaged institutional set
-up, it is unclear how effectively t
he 
European Fiscal Board 
will be able to carry out its role. 
The fact that, according 
to the Commission Decision, the European Fiscal Board will operate within the 
European Commission™s institutional structure and not have a strong public voice is 
likely to undermine its credibility as an independent policy advisory institution.
107  From an operational point of view
, the 
European 
Fiscal Board
 will need to 
develop a sound methodological framework on which to base its assessment 
of the fiscal stance
. The Commission Decision also remains vague on how the 
Board shall perform its tasks in practice. While the assessment of
 Member States™ 
compliance with the provisions of the EU fiscal framework can build on 
well
-                                                                    105  
According to the European Commission, this exceptional provision is expected to be used only in the 
most unusual of circumstances
. See ﬁ

 85 established methodological foundations,
 this is not the case for the assessment of 
the appropriateness of the fiscal stance,
 in particular at the euro area level
. Given 
the European Fiscal Board™s mandate to provide its assessments within the rules of 
the SGP,
 it will be important to ensure that SGP
 compliance in all Member States 
and debt sustainability risks form key elements of the
 assessment of the fiscal 

stanc
e. 
 5.2
 Options for a better setting of fiscal policies at the euro area level
 In the context of a far
-reaching overhaul of the institutional architecture of 
EMU, the Five Presidents™ Report proposes two fiscal instruments at the euro 

area level 
Œ 
a macroeconomic stabilisation function and a euro area treasury. 
The experience of the crisis has shown that, without monetary policy instruments at 
the national level, fiscal policies can become overwhelmed if country
-specific shocks 
are very large and not well catered for by the shock
-absorbing capacity of the 
economy and the financial sector.
 At the same time, as discussed in Section 4, the 
pursuit of national policies does not necessarily result in an appropriate stance at the 
euro area level. 
Central fiscal policy
 tools may therefore be useful to address 
idiosyncratic shocks
 more effectively and/or better steer the aggregate fiscal stance 

where appropriate. 
 A 
macroeconomic stabilisation function at the euro area level
 could 
complement automatic stabilisers at national level under certain conditions
. 
While the 
ultimate 
design of a euro area macroeconomic stabilisation function would 
depend on political 
preferences
, certain design principles 
should 
be adhered to in 
order to 
preserve 
incentives for sound fiscal policymaking and 
for 
addressing 
structural weaknesses at the national level. As emphasised in the Five Presidents™ 

Report, a euro area macroeconomic stabilisation function should neither be aimed at 
income equalisation nor lead to permanent transfers between Member States
. It 
should take the form of automatic stabilisation and not aim at fiscal fine
-tuning of the 
economic cycle. The stabilisation function would therefore not be a tool to actively 

steer the euro area fiscal stance, but rather reduce the need for euro area countries 
to address large country
-specific shocks by using discretionary policies. 
 Mutual insurance against asymmetric shocks through a stabilisation function 
will require convergence in other policy areas. 
In this context, the Five 
Presidents™ 
Report emphasises that a
ny move 
towards risk sharing needs to
 be preceded by
 a new convergence process towards more resilient economic structures
 in euro area countries
. In the longer term, a euro area treasury could be created and equipped with 
fiscal instruments to contribute to the setting of the aggregate euro area fiscal 

stance. 
The creation of such a central treasury would be the only way to effectively 

steer the euro area aggregate stance. However, to be effective, the budgetary 

capacity of this treasury needs to be sufficiently large to be able to react to economic 

shocks in the euro area. It is clear that the creation of such a central treasury 
function would require far
-reaching institutional reform 
Œ 
in particular, a shift of

 86 sovereignty to the euro area level via an amendment to the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union. A future euro area treasury would need to be 
democratically legitimised 
and accountable in order to carry out fiscal policy 
functions at the central level. 
 6 Conclusions
 Recent institutional reforms have gone in the direction of strengthening the 
aggregate euro area perspective when assessing fiscal policies in the euro 
area. 
Following the 
ﬁtwo
-packﬂ reforms in 2013,
108 the Council 
Œ 
based on the 
Commission™s assessment of e
uro area countries™ draft budgetary plans 
Œ 
now issue
s 
policy recommendations for the euro area as a whole, including advice 
regarding the appropriateness of the euro area aggregate fiscal stance.
 Member 
States should take into account this advice when defining their policy strategy in the 
context of the annual stability programme updates. At the same time, once 
operational, the newly established European Fiscal Board will advise the 
Commission on the appropriateness of the fiscal stance at both the national and euro 

area level within the rules of the SGP. The SGP, however, does not contain any 

requirement to contribute to the euro area
-wide fiscal stance.
 The assessment of the appropriateness of the euro area fiscal stance is not 

straightforward. 
Such an as
sessment 
needs to balance various objectives, notably 
with regard to sustainability and stabilisation, and to account for severe 
measurement problems, notably with respect to the output gap. 
While
 the European 
Commission
™s approach to assess
ing
 the fiscal 
stance at the national and euro area 
level provides a useful basis for discussion, further work needs to be done 
to 
develop a sound methodological framework 
that 
is sufficiently robust to draw policy 
conclusions. Compliance with the provisions of the SGP a
nd the timely correction of 

debt sustainability risks need to 
be key elements of 
the 
assessment of the fiscal 
stance.
 The Stability and Growth Pact provides flexibility for Member States
™ 
budgetary policies to react to cyclical fluctuations while ensuring adequate 

progress towards sound and sustainable fiscal positions.
 The full and 
consistent implementation of the SGP is crucial to ensure that markets trust the 

capability of the EU
 govern
ance framework to effectively coordinate fiscal policies in 
EMU
. At the same time, compliance with the SGP rules will enable Member States to 
rebuild fiscal buffers and increase their capacity to cushion future economic shocks 
effectively. 
 The decentralised fiscal framework, however, does not necessarily result in an 
appropriate stance at the euro area level
. Two additional features for the future 
institutional architecture of EMU therefore appear desirable. First, the creation of a 

euro area 
macroeconomic
 stabilisation function to
 cushion large 
country
-specific 
                                                                    108

 87 shocks
, which can 
overwhelm national stabilisation capacities as experienced in the 
recent crisis. The aim of such a central macroeconomic stabilisation function would 
not be to actively steer the euro area fiscal stance but to provide an additional layer 
of automatic stabilisation
, which would 
mitigate 
the need for discretionary policies at 
national level. 
A 
central 
stabilisation function
 would need to be well
 designed to 
preserve incentives for sound fiscal policymaking and 
for 
addressing structural 
weaknesses at the national level. At the same time, access to a prospective 

macroeconomic stabilisation function would need to be made conditional on 
significant progress on economic convergence in the euro area to achieve similarly 
resilient economic structures, ensuring that the stabilisation function does not imply 

permanent transfers between Member States. I
ncreased risk
 sharing in the 
euro 
area 
would also have to be accompanied by 
more
 joint economic policy decision
-making. Second, 
in the longer term, a euro area treasury could be equipped with 

fiscal policy tools to contribute directly to the setting of the euro area fiscal stance
. 
This would require a shift of sovereignty to the euro area level via a Treaty 
amendment. Strong d
emocratic 
legitimacy 
and accountab
ility are crucial 
prerequisites for a euro area treasury that would
 carry out fiscal policy functions.
